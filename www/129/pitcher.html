<h1>A Prisoner of Windows</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/pitcher.html">Lew Pitcher</A></b></p>

<em>Imprisoned in a Windows jail? Make your escape to Linux through an SSH tunnel and remote X Windows.</em>
</center>

<hr/>

<p>
Those of us who use Linux desktops sometimes forget that most of our peers
do not have our luxuries. At times, we find ourselves forced to devolve,
and use a Windows desktop to do our work. When we do, we pine for the vast
variety of tools we had under Linux and curse the clumsiness of the
software prison that we are locked into.
</p>

<p>
But there is hope for Prisoners of Windows. If our Microsoft Windows
environment is network-enabled, and if we can connect to a suitably
configured network-enabled Linux box, we can still work on our platform of
choice. So, how do we free ourselves? By giving ourselves secure remote
access to Linux, both at the command line and at the GUI level with a
combination of standard Linux tools and a couple of Open Source
applications for Windows.
</p>

<p>
My goal is to show you how to let a Windows desktop user log into and run
both command-line and GUI applications on a remote Linux system, with
Windows handling the presentation (and <em>only</em> the presentation). I
will show you how to set up OpenSSH on a Linux system in order to provide
secure access and facilitate GUI interaction, and how to configure and use
an Open Source SSH client (<strong>PuTTY</strong>) and an Open Source X
server (<strong>Xming</strong>) on Windows. With these tools, Windows
captives can securely and easily escape to a Linux system and work on it
remotely as if it were the only system they were on.
</p>

<h3>The escape plan: Setting up the OpenSSH Server</h3>
<p>
Before you can escape, you have to prepare a "safe haven" on a Linux system.
You will need to set up an OpenSSH server on a Linux system and make it
reachable from the outside world.
</p>
 
<p>
As most Linux distributions come with (or make available) a native version
of OpenSSH, I will not cover the distribution-specific details of
installation from native packages, or the tedious technical details of
installation from source. Instead, I will assume that you already have
located and installed the appropriate package, and are ready to configure
it.
</p>

<h4>Configuring the OpenSSH Server</h4>
<p>
You can find the default configuration file for the OpenSSH server in
/etc/ssh/sshd_config.  This text file contains three types of text: blank
lines, comments (which start with a #) and lines of keyword/argument pairs
which control the behaviour of the SSH server. You only need concern
yourself with the keyword/argument lines, since 'sshd' ignores comments and
blank lines.
</p>

<p>
Even though the default values for the 'sshd' parameters (the values
assumed when no options are specified) are usually adequate for general
SSH use, I'd like you to explicitly set the values of four of the
parameters to ensure proper access.
</p>

<p>
Specifically, set:
<ul>
<li><tt><strong>AllowTcpForwarding</strong></tt> to <tt><strong>yes</strong></tt></li>
<li><tt><strong>X11Forwarding</strong></tt> to <tt><strong>yes</strong></tt></li>
<li><tt><strong>X11DisplayOffset</strong></tt> to <tt><strong>10</strong></tt></li>
<li><tt><strong>X11UseLocalHost</strong></tt> to <tt><strong>yes</strong></tt></li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt><strong>AllowTcpForwarding</strong><dd> controls whether or not
the SSH daemon will permit generic TCP forwarding. This feature permits SSH
clients to direct selected network traffic through the SSH tunnel so that
it moves securely from client to server (or vice versa). While this
parameter defaults to &quot;<tt><em>yes</em></tt>&quot;, you may find that
the default <tt>sshd_config</tt> explicitly sets it to
&quot;<tt><em>no</em></tt>&quot;, and since we wish to ensure that TCP
forwarding is permitted, you need to change it.<br/>

<dt><strong>X11Forwarding</strong><dd> controls whether or not the SSH
daemon will explicitly handle SSH forwarding of X11 data streams. This
parameter defaults to &quot;<tt><em>no</em></tt>&quot; and you should
explicitly set it to &quot;<tt><em>yes</em></tt>&quot; in
<tt>sshd_config</tt> in order to permit your Windows detainee to easily
interact with Linux GUI applications. Note that, with
<tt><em>AllowTcpForwarding</em></tt> enabled,
<tt><em>X11Forwarding</em></tt> is a convenience, and is not absolutely
necessary for X11 tunnelling.<br/>

<dt><strong>X11DisplayOffset</strong><dd> specifies the starting
DISPLAY number for SSH-transported X11 datastreams. This parameter should
be set to a value higher than the highest 'real' (locally attached) X11
display on the Linux system in order to avoid interfering with the local
GUI users. The default value for this parameter is <tt><em>10</em></tt>,
but you may wish to assign a larger value if your Linux system supports a
large number of X users.<br/>

<dt><strong>X11UseLocalHost</strong><dd> controls whether SSH should
&quot;bind&quot; X11 forwarding to the local loopback address or to the
less secure wildcard address. If bound to the local loopback address, some
older X11 clients may not function properly. The default for this parameter
is &quot;<tt><em>yes</em></tt>&quot; (which is the value I'd like you to
explicitly set it to), but your initial configuration file may have
a different value.
</dl>

<p>
Of the above four parameters, two are typically unnecessary (since their
default values are sane anyway), and one of the other two may be redundant.
Specifically, <tt><strong>X11DisplayOffset</strong></tt> and
<tt><strong>X11UseLocalhost</strong></tt> default to sane values, and you
don't need to alter them in <tt>sshd_config</tt>. Also,
<tt><strong>AllowTcpForwarding</strong></tt> and
<tt><strong>X11Forwarding</strong></tt> offer clients similar abilities; if
<tt><strong>AllowTcpForwarding</strong></tt> is already specified, then it
is simple (but not obvious) for a client to perform X11 forwarding without
the <tt><strong>X11Forwarding</strong></tt> option. If
<tt><strong>X11Forwarding</strong></tt> alone has been set, our incoming
clients can forward X11 sessions, but not other types of data streams. For
your prisoner of Windows, you want to allow access to all network data
streams (hence the explicit <tt><strong>AllowTcpForwarding</strong></tt>
setting), and painlessly permit him to forward X11 specifically (hence the
explicit <tt><strong>X11Forwarding</strong></tt> setting).
</p>

<p>
Once you've made the appropriate changes to your
<tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_conf</tt> file (see <a
href="misc/pitcher/figures.html#figure_1"><em>Figure 1</em></a>), save your
editing efforts and continue to the next step: generating your SSH server
keys.


<h4>Generate your Server Keys</h4>

<p>
Before you can use the SSH server, you must generate encryption keys for
it. Some Linux distributions arrange for the first execution of the SSH
server to build these keys, but some do not. In the next step, you will
explicitly build three sets of keys (one set for each method of
conversation that SSH understands), and place these key sets in the
standard files.
</p>

<p>
As <tt><strong>root</strong></tt>, first execute the <tt>ssh-keygen</tt> command
to build your <tt>rsa1</tt> key into the <tt>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_key</tt>
file:
</p>
<dl>
<dd><tt>/usr/bin/ssh-keygen -t <strong>rsa1</strong> -f <strong>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_key</strong> -N ''</tt></dd>
</dl>

<p>
Next, again execute the <tt>ssh-keygen</tt> command, but this time to build your <tt>dsa</tt> key into
file <tt>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key</tt>:
</p>
<dl>
<dd><tt>/usr/bin/ssh-keygen -t <strong>dsa</strong> -f <strong>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key</strong> -N ''</tt></dd>
</dl>

<p>
Finally, execute the <tt>ssh-keygen</tt> command for a third time, this time to build your <tt>rsa</tt>
key into file <tt>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key</tt>:
</p>
<dl>
<dd><tt>/usr/bin/ssh-keygen -t <strong>rsa</strong> -f <strong>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key</strong> -N ''</tt></dd>
</dl>

<p>
With these commands, you have given your SSH daemon both ears and a voice
through which your Windows captive can communicate with the Linux
environment.
</p>


<h4>Start the OpenSSH server</h4>
<p>
Finally, it is time to start your OpenSSH server, which will use the
configuration and key files you've prepared to conduct conversations with
the outside world. If your system starts the SSH server automatically, you
can just &quot;signal&quot; it to have it reread its configuration. To do
this, as <tt><strong>root</strong></tt>, you
</p>
<dl>
<dd><tt>/bin/kill SIGHUP `cat /var/run/sshd.pid`</tt></dd>
</dl>
to send the SIGHUP signal to the currently running ssh daemon. On the other
hand, if your system hasn't started the SSH daemon, you (again as
<tt><strong>root</strong></tt>) can run the sshd server with a simple
command:
<dl>
<dd><tt>/usr/bin/sshd</tt></dd>
</dl>

<p class="editorial">[ In most distributions, launching standard system
daemons such as SSH is best done via the scripts in '/etc/init.d'. The
above two tasks, for example, would be handled by '/etc/init.d/ssh restart'
and '/etc/init.d/ssh start' executed as root. -- Ben ]</p> 

<p>
Now you have completed the extra Linux configuration, created a secure door
to your Linux &quot;safe haven&quot; (did you remember to adjust your
firewall to permit SSH connections?), and have taken the first step to
freeing that Prisoner of Windows from his oppressive confines. Of course,
he will still require an account on the Linux system, which you will need
to create with the standard tools and methods of your distribution.
Initially, he will log into the Linux system using his assigned username
and password; after that, he will have the option of logging in through the
secure facilities of SSH.
</p>

<h3>A foot out the door - Linux Commandline with PuTTY</h3>
<p>
Fully locked-down Windows systems, where you can't even run unapproved
programs from floppy disk or USB &quot;thumb drive&quot; memory stick, are
the worst prisons of all. You can't do anything about these dungeons
without the co-operation of the Windows system administrator. Let's hope
that your Windows captive is not locked in one of these &quot;solitary
confinement&quot; cells, and instead has a little latitude in his actions.
</p>

<p>
The first step to freedom, from the Windows side, is to install the
&quot;<strong>PuTTY</strong>&quot; SSH client application.
&quot;PuTTY&quot; is a Windows GUI application written and maintained by
Simon Tatham, and released (both in executable form, and in source code)
under a BSD-like Open Source license. When installed, it takes about 2800K
of disk space, and creates a couple of (not absolutely required) Windows
Registry entries. The 6 programs in the PuTTY suite provide the client
tools necessary for our captive to escape to our Linux "safe haven".
</p>

<dl>
<dd><table border="1" summary="PuTTY programs">
<tr><td><tt>PUTTY.EXE</tt></td>
	<td>This is the SSH client program used for &quot;command-line&quot;
	access to outside systems, and is a secure replacement for the
	<strong>telnet</strong> client command.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><tt>PUTTYGEN.EXE</tt></td>
	<td>This program builds client &quot;public key&quot; keys, for use in
	identifying the client to the ssh server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><tt>PAGEANT.EXE</tt></td>
	<td>This tool is a &quot;key agent&quot; that allows the Windows user
	to &quot;make available&quot; selected keys on an ongoing basis to
	PuTTY applications. This is a convenience (to reduce the number of
	times a user must enter key information), and not a requirement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><tt>PSCP.EXE</tt></td>
	<td>An SSH replacement for the <strong>rcp</strong> client command, and
	allows secure copying.</td> </tr>
<tr>
    <td><tt>PSFTP.EXE</tt></td>
    <td>An SSH replacement for the <strong>ftp</strong> client command.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><tt>PLINK.EXE</tt></td>
	<td>This tool is an SSH client program (like <tt>PUTTY.EXE</tt>)
	suitable for use in automated processes (like <tt>.BAT</tt> and
	<tt>.CMD</tt> files). Other GUI programs (like <strong>Xming</strong>)
	also use <tt>PLINK.EXE</tt> to establish their own SSH connections to
	the target systems.</td>
</tr>
</table></dd>
</dl>

<p>
Your first task will be to configure PuTTY to connect to the Linux system. This will be a simple connection
that depends on Linux userid and password confirmation; it will not (yet) use the power of SSH public key
authorization to give you immediate access to the Linux system. We'll save that little flourish for later.
</p>

<p>
So, from the <tt><strong>Windows Start -> All Programs -> Putty</strong></tt> menu, you now run
<strong>PuTTY</strong>. The <tt>PUTTY.EXE</tt> program will start, and present you with a PuTTY
Configuration window. Because this is your first time running PuTTY, and you have not yet set any configuration
information, the window will be mostly empty. On the left hand side of the window, you will see a tree of PuTTY
options, and on the right, the settings for the &quot;Session&quot; option. It is here that you provide the basic
information necessary to get out of Windows and into your Linux commandline.
</p>

<p>
In the <tt><strong>Host Name</strong></tt> field, you enter the <em>DNS
name or IP address</em> of your Linux system. If you intend to return to
this system (and you likely do), you can save the session information by
entering a meaningful name in the <tt><strong>Saved Sessions</strong></tt>
entry box and selecting the <tt><strong>Save</strong></tt> button (see <a
href="misc/pitcher/figures.html#figures_2a-2c"><em>Figures 2a-2c</em></a>).
From this point on, you can launch PuTTY, select and
<tt><strong>Load</strong></tt> the Linux system session information from
the list of <tt><strong>Saved Sessions</strong></tt>, and then select the
<tt><strong>Open</strong></tt> button to immediately connect to the Linux
system.
</p>

<p>
Because PuTTY has never conversed with your Linux system before, it will
show you the SSH key that the &quot;Safe Haven&quot; OpenSSH server
provided (see <a href="misc/pitcher/figures.html#figure_3a"><em>Figure
3a</em></a>), and ask you if you trust it. Answer
<tt><strong>&quot;Yes&quot;</strong></tt> to complete the SSH handshake
with the Linux system; if you answer
<tt><strong>&quot;No&quot;</strong></tt> instead, then PuTTY will continue
with the handshake, but will not remember that you trust the Linux system,
and if you answer <tt><strong>&quot;Cancel&quot;</strong></tt>, Putty will
abandon the connection altogether. Once you've completed the handshake, it
is now just a simple matter of completing the text-based login with your
Linux userid and password (<a
href="misc/pitcher/figures.html#figures_3b-3d"><em>Figures 3b-3d</em></a>),
and you are done; the world of your Linux system awaits you, from a
character-based interface (like in <a
href="misc/pitcher/figures.html#figure_3e"><em>Figure 3e</em></a>).
</p>

<h3>Free as a Bird - Linux GUI with Xming</h3>
<p>
But a character-based interface is just &quot;a shadow on the wall&quot; to
our GUI-acquainted eyes. While it <em>is</em> possible to use Linux this
way, you likely prefer a less limited interaction, and that means X. Your
Windows captive will better enjoy his freedom if you install the
&quot;Xming&quot; X server, and that is your next step.
</p>

<p>
Xming is a port of the <a href="X.org">X.org</a> X11 server to the Windows
environment, currently maintained by Colin Harrison who took over from
Alexander Gottwald. The latest release of Xming (at the writing of this
article) is based on the new X.org X11R6.9 X server, and (like PuTTY) is
released under an Open Source licence.
</p>

<p>
Unlike PuTTY, however, the Xming install comes in multiple parts. There are
two different X servers (one that uses OpenGL for rendering, and one that
uses the much slower Mesa renderer) and one font package. You will need to
install one of the two X servers, and some of the fonts from the font
package. The installations are very straightforward, consisting of a
familiar graphical installation wizard that takes care of all the mechanics
of the install. Configuration (at this point) is not an issue; the basic
Xming services that the install builds will suit our needs perfectly. With
the OpenGL server and all the fonts (both obligatory and optional)
installed, Xming takes about 45Mb of disk space (and a few optional
registry entries) to install.
</p>

<p>
Once you have the X server and fonts installed, you will start a &quot;rootless&quot; Xming server by traversing
the <tt><strong>Windows Start -> All Programs -> Xming</strong></tt> menu, and selecting the 
<tt><strong>Xming</strong></tt> option. This will start the X server, and leave you with an Xming icon
(see <a href="misc/pitcher/figures.html#figure_4"><em>Figure 4</em></a>) in your toolbar. Xming does not come with the 
<tt>xauth</tt> or <tt>xhost</tt> commands (although they are available through an add-on package), and the X server
does not, by default, permit unauthenticated remote applications to connect to and use the display. You could add in
some of the add-on toolset in order to get the X authority tools, but instead, I'll show you how to use the X11
forwarding capabilities of your OpenSSH server and PuTTY client to cause your remote X11 applications to appear as
local applications to Xming. So, back to PuTTY we go.
</p>

<p>
When you launch <tt>PUTTY.EXE</tt>, you are always first presented with a
configuration window. When you first connected to your Linux &quot;safe
haven&quot;, you (hopefully) saved the PuTTY configuration for that
connection.  You now want to <tt><strong><em>Load</em></strong></tt> that
<tt><strong><em>Saved Session</em></strong></tt>, and alter it a bit. If
you scroll down the &quot;Category&quot; list on the left hand side of the
configuration window, you will come to a leaf titled
&quot;<tt><strong><em>X11</em></strong></tt>&quot;. Select this leaf and
alter its settings (see <a
href="misc/pitcher/figures.html#figure_5a"><em>Figure 5a</em></a>) to
<tt><strong><em>Enable X11 Forwarding</em></strong></tt>.  Then, scroll
back to the <tt><strong><em>Sessions</em></strong></tt> leaf, and
<tt><strong><em>Save</em></strong></tt> the altered definition before you
<tt><strong><em>Open</em></strong></tt> the session to your Linux system.
</p>

<p>
When you do open the session, you will find that, on the Linux side of the
connection, the <tt>$DISPLAY</tt> environment variable is now set (see <a
href="misc/pitcher/figures.html#figure_5b"><em>Figure 5b</em></a>) to a
display on the Linux system. This display doesn't actually physically
exist; it is one of the X11 tunnels that you permitted with your OpenSSH
<tt>X11Forwarding</tt> and <tt>X11DisplayOffset</tt> settings. Your Linux X
client applications will interact with OpenSSH instead of a real X server,
and OpenSSH (on Linux) will relay the X protocol messages to PuTTY (on
Windows), which will then pass them on to your Xming X server running on
Windows. The X server will respond in reverse, passing data to your PuTTY
client, which passes it back to OpenSSH to be finally handed over to the X
client application. It is a round-about route to be certain, but it does
provide several advantages:
</p>

<ol>
<li>it provides a layer of security around your GUI traffic,</li>
<li>it gives your X client applications an assured route to your X server,
guaranteeing that they will not be stopped by firewall rules or routing
problems that may inadvertently block the X protocol traffic, and</li>
<li>it eliminates the need to use the X authorization tools (like
<tt>xauth</tt> or <tt>xhost</tt>) because, to your X server, all the X
protocol traffic is local traffic.</li>
</ol>

<p>
As <a href="misc/pitcher/figures.html#figure_5c"><em>Figure 5c</em></a>
shows, from this PuTTY and Xming setup, you can run even the most
sophisticated X application. Truly, almost any X application that is
available to you in Linux can be run this way. Only those applications that
require services not implemented in the Xming server (such as OpenGL when
you use the Mesa version of Xming) cannot be run this way.
</p>

<h3>A Person In Danger</h3>

<p>
With this, I've met my goal and given you the tools to free your Prisoner
of Windows. Now, all the facilities of Linux are open to him, command-line
and GUI tools alike. He no longer needs to curse the confines of his local
working environment, and can luxuriate in the freedom of the remote Linux
system.
</p>
 
<p>
The I Ching says <em>&quot;A person in danger should not try to escape at
one stroke. He should first calmly hold his own, then be satisfied with
small gains, which will come by creative adaptations.&quot;</em> We've
given our Prisoner of Windows a small gain achieved by a creative
adaptation. The next steps you take will lead to his complete escape.
