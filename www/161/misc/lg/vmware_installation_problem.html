Hello Deividson                                                            
</p>

<p>
Can you help me to fix the problem below?. I actually interrupted vmware   
installation before trying to install it only to be requesting for the

Hi there. As you may have guessed from the 'lists' part of the address,
Deividson isn't the only person reading this email; in fact, there's a
whole gang of us (The Answer Gang, that is.)

What this says is that the VMware installer is looking for its
installation data on some sort of an externally-mounted drive -
one that's mounted under '/media/DATA_DRIVE'. I don't know why it
expects this - perhaps your first attempt at installing VMware was from
an external drive, and it left some configuration data as a result? -
but your best option is to purge the current installation and to start
completely from scratch.
</p>

<p>
As another possibility - one that may create problems, but may be
necessary if you want to do this as a reinstall - you could either
re-use the original data device (which will, presumably, mount in the
same place with the same name), or - and this is somewhat contrived, but
should work - you could make a symlink in the /media directory called
DATA_DRIVE that points to /home/adey/Documents/vmware-server-distrib (or
wherever your install data actually lives.) Re-run the installer, and
make sure to delete the link afterwards.
</p>

<p>
Again, though, the first option - purging the old install and doing it
fresh - is strongly preferred. That is, after all, the whole point of
the package system - one of the major factors in the stability of Linux.

As Ben pointed, it looks like youre installing from a different
location than last time, and thats confusing the installer, so it's
not locating the uninstaller correctly. You can try to install from
the old location, what will make the installer locate the un-installer
correctly, or you can run the un-installer directly
(vmware-uninstall.pl at your new installer folder)- whatever is easyer
for you.
