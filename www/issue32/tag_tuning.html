>Tuning X to work with your Monitor</H3>
<p><strong>From Alan Morton on the L.U.S.T Mailing List 
	on 14 Aug 1998 </strong></p>
<!-- begin body -->

<p><strong>I am wondering if anyone on the list has any experience with a vid
card/monitor combination similar to mine, or have any experience
with this particular problem that can either give me some
constructive advice or can point me to some relevent documentation.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>I am using a Jaton 67-P video card with 4 megs of RAM. I am trying
to use it with a HP 4033A monitor. The problem is that whem I use
Xconfigurator (I'm using a RH5.0 distro) irregardless of what it
says about an acceptable configuration, when I start up X it trips
the Power Saving function on the monitor and it goes blank.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>When I use the cntrl-alt-backspace it naturally kills X, plus it
retrips the monitor and my screen begins to reappear. I am making
the assumption that it is engaging some error procedure in the
monitor, which is fine. But I really want to get this working at a
reasonable resolution. If I use a setting of 800x600 and 8 bit
color it works just fine, but that seems a bit wasted on a 21"
monitor.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>I know the monitor will handle a lot because I can use it at
1024x748 in 16 bit color with my Windows NT boot-up. And I have a
friend with an identical monitor running 1280x1024 in 24 bit color
under Win95.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>I don't think the problem is the card because I have been running
it with a 14" Magitronic monitor previously at 800x600 in 24 bit
under both NT and Linux with no problems.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Any assistance with this will be greatly appreciated.

>The problem you are having is related to the refresh rate that X is
trying to use for the mode you are trying to display.  The rate may
be either too high or too low.  I am not sure exactly about the
specifics of what needs to be done to change the refresh rate that X
uses, but I'm sure there is a good source of information for
configuring the display properties of X.  Hopefully this will narrow
your scope in searching for an answer, because I don't really know
what else would cause this problem.  Any other suggestion welcome.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Configuring X on a system is like a classic "three-body problem."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>You have to get the correct software and libraries all
installed (which any distribution makes pretty easy).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>You have to select the correct "server" for your video card.
This is complicated by the number of video card manufacturers
--- many of whom have many models of video card, often 
identified by a stream of very similar sound digits and 
letters while using completely different combinations
of chipsets, clock chips, and RAMDAC's (digital to analog 
coverters?).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>You have to provide a "tuned" set of video timings.  This
is primarily dependent on your monitor.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Getting all of these things to work together is still a 
pain.  However, the xf86config, SuperProbe, and Xconfigurator
have helped alot.  I've heard that Eric S. Raymond's 
Video-Timings-HOWTO has helped alot of people (though I've never
used it myself).  I've played with '<tt>vidtune</tt>' (an X program that
allows you to tune your video times after you've gotten
"close enough") --- but it's still a bit mysterious to me.
(How to I get it to write the timings out to a format I can
use in my XF86Config?)
</blockquote>
<blockquote>I usually just use a "hit and miss" approach by looking
through the list of samples in <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc/Monitors</tt>
(or thereabouts).  The one on my 
<A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">S.u.S.E.</A> box lists about 
65 different samples for various monitors.  I just play with 
them a bit while I hand hack on the <tt>/etc/X11/XF86Config</tt> file
(which is probably the least efficient way of doing it ---
but usually <tt>Xconfigurator</tt> and a good multisync monitor
get along O.K. so I usually don't have to fuss too much).
