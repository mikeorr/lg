<h1>Taking the Pain Out of Authentication</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/vandoorn.html">Yvo Van Doorn</a></b></p>

<p>
When dealing with authentication, there are a myriad of systems out there
that validate user identity and permissions: shadow passwords, Kerberos,
NIS and LDAP, just to name a few.
</p>

<p>
In early Unix and (very early) Linux deployments, the applications would be
responsible for directly interacting with whatever security system that was
in place for a given server. When it was just the app scanning the
/etc/passwd file, that wasn't so hard to manage, but once all those other
authentication systems were deployed, then leaving authentication in the
application space quickly became unmanageable.
</p>

<p>
In 1995, Sun Microsystems came up with a better way: a library that would
handle all of the communication between applications and whatever
authentication system that might be in place. This would take the onus of
authentication off application developers' plates, and prove to be much
easier to expand. If a new authentication system is put into place, a
shared library object can be added to the library, without any changes to
the app. This library is known as the pluggable authentication module
(PAM), and it's a big part of authentication systems used today.
</p>

<p>
The biggest advantage to PAM is scalability: the capability to add a new
authentication system to any given server without needing to re-configure
(or worse, re-compile) a program is a big deal. That's not to say there
isn't some sort of payment to be made -- nothing is free. Instead of
touching the application, all PAM-aware applications have a text
configuration file that must be edited to compensate for any new module
within the PAM library.
</p>

<p>
At first, that may seem like more trouble than it's worth, since managing
multiple configuration files could quickly get painful. In truth,
individual PAM configuration files enable each application to use any
authentication protocol they need, even if they're on the same system. So,
one application can use LDAP, while another can rely on shadow passwords,
if that's what you need. Better still, with one notable exception,
switching to a new protocol is as simple as plugging in the protocol's
module to PAM then editing the application(s) configuration files to make
note of the change. The application only cares what PAM is telling it, not
what the actual authentication solution says.
</p>

<p>
Another important feature of PAM, which makes it of interest to
authentication providers like Likewise, is that it can be used for more
than just password management. PAMs can be configured to outline session
setup, logging, permissions management, as well as work directly with
Active Directory for authentication.
</p>

<p>
Modules can be combined as well, thus giving apps a layered approach to
authentication, if needed. Individual PAM configuration files are comprised
of a list, known as a "stack," of all the PAM modules that will govern
access for the application in question. Modules are invoked in their stack
order and any module failure will usually block access for the app. More
lenient policies can be put in place that might circumvent this
all-or-nothing approach.
</p>

<p>
One example of such a policy might be to allow a user to physically access
a system at any time of the day, but not grant access remotely during
certain times. (Care must be taken, though, to allow for international
travelers who may indeed need to login remotely in the middle of the
server's night.) Another such module could authenticate a user only if
their Bluetooth-enabled device was broadcasting nearby.
</p>

<p>
Of course, like any system, PAM isn't without its vulnerabilities. A
security hole this past summer would allow a malicious user to own the
permissions of a vulnerable system's shadow password file. With access to
the shadow file, the cracker could easily reset the password for every
account on the machine, including root. At that point, the cracker can do
just about anything to the box, including resetting the shadow file back to
its former state, so that system administrators would be less likely to
notice something was amiss. This vulnerability was very quickly patched,
but it outlines the need to keep a constant eye on any authentication- or
security-based frameworks.
</p>

<p>
The extreme scalability and flexibility of the PAM framework means it can
fit within almost any security policy an organization might come up with.
If a module or combination of modules doesn't meet specific security needs,
then a new module can be written as a solution. Linux users, for instance,
can visit Andrew Morgan's <a
href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/Linux-PAM-html/Linux-PAM_MWG.html">The
Linux-PAM Module Writers' Guide</a> to learn more about creating such
solutions.
</p>

<p>
PAM is a major tool in the security world, and one well worth
understanding, since it can do far more than just handle passwords.
