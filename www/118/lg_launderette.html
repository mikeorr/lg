One of the methods used by normal humans to send other (normal humans) on the "guilt trip" is to use the cliche "every time you do THIS or THAT god kills a kitten. Please, think of the kittens..." For an even bigger guilt-trip, you can use "every time you do THIS , somewhere a kitten gets run over by a Monster truck. given not ten minutes ago to the five year old girl standing by the side of the road, spattered, red, and crying as she fumbles with her inhaler" (Thanks to Brian Bilbrey, member of The Answer Gang for the picturesque description )
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Frankly, the whole killing of the kitten part leaves me rather unmoved. Having lots of free time on my hand lately, I thought of things that would send me on a guilt trip.

RMS writes in the Guardian about software patents
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
"If we, the free-software proponents, had lost [the July 6 vote in the
European Parliament], it would have been a final defeat in Europe. The
relevant part of the European commission works hand in glove with the
Business Software Alliance (BSA), and a BSA lawyer actually wrote much of
the text of the draft directive the commission proposed. (We know this
because they were so foolish as to publish it as a Word file, which
contained information about who wrote what.)"
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
"Our years-long fight has shown how undemocratic the EU is."
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
"Bullying a whole national government appears to be easy, but there is
usually no need to go that far: it suffices to convince one minister, or
the minister's representative, to vote as desired. The Hungarian
representative voted for software patents even as his prime minister said
Hungary was against them. The German representative voted in favour even
after the German parliament voted unanimously against. The Dutch
government pushed software patents through the council of ministers after
its parliament ordered it to reject them."

"Decided that the CollabNot infrastructure must have been stolen
whole-sale from some bad D&amp;D
game: if ye wish to attain commit-level
access for project foo, ye must first - request the 'Acolyte' role in
the foo project. If approved, ye need to accumulate power-points - the
path lies through stealing the magic sword of Blag and killing the
evil goblin of Nurg. When ye hast won through: heft your stone of
Bling, and publicly crunch the bones of Nodab (for luck) - while
requesting stewardship of the Can-Commet relic. Be warned - only the
few get this far, and the process must be repeated for each 'project'.
Many fall at the next mighty hurdle to await you: the mind-deadening,
spine chilling Specification task, with it's many difficult stages:
iTeamus-formationus-from-nothingus, QAEducationus,
endless-pointless-discussionus, and acutely-delayed-resultus. The real
shame is Sun didn't choose Collab to help strangle their OpenSolaris

"The third big lesson we can learn from open source and blogging is
that ideas can bubble up from the bottom, instead of flowing down from
the top. Open source and blogging both work bottom-up: people make
what they want, and the the best stuff prevails.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Does this sound familiar? It's the principle of a market economy.
Ironically, though open source and blogs are done for free, those
worlds resemble market economies, while most companies, for all their
talk about the value of free markets, are run internally like
commmunist states."

I was pleased to see your reasonably candid responses to the moderated
questions that were posed on the Slashdot "interview".

I'd like to ask a more pointed question [set] related to Question 2:
Open Standards
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
"How does Microsoft internally deal with Open Standards and Open
Document Formats?"
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
It strikes me that you could have interpreted the question to mean "It
appears that Microsoft practices customer lock-in through proprietary
data formats. What progress do you see Microsoft making on reversing
these practices? Is Microsoft going to provide reasonable data-
interchange tools? If so, then why would Microsoft be patenting features
of their future document formats?
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>

<p><strong>From Brian Bilbrey 
</strong></p> 
<p></strong></p>
<blockQuote>
I have been back and forth via email with Bill Hilf of Microsoft's Linux
Lab, following his interview on <A HREF="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</A> [1]. In question two, he was
asked about Open Standards, and weaselled a bit, to my way of thinking.
So I wrote and asked:
</blockQuote>

<TABLE WIDTH="95%" BORDER="1" BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC"><TR><TD>
<p align="center">...............</p>
<HR width="10%" align="left"><P><BLOCKQuote>
I was pleased to see your reasonably candid responses to the
moderated questions that were posed on the Slashdot "interview".
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
I'd like to ask a more pointed question [set] related to Question 2:
Open Standards
</P>
<P>
"How does Microsoft internally deal with Open Standards and Open
Document Formats?"
</P>
<P>
It strikes me that you could have interpreted the question to mean
"It appears that Microsoft practices customer lock-in through
proprietary data formats. What progress do you see Microsoft making
on reversing these practices? Is Microsoft going to provide
reasonable data-interchange tools? If so, then why would Microsoft be
patenting features of their future document formats?"
</P>
<blockQuote>
That would really be a stellar set of questions to hear the answer
to. It's the number one reason why I can't recommend MS products to
clients - data formats win out over user interface every time I lay
the issues out.

</blockQuote><p align="center">...............</p>

<blockQuote>
He sent me a link to Microsoft Office Open XML Formats Overview [2], and
stated "I think this is a great step forward in the right direction.  -Bill"
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Hmm, thinks I, after following the link and reading for a fair piece.
Then I write to him again:
</blockQuote>

<TABLE WIDTH="95%" BORDER="1" BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC"><TR><TD>

<HR width="10%" align="left"><P><BLOCKQuote>
So, by "royalty-free" does Microsoft mean that use of the format will
be licensed to all comers?
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<blockQuote>
Well, open patented format is less good than open public domain
format. I can hear the argument for "keeping control" of the format,
but as MS is the 800 pound gorilla on this issue, I'd imagine that
actual baseline control of the format would remain with the vendor
who has such a large percentage of the desktops, world-wide. Hmmm.

</blockQuote><p align="center">...............</p>

<blockQuote>
Bill, game as ever, comes back with this stellar response: "[Bill Hilf]
Yes, 'royalty free' means you can use it without paying us a royalty fee."
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Well, color me surprised, I'd have never come to that on my own. &lt;/sarcasm&gt;

<blockQuote>
Bill, ever resourceful, pops yet another link into the mix, and doesn't
answer my question: "It depends on the license terms of the program -
each program and license is available at MS' Shared Source Initiative.[3]
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Office isn't among the "programs" listed in the Shared Source Initiative
pages, so I am lead to believe that Microsoft does not in fact intend
its Open XML Formats to be open in any real sense of the term. I'll
desist in my game of Whack-A-Hilf, as it appears that as usual, the game
is rigged.

Then Hare came out with a startling proposal. He said that the recent
corporate scandals could have been prevented if CEOs were screened for
psychopathic behavior. "Why wouldn't we want to screen them?" he asked.
"We screen police officers, teachers. Why not people who are going to
handle billions of dollars?"
</P>
<blockQuote>
It's Hare's latest contribution to the public awareness of "corporate
psychopathy." He appeared in the 2003 documentary The Corporation,
giving authority to the film's premise that corporations are
"sociopathic" (a synonym for "psychopathic") because they ruthlessly
seek their own selfish interests -- "shareholder value" -- without
regard for the harms they cause to others, such as environmental damage.

Well that's just plain wrong. At the time the Catholic church considered it heresy to translate the Bible.

"By the time the bible was published in 1611, King James was pretty well losing it.

	>[conspire] OT (somewhat) Linux perspective on "Zotob's"</H3>


<p><strong>From Rick Moen 
</strong></p> 
<p></strong></p>
<P><STRONG>
I'm going to go to Hell for this, I know, but I'm succumbing to the
temptation to post about the latest Windows virus, here -- sort of.  But
this won't be your standard "update your $WHATEVER" MS malware advisory,
I hope:  I have in mind some points within spitting distance of
topicality for a Linux user group.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Here's a summary of the current one-day wonder.  Feel free to compare &amp;
contrast it against mass-news coverage:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
Yesterday's worm, called Zotob, is an automated remote exploit against
insufficiently paranoid input routines in a Win2k (&amp; some WinXP) "Plug and
Play" network daemon (in msdss.dll[1]) reachable over TCP port 445 (the
"Microsoft Naked CIFS" port).  This weakness in the daemon's input
validation routines was discovered and disclosed four days before, in
MS Security Bulletin MS05-039, which was accompanied by a binary patch
to close the hole.
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The exploit feeds the msdss.dll network interface aberrant data to cause
a -- yes, you guessed it -- stack-based buffer overflow (failing to check
the length of the network message[2] before passing it on to some
buffer), found recently by Neel Mehta of ISS[3], which somehow permits the
remote attacker to locally escalate privilege on the vulnerable machine
and then carry out assorted mischief and attacks on additional hosts.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The news stories and "virus advisories" tell people gruesome tales about
the aforementioned mischief, argue over which Win$FOO releases are and
are not vulnerable, and warn to install $WHATEVER without delay,
but what's <em>  invariably missing  </em> are obvious concerns like these:
</STRONG></P>

<p><Strong><ol>
<LI>Why the frell are all Win2k-and-later Microsoft machines offering open network access from anywhere at all to a Plug and Play "service" (daemon) -- even on Aunt Marge's desktop box?  Who exactly thought that adding network-aware capabilities to Plug and Play was a good idea?  (Note that this isn't the same as Microsoft's equally worrisome but distinct "Universal PnP" architecture.)



<LI>Why aren't machine admins/owners made <EM>aware</EM> that they're running such network daemons and exposing them to the entire world as attack targets?  What does each of them do?  How would one turn each of them off, or limit one of them to be reachable from (say) localhost only, i.e., running them bound only to the loopback  network interface, or alternatively from just one's local IP subnet? What would be the <EM>consequences</EM> of disabling each of them? (I might point out that there's a frightening forest of network daemons enabled by default on such boxes, not just this one Plug and Play daemon on 445/tcp -- and Windows users are told nearly nothing about what, why, and how.)



<LI>Given the eyebrow-raising assumption that such a daemon has to be left running by default and accessible outside localhost, why can't Microsoft manage to make it validate its input correctly? I mean, this isn't brain surgery, guys.



<LI>And given that such a thing must be running, etc., why is the library allowed such apparently trivial access to escalate privilege?  Why should it be able to escalate privilege *at all*? Haven't the Microsoft guys ever heard of role separation and dropping privilege in a process?

</ol></Strong></p>
<P><STRONG>
Linux relevance:  Please note the difference in coverage and emphasis,
compared to *ix vulnerabilities
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
99% of the news coverage -- even in the allegedly technical press -- of
this "virus" (worm) included basically <EM>none</EM> of the relevant technical
details about the attack mechanism, and what is being attacked, and what
that is, and why that software is running in the first place... let
alone what would happen if you were to turn that software off, how you
would do so, etc.  And my <EM>finding</EM> that information was like pulling
teeth.  (I eventually found most of it at SANS.)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
If this were a remotely exploitable buffer overflow and privilege
escalation in the *ix world -- say, in NFS's rpc.statd -- there would be
copious information easily findable about all of the above matters.
In fact, there <EM>is</EM> such information routinely available, when such
things emerge.

[1] The filename suggests that the library probably is primarily
concerned with the Microsoft Directory Synchronization Services, which
are an external interface for Active Directory.  But it's really rather
disturbing and shocking that searching Google on this filename turns up
zero hits.  (It's mentioned only in a few very new articles that Google
hasn't yet found.)  The file's reportedly (per one recent article) not
provided by the OS itself, but rather silently installed and activated
when you install this-or-that additional software.

[2] There's something about SMB/NetBIOS "NULL session" information being
used in this exploit.  If curious, see this coverage:

	>http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/alerts/id/202</A>   Interesting quotation:
"The Plug and Play service is a Windows DCE-RPC service that is designed
to handle device installation, configuration, and notification of new
devices. It starts automatically on modern versions of the Windows
operating system, and runs in default configurations. On Windows 2000,
this service is reachable via named pipes and a NULL session. It is
not possible to disable this service without adversely affecting system
operation.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
This Plug and Play service contains a remotely exploitable stack-based
overflow. It has been proven to be trivially exploitable...."
