<BLOCKQUOTE>
All,
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is going to be a great year for Linux.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I was at a Fry's (a chain of computer stores in California and
around the west coast of the U.S.) in Palo Alto a couple of weeks
ago.  They had Loki games for Linux at the endcap of one aisle,
boxes of Corel's new Linux distribution at the end of another, and
copies of _Linux_Unleased_ at the end of another.  As Heather and I
wandered past the a components wall we heard a customer insisting
that he needed a "100% Linux compatible" motherboard.  While I was
browsing the magazines, Heather brought over a store employee who
she heard telling one of his co-workers that he needed to go study
Linux 'cause he was hearing so much about it.  When we were in the
check out stand the guy next to us was buying a copy of 
<A HREF="http://www.turbolinux.com/">TurboLinux</A>
4.0 and a small stack of books to go with it.  (No, I didn't see
copies of my book there yet.  Darn!).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><em>[ I brought that employee over to give him my business card, after
answering a handful of his questions.  Business is booming for Linux
<a href="http://www.starshine.org/">consulting</a>, too. -- Heather ]
</em></p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
That was just a short trip to the store to get some party supplies
(hosting some cypherpunks from the RSA conference).  We wanted to
special lighting.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
While we were there we also picked up a couple of little UPS
power strips (CyberPower Systems <A HREF="http://www.cyberpowersystems.com"
	>http://www.cyberpowersystems.com</A>)
for a couple of the workstations around the house.  These were only
about $70 each and there were the only ones in their price range
that have serial connectors for UPS power management.  This wasn't
important for Heather and I, but we figured it would be a nice
feature to play with.  I figured that there wasn't much chance for
there to be a Linux driver in the package (there wasn't) but there
might be some freeware already done (there is).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The cool thing is that I found the link to the University of
Iowa powstatd (power status daemon) 
(<A HREF="http://dollar.biz.uiowa.edu/powstatd"
	>http://dollar.biz.uiowa.edu/powstatd</A>).
(The irritating thing is that that was a "JavaScript" driven link
on CyperPower's web site, but they may yet get another helping of
clue).  So <tt>powstatd</tt> is available as RPM and 
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> packages.  In fact it's
available as two different Debian packages depending on whether you
need the encryption support that makes it less dangerous to remotely
control the power/shutdown on other systems over your network using
this tool.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The gist of this is that the Linux software for this peripheral is
readily available, linked to the manufacturer's web site and that it
probably offers more utility and better security than the included
proprietary software.  (Also the fact that Alberto Maria Segre's
<tt>powstatd</tt> package is open source means that our *BSD cousins can
use it and that future operating systems will find it that much easier
to support).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><em>[ Chances are pretty good that FreeBSD's support for Linux binaries
	would run it directly.  It's probably more important that our 
	cousins on non-Intel hardware, whether running Linux, *BSD or
	something else, will be able to recompile it. -- Heather ]</em></p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(I went back to a different Fry's last night and
picked up a copy of "Heroes of Might &amp; Magic III"
for Linux, which  was ported by Loki Software
<A HREF="http://www.lokigames.com"
	>http://www.lokigames.com</A>.  They had Linux copies
of Civilization, Quake III, and Railroad Tycoon.
They also had plush stuffed "Tux" penguins all over the store).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To many new Linux users this may not seem remarkable.  However,
to those of use who started using Linux back in about '92 it's
pretty incredible.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Last month I was looking through Microtimes and Computer
Currents (a couple of freebie local computer "newspapers"
which are almost all advertising for regional computer stores;
they each have SF Bay Area and Los Angeles editions).  I noticed
that many (about 25%) of the ads for computers systems now mention
Linux (and <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A> in some cases).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course, some people would hasten that the Silicon Valley isn't
middle america, and Fry's isn't the venue for "Joe Sixpack."
However, it's hard to deny that this is happening in other
places, too.  (Linux is particularly popular in other countries,
particularly Europe and Asia).  I seem to recall that IDC or
Gartner recently had to revise their estimates of how fast
Linux was growing --- especially on the desktop/client side.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've experienced another indication of Linux growth over the
last few months.  When I first started doing the "Answer Guy"
column I received an average of 30 questions a month.  Now I
get about 50 per week!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(Sorry I can't answer them all.  I don't even have
a "fair" or sensible way to pick which questions I
answer.  Basically I answer them when I see them
or set them aside and hope for a night when I'm
watching TV and have idle fingers).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some people might complain that "answer guy" mail volume is
not a representative sampling of overall Linux usage.  It could
be that I'm getting more popular among the existing Linux userbase.
Who knows.  I'm just a sysadmin, support guy and sometimes writer.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
But this sure looks like a good year to be a Linux geek from
where I'm sitting.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course anyone who wants to look into it for themselves
can point their web browser at <A HREF="http://www.google.com"
	>http://www.google.com</A> and
search on the string: "Linux market research" and read what
lots of other people are saying on the subject).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Makes me glad that I'm such a "curses curmudgeon."  The truth
is that the main reason I chose Linux is because Microsoft was
pushing MS Windows so hard.  I don't like GUIs and for a long
time I couldn't afford a monitor that was big enough to
display a reasonable working area (for an environment that insists
on cluttering half of the available space with menus, titles,
scroll bars, status lines, icon ribbons, ruler bars and other
crap that I don't need to see) and that had enough of a refresh
rate to let me work for hours without that exhausting flicker.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, I decided to Learn UNIX so I could still do most of what I
wanted in "text mode" (through a terminal if necessary).  I grabbed
a (used) copy of Coherent and played with that enough to do the
basics.  From there I started reading the alt.os.linux news group
(just after its split from alt.os.minix, which I also used to
read).  Eventually I got access to enough bandwidth to download
my first distribution (SLS).  Later I bought my first Linux on a
CD (Yggdrasil).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<em><P>
[ Although we know what happened to it (others became more popular by
updating faster) I swear I still don't know what happened to its author,
Peter MacDonald.  Even the Linux
<A HREF="http://www.kernelnotes.org/pub/linuxhq/raw/kernel.org/2.2.x/CREDITS"
	>CREDITS</A> file has no address for him.

<A HREF="http://www2.linuxjournal.com/lj-issues/issue2/2755.html"
	>article on the early distributions</a> in Linux Journal, Issue 2.
-- Heather ]
</P></em>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
But enough about the past.  Now about the future.  I don't know
any more about the future than anyone else.  However it does
appear that I'll be in New York at the LinuxExpo that'll be going
on there from February 1st through the 4th.  My co-authors should
also both be there, so come on my the <A HREF="http://www.linuxcare.com/">Linuxcare</A> booth or hunt me
down in the hallway track or at the BoFs (birds of a feather
meetings).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<em><p>[ Hey, let's keep that straight.  It's 
<a href="http://www.linuxworldexpo.com/">LinuxWorld</a> conference and
expo in New York ... they couldn't take the URL "linuxworld" because
<a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/">Linux World magazine</a> already
had it.  They did manage to snag "linuxexpo.com", but "linux-expo.com"
leads to
<a href="http://www.linux-expo.com/international/linux-expo/linux-expo.html"
	>Linux Expo 2000</a> is in Paris, France, on the 1st through
	3rd of February.
</p><p>It's hard to tell, but I think it's the same parent group running
	it, so maybe that makes it less wacky that they're on the same
	dates (essentially competing with each other).  Apparently even
	the conference folks agree, there's enough Linuxers to go around.
</P><p>I ask, would it have been too hard to offer "paris.linuxworldexpo.com"
	and "newyork.linuxworldexpo.com"?  I'm getting really tired of seeing
	entire domains squished into the tiny existence of "www" being their
	only visible host.
</p><p>And before anybody asks, no. We're NOT going to both shows.

Hope to see you all there.
