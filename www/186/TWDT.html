&gt; Hello Ben Okopnik,
&gt; 
&gt; Yesterday I bumped into a su (substitute user) permission error similar
&gt; to your Apr. 2000 article, "Cannot execute /bin/bash: Permission denied".
&gt; I was attempting to run an expect script in non-root user mode on Fedora 8:
&gt; 
&gt;   su netter -c "expect try.exp"
&gt; 
&gt; and it failed:
&gt; 
&gt;   couldn't read file "try.exp": permission denied
&gt; 
&gt; No problem if I run:
&gt;   su root -c "expect try.exp"
&gt;   expect try.exp
&gt; 
&gt; I pored over permission related avenues for the whole day and failed.
&gt; It was around midnight when I googled upon your article that my hope was
&gt; rekindled.
&gt; 
&gt; So the first thing coming into work today...
&gt; Using your approach (especially strace), I found the execution bit for others
&gt; for /root
&gt; was not set.  After setting it, my non-root mode command string started to
&gt; work!
</pre>

<p>
That's actually not a good solution; the correct permissions for 
/root are 0700. Setting it to 0701, as you have, allows other users to
enter that directory - a really bad idea!
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
ben@Jotunheim:~$ ls -ld /root
drwx------ 11 root root 4096 2011-03-10 21:14 /root
ben@Jotunheim:~$ head -n 1 /root/.bashrc
head: cannot open `/root/.bashrc' for reading: Permission denied
</pre>

<p>
OK, this is what's supposed to happen. But here's what happens when I
change the permissions as you specified:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
ben@Jotunheim:~$ sudo chmod 0701 /root
[sudo] password for ben: 
ben@Jotunheim:~$ head -n 1 /root/.bashrc
# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
</pre>

<p>
Whoops...
</p>

<p>
I suspect that the right solution for you would be to put 'try.exp'
somewhere other than /root; then you won't have to do anything with
those permissions (other than hopefully set them back as quickly as
possible.)

than asking me for a private consult (those tend to be expensive <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">, so

&gt; Dear Ben Okopnik,
&gt;  
&gt; I've read your article "Installing Perl Modules as a Non-Root User", and
&gt; regarding including the "myperl" in @INC" it worked. But now I have a problem,
&gt; that maybe you can help.
&gt; I▓m trying to install a local module in a webserver that isn▓t mine. I get no
&gt; error with the following Makefile.PL
</pre>

<p>
Do you mean when you run 'make', 'make test', 'make install', or all of
them?
</p>


<pre>
&gt; CODE:
&gt;  #!/usr/local/bin/perl
&gt; use 5.008007;
&gt; use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
&gt; # See lib/ExtUtils/MakeMaker.pm for details of how to influence
&gt; # the contents of the Makefile that is written.
&gt; WriteMakefile(
&gt;     NAME              =&gt; 'Kepler',
&gt;     VERSION_FROM      =&gt; 'lib/Kepler.pm', # finds $VERSION
&gt;     PREREQ_PM         =&gt; {}, # e.g., Module::Name =&gt; 1.1
&gt;     ($] &gt;= 5.005 ?     ## Add these new keywords supported since 5.005
&gt;       (ABSTRACT_FROM  =&gt; 'lib/Kepler.pm', # retrieve abstract from module
&gt;        AUTHOR         =&gt; 'Rui Fernandes &lt;rui.kepler@gmail.com&gt;') : ()),
&gt;     LIBS              =&gt; ['-L/home/username/usr/local/lib -lswe'], # e.g.,
&gt; '-lm'
&gt; #    LIBS              =&gt; ['-lswe'], # e.g., '-lm'
&gt;     DEFINE            =&gt; '', # e.g., '-DHAVE_SOMETHING'
&gt;     INC               =&gt; '-I/home/username/usr/local/include', # e.g., '-I. -I/
&gt; usr/include/other'
&gt;     INSTALL_BASE      =&gt; '/home/username/myperl',
&gt; #    DISTVNAME         =&gt; 'perl_kepler', #
&gt;  # Un-comment this if you add C files to link with later:
&gt;     # OBJECT            =&gt; '$(O_FILES)', # link all the C files too
&gt; );
&gt;  
&gt; END CODE
&gt;  
&gt; But when I run the test script, the module isn't found, not even in the "myperl
&gt; /lib" directory.
</pre>

<p>
I'm having trouble parsing that last sentence. Do you mean the module is
actually not in myperl/lib, or does your test script not find it?
</p>

<p>
I suspect that it's the latter. If that's the case, then what's
happening is that your web server isn't seeing the correct path. This
often happens because the actual path to your home directory is not
necessarily the same thing as you see when you log in via, say, SSH. For
example, in one of my former webservers, the path reported by 'pwd' when
I was in my home directory was '/home/ben' - but the <strong>real</strong> path was
something like '/homepages/41/d322536930/'. As a result, using
'/home/ben/myperl' as part of my 'use lib' statement was worthless: the
web server didn't know anything about a path like that.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the easiest way to find out what the server is seeing as your
real path is to look at the server environment. Here's an easy way to do
that with Perl:

<p>
I've always wondered why "ls" doesn't just have this as an option. Got
tired of wondering, so I went ahead and wrote it.
</p>

<p>
This script is intended to be a drop-in replacement for "ls" - in other
words, just put it somewhere accessible and alias it to 'ls'. It takes
all the same options that 'ls' does (no wonder; it simply passes the
entire argument string to 'ls'), and works in the same way, unless the
first option that you specify - and it must be specified by itself - is
"-O" (capital "o", not a zero.) In that case, it does all the same stuff
but reformats the output a little - just the filetype/permissions
section. I haven't done a huge amount of testing on it, so it might be
fragile in some unexpected places (reports would be appreciated).  Seems
OK, though, so I'm releasing it to the unsuspecting world. Enjoy.

&gt; My 2-cents:  USB is being polled.

<p>
You're probably right - and very likely, it's getting polled very
rapidly, given the task. I'm not sure what could be done about that -
some kernel setting, perhaps?

<pre>
&gt; strace -p ....  might give you some clues too.

<p>
The question is, what would I attach it to? 'rsync' wouldn't make a
whole lot of sense, since it's not involved in USB polling.

Hi,
     I had a horror story similar to Ben's one, about two years ago. I 
backed up a PC and reinstalled the OS with the backup usb disk still 
attached. The OS I was reinstalling was a version of Windows (2000 or 
XP, I don't remember right now). When the partition creation screen 
appeared, the list items looked a bit different from what I was 
expecting, but as soon as I realized why, my fingers had already pressed 
the keys, deleting the existing partitions and creating a new ntfs one. 
Luckily, I stopped just before the "quick format" command...
Searching the 'net for data recovery software, I came across TestDisk, 
which is target at partition table recovery. I was lucky enough to have 
wiped out only that portion of the usb disk, so in less than an hour I 
was able to regain access to the all of my data.
Since then I always "safely remove" usb disks from the machine before 
doing anything potentially dangerous, and check "fdisk -l" at least 
three times before deciding that the arguments to "dd" are written 
correctly...

Hi Francis,
</p>


<p>
--&gt;I see one possible typo in a not-yet-much-used one:
--&gt;
--&gt;"""
--&gt;I have just changed this alias to
--&gt;
--&gt;   alias w '(pwd; /bin/pwd ) | uniq; df -h | tail -1'
--&gt;
--&gt;I often also want to know whether I'm on a local disk or not.
--&gt;"""
--&gt;
--&gt;That probably wants to be "df -h ." (at least on recent-ish Debian and
--&gt;RedHat systems).
</p>

<p>
Absolutely correct. Thanks for that.
</p>


<p>
--&gt;And if you are likely to be on a system where the "Filesystem"
--&gt;name is quite long (such as "/dev/mapper/VolGroup00-LogVol00"), then
--&gt;using "tail -n +2" might be handy too -- but I can't comment on the
--&gt;portability/compatibility of that option across systems.
</p>

<p>
Perfect!
</p>

<p>
Another example of "write in haste, repent at leisure." I should stick
to presenting the tried and true - and forget about improvising.
</p>

<p>
Thank you for your fixes. I will adjust my files immediately.
</p>


<p>
Cheers,
Henry

<h3>LG - what's next?</h3>

<p>
Hello, all -
</p>

<p>
After a number of years of running LG, I've reached a stopping point: I
can't continue producing it, for a variety of interconnected reasons. In
short, the group of people currently involved in making LG happen has
become so small that almost the entire thing has fallen on me - and the
technical side of producing it is so complicated that my current level
of business and other life involvement does not leave me with enough
spare time to do it. As a result, there was no LG issue for this month -
and despite giving it my best shot over the past two weeks, I have still
not managed to release one.
</p>

<p>
That seems to me to be an extraordinarily clear signal that the time has
come for me to step down. Whether that means that someone else gets to
take over, or whether LG simply ends at this point, I don't know. I've
tried to prevent the latter... but it appears that I have reached the
end of what I can do in that regard. Whether it continues or not has to
become someone else's concern. I am no longer able to carry the load.
</p>

<p>
I'm sure that someone with better management skills than mine could
organize and structure a working team that would distribute the load;
someone with more time could replace the totally outdated and rather
arcane production system, which currently takes many hours of work to
release an issue (by contrast, a CMS such as WordPress could easily be
configured to replicate the LG site structure, and production - as well
as adding proofreaders and editors - would become a trivial matter
rather than the complicated and fragile SVN-based system currently in
place.) I would be happy to advise whoever takes over, assuming that
someone does.
</p>

<p>
The current state, however, is that LG is no longer being actively
produced by me. My most sincere apologies to anyone that I have let
down.
</p>

<p>
Hi, all -
</p>

<p>
I'm hoping that someone here has experience in setting up SVN. I'm
running into several issues in setting it up for LG... frankly, it's
mostly my own mental state more than anything else; 'buffer full' at the
moment. Unsurprising, after a couple of weeks of full-time training
course development, setting up LG in its new home, and learning a new
language during all that. My brain is pretty cooked, and I desperately
need a break. I'm just hoping that someone here has a shortcut; it
shouldn't be that difficult, really.
</p>

<p>
What I'd like to do is set it up so that I don't have to create a system
account for everyone who needs SVN access. We don't even need web access
to the repo; we just need our editors and proofreaders to authenticate
via whatever mechanism SVN uses, pull a copy of the repo, and check
their work back in whenever they're done with it.
</p>

<p>
Any help - and the best of all possible world would be an offer like
"I'd be happy to do it for you!" - would be <strong>very</strong> welcome.

You probably shouldn't do that. Unless you know <em>exactly</em> why you're
doing it (hint: "I want this sub to only take a single scalar argument"
is not a good reason) and what the side effects and the pitfalls are.
For the full treatment, see "perldoc perlsub". The takehome rule of

Yep. Thomas' advice is right on the dot; in this kind of situations,
'pack' (and often 'vec') are your very good friends.

Presuming that it did have one, and had a reasonable identifier, it
looks like your card's not readable. Assuming that there's no "protect"
switch on it - you did look for one, right? - I suspect that it has
failed. That is, it can be read enough to determine its physical
characteristics - I don't know how the two processes differ, I only know
that they do - but you can't access its storage. In other words, it's
junk.

This is, or closely related to, the thing that attracted me to Linux in
the first place. In the Windows world, you're either a user - which is
defined by a very narrow, small set of pointy-clicky skills and not much
if any understanding of the mechanisms you use - or you're some sort of
a "wizard", which gets defined in all sorts of arcane ways, mostly
meaning "knows some stuff beyond what users know." All that "stuff",
however, doesn't form any kind of a coherent whole: it was all chunks
and bits and pieces, no relation of anything to anything else. The only
choices, if you wanted more than the minimum, were 1) specialize -
meaning something like learning a certain language or a given
application, or 2) gather enough critical mass of random <strong>stuff</strong> until
you formed a gravity well of your own and could pull out some sort of a
related useful fact when a problem came along.  All very haphazard, and
somewhat akin to stumbling around in a dark dungeon until you found some
treasure or (far more likely) ran into some kind of a monster.
</p>

<p>
YOU'RE TRAPPED IN A MAZE OF TWISTY PASSAGES, ALL ALIKE, AND YOU'RE
LIKELY TO BE EATEN BY A GRUE.
</p>

<p>
(It is worth noting that I functioned in that world, professionally, for
a number of years, all the way from a wet-behind-the-ears teenage
computer repairman to working as CIO for an insurance company. This
perspective is not formed by my desire to promote Linux; quite the
opposite, if anything - I advocate Linux usage <em>because</em> I have this
perspective, which was formed by long experience.)

I generally try to avoid importing modules if there's a built-in method
that works just as well. In this case, you're importing "os" anyway, but
this also works in scripts where you don't.

<p>
The main problem with this type of script is that you have to be a
Python programmer to add a filetype/program pair. I'd suggest breaking
out the dictionary as an easily-parseable text file, or adding a simple
interface ("Unsupported filetype. What program would you like to use?")
that updates the list.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; Is there any Linux command line tool which can easily do this?
</pre>

<p>
Midnight Commander is quite good at this; in fact, I've used that
functionality of 'mc' in some of my shell scripts for just this purpose.
They use a mix of regex matching, MIME-type matching, and literal
extension recognition to work with various files. E.g., the ".gz"
extension in "foo.1.gz" doesn't tell you anything about the type of file
that it is (a man page).

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">71% of iPhone and Android Apps Violate Open Source Licenses</h3>

<p>At the March AnDevCon Conference, OpenLogic, Inc., a provider of open 
source governance solutions. announced the results of a scan and 
license compliance assessment of 635 leading mobile applications. 
Among other findings, the results show that 71% of Android, iPhone and 
iPad apps containing open source failed to comply with basic open 
source license requirements.</p>
		
<p>OpenLogic found several apps with extensive EULAs that claimed all of 
the software included was under their copyright and owned by them - 
when in fact some of the code in the app was open source.</p>

<p>Using its scanner, OSS Deep Discovery, OpenLogic scanned compiled 
binaries and source code where available for 635 mobile applications 
to identify open source under GPL, LGPL and Apache licenses. For the 
66 applications scanned that contained Apache or GPL/LPGL licenses, 
71% failed to comply with four key obligations that OpenLogic 
analyzed. These included:</p>

<p>GPL/LGPL license requirements to:</p>				
<ul><li> provide source code or an offer to get the source code</li>
<li>provide a copy of the license</li></ul>
				
<p>Apache license requires to:</p>
<ul><li> provide a copy of the licenses</li>
<li> provide notices/attributions</li></ul>

<p>"Many mobile and tablet developers may not have a complete picture of 
the open source they are using and the requirements of the open source 
licenses. This has real-world implications. For example, the Free 
Software Foundation has stated that the GPL and iTunes license are not 
compatible, and Apple has already pulled several apps from the store 
that were determined to be under the GPL," said Kim Weins, senior vice 
president of products and marketing at OpenLogic. "Google has also 
received takedown requests for Android market apps that violated the 
GPL. App developers need to pay attention to open source license 
compliance to ensure their apps are not impacted by legal actions."</p>
			
<p>Out of the 635 apps scanned, OpenLogic identified 52 applications that 
use the Apache license and 16 that use the GPL/LGPL license.</p>

<p>OpenLogic found that among the applications that use the Apache or 
GPL/LGPL licenses, the compliance rate was only 29%. Android 
compliance was 27% and iPhone/iOS compliance was 32%. Overall 
compliance of Android applications using the GPL/LGPL was 0%.</p>
			
<p>Although the research did not specifically analyze conflicts between 
different licenses, OpenLogic noted that 13 of the applications came 
from the Apple App Store, used GPL/LGPL. The App Store has already 
removed other applications that included GPL/LGPL licenses. In 
addition, two of the applications on Android contained LGPLv2.1. This 
license could have potential conflicts with Apache 2.0 - which is the 
major license of the Android operating system.	
OpenLogic provides enterprises with a certified library of open source 
software that encompasses hundreds of the most popular open source 
packages via OpenLogic Exchange (OLEX), a free web site where

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">IronKey finds UK Organisations Fear Organised Cyber-crime</h3>

<p>IronKey, a leader in securing data and online access, released a 
survey of IT security professionals working at UK-based organisations 
including, Lloyds Banking Group, HP, Fujitsu, Siemens, Worcester 
County Council and Cleveland Police.  The study showed that 31 per 
cent suffered one or more organised attacks in the last 12 months 
resulting in theft of data or money.</p>

<p>Besides  suffering at least one cyber attack in the last 12 months, 45 
per cent believed their organisation is a target of organised 
cyber-crime which could result in the theft or sabotage.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately the results of our research don't really come as a 
shock, as the past 12 months have seen some of the biggest and most 
successful cyber-attacks our industry has ever witnessed," said Dave 
Jevans, founder of IronKey and the Anti-Phishing Working Group. </p>

<p>When asked about the significant information security threat facing 
their organisation today, 54 per cent of respondents highlighted 
accidental data leakage by staff, contractors or vendors as the 
biggest threat. The past five years of highly publicised data breaches 
and the power of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) to levy 
&pound;500,000 have gained the attention of organisations. In contrast, only 
10 per cent fear external attack on networks and systems and only 13 
per cent see Trojans that steal data, money, or sabotage systems as a 
significant threat to their organisation.</p>

<p>While 44 per cent of respondents believed an untrusted desktop or 
laptop is the most vulnerable location for an advance persistent 
threat (APT) attack, it appears respondents prefer traditional 
methods, such as end user education (44 per cent) or anti-virus (29 
per cent), as opposed to technology that isolates user and data from 
threats (19 per cent), as the most effective tool to prevent APT 
attacks.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, end user education and anti-virus were all in place at 
organisations that suffered painful losses as a result of APT attacks. 
Doing the same thing over and over won't make the problem go away - 
criminals are only more encouraged," commented Jevans. "As an 
industry, we need to shift away from trying to be all knowing and 
detecting threats we can't know about until they happen. Instead, we 
need to isolate users of sensitive data and transactions away from the 
problem."</p>

<p>As a result of cyber-crime, British business is estimated to be losing 
&pound;20bn a year.  Targeted attacks on the global energy industry as part 
of the Night Dragon attacks, the breach of infrastructure at RSA, 
compromise of digital certificate issuance at Comodo, and theft of 
millions of customer records from Epsilon all show that any 
organisation is a potential target.</p>

<p>IronKey also announced the availability of IronKey Trusted Access for 
Banking 2.7 which addresses the continuing needs of banks to isolate 
customers from the growing threat of crimeware and online account 
takeovers. The new update includes IronKey's keylogging protection 
that blocks the capture of user credentials, one-time passcodes (OTP), 
challenge questions, and other sensitive data criminals can otherwise 
easily steal.</p>

<h2>Distro News</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Ubuntu 11.04 Goes Gold</h3>

<p>The newest release of Ubuntu Linux was released at the end of April 
and features the new Unity user interface - a source of some 
controversy among beta testers - and added support for Cloud 
deployments and DevOps automation.</p>

<p>Ubuntu 11.04 Server, while not a release with Long Term Support (LTS) 
, will include will upgrades for the core cloud solution, Ubuntu 
Enterprise Cloud. The release includes the latest stable version of 
technology from Eucalyptus for those looking to build private clouds. 
Also included is  OpenStack's  latest release, 'Cactus.</p>

<p>For those working on public clouds, Ubuntu Server 11.04 will be 
available from Amazon Web Services (AWS). In addition, Canonical is 
announcing Ubuntu CloudGuest later in May, allowing individuals and 
businesses to test  and develop on the cloud with support and systems 
management from Canonical. For the first time, potential users can 
test-drive Ubuntu online using only a web browser. Visitors to 
Ubuntu.com will be able to access a complete version of the latest 
product without having to download anything.</p>

<p>In part, the CloudGuest program replaces the free CD program that 
Canonical has discontinued.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Yocto 1.0 and Carrier Grade Linux 5.0 Released</h3>

<p>Two Linux Foundation Working Groups released major updates of their 
collaborative work in April.</p>

vThe Yocto 1.0 Project Release became availabile and includes major 
improvements to its developer interface and build system, providing 
developers with even greater consistency in the software and tools 
they're using across multiple architectures for embedded Linux 
development. <a href="http://www.yoctoproject.org">For more information, Click here.</a></p>

<p>Carrier Grade Linux 5.0 covers several specification categories that 
include Availability, Clustering, Serviceability, Performance, 
Standards, Hardware, and Security. Also, a number of requirements have 
been dropped from the specification due to the mass adoption and 
ubiquity of CGL and its inclusion in the mainline Linux kernel, which 
allows these specifications to become more consistent fixtures across 
different distributions. For more information and to review the CGL

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">VMware Delivers Cloud Foundry as an Open PaaS</h3>

<p>This next generation open application platform provides a broad choice 
of developer frameworks and cloud deployment options.</p>

<p>VMware delivered Cloud Foundry in April, an open Platform as a Service 
(PaaS) architected specifically for cloud computing environments and 
delivered as a service from both enterprise datacenters and public 
cloud service providers. Cloud Foundry enhances the ability of 
developers to deploy, run and scale their applications in cloud 
environments while allowing wide choice of public and private clouds, 
developer frameworks and application infrastructure services.</p>

<p>VMware is introducing a new VMware-operated developer cloud service, a 
new open source PaaS project and the first ever "Micro Cloud" PaaS 
solution.  VMware introduced Cloud Foundry at an event where developer 
community leaders highlighted the value of an open PaaS in advancing 
highly productive development frameworks for the cloud. Speakers 
include: Dion Almaer and Ben Galbraith, co-founders of FunctionSource, 
Ryan Dahl, creator of Node.JS from Joyent, Ian McFarland, VP, 
Technology, Pivotal Labs, Roger Bodamer, 10Gen, steward of MongoDB, 
and Michael Crandell, CEO and co-founder of RightScale. Further 
industry support and blogs are available from 10Gen and RightScale.</p>

<p>Modern application development faces a growing set of challenges such 
as diverse application development frameworks, choices in new data, 
messaging, and web service application building blocks, heterogeneous 
cloud deployment options, and the customer imperative to deploy and 
migrate applications flexibly across enterprise private clouds and 
multiple cloud service providers.</p>

<p>PaaS offerings have emerged as the modern solution to the changing 
nature of applications, increasing developer efficiency, while 
promising to let developers focus exclusively on writing applications, 
rather than configuring and patching systems, maintaining middleware 
and physical machines and worrying about network topologies.</p>

<p>Early PaaS offerings, however, restricted developers to a specific or 
non-standard development frameworks, a limited set of application 
services or a single, vendor-operated cloud service. "For all of the 
developer interest in the potential benefits to PaaS solutions, actual 
adoption has been slowed by their employment of non-standard 
components and frameworks which raise the threat of lock-in," said 
Stephen O'Grady, Principal Analyst at RedMonk." With Cloud Foundry, 
VMware is providing developers a PaaS platform with the liberal 
licensing and versatility to accommodate the demand for choice in 
developer programming languages."</p>

<p>Cloud Foundry is a modern application platform built specifically to 
simplify the end-to-end development, deployment and operation of cloud 
era applications. Cloud Foundry orchestrates heterogeneous application 
services and applications built in multiple frameworks and automates 
deployment of applications and their underlying infrastructure across 
diverse cloud infrastructures.</p>

<p>Cloud Foundry supports popular, high productivity programming 
frameworks, including Spring for Java, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra for Ruby 
and Node.js, as well as support for other JVM-based frameworks 
including Grails. The open architecture will enable additional 
programming frameworks to be rapidly supported in the future. For 
application services, Cloud Foundry will initially support the 
MongoDB, MySQL and Redis databases with planned support for VMware 
vFabric services.</p>

<p>Cloud Foundry is not tied to any single cloud environment, nor does it 
require a VMware infrastructure to operate. Rather, Cloud Foundry 
supports deployment to any public and private cloud environment, 
including those built on VMware vSphere those offered by VMware vCloud 
partners, non-VMware public clouds and demonstrated support for Amazon 
Web Services by cloud management provider RightScale.</p>

<p>Cloud Foundry will be offered in multiple delivery models:</p>

<ul><li>New VMware-Operated Developer Service - Available now in beta release, 
<a href="http://www.cloudfoundry.com">http://www.cloudfoundry.com</a> is a full function public cloud PaaS service, 
operated by VMware, enabling developers to access Cloud Foundry and 
providing a test bed for new services and operational optimization.  
Via this multi-tenant PaaS environment, developers can deploy and 
cloud-scale their applications in seconds.  Developers can sign up for 
invitations today to use this service.</li>

<li>Open Source, Community PaaS Project - Available now at 
<a href="http://www.cloudfoundry.org">http://www.cloudfoundry.org</a>, this open source project and community under 
Apache 2 license enables developers to inspect, evaluate and modify 
Cloud Foundry software based on their own needs, while also minimizing 
the risk of lock-in.  This model provides the highest degree of 
extensibility, allowing the community to extend and integrate Cloud 
Foundry with any framework, application service or infrastructure 
cloud.</li>

<li>New Cloud Foundry Micro Cloud - Available later in Q2 2011, Cloud 
Foundry Micro Cloud will be a complete, downloadable instance of Cloud 
Foundry contained within a Linux virtual machine that can run on a 
developer's desktop, enabling simplified development and testing.  
Then developers can build and test applications on their own machines 
and ensure that applications running locally will also run in 
production, without modification, on any Cloud Foundry-based private 
or public cloud.  </li>

<li>Cloud Foundry for the Enterprise and Service Providers - In the 
future, VMware will also offer a commercial version of Cloud Foundry 
for enterprises who want to offer PaaS capabilities within their own 
private clouds and for service providers who want to offer Cloud 
Foundry via their public cloud services.  This commercial solution 
will enable enterprises to integrate the PaaS environment with their 
application infrastructure services portfolio. Service provider 
solutions will further deliver on the promise of portability across a 
hybrid cloud environment, enabling freedom to deploy internally or 
migrate to one of VMware's nearly 3,500 vCloud partners.</li></ul>



<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">New Version of Intel Atom CPU aimed at NetBooks and Tablets</h3>

<p>In April, Intel released the Intel Atom chip formerly codenamed "Oak 
Trail," which will be available in devices starting in May.  In 
addition, at the Intel Developer Forum in Beijing, the company gave a 
sneak peak of its next-generation, 32nm Intel Atom platform, currently 
codenamed "Cedar Trail." This solution will help to enable a new wave 
of fanless, cool and quiet netbooks, entry-level desktops and 
all-in-one designs.</p>

<p>The new Intel Atom processor Z670, part of the "Oak Trail" platform, 
delivers improved video playback, fast Internet browsing and longer 
battery life. The rich media experience available with "Oak Trail" 
includes support for 1080p video decode, as well as HDMI. The platform 
also supports Adobe Flash, enabling rich content and Flash-based 
gaming.</p>

<p>The platform also helps deliver smaller, thinner and more efficient 
devices by packing integrated graphics and the memory controller 
directly onto the processor die. The processor is 60 percent smaller 
than previous generations with a lower-power design for fanless 
devices as well as up to all-day battery life. Additional features 
include Intel Enhanced Deeper Sleep that saves more power during 
periods of inactivity. An integrated HD decode engine enables smooth 
1080p HD video playback with less power used.</p>

<p>The Intel Atom processor Z670 allows applications to run on various 
operating systems, including Google Android, MeeGo and Windows. This 
flexibility aides hybrid designs that combine the best features of the 
netbook and tablet together.</p>

<h1>Caps Lock</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/anonymous.html">Anonymous</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<p>
Coming back again to Ubuggy in the text console, be sure you are
relaxed and in tolerance mode.
</p>

<p>
First, if you do not know it by its legal name, Ubuggy goes mostly
by the nickname of Ubuntu. I have no problems using the nickname.
</p>

<p>
Second, assume that we have switched from the Ubuntu desktop to pure text mode
with Ctrl-Alt-F1 or Ctrl-Alt-F2 or whatever. We are not in a graphic
terminal.
</p>

<p>
Third, adjustments to the keymap in text mode do not affect the
desktop.
</p>

<p>
Fourth, you have superuser privileges or else you can stop
here.
</p>

<p>
And what are we dealing with this time? The caps lock key. When
pressing it intentionally or inadvertently in the text console, you
notice that other keys are not responding or are responding the
wrong way. The caps lock LED is not lighting up.
</p>

<p class="editorial">[ Just for the record: I'm using Ubuntu, and my text
terminal keys all seem to work fine - although the caps lock LED does fail
to come on. -- Ben ]
</p>

<p>
Google to the rescue: the problem is at least 6 years old. Has it
been solved? You have one guess and if you fail, nobody can help
you.
</p>

<p>
It turns out that Ubuntu has just inherited the problem, although you
can assume they made it worse. The problem is:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://old.nabble.com/Bug-514212%3A-console-setup%3A-on-UTF-8-console,-caps-lock-is-turned-into-a-shift-lock-td21848145.html">http://old.nabble.com/Bug-514212%3A-console-setup%3A-on-UTF-8-console,-caps-lock-is-turned-into-a-shift-lock-td21848145.html</a><br>
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/debian-boot@lists.debian.org/msg106545.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/debian-boot@lists.debian.org/msg106545.html</a>
</p>

<p>
So the traditional caps lock action - called Caps_Lock in the kernel
keymap - only works for ASCII or more precisely for latin1.
</p>

<p>
The intended solution is to replace it with CtrlL_Lock which is
nothing but a sticky Ctrl key to help produce Unicode capitals when
set.
</p>

<p>
The way to hell is paved with Unicode intentions. For the moment,
the patches do not work properly. Or maybe they do in a different
distro but Ubuntu has further complications:
</p>

<ol type='latin'>
<li> The Ubuntu text mode keymap has a total of 127 combos on top of
any plain key. I'd bet the farm that they have not been tested one
by one.

<li> Debian is still winding up the legacy of console-tools:

<p>
<a href="http://lct.sourceforge.net/">http://lct.sourceforge.net/</a>
</p>
</ol>

<p>
This was a project with alternative loadkeys/dumpkeys, launched in
the late 90s and stuck into non-maintenance shortly afterwards. Its
short life was, however, long enough to lure Debian into a costly
mistake they still have not recovered from. OK, but Ubuntu is Ubuntu
and they are responsible for what they do even if they are based on
Debian. Just thank console-tools if you change your text mode keymap
and later on it is rolled back unbeknownst to you.
</p>

<p>
So what has to be done until isolated kernel patchers close in on
a safe caps lock solution and Ubuntu converts to a safe text mode
keymap?
</p>

<p>
I was asking myself the question and couldn't find an answer. But
then it occurred to me that normally you and me do not type lengthy
texts all caps. For a short text of half a screen line it is not
difficult to hold down the Shift key and type the letters. For
lengthy text, should necessity really arise, type the lowercase text
in an editor, turn it upper case with the editor and paste it
wherever it is supposed to go. In other words, who needs Caps Lock
besides the Nigerians offering you millions?
</p>

<p>
And where does this key originate from in the first place? Decades
ago in the world of telegraph and telex, there was no lower case.
Typewriters could be shifted to upper case. When ca. 1970 dedicated
text processing machines were introduced, they had keyboards with
lower case and were mimicking typewriters, so they got the caps
lock key. But why the hell is it still there firmly planted on our
keyboards forty years on?
</p>

<p>
Let's solve the problem without waiting for the perfect kernel
patch: let's nuke Caps Lock.
</p>

<p>
In step 1, issue:
</p>

<pre>
dumpkeys -1 &gt; kdump.txt
</pre>

<p>
In step 2, load kdump.txt into an editor and replace all instances
of CtrlL_Lock with VoidSymbol. Save the modified file.
</p>

<p>
In step 3, issue:
</p>

<pre>
loadkeys -s kdump.txt
</pre>

<p>
Done. Of course, you may also assign to the key some other action of
your choice. For instance, I came across a guy who assigned Tab to
it because his normal Tab key was damaged. If you want to do that,
do nuke CtrlL_Lock first as indicated above, then issue:
</p>

<p>
echo "keycode 58 = Tab" | loadkeys
</p>

<p>
or whatever you want to use.
</p>

<p>
This solution is ephemeral. At the next boot you will again get the
CtrlL_Lock treatment. So save the keymap as you need it and load it
automatically from your bash profile.
</p>

<p>
Hello, Dell? Please extend an invitation to Microsoft and others and remove
the Caps Lock key from our PC keyboards.

<h1>PostgreSQL - import of large texts and dynamic content</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/borisov.html">Anton Borisov</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>PostgreSQL is an enterprise-level database. It is an open-source software, 
competes by some features with products from Oracle, so it is no surpise that 
more and more projects delegate such important duties like data-mining and 
data handling to PostgreSQL. And what's more important, the architectural 
design for this database is extremely powerful and conforms to KISS principal 
very close, so it is really very fun to deal with PGSQL internal programming, 
as well as maintaining it.
</p>

<h3>The task</h3>

<p>One of the projects that I need to take care of is based on PostgreSQL and 
Liferay Portal, which in turn is based on Tomcat. Actually, it has a 3-tier 
architecture, where Tomcat works as a web-server, i.e. it basically is a front-end, 
that serves requests from around the world. Liferay's web-pages can be as: 
(a) plain HTML, (b) JSP (Java Server Pages), (c) or can be programmed as 
servlets (portlets) as well. The latter two scenarios require you to have 
an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) with JSP-, portlet-, JDBC-bindings 
deployed. Basically, either JSP, or portlet contains code, that just fetches 
actual SQL-data from database instance (for example, news_portal) and prepares 
lovely HTML-page, which shows today's weather forecast, or currency rates. However, 
you might be interested in generating the same page without doing time consuming 
efforts like downloading and installing IDE, programming new servlet and deploying 
it afterall. How to make it happen? Simply execute necessary SQL-requests at 
backyard, i.e. within operating system space, where Tomcat and PostgreSQL servers 
reside. You can program it in 10 minutes - in bash, python or any other scripting 
language. In my case I generate HTML-page, that consists of thousand lines of text, 
and push it back into Liferay's CMS database engine (news_lportal), so HTML contents 
of this page is to be displayed by Liferay itself. I also scheduled via cron how often 
I regenerate this information page, so Liferay would always show up-to-date news, 
rates, etc.
</p>

<h3>Data manipulating with PSQL</h3>

<p>There's a native client, that comes with PostgreSQL server, called psql. 
Although psql is console application only it has essentially the same 
capabilities as it's counterpart - a GUI, GTK-based PgAdmin. If you don't 
have it installed in your system, please run aptitude (for Debian):
</p>

<pre class="code">
# aptitude install postgresql-client
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
Reading extended state information      
Initializing package states... Done
Reading task descriptions... Done  
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  postgresql-client postgresql-client-8.3{a} postgresql-client-common{a} 
0 packages upgraded, 3 newly installed, 0 to remove and 6 not upgraded.
Need to get 2028kB of archives. After unpacking 5276kB will be used.
Do you want to continue? [Y/n/?]
</pre>

<p>
Listing 1. Postgresql package consists of psql as well as other auxiliary utilities
</p>

<p>
It will install psql, as well as pg* utilities (pg_dump, pg_restore and others).
</p>

<p>
Surely, you can install a GUI application as well for performing complex tasks, 
like data analysis:
</p>

<pre class="code">
# aptitude install pgadmin3
</pre>

<img src="pgadmin.png" alt="PgAdmin" align="center" style="margin-right: 50px; margin-bottom: 15px;" />

<p>
Figure 1. PgAdmin - graphical application for handling SQL-queries
</p>

<p>
With the help of psql you can quite easily run any SQL-statement, like this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
psql -q -n -h 127.0.0.1 news_lportal -U root -c "select userid, emailaddress from user_"</pre>
<p>where used:</p>

<pre class="code">
	host to connect to - <b>127.0.0.1</b>
	desired database within PostgreSQL pool - <b>news_lportal</b>
	username, which is granted to execute SQL-command - <b>root</b>
	and SQL-command itself - <b>select userid, emailaddress from user_</b>
</pre>

<p>
Alternatively, you can run psql with <i>update operator</i>, like this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
psql -q -n -h 127.0.0.1 news_lportal -U root -c "update journalarticle set content = '&lt;H1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/H1&gt;' where id_ = 24326"
</pre>

<p>
Where ID with number 24326 is my HTML document previosuly created by CMS-engine 
on top of Liferay and stored inside PostgreSQL database - news_lportal.
</p>

<p>
In such a way, you could refresh any information, that is stored inside <b>journalarticle</b> 
table. The only thing you should remember about is the correct ID for your article.
</p>

<p>
However, in real life this update trick won't work as it should. I've prepared 
an update script (import_table.sh), where the contents of <i>table_news.html</i> 
file should be uploaded into PostgreSQL.
</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh
    ct=`cat table_news.html`
    psql -t -l -q -n -h 127.0.0.1 news_lportal -U root -c "update journalarticle set content = '$ct' where id_ = 24326;"
</pre>

<p>
Listing 2. Very simple import script (import_table.sh), first version
</p>

<p>
Argh! It didn't work out - PostgreSQL client refused to run an update command.
</p>

<pre class="code">
$ ./import_table.sh 
./import_table.sh: line 4: /usr/bin/psql: Argument list too long
</pre>

<p>
At first glance, the file <i>table_news.html</i> seems to be quite good. 
But a closer look shows another catch-up - the file is a bit too large - 400Kb in size.
</p>

<pre class="code">
$ file table_news.html
table_news.html: UTF-8 Unicode text, with very long lines
$ cat table_news.html | wc
    617    2505  408460
</pre>

<p>
Is there a mechanism to load any text file larger than 2Kb into database? Yes! 
Luckily, PostgreSQL has import/export functions that will ease communicating 
with file I/O operations. Let's declare our own procedure get_text_document_portal() 
that will load into database any text file.
</p>

<pre class="code">
- Function: get_text_document_portal(character varying) 
-- DROP FUNCTION get_text_document_portal(character varying); 
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_text_document_portal(p_filename character varying) 
  RETURNS text AS 
$BODY$ SELECT CAST(pg_read_file(E'liferay_import/' || $1 ,0, 100000000) AS TEXT); 
$BODY$ 
  LANGUAGE sql VOLATILE SECURITY DEFINER 
  COST 100; 
ALTER FUNCTION get_text_document_portal(character varying) OWNER TO postgres; 
</pre>

<p>
Listing 3. Our new procedure will call pg_read_file() function and read text file from disk
</p>

<p>
In order to load a text file into the database named news_lportal, I've written 
the script below (import_table_2.sh), which takes filename - in this example, 
<b>table.text</b> - as a parameter for get_text_document_portal() procedure and 
places it's contents into corresponding field of table journalarticle. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh
    psql -q -n  -h 127.0.0.1 news_lportal -U root -c "update journalarticle set content = get_text_document_portal('table.text') where id_  = 24326;"
</pre>

<p>
Listing 4. Import script (import_table_2.sh) that triggers our new pgsql-procedure
</p>

<p>
All you need to do is to change the source HTML file, named table.text 
and run import_table_2.sh. Please pay attention to a location, where 
the imported file should be placed - this is a subdirectory <b>liferay_import</b> 
under /var/lib/postgresql/8.3/main/ tree.
</p>

<pre class="code">
$ ls -l /var/lib/postgresql/8.3/main/

</pre>

<p>
Listing 5. Owners' information for PostgreSQL disk storage pool
</p>

<p>
It is owned by postgres and can be written by this user only. Or, by root 
account. Of course, you could add an entry into root's crontab, but a good 
practice is - split jobs between different accounts. Assigning database jobs 
to postgres only, and every other task trust to, for instance, tomcat account. 
So how can tomcat user be able to write to <b>liferay_import</b> directory 
with postgres owner access bits? By making a link - symlink doesn't work, 
but hardlink will do!
</p>

<pre class="code">
# ln /var/lib/postgresql/8.3/main/liferay_import/table.text	/home/tomcat/db/table.text
</pre>

<p>
Listing 6. Hardlink allows to override owners' limitations provided by symlink 
</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh

        /home/tomcat/db/prepare_table_news.sh > /home/tomcat/db/table.text
        /home/tomcat/db/import_table_2.sh
</pre>

<p>
Listing 7. Script (mk_db.sh), that prepares arbitrary HTML-document and loads it into database
</p>

<p>
Hooray! Now I can place an entry into tomcat's crontab and get the news 
information updated every hour. And this is done from under tomcat account. 
Really nice.
</p>

<pre class="code">
$ crontab -l
# m h  dom mon dow   command
0 * * * * /home/tomcat/db/mk_db.sh > /dev/null
</pre>

<p>
Listing 8. One entry in tomcat's crontab that should be executed every 
hour in order to update news 
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
There exist different approaches how to provide up-to-date information when 
you deal with Liferay Portal and portlet-technology. First way requires to 
have dedicated developer environment preinstalled (NetBeans IDE with portlets 
bindings), whilst another way needs only to have a basic shell-scripting 
knowledge and be able to correctly construct SQL-queries. Of course, the better 
way is a good full-time developer with hands on IDE, JSR168 / JSR268 portlet 
standards, that would program whatever web-application you need, especially 
HTML-page with dynamically changed information. However, you can achieve the 
same results much quicker - simply rely upon casual Linux console tools.

<h1>Running Encyclopaedia Britannica on Linux</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/brownss.html">Silas Brown</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<p>Encyclopaedia Britannica is a commercial encyclopedia and is
therefore non-free, but old versions of the CDs and DVDs can
often be purchased cheaply in second-hand markets.  Of
particular interest are the 2004 editions, as its publishers
have made available an unofficial <A
HREF="http://support.britannica.com/linux/linux.htm">Linux
support script for 2004 editions of Britannica</A> (the Windows
installer does not yet work on WINE).  If you follow their
instructions, you can expect to see the basic encyclopedia
articles and images, but you might have a more difficult time
with the Webster dictionary entries and some of the
multimedia.</p>

<p>The instructions tell you to download version 1.3.1 of the
Java Runtime Environment, and the script refuses to run on any
other version.  Nowadays we're up to at least version 1.6, and
it can be difficult to find the old 1.3.1 version.  However, if
you edit their script and comment out the version check (at the
time of writing it's on line 112 of
<tt>linux-launch2.0.pl</tt>), you should find that most things
work on newer versions.</p>

<p>You also need to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable.  If
you're not sure, try setting it to <tt>/usr</tt>.  I added
<tt>$ENV{JAVA_HOME} = "/usr";</tt> to the
<tt>linux-launch2.0.pl</tt> file itself, and also deleted the
"Enter location of the Britannica Software" question and
replaced it with a hard-coded location so I can launch it more
quickly.</p>

<h2>Large print</h2>

<p>Unfortunately the preferences dialog doesn't work, and
manually editing the preferences file has limited success when
it comes to adjusting the font size.  It may seem you're stuck
with the default small-sized fonts, and you have to copy and
paste the text elsewhere if you want to read it larger. 
However, if all else fails, you can use VNC for magnification. 
To set this up:</p>

<pre>
sudo apt-get install x11vnc xtightvncviewer vnc4server
vncpasswd   # give yourself a password
cat &gt; .vnc/xstartup &lt;&lt;EOF
#!/bin/bash
x11vnc -display :1 -rfbport 5902 -forever -scale 2:nb &amp;
xsetroot -solid grey
exec $HOME/britannica/linux-launch2.0.pl
EOF
chmod +x .vnc/xstartup
</pre>

<p>and then to run it:</p>

<pre>
vncserver :1 -geometry 700x560 -depth 16  # this is about the minimum dimensions for EB
sleep 2  # allow x11vnc to start
xtightvncviewer :2 -passwd $HOME/.vnc/passwd -geometry 1275x720 # (adjust this for your desktop)
killall Xvnc4
</pre>

<p><tt>xtightvncviewer</tt> tends to have better display-update
logic than straight <tt>xvncviewer</tt>.</p>

<p>One disadvantage of this approach is that you can't copy text
from articles and paste them into other applications that are
outside of the VNC server.  This appears to be a limitation of
<tt>x11vnc</tt>.  If you want to copy text then you'll have to
run Encyclopaedia Britannica without magnification.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>There has been much debate about how Britannica compares with
Wikipedia, and I won't go into that too much.  Suffice to say
that you can't expect <b>any</b> encyclopedia to be absolutely
perfect; after all they are all <b>human</b> creations, just like
software, so you will need to keep your head about you when
using any of them.  Wikipedia tends to be more up-to-date and
covers some areas that Britannica does not, but Britannica tends
to give you more of that "finished product" feeling: you won't
spend your time sifting through work in progress, or finding
articles that look more like the fallout of a heated debate than
something that belongs in the quiet back room of a traditional
reference library.  If you sometimes get tired of the noisier
wiki atmosphere<sup>[clarification needed]</sup> then you might
want to add Britannica to your reading at times.</p>

<h1>Away Mission - May/June 2011</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<h2>Events in May</h2>

<p>
This is very full month, a Red Hat/MeeGo/Synergy month.
</p>   

<h3>Red Hat Summit</h3>

<p>
The first week is dominated by the combined Red Hat Summit and co-located JBoss World in Boston.  The joint venue is billed as "...open source events that bring together engineers, business decision makers, developers and community enthusiasts to learn about the latest in open source cloud, virtualization, platform, middleware, and management technologies."  Right.  As does every major conference.
</p>

<p>
But this event has the Red Hat imprimatur and a very long history with the Linux Community, making it a Gold Standard Linux conference.
</p>  

<p>
At the Red Hat Summit, you can learn about open source advancements through:<br>
Technical and business seminars<br>
Hands-on labs and demos<br>
Customer case studies<br>
Networking opportunities<br>
Keynotes by Open Source leaders, and Red Hat partners<br>
Direct collaboration with Red Hat and JBoss engineers
</p>


<p>
It's this last item - talking with the engineers - that can justify a trip to Boston.
</p>

<p>
Among keynotes by executives from Cisco, HP, IBM and Intel, will be Jeremy Gutsche, the founder of TrendHunter.com and an author of thousands of postings and articles on viral trends and innovation.  He has been described as "a new breed of trend spotter" by The Guardian, "an eagle eye" by Global TV, an "Oracle" by the Globe and Mail and "on the forefront of cool" by MTV.
</p>

<p>
Also, there is Red Hat's Cloud Evangelist and author of the Pervasive Datacenter blog on CNET, Gordon Haff.  He has been speaking with enterprise architects and CIOs about their aspirations for cloud computing, how they're approaching it, and areas of potential concern. Gordon will be sharing these experiences in his session "Trends in Cloud Computing: What You Need to Know." In addition, he'll be moderating the panel discussion "Real World Perspectives Panel: Cloud" and he will also participate in the  Expert Forum panel where he and other experts  will answer questions about cloud computing.
</p>


<p>
As a preview, here are the 2010 presentations, organized by tracks:<br>
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/promo/summit/2010/presentations/">http://www.redhat.com/promo/summit/2010/presentations/</a>
</p>



<p>
Early Bird rates are past but were $1295; registering the week of the conference is $1595.  That's high.  Alumni rates for prior attendees are $400 less in either category, which is a fairer rate for a 3 day event.  You can Register for Red Hat Summit and JBoss World until May 2.
</p>


<h3>Google IO 2011</h3>

<p>
If you work with Google technologies, especially Android OS, then Google IO is the place to be.   But only Alumni from the last 2 years were able to register in advance,  and only a lucky few got to the registration site within the first 30-40 minutes.   I missed it too....
</p>

<p>
But there was a silver lining in that: the sell-out at Google IO led to
sell out attendance at the recent AnDevCon in San Mateo and the Android
Builders Conference that was co-located with the recent Embedded Linux
Conference.  Those were good events and they should be noted for next year.
Try to follow some Google IO alumni on Twitter if you want to get a jump
on the 2012 registration.
</p>  

<p>

</p>



<h3>Open Source Business Conference (OSBC)</h3>

<p>
Open Source has become almost common at mainline businesses.   But OSBC brings long term leaders of Open Source businesses together to discuss new trends and developments.  
If you or your company is planning to jump into the Open Source world, this is an event to attend.
</p>

<p>
Admittedly, the pronouncements and trends discussed have been less stunning than in the first years of this conference.  But as shown by the NewsBytes story on the non-compliance of mobile apps, a lot of developers don't do Open Source correctly.  Expect this and larger issues, like the Oracle-Google conflict, to be addressed.
</p>

<p>
The OSBC agenda sports many panels over its 2 day run.   These are often more interesting than the prepared presentations.  Last year, a panel with Microsoft executives had them talking about improving their relationship with the Open Source community and pledging quick support for HTML 5.
</p>  

<p>
Bob Sutor of IBM gave a keynote called "Asking the Hard Questions about Open Source Software" at the OSBC 2010 conference. It distilled the wisdom he and other IBMers acquired after a decade of Linux and Open Source contributions.  He concluded that OSSw is still SW -  that it needs to be measured and compared with regular SW in the enterprise.  There should be  no free pass due to ideology or community affiliation.
</p>

<p>
Here's a link to a PDF version of that talk, aimed at developers and enterprise IT staff: <a href="http://www.sutor.com/d/Sutor-OSBC-2010.pdf">http://www.sutor.com/d/Sutor-OSBC-2010.pdf</a> 
</p>

<p>
One of the best talks I experienced was given by Matt Aslett, an analyst with The 451 Group: "The Evolution of Open Source Business Strategies"  This focused on the relations between the developer community and supporting companies in varying business models.
Aslett discussed the evolution of those models and showed that there was a tendency to both open the underlying platforms more and also to move to a mix of open and proprietary licensing.  In the end, he argued that there was no basic model  for open source businesses and the future remained, literally, "mixed"  For more info on his point of view, visit his blog at The 451 Group, <a href="http://blogs.the451group.com/opensource/author/maslett/">http://blogs.the451group.com/opensource/author/maslett/</a> . 
</p>

<p>
This year, OSBC moves to the Hilton near Union Square from the slightly grander Palace Hotel.  This could be a sign that the event has expanded.  Let's hope the quality remains the same.
</p>


<h3>MeeGo 2011</h3>

<p>
This is the second MeeGo conference and is sponsored by Intel, Nokia, and the Linux Foundation.
</p>  

<p>
Created by merging Moblin and Maemo, this distribution is designed for smartphones, netbooks, entry level desktop computers and in-vehicle enteratainment systems.  Its been annointed by Intel and the Linux Foundation.  But Android seems to be getting more developer attention, so far.
</p>

<p>
MeeGo netbooks and tablets will be coming out shortly, so this may be the moment to ride an up-and-coming MeeGo wave.  Jim Zemlin of the Linux Foundation thinks so.
</p>

<p>
We didn't attend last year but from the quality of sessions at the Linux Foundation's Embedded Linux Conference this year, which included some MeeGo sessions, and the Android Builder's Conference in April, we think this is a good bet for Linux developers and OEMs of portable and embedded devices.   And the price is right:   Free.
</p>

</p>

<h3>Citrix Synergy 2011</h3>

<p>
This is the Xen Conference and Citrix, after buying XenSource, is like EMC to VMware.  This is a good event for the Xen faithful, but Citrix is increasingly commercializing Xen offerings.  And the spreading adoption of KVM for hosting guest OSes is putting Xen out of fashion.  But this is still a solid technology and business conference with good sessions and decent grub.  If you are using XenServer or other Xen technologies, or if you use the popular NetScaler appliances, this is the place to be.
</p>

<p>
Arguably, Citrix has had success positioning XenServer and its management tools as a safe niche between VMware and Microsoft's HyperV. The underlying hypervisor technology in both Xen and HyperV come out of the same Cambridge virtualization research and the Citrix tools integrate exceedingly well with Microsoft servers.  So the slideware and market-tecture lean a bit more toward Redmond and many of the Expo businesses are Microsoft Partners.
</p>  

<p>
More than 75 breakout sessions are planned for the 2011 Synergy.   Here is the current list:<br>
<a href="http://www.citrixsynergy.com/sanfrancisco/learning/breakoutsessions.html">http://www.citrixsynergy.com/sanfrancisco/learning/breakoutsessions.html</a>
</p>

<p>
There are also new self-paced labs and instructor-directed labs and many whiteboard sessions with leading Citrix engineers.
</p>  
		
<p>
Those self-paced Learning Labs will be held more than half a mile away at the Hilton San Francisco Union Square. Just find an available workstation, select your topic from the menu and get set for a 90-minute lab experience. There will be 200 seats and computers are provided. And no reservations are required for these labs.
</p>

<p>
Sneak peak: SYN203 Managing VM networking across the datacenter with XenServer<br>
<a href="http://www.citrix.com/tv/#videos/3781">http://www.citrix.com/tv/#videos/3781</a>
</p>
 
<p>
This session will give a glimpse into distributed virtual switching (DVS) in Citrix XenServer will describe best practices for using DVS to deliver more secure, measurable and reliable network services for virtualized applications.
</p> 

<p>
And here are additional video sessions from Synergy San Francisco 2010:<br>
<a href="http://www.citrix.com/tv/#search/synergy+SF">http://www.citrix.com/tv/#search/synergy+SF</a>
</p>  

<p>
Unfortunately, aside from those edited session videos, there is no archive of materials for previous Synergy conferences - not for previous attendees or the public.   You got to be there to get the Synergy content.
</p>


<p>
The gala Synergy party on Thursday evening, May 26, will wrap up the conference with great entertainment by Train, the Grammy award-winning group that recently released a very appropriate album title – "Save Me San Francisco" – that has since gone gold.
</p>

<p>
This could be a lead-up to a sweet Memorial Day Weekend in the San Francisco Bay Area.

<h2>Events in June</h2>

<h3>The Semantic Technology Conference</h3>

<p>
SemTech is the world's largest, most authoritative conference on semantic technology. This is the eigth year of the conference and the second year the event is at a San Francisco Hotel - in this case, the Hilton Union Square.  About 1000 attendees are expected to attend SemTech 2011, and for the first time there will be a SemTech London at the end of September and a SemTech East in Washington at the end of November.
</p>

<p>
One new theme for this 8th year of SemTech is the Future of Media.  In the session, "The paradox of content liberation: More structure means more freedom" Rachel Lovinger will discuss how applying greater structure to content via semantic metadata allows it to be more widely re-used, referenced and adapted for different purposes.  Semantic metadata is what runs the Web know, extending and sharpening searches, enhancing ecommerce, and developing social context.
</p>

<p>
If you can fit it into your schedule, this one is worth attending.
</p>  


<h3>Ottawa Linux Symposium (OLS)</h3>

<p>
The goal of the Ottawa Linux Symposium is to provide a vendor neutral and open environment to bring together Linux developers, enthusiasts, and systems administrators as well as to strengthen the personal connections within the Linux Community. This conference has been running for the last 13 years. so they must be doing several things right.  This year the main keynote is presented by the irascible Jon "Maddog" Hall,  a long-time advocate for the open source community.
</p>

<p>
OLS usually opens with an update of the current state of the Linux Kernel and key events and contributions over the past 12 months. These presentations were first done by Jon Corbett from LWN.net - who runs a kernel panel at the Linux Collaboration Summit annually as well - but  this year the OLS kernel session will be done by Jon C. Masters, who is an author and also the producer of the Kernel Podcast.
</p>

<p>
Costs are fairly low as the event is hosted by the University of Ottawa so the full Enthusiast/Small Business Rate is only $500 and the full Corporate rate is only $800 for 3 days.  This represents their first increase in the 13 years OLS has been running.<br>
OLS has set up a travel fund to help people make it to the event who would otherwise not be able to in the current economic climate. They are taking contributions by Paypal to Community Travel Assistance Fund page: <a href="http://www.linuxsymposium.org/2011/travel_assistance.php">http://www.linuxsymposium.org/2011/travel_assistance.php</a> 
</p>

<p>
They also have an active following on Twitter and run contests like the May 16th-20th raffle  to win admission at the heavily discounted student rate of $200.
</p>  

<p>
Here's the link for OLS list of presentations and tutorials:<br>

</p>


<h3>Amazon Web Services Summits 2011</h3>

<p>
The AWS Summit is actually held on 2 different days:  June 10th in New York, and June 14th in both San Francisco and London.  These regional full-day conferences will provide information on Amazon's Cloud offerings and feature a keynote address by Amazon.com CTO Werner Vogels, customer presentations, how-to sessions, and tracks designed for new users.
</p>

<p>
Among the reasons to attend:
</p>

<p>
--    Gain a deeper understanding of Amazon Web Services, including best practices for developing, architecting, and securing applications in the Cloud.<br>
and<br>
 --   Learn how Solutions Providers from the AWS community have helped businesses launch applications in the Cloud, utilizing enterprise software, SaaS tools, and more.
</p>

<p>
These events are free if you register early, and there will be lunch.
</p>



<h3>eComm - the Emerging Communications Conference</h3>

<p>
This event focuses on the convergence of communications and emphasizes the impact of new technology and also open source software on digital networks.   Its a fairly young event but has been steadily growing, even in the time of the Great Recession.
</p>

<p>
The conference has moved this year from its traditional early Spring time to the beginning of Summer, June 27-29.   There was some risk earlier this year that it might be postponed but the main organizer, Lee Dryburgh, is fully committed to making it happen in the new time slot.
</p>

<p>
In 2008, eComm was billed as the communications industry rethink. It tries to be  like a TED conference for the telcom sector, said Dryburgh.  It certainly remains the place to examine the varied strands of digital communications.
</p>

<p>
You help shape the event by contributing to the on-going and open topic discussion document  - no registration required - at <a href="http://bit.ly/fT9L7y">http://bit.ly/fT9L7y</a> .
</p>

<p>
Here's a slide share link to earlier presentations at eComm:<br>
<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/search/slideshow?type=presentations&amp;q=ecomm">http://www.slideshare.net/search/slideshow?type=presentations&amp;q=ecomm</a>
</p>

<p>
I have always found interesting speakers and attendees at eComm and the evenings are set up like mixers to encourage interaction.  The food isn't bad either.   So come if you can.

<h1>FreeBSD - An Intro for Linux Devotees</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/grebler.html">Henry Grebler</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<h3>Disclaimers</h3>

<p>
Let's get the disclaimers out of the way quickly.
</p>

<p>
These are my impressions. I do not have a special pipeline to FreeBSD
gurus.
</p>

<p>
I started using FreeBSD in January 2010, a bit more than a year ago. I
was not a total stranger to FreeBSD, having done a little on it a few
years earlier. But I have not used FreeBSD anywhere near as long as
I've used Linux.
</p>


<h3>A Little History (Very Little)</h3>

<p>
There are 3 main BSDs and a handful of minor variations. The main ones
are FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD. I can't tell you how they differ.
Possibly, they are the analogues of Red Hat, Debian and SUSE. Of the
3, FreeBSD has the lion's share of users.
</p>

<p>
NetBSD and FreeBSD began with the same initial code base around 1993.
OpenBSD is a later fork from NetBSD. To varying degrees, code from
FreeBSD's precursor is used in Microsoft Windows, Darwin (Mac OS X),
Solaris.
</p>


<h3>Look and Feel</h3>

<p>
What does it feel like to use FreeBSD on a daily basis? The short
answer is that it's a lot like Linux. Or any other Unix, for that
matter.
</p>

<p>
Readers of Linux Gazette may be aware of my HAL (Henry Abstraction
Layer); that I use HAL to hide the differences between different
platforms. But, in fact, I needed to make very few changes to my HAL
to adapt to FreeBSD.
</p>

<p>
Linux users might notice that some of the standard commands don't have
exactly the same options. FreeBSD ls is not GNU ls. For instance, they
have conflicting interpretations of the "-T" option. In FreeBSD, "-T"
produces complete time information, but not as detailed as
"--full-time".
</p>

<p>
However, FreeBSD includes GNU ls as gls (/usr/local/bin/gls).
</p>

<p>
Further, if you really want something Linux, FreeBSD includes Linux
binary compatibility which "allows FreeBSD users to run about 90% of
all Linux applications without modification"
(http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/linuxemu.html).
</p>

<p>
So on top of gls, you can also get /usr/compat/linux/bin/ls. (That's 3
versions of ls for the price of 1!)
</p>

<p>
What's the difference?
</p>

<pre>
$ /usr/compat/linux/bin/ls --version
ls (GNU coreutils) 6.12
Copyright (C) 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
...

$ gls --version
ls (GNU coreutils) 7.5
Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
...
</pre>

<p>
That's probably more than you ever wanted to know about ls (or any
other command).
</p>

<p>
As a last resort, if you have a Linux program, you can try to run it
under FreeBSD. There's a good chance that it will just work. And it's
not an emulation. It runs at pretty much native speed.
</p>


<h3>Differences I've noticed</h3>

<p>
FreeBSD comes without bash. But, in fairness, on FreeBSD /bin/sh is
vastly more than Bourne shell. But it's not bash.
</p>

<p>
Standard stuff that comes with FreeBSD can be found in /bin and
/usr/bin. Alien software usually goes into /usr/local/bin. You can
install bash and it will wind up in /usr/local/bin. Most of my scripts
are Bourne shell; their first line consists of:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    #! /bin/sh
</pre>

<p>
However, I do have a few bash scripts; these tend to have a first
line:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    #! /bin/bash
</pre>

<p>
I guess I could have found another solution, but it seemed simplest to
make /bin/bash a symlink to /usr/local/bin. Some people might raise
their eyebrows at this, but my system, my rules.
</p>

<p>
su is a bit different. FreeBSD has truss (similar to Solaris) rather
than strace.
</p>


<h3>The Good</h3>

<p>
The sheer number of packages. FreeBSD has an astonishing number of
packages. Looking at my system, I estimate over 22,000 (available
packages - I haven't installed them all!). This number probably
overestimates because some of these are to do with different languages
(arabic, chinese, french, german, hebrew, hungarian, japanese, polish,
portuguese, russian, ukrainian, vietnamese). But even without the
languages, there were more than 21,800 packages.
</p>

<p>
I may not be interested in any of these languages since I am most
comfortable in English. But I suspect that there are a lot of people
in the world who would be quite grateful to be able to use their
native tongue. This sort of thing only becomes an issue when one's
preferred language is omitted.
</p>

<p>
There is heaps of documentation (are heaps?). And the documentation is
pretty good.
</p>

<p>
I like the idea that there is a Master of the FreeBSD Universe.
Consequently, no one can change a standard or the framework. But,
individually, a user can still make any conceivable modification -
because, ultimately, you are encouraged to build anything and
everything for yourself.
</p>

<p>
The result is that you never get dynamic library conflicts. (I did
once - it's a long story and an unusual scenario).
</p>

<p>
There is an overwhelming sense of quality, an expectation that things
will just work. Whenever something didn't work for me, I assumed that
it was simply a matter of my ignorance. Although this is usually a
safe bet, it nonetheless speaks volumes about the quality of FreeBSD.
</p>

<p>
There are some exceptions at the margins.
</p>


<h3>The Bad</h3>

<p>
Here is something I noticed on the Internet:
</p>

<pre>
        "... being a long time Linux person, I'm sad to say that
        FreeBSD ports/packages is really confusing to me."
</pre>

<p>
I agree. I finally have a handle on packages. I'm still confused about
ports. I'd like some tutorials or HowTos on how one is meant to manage
ports. There is a plethora of similarly named tools. Which one(s)
should I use? What's best practice?
</p>

<p>
At its simplest, packages are, or more specifically, pkg_add is, a lot
like an inferior yum. It's like "yum install" without "yum list": it
takes care of the installation, but it's an act of faith as to how
much will be downloaded. Until recently, this was an ISP issue for me.
It's still an issue for another reason. If I install openoffice
blindly, I might end up filling a disk. "yum list" gives me some idea
of what's involved *before* I commit.
</p>

<p>
There's another annoyance. Let's say you want to run Firefox. Of
course you do. No problems. You can't go to the Firefox website and
simply download the latest Firefox. The choices there are "Windows, Mac
OS X, Linux" in many languages. Instead, you download it as a package.
It's a big download, but, like yum, pkg_add takes care of
dependencies.
</p>

<p>
Good, your happy. Your Firefox works like a bought one, straight out
of the box. Until you go to, say, YouTube. Or any site that needs
extensions. Let me be a little more precise: until you need some sort
of plugin that executes proprietary binary code. Who makes Flash?
Adobe. Is the source freely available? No, sir. Clearly a solution is
needed. The solution is rather convoluted:
</p>

<p>
(From http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/desktop-browsers.html)
</p>


<pre>
6.2.3 Firefox and Macromedia&reg; Flash Plugin

Macromedia&reg; Flash plugin is not available for FreeBSD. However, a
software layer (wrapper) for running the Linux version of the plugin
exists. This wrapper also supports Adobe&reg; Acrobat&reg; plugin,
RealPlayer&reg; plugin and more.
</pre>

<p>
Now before you start laughing, let me say that I encountered a similar
problem when I ran a 64-bit version of Firefox on CentOS at work (on a
64-bit machine). The Firefox works, but I couldn't get any plugins to
work because there was no 64-bit Flash plugin. I don't understand why
it couldn't run a 32-bit plugin, but there it is.
</p>

<p>
At least I have been able to get Flash working under FreeBSD. I can
see video and hear audio. It was a complicated install, but now it's
done.
</p>


<h3>The Indifferent</h3>

<p>
Don't expect FreeBSD to be like Microsoft Windows or even Ubuntu. You
are expected to know what you are doing. If you don't, you can ask for
help. But you will not be mollycoddled the way Microsoft or Apple do
it. Personally, this is how I prefer it. I like my platforms a little
user-antagonistic.
</p>

<p>
By default, FreeBSD uses ufs which is not at all like ext2 or ext3.
And it talks of slices rather than partitions. So to install FreeBSD,
you use something (eg fdisk) to partition the disk. Whichever
partition you allocate to FreeBSD, it will slice up that partition
into several bits. So, for example, I allocated partition 3 of the
second drive (/dev/ad1s3) to FreeBSD:
</p>

<pre>
    Device Boot    Start       End    Blocks   Id  System
/dev/ad1s3   *     10608     25846   7680456   a5  FreeBSD
</pre>

<p>
(I've omitted the other partitions).
</p> 

<p>
Here's the relevant bits of a df:
</p>

<pre>
Filesystem                         Size     Used    Avail Capacity Mounted
/dev/ad1s3a                        372M     268M      74M  78% /
/dev/ad1s3e                        310M     117M     168M  41% /tmp
/dev/ad1s3f                        4.9G     3.5G     1.0G  78% /usr
/dev/ad1s3d                        558M      51M     462M  10% /var
</pre>

<p>
FreeBSD uses the term "slice". It has taken the partition I gave it
(/dev/ad1s3) and sliced it up (/dev/ad1s3a, /dev/ad1s3b, etc).
</p>

<p>
But the good news is that FreeBSD understands ext2. So, when I ran out
of room in my FreeBSD partition, I simply mounted some Linux
partitions. Further, FreeBSD not only understands NFS, I think it
wrote the original book on it. So I am able to run both my Linux
machine and my FreeBSD machine and mount drives from either on the
other and just be on whichever machine without being too conscious of
any differences.
</p>

<p>
I don't know the relative merits of ufs and ext2. It also looks like
FreeBSD understands all of ext2/ext3/ext4. I wonder why I'm using ext2
and not ext3.
</p>


<h3>Why did I choose FreeBSD?</h3>

<p>
Good question. Difficult question.
</p>

<p>
I was trying to solve a problem. Maybe several problems.
</p>

<p>
My first problem is that I run an idiosyncratic environment. Why?
</p>

<p>
Imagine you have a car. I guess that's not a difficult exercise for
most people. Let's accept, for the purposes of this exercise, that you
are not a rev-head. You are not particularly interested in cars per
se. You're a lot like my wife: you want to get into your car and drive
to your destination. The only choice you want is the colour of the
Duco.
</p>

<p>
So, after a while it's time to replace your car. But the latest model
cars don't have the same controls as your previous car had. Steering
wheel? No, we don't have one of them any more. We've got this new
gadget. You sit on it; and when you want to steer, you sort of wriggle
around. Sounds odd, but you'll soon get used to it. It's not actually
better than a steering wheel, but it's the latest must-have. Everybody
wants one. They were all getting bored with steering wheels. Brakes?
Yes, we have a new way of stopping. We stick a gizmo in your ear and
...
</p>

<p>
That's what new releases of distros feel like to me. I went to
"upgrade" from Fedora 5 to 10. I had had no problems going from 2 to
5. But 10 was another matter altogether. Just out of the blue, the
names of disks changed. My Fedora 5 (which I'm still running)  refers
to /dev/hda. Fedora 10 decided to call it /dev/sda. Perhaps I'm naive,
but I don't expect gratuitous changes like that from FreeBSD.
</p>

<p>
Every new rev of emacs introduces incompatible changes.
</p>

<p>
I don't turn on a computer so that I can learn new tricks. Not those
sorts of new tricks. One of my computers has to be bread and butter,
unchanging from day to day. I don't want to spend my time learning
somebody's idea of a better editor. It's an editor! I just want the
one I was using yesterday. Not better, not worse, not different. I DO
NOT NOT NOT WANT ANY NEW FEATURES. If you want to do that, here's an
idea: deliver emacs-classic and new-emacs. Put all your changes into
new-emacs and leave emacs-classic as it is. Coke, anyone?
</p>

<p>
Every time they make it better, they make it worse. And that goes for
Solitaire and aspell and ... the list goes on.
</p>

<p>
And these gratuitous changes come at a price. I used to run Slackware
on a 16MB 100 Mhz Pentium 1. I was trying to install Fedora 10 on a
spare machine and getting intermittent problems. After a while, they
went away. It wasn't till much later that I twigged. I happened to
notice in some documentation a declaration that Fedora would no longer
run in 256MB; it needed a minimum of 512MB. While fiddling with my
machine, I'd added some extra memory from another (dead) machine.
</p>

<p>
I decided I didn't like the notion of releases. Especially since
Fedora is committed to producing a new release every year. That
wouldn't be a disaster if there were any respect for backward
compatibility. But there's not. There's the tacit assumption that the
newest and latest will necessarily be the best. For everyone.
</p>

<p>
I asked around. Gentoo and Arch Linux were suggested as solutions to
my problems. I was given to understand that they are more into the
idea of just allowing the system to update organically. If you need a
latter version of application X, just go get it. They had gone away
from the idea of discrete releases. Sure, if you wanted to switch
sects, you'd get the latest release. But you would not be penalised
for running an old release. Maybe I misunderstood.
</p>

<p>
I tried Arch but found it difficult to get information. The idea is
possibly ok, but I really felt isolated.
</p>

<p>
LG readers may be aware of my History files, records of what I do on
the machines I administer. Here's a note from the day I installed
FreeBSD:
</p>

<pre>
	The documentation is excellent, by the way.
</pre>

<p>
And that probably says it all. I dare say I encountered the same
problems with FreeBSD that I did with Arch. But, with FreeBSD I was
able to get answers.
</p>

<p>
I hope to find the source of a really old rev of emacs and build it.
And keep it forever. Because rolling your own is encouraged with
FreeBSD.
</p>

<p>
That's not to say I've abandoned Linux altogether. Recently I had
power-supply problems with this machine. After I had replaced the
power supply, the machine wouldn't boot. I tried running live FreeBSD
off a CD, but could not get an environment which would allow me to
examine the disks.
</p>

<p>
I booted a live Fedora and soon had things under control.
</p>

<p>
I've got KVM/QEMU working under FreeBSD. My next step might be to take
my Fedora 5 machine and virtualise it. I've already got a virtual XP
(which I've not returned to after proving I could do it), an Arch, a
later rev of FreeBSD. And the first Linux I ever ran, a Slackware from
1995.
</p>


<h3>Some Random Observations</h3>

<p>
FreeBSD is comfortable with ext2/ext3/ext4 but my Fedora 10 was not
as comfortable with ufs. When everything is running fine, these things
may be much of a muchness. When it comes to recovery, be careful what
you wish for. I could get access to some of my ufs slices from Fedora
10 - well, actually, only 1 - but not the rest. It's not normally a
consideration, but perhaps it ought to be.
</p>

<p>
A similar argument could, perhaps, be applied to other less common or
more refined file systems: Reiser, xfs, zfs, LVM. In fact, some time
back, I had similar problems with LVM.
</p>


<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
No platform is perfect. The best that I can hope for is a platform
which is a reasonably good fit, particularly in the style in which it
operates. I had come to the conclusion that Fedora was getting too
concerned with look and feel and had consigned functionality to the
status of second-class citizen.
</p>

<p>
I think FreeBSD provides me with a comfortable environment for
keyboard, video, mouse and audio. For anything else, there are virtual
machines.
</p>

<p>
From a conversation I had yesterday with a man in his 80s that I met on
the street; all this in a slow, unhurried Southern accent.
</p>

<p>
  I used to work f' the Forestry Service, y'know. A man there - he must
  be dead b'now - tole me once: "Never hire a man t'do a job o'work for
  you who eats salt herrin' for breakfast, rolls his own cig'rettes, er
  wears a straw hat. Reason bein', he's either chasin' his hat down th'
  road, rollin' a cig'rette, er lookin' fer a drink o'water!"
