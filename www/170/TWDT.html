Hello everyone!
</p>

<p>
Im looking for a multi-process CPU benchmark to be run on linux (CLI
is even better), as I need to test how well a kerrighed cluster is
running. Anyone know of any of those programs?
</p>

<p>
Thanks
Deividson

Hello gurus,
</p>

<p>
I run a diskless, keyboard-less pc that boots into X11 (just plain twm 
as a window manager). The X clients I run remotedly, on a "database 
server". When someone switches off the Xserver PC (i.e. flips that big 
red switch), the X clients aren't killed - they remain on the "database 
server" forever (or at least 24 hours, that's for me the same as 
"forever"). Is there something that I could to to force them to die 
automa[t|g]ically?
</p>

<p>
Thanks in advance,
Petr

<h3>Ubuntu boot problems</h3>

</p>

<p>
Earlier today, I had a problem with my almost-brand-new Ubuntu 9.10
install: my netbook suddenly stopped booting. Going into "rescue" mode
showed that it was failing to mount the root device - to be precise, it
couldn't mount /dev/disk/by-uuid/cd4efbe9-9731-40a5-9878-06deff19af06
(normally, a link to "/dev/sda1") on '/'. When the system finally timed
out and dropped me into the "initramfs" environment/prompt, I did an
"ls" of /dev/disk/by-uuid - which showed that the link didn't exist.
Yoiks... had my hard drive failed???
</p>

<p>
I was quickly comforted by the existence of another device in there, one
that pointed to /dev/sda5, a swap partition on the same drive, but that
could still have meant damage to the partition table. I tried a few
things, none of which worked (i.e., rebooting the system would always
bring me back to the same point)... until I decided to create the
appropriate symlink in the above directory - i.e.,
</p>

<pre>
cd /dev/disk/by-uuid
ln -s ../../sda1 cd4efbe9-9731-40a5-9878-06deff19af06
</pre>

<p>
and exit "initramfs". The system locked up when it tried to boot
further, but when I rebooted, it gave me a login console; I remounted
'/' as 'read/write', then ran "dpkg-reconfigure -plow ubuntu-desktop",
the "one-size-fits-all" solution for Ubuntu "GUI fails to start"
problems, and the problem was over.
</p>

<p>
NOW, Cometh The REALLY Big Problem.
</p>

<p>
1) What would cause a device in /dev/disk/by-uuid to disappear? Frankly,
the fact that it did scares the bejeebers out of me. That <em>shouldn't</em>
happen randomly - and the only system-related stuff that I did this
morning was installing a few packages (several flavors of window manager
so I could experiment with the Ubuntu WM switcher.) I had also rebooted
the system a number of times this morning (shutting it down so I could
take it off the boat and to my favorite coffee shop, etc.) so I knew
that it was fine up until then.
</p>

<p>
2) Why in the hell did changing anything in the "initramfs" environment
- i.e., creating that symlink - actually affect anything? Isn't
"initramfs", as indicated by the 'ram' part, purely temporary?
</p>

<p>
3) What would be an actual solution to this kind of thing? My approach
was based on knowing about the boot process, etc., but it was part
guesswork, part magical hand-waving, and a huge amount of luck. I
<em>still</em> don't know what really happened, or what actually fixed the
problem.
</p>

<p>
I'd be grateful for any insights offered.
</p>

<h3>Industrial PC booting issues</h3>

<p>
Allmighty TAG!
</p>

<p>
first, sorry for a longish post. I'm almost at my wit's end.
</p>

<p>
I have an industrial PC, equipped with a touch screen and "VIA Nehemiah"
CPU (that behaves like i386). The PC has no fan, no keyboard, no 
harddisk, nor flash drive - only ethernet card. It boots via PXE from my 
database server. The /proc/meminfo on the PC says, that the PC has 
MemTotal: 452060 kB. I'm booting the "thinstation" 
(<a href='http://thinstation.sourceforge.net'>http://thinstation.sourceforge.net</a>) with kernel 2.6.21.1. The PC uses 
ramdisk. I boot Xorg with twm window manager. Then I start client of the 
"Opera" browser on my database server and "-display" it on the X server 
on the PC. This setup has worked flawlessly for a couple of months.
</p>

<p>
Then my end-users came with complains, that the PC doesn't boot anymore
after flipping the mains switch. For the moment, I have found following:
</p>

<p>
1. The PC sometimes doesn't boot at all. The boot process stops with
the message:
</p>

<pre>
   Uncompressing linux... OK, booting the kernel.
</pre>

<p>
...and that's all. Usually, when I switch the PC again off and on, it 
boots OK, I mean I don't change anything, just flip that big button.
</p>

<p>
2. When it really <strong>does</strong> boot all the way into X, the opera browser 
isn't able to start properly. I tried to investigate further the matter. 
I modified the setup, now I'm booting only into X+twm. This works.
</p>

<p>
Now I tried to run following test on my database server:
</p>

<pre>
    xlogo -display &lt;ip_address_of_the_pc&gt;:0
</pre>

<p>
This works, the X logo is displayed on the screen of the PC.
</p>

<p>
Now I tried this test on the database server:
</p>

<pre>
    xterm -display &lt;ip_address_of_the_pc&gt;:0
</pre>

<p>
Result is this error message on the client side (i.e. on the database 
server):
</p>

<pre>
   xterm:  fatal IO error 104 (Connection reset by peer) or KillClient 
on X server "192.168.100.171:0.0"
</pre>

<p>
...and the X server on the PC is really killed (I can't find him anymore 
in the process list on the PC).
</p>

<p>
This is, what I have found in the /var/log/boot.log on the PC:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
------------ /var/log/boot.log starts here ----------------------------
X connection to :0.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).
/etc/init.d/twm: /etc/init.d/twm: 184: xwChoice: not found
twm_startup
twm:  unable to open display ":0.0"
------------ /var/log/boot.log ends here ------------------------------
</pre>

<p>
...and this is from /var/log/messages on the PC:

<h3>2-cent Tip: using class of characters in grep</h3>
<p>
<b><p>

</p>

<p>
How do you catch a range or group of characters when using grep? Of
course you can always do something like:
<pre>
$ grep -E '[a-z]+' ./test.txt
</pre>
to show lines in file "test.txt" that contain at least single
character between 'a' to z in lower case.
</p>

<p>
But there is other way (and hopefully more intuitive...for some
people). Let's do something like above, but the other way around. Tell
grep to show the name of text files that doesn't contain upper case
characters
<pre>
$ grep -E -v -l '[[:upper:]]+' ./*
</pre>
Here, upper is another way of saying [A-Z]. Note the usage of double
brackets! I got trapped once, thinking that I should only use single
bracket and wonder why it didn't work....
</p>

<p>
There are more classes you can use. Check "info grep" in section 5.1
"Character class"

<p>
Obviously, this isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea, but it would
annoy me if I ever have to repeat this, or had to tell someone 'oh, I
did that once, but forgot the details'.
</p>

<p>
Festival is a fairly well known as a speech synthesiser, but it's
generally better suited as a development platform for voice and
language data; Flite is a lightweight TTS system that uses data
developed with Festival. Flite has some scripts to help the process,
but they're either undocumented or misleadingly documented.
</p>

<p>
One such script is tools/make_phoneset.scm: the function synopsis
gives 'phonesettoC name phonesetdef ODIR', but the actual synopsis is
'phonesettoC name phonesetdef silence ODIR', where 'name', 'silence'
and 'ODIR' are strings, 'phonesetdef' is a Lisp list of features. I
don't know Scheme or Lisp all that well, so I eventually got it to
work by copying the phoneset to a file like this (myphones.scm):
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
(phonesettoC "my_phoneset"
'(defPhoneSet
  my_phoneset
  ;;;  Phone Features
  (
   (vc + -)
   (vlng s l d a 0)
   (vheight 1 2 3 -)
   (vfront 1 2 3 -)
   (vrnd + -)
   (ctype s f a n l t 0)
   (cplace l a p b d v 0)
   (cvox + -)
   )
 
  (
   (#  - 0 - - - 0 0 -) ;this is the 'silence' phonedef
   (a  + l 3 2 - 0 0 -)
   ; snip
  )
)
 
(PhoneSet.silences "#")
 "outdir")
</pre>

<p>
and converting it with:
mkdir outdir &amp;&amp; festival $FLITEDIR/tools/make_phoneset.scm myphones.scm
</p>

<p>
leaves a C file suitable for use with Flite in outdir
</p>

<p>
1 down, ~12 scripts left to figure out...

If you have an iso that fails checksum and a torrent is available,
rtorrent is a pretty good way to fix it.
</p>

<p>
cd /path/to/ubuntu910.iso &amp;&amp; rtorrent <a href='http://url/for/ubuntu910.iso.torrent'>http://url/for/ubuntu910.iso.torrent</a>
</p>

<p>
The reason torrent is good for this is that it checksums each block and
fetches only the blocks required.

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">New Novell Collaboration Platform for E2.0 Links to Google Wave</h3>

<p>In early November, Novell announced its real-time collaboration
platform, Novell Pulse. Pulse combines e-mail, document authoring, and
social messaging tools with robust security and management
capabilities.</p>

<p>Novell Pulse was demonstrated on November 4, 2009, during the
"Integrating Google Wave into the Enterprise" keynote at Enterprise 2.0 in
San Francisco.  Beta availability will be early 2010, followed by 
general availability in the first half of 2010 via cloud deployment. Novell
Pulse interacts with Google Wave through Wave's federation protocol,
letting Novell Pulse users communicate in real-time with users on any
other Wave provider.</p>

<p>"We designed Google Wave and its open federation protocol to help
people collaborate and communicate more efficiently", said Lars
Rasmussen, software engineering manager for Google Wave. "We are very
excited to see Novell supporting Wave federation in its innovative
Novell Pulse product."</p>

<p>"Security and identity management remain top concerns for 
companies considering real-time social solutions", said Caroline Dangson,
analyst at IDC.  "Novell has a proven record in security and identity

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">ECMA Proposes Revised JavaScript Standard</h3>

<p>The future of JavaScript - at least for the next 3 years - will be
determined by ECMA's General Assembly in early December.  At that
time, ECMA's membership will vote on the ECMAScript 3.1 proposal, a
technology compromise from ECMA's contentious Technical Committee 39.</p>

<p>Factions within TC39 worked on JavaScript revision for several years,
but AJAX's success upped the stakes for v. 4.0 - which is far from
complete - so a smaller set of improvements went into the 3.1 draft.
However, both Adobe and IBM are dissatisfied, and are lobbying to defeat
it.</p>

<p>Doug Crockford, who represents Yahoo on TC39, delivered a keynote on
the draft spec and its importance recently, at QCon in San Francisco.
Doug explained that the sudden explosion in use of JavaScript (formally
called ECMAScript) - both upped the stakes on revisions and intensified
risks.  One example is an on-going problem with representing decimal
numbers.   Original JavaScript can represent small and large integers,
but often gives erroneous results for decimal arithmetic (e.g., 0.1 +
0.2 != 0.3).</p>

<p>IBM has proposed a revision ("754-r") to the 1970s-era IEEE 754 spec
for floating point processing.  However, this change would result in
significant performance penalties on arithmetic unless implemented in
silicon, which IBM has already done in Power CPUs.  Speaking with
<em>Linux Gazette</em>, Doug said IBM may be attempting to increase the
value of its Power servers, or may be encouraging Intel to modify its own
chips.</p>

<p>The committee is also discussing a longer-term set of changes to
JavaScript / ECMAScript, with a working title of Harmony. Some additions
could include enhanced functions and inclusion of a standard crypto
library.  However, many of those changes could break existing Web
applications; implementations will have to do as little damage as
possible.</p>

<h2>Distro News</h2>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Fedora 12 Released in November</h3>
<p>The Fedora Project, Red Hat's community-supported open source group,
announced availability of Fedora 12, the latest version of its free,
open-source distribution.  The new release includes robust features for
desktop users, administrators, developers, and open source enthusiasts.
Enhancements include next-generation Ogg Theora video, virtualization
improvements, and new capabilities for NetworkManager.  </p>

<p>"Fedora always tries to include cutting-edge features in its
distribution.  We believe Fedora 12 stays true to this pattern, packing
a lot of punch across its feature set", said Paul Frields, Fedora Project
Leader at Red Hat. "Our community of global contributors continues to
expand, with 25 percent growth in Fedora Accounts since 
Fedora 11. We've also seen more than 2.3 million installations of Fedora
11 thus far, a 20 percent increase over earlier releases."</p>

<p>Notable feature enhancements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Theora 1.1, enhancing free video's quality to better meet user
expectations. Ogg Theora video delivers crisp, vibrant media, letting
users stream and download high-definition video, while using 100 percent
free and open software, codecs, and formats.</li>
<li>NetworkManager, a network configuration tool, has been improved to
make it easier for users to be online using mobile broadband, to
configure servers, and to handle other special situations.</li>
<li>Virtualization improvements include better virtual disk performance
and storage discovery, hot changes for virtual network interfaces,
reduced memory consumption, and modern network booting infrastructure.
</li>

</ul>

<p>Other improvements are PackageKit command-line and browser plugins;
better file compression; libguestfs, which lets administrators work
directly with virtual guest machine disk images without booting those
guests; SystemTap 1.0, to help developers trace and gather information
for writing and debugging programs, as well as integration with the
widely-used Eclipse IDE; and NetBeans 6.7.1.</p>

<p>The Fedora community held fifteen Fedora Activity Day events across
the globe in 2009. These are mini-conferences where Fedora experts work
on a specific set of tasks, ranging from developing new features and Web
applications to showing contributors how to get involved by working on
simple tasks.  During that same period, the Project also held three
Fedora Users and Developers Conferences (FUDCons), in Boston, Porto
Alegre, and Berlin.</p>

<p>The next FUDCon is scheduled for December 5 - 7, 2009, in Toronto,
Ontario, Canada. For more information about FUDCon Toronto 2009, visit <a

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">New Knoppix 6.2 Released</h3>

<p>"Microknoppix" is a complete rewrite of the Knoppix boot system from 
version 6.0 and up, with the following features: </p>

<ol>
<li>High compatibility with its Debian base: Aside from 
configuration files, nothing gets changed in Debian's standard 
installation.
<li>Accelerated boot procedure: Independently from the usual SysV 
bootscripts, multiple tasks of system initialization are run in 
parallel, so the user reaches an interactive desktop very quickly.
<li>LXDE, a very slim and fast desktop with short start time and 
low resource requirements, is the desktop environment. Because of 
its GTK2 base, LXDE works together nicely with screenreader Orca.
<li>Installed software in this first CD version has been greatly 
reduced, so that custom CD remasters are again possible. The 
DVD edition offers KDE4 and GNOME, with many applications
originating from these popular desktops.
<li>Network configuration is handled by NetworkManager with 
nm-applet in graphics mode, and by textual GUIs in text mode 
(compatible with Debian's /etc/network/interfaces specification).
<li>A persistent image for saving personal settings, and additionally 
installed programs, KNOPPIX/knoppix-data.img, is supported on the 
boot device, optionally encrypted using 256-bit AES. In general, 
Knoppix recommends live system installation on flash. </ol>

<p>The current 6.2 release has been completely updated from Debian
"Lenny".</p>

<p>Also included is A.D.R.I.A.N.E. (Audio Desktop Reference Implementation
And Networking Environment), a talking menu system, which is supposed to
make work and Internet access easier for computer beginners.</p>

<p>The current public 6.2 beta (CD or DVD) is available 
in different variants at the Knoppix Mirrors Web site 
(<a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix-mirrors/index-en.html">http://www.knopper.net/knoppix-mirrors/index-en.html</a>).</p>

<h2>Software and Product News</h2>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Intalio Announces Jetty 7</h3>
<p>Intalio, Inc., has released Jetty 7, a lightweight open source
Java application server. The new release includes features 
to extend Jetty's reach into mission-critical environments, and 
support deployment in cloud computing.</p>

<p>Jetty 7 brings performance optimizations to enable rich Web
applications. Thanks to small memory footprint, Jetty has become the
most popular app server for embedding into other open source projects,
including ActiveMQ, Alfresco, Equinox, Felix, FUSE, Geronimo,
GigaSpaces, JRuby, Liferay, Maven, Nuxeo, OFBiz, and Tungsten. Jetty is
also the standard Java app server in cloud computing services, such as
Google's AppEngine and Web Toolkit, Yahoo's Hadoop and Zimbra, and
Eucalytpus.</p>

<p>This is the first Jetty release developed in partnership with
Eclipse.org, where the codebase has gone through IP auditing, dual
licensing, and improved packaging for such things as OSGi integration. 
In addition, Jetty 7 makes some of the key servlet 3.0 features, such as
asynchronous transactions and fragments, available in a servlet 2.5
container.</p>

<p>Jetty provides both asynchronous HTTP server and asynchronous HTTP
client, thereby supporting both ends of protocols such as Bayeux, XMPP,
and Google Wave, that are critical to cloud computing &mdash; and can be
embedded in small and mobile devices:  Today, Jetty runs on J2ME and
Google Android, and is powering new smartphones from Verizon and other
manufacturers soon to start production.</p>

<p>"Jetty 7 significantly reorganizes packaging and jars, and makes 
fundamental improvements to the engine's underlying infrastructure",
said Adam Lieber, General Manager at IntalioWorks.</p>

<p>The Jetty distribution is available via <a
href="http://eclipse.org/jetty">http://eclipse.org/jetty</a> under 
the Apache 2.0 or Eclipse 1.0 licenses, and covered by the
Eclipse Foundation Software User Agreement. The distribution furnishes
core functionality of HTTP server, servlet container, and HTTP client.

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">One Stop Systems Introduces First GPU/SSD 2U Server</h3>
<p>One Stop Systems, Inc. (OSS), a manufacturer of computer modules and
systems, announced the first server to integrate an AMD-based
motherboard featuring dual "Istanbul" processors and eight GPU boards
providing 10 TeraFLOPS computing power. The server can also accommodate
a combination of GPU boards and SSD (solid state drive) boards.</p>

<p>Four GPU boards and four 640GB SSD boards provides 5TFLOPS GPU
processing and 2.5TB memory, in addition to the dual six-core CPUs'
computing power. In addition, OSS has packed even more storage capacity
into the system, with four hot-swappable hard disk drives and an internal
RAID controller. The server is powered by dual, redundant 1,500 watt
power supplies and housed in a 2U-high chassis tailored for rigorous
environmental demands.</p>
 
<p>"The Integrated GPU Server represents a combination of One Stop
Systems's areas of expertise; designing and manufacturing
rugged, rackmount computers and PCI Express design", said Steve Cooper,
CEO. "At the heart of this server is the dual Opteron processor board.
With a motherboard based on the SHBe (System Host Board Express) form
factor for industrial computing, it's built for long-life service.
Then, we employed multiple PCIe switches to provide the 80Gb/s bandwidth
to each slot. Using the latest AMD-based GPU boards, we produce
greater than 10 TFLOPS  of computing power. The system is then powered
by dual redundant 1,500 watt power supplies with ample cooling."</p>

<p>The system supports two six-core Opteron processors and up to 96GB
DRAM in six DDR2 DIMM slots, plus dual gigabit Ethernet ports, four USB,
PCI Express 2.0, and ATI Radeon graphics. It supports four SATAII/SAS
drives, and includes an LSI RAID controller.</p>

<p>The system can be configured to provide eight PCIe x16 Gen 2 slots for 
single-wide I/O cards, or four slots for double-wide cards. While GPUs 
offer the greatest amount of compute power, customers who want to mix 
other cards in the system can do so. A common example is to install 
two or four GPU boards with four SSD (solid state drive) boards.</p>

<h1>How to Start a Linux User Group</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/crosby.html">Dafydd Crosby</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<p>
The Linux User Group (also known as a LUG) has been one of the
cornerstones of Linux advocacy ever since its first inception. Bringing
together local Linux lovers, it is the grassroots of Linux - where
neighbours and other townfolks can sit around a table and discuss the best
way to compile the kernel for their machines, or how to get their Slackware
network devices going again. It is also a high bandwidth way to share
knowledge - if you've ever heard of the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet">sneaker-net</a>, you'll
appreciate the advantages of being in a room full of real people who share
your interest in open-source software. 
</p>

<p>
Chances are good that you are already in an area that has a local LUG,
and a simple search online should be able to confirm it. However, if you happen
to be in an area where none currently exists, the process of actually
setting up a group is very easy.<a id="crosby.html_1_back"></a><a href="#crosby.html_1">[1]</a>
</p>

<h3>Setting up a group</h3>

<p>
Your group will be ready to go once you've got a basic framework in place:


<ul> 

<li><strong>A Web site</strong> - This part is easier to do
than ever before. <a href="http://www.linux.com">Linux.com</a> allows you
to set up a group page in a simple, straight-forward fashion. It's a lot
like a social network, so other members can easily join and keep informed
of events.</li> 

<li><strong>A mailing list</strong> - This is the pulse of
your group, where interested people can ask questions and swap info. With a
simple mailing list, you can coordinate your efforts with other group
members, discuss future meeting ideas, and keep the blood flowing in the
group.</li> 

<li><strong>A meeting spot</strong> - Find a spot (preferably a
public one) that is quiet enough to allow speakers and presentations, but
large enough to hold however large your group is. Location is key! Some
good spots that are often free (or very cheap) are schools and university
campuses. You'll want an Internet connection and power sockets, so keep
that in mind when looking for a place.</li> 

</ul>
</p>

<p>
The first two items shouldn't take longer than a couple of hours to set
up, and will only need minimal maintenance after that. The meeting spot
will take a little longer, but, with the collective effort of your group
(communicating through the mailing list) it shouldn't be too difficult.
</p>

<p>
Now it's just a matter of getting a few people interested. It's alright
if the first members are your friends - that's how the ball gets rolling!
The LUG will take on a life of its own, once you have outsiders coming in,
so find ways of getting the word out around town. Postering universities
and cafes (be sure to ask permission) is a great way to get other
like-minded folks to check out your Web site and meetings. 
</p>

<h3>Having fun and keeping the LUG interesting</h3>

<p>
Keeping things interesting isn't something that is easily done
spontaneously, so you'll want to keep note of ideas for presentations and
events for future use. It's essential to keep the creative pump primed,
otherwise it will be hard keeping members coming to meetings. 
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, your members will be a great resource in letting you know
what they're interested in - after all, they want to have fun, too! When
someone is bursting with passion over the new distro he or she just installed,
that enthusiasm can be infectious. Encourage this passion, because these
people will help keep the group moving along. 
</p>

<p>
Occasionally, there's the meeting where a talk or the scheduling has
fallen through. This is a great time to be generating ideas and keeping
those creative juices flowing. Keeping the meet-ups consistently fun and
engaging will keep everyone showing up time and time again. 
</p>

<h3>Reaching out to the community</h3>

<p>
The greatest benefits of a LUG is what it can do for the local community.
It can be donating Linux-loaded machines to non-profit groups, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_User_Group#Installfests">install-fests</a>
to help people start using Linux, or connecting people from different
technology groups who wouldn't normally interact. 
</p>

<p>
One of the beauties of Linux and F/OSS software is that there are many
ways that people from different technology backgrounds and groups can
contribute. Java programmers, hardware hackers, and theoretical scientists
can all sit at the same table and meet common ground at a LUG, when given a
good topic to think over. Therefore, keep connected with all the local
groups which could potentially have a few Linux users (or future Linux
users). 
</p>

<h3>The long road ahead</h3>

<p>
A lot of groups get side-tracked by things like dues, group bylaws, and
other organizational structures that are necessary to keep the group viable
year-to-year. Transparency is key, but don't let the meetings get bogged
down in administrative matters - keep it short, keep it simple, and keep it
civil. If an issue can be relegated to the mailing list, that's the best
spot for it. That way everyone has a chance to speak up, and it's all
available on the public record. 
</p>

<p>
Starting a LUG is a rewarding experience, and can be a great experience
for everyone involved. With so many successful groups running now, it has
never been easier to start your own, so start organizing one today!

My rule of thumb in the LUG HOWTO, and <a
href="http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Linux_PR/newlug.html">other writings</a> 
on the subject, is that a successful LUG seems to need a core of at least
four active members -- who need not be particularly knowledgeable.  
As you say, not a lot else is strictly necesssary.

<h1>What's up with Google Public DNS?</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/moen.html">Rick Moen</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
A few days ago, out of nowhere, Google, Inc. announced that it was
offering a new free-of-charge service to the public: robust recursive
DNS nameservice from highly memorable IP addresses 8.8.8.8 and
8.8.4.4, with extremely fast responses courtesy of anycast IP
redirection to send the query to the closest network cluster for that 
service (like what Akamai and similar CDNs do for Web content).  
</p>

<p>
This service needs some pretty considerable funding for hardware and
bandwidth, especially if its usage scales upwards as Google intends.
Reportedly, it also developed a totally new recursive-only nameserver
package, name not disclosed, in-house. According to my somewhat casual
research, the software was probably written by Google developer Paul S.
R. Chisholm, who doesn't seem to have any prior record of writing such
software.
</p>

<p>
That is remarkable, to begin with, because recursive nameservers are
notoriously difficult to write correctly, such that the history of open
source DNS servers is littered with failed recursive-nameserver
projects.  (By contrast, the other types, authoritative, iterative, and
forwarder, are much easier to write.  Please see my separate article, "<a
href="lan.html">The Village of Lan, A Networking Fairy Tale</a>", about the
differences.)
</p>

<p>
The obvious question is, what's in it for Google? At first, I guessed
it to be a research/prestige project, an opportunity for Chisholm
and other technical staff to try their hand at managing major network
infrastructure.  It also already serves as DNS foundation for some
internal Google services, such as the WiFi network for visitors to the
Google campus, and for the free public WiFi network Google offers to
residents of Mountain View, California, near its headquarters.  
That didn't really seem sufficient to justify the outlay required in
expenses and technical resources, though.
</p>

<p>
My friend Don Marti suggested an alternative idea that sounds more
promising:  It's a "spamtenna", a distributed data-collection system that
classifies DNS clients: those doing high numbers of DNS lookups of
known spam-related hostnames, and regular DNS clients that don't.  Then,
other hostnames resolved more often by the first group than the second
are noted as also probably spam-involved.  Google can use that
database of suspect hostnames in anti-spam service, to aid GMail
antispam, etc., a usage model consistent with Google's privacy policy.
</p>

<p>
Is Public DNS an attractive offering? Does it have privacy problems? Yes and
no.  
</p>

<p>
For most people, probably even most <em>Linux Gazette</em> readers, 
DNS is just something automatically taken care of, which means it tends
to get referred out to the local ISP's recursive nameservers.  I 
shouldn't be unkind to ISPs, who do their best, but ISP recursive
servers tend to be pretty bad.  In general, they have
spotty performance, often play tricks such as redirecting queries or 
ignoring time-to-live timeouts on DNS data, are security liabilities (on
account of pervasive "cache poisoning" by malign parties elsewhere on
the Internet), and of course are an obvious point where data collects
about all of your DNS queries -- what you and your users ask about, and
what is replied.  Of course, your ISP already sees all all your incoming
and outgoing packets -- but, unlike Google, are contractually obliged to
deal with you in good faith and look after your interests.
</p>

<p>
That is one of the problems with Google's Public DNS offering, and,
likewise, with its other free-of-charge services such as GMail (and, for
that matter, with pretty much any unpaid "Web 2.0" service):  Any
contractual commitment to users is either non-existent or extremely weak.
They say they have a strong privacy policy, with information about which of
your IP addresses queried their servers being erased after 24-48 hours, but
the fact is that you're just not a paying customer, so policies don't mean
much, completely aside from the possibility of them being changed on a
whim.
</p>

<p>
Another problem I've already alluded to:  What software does it use, and
is it reliable and correct?  Google is telling the public nothing about
that software, not even its name, except that it was developed in-house
and is not to be open source in the foreseeable future.  Most of the
really good recursive nameserver packages were developed as open source
(in part) to get the benefit of public debugging and patches.  The rest 
took a great deal of time and money to get right.
</p>

<p>
One common comparison is to David Ulevich's OpenDNS free recursive
service, which is competently run and keeps users away from
malware/phishing hostnames.  Unless you use the paid version, however, 
OpenDNS deliberately breaks Internet standards to return the IP of its
advertising Web server whenever the correct answer is "host not found" 
(what is called NXDOMAIN in DNS jargon).  Google Public DNS doesn't
suffer the latter problem.
</p>
 
<p>
A third alternative:  None of the above.  Run your own recursive
nameserver.  For example, NLnet Labs's open-source Unbound is very easy
to set up, requires no maintenance or administration, takes only about
11 MB RAM, and runs on Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X.  It would be silly
to run such a network service on <em>every</em> machine:  Instead, run 
it on one of the machines of your home or office's LAN, and have all of
the machines' DNS client configurations -- /etc/resolv.conf on Linux
machines -- point to it.  That way, there's a single shared cache of
recently queried DNS data shared by everyone in the local network.
</p>

<p>(Note:  Most people have their machines' "resolv.conf" contents, along
with all other network settings, populated via DHCP from a local network
appliance or a similar place, and configure that to point clients' DNS to
the nameserver machine's IP.  For that reason, the nameserver machine
should be one to which you've assigned a static IP address, and left
running 24/7.</p>

<p>Hey, <a href="http://http://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a> wireless-router
firmware developers!  Make me happy and put Unbound into OpenWRT, rather
than just Dnsmasq, which is a mere forwarder, and Just Not Good Enough.
Dnsmasq forwarding to Unbound, however, would be really good, and 
putting recursive DNS in the same network appliance that hands out DHCP 
leases is the ideal solution for everyone.  Thanks!)
</p>

<p>
It seems that hardly anyone other than us networking geeks bothers to
have real, local nameservice of that sort -- a remarkable example of
selective blindness, given the much snappier network performance, and
greater security and control, that doing it locally gains you for almost
no effort at all.
</p>

<p>In fact, what's <em>really</em> perplexing is how many people, when I give
them the above suggestion, assume either that I must be exaggerating the
ease of running a recursive nameserver, or that "professional" options 
like their ISP, OpenDNS, or Google Public DNS must actually be faster
than running locally, or both.  Let's consider those:  (1) When I say
there's nothing to administer with recursive nameserver software, I mean
that quite literally.  You install the package, start the service, it
runs its cache by itself, and there are no controls (except to run it or
not). It's about as foolproof as network software can get.  (2) When 
your DNS nameserver is somewhere on the far side of your ISP uplink,
then all DNS queries and answers must traverse the Internet both 
ways, instead of making a local trip at ethernet speeds.  The only
real advantage a "professional" option has is that its cache 
will be already well stocked, hence higher percentage of cache hits 
relative to a local nameserver when the latter first starts, but then
there will be essentially no difference and the local service will
thereafter win because it's local.
</p>

<p>
Why outsource to anyone, when you can do a better job locally, at 
basically no cost in effort?

<h3>Late Addendum:  The Real World Sends Rick a Memo</h3>

<p>
This might be you:  You have one or more workstation or laptop on either a
small LAN or direct broadband (or dialup) connection.  You're (quite
rightly) grateful that all the gear you run gets dynamic IP configuration
via DHCP.  The only equipment you have drawing power on a 24x7 basis is
(maybe) your DSL modem or cable modem and cute little network gateway
and/or Wireless Access Point appliance (something like a Linksys WRT54G).
You don't have any "server" other than that.
</p>

<p>
Mea culpa:  Being one of those oddballs who literally run servers 
at home, I keep forgetting you folks exist; I really have no excuse.
</p>

<p>Shortly after I submitted the first version of this article to
<em>LG</em>, a friend on my local Linux user group mailing list reminded
me of the problem:  He'd followed my advice and installed Ubuntu's Unbound
package on his laptop, but then (astutely) guessed it wasn't being
sent queries, and asked me how to fix that.  His house had the usual
network gateway appliance, which (if typical) runs Dnsmasq on embedded Linux
to manage his Internet service, hand out DHCP leases on a private IP
network, and forward outbound DNS requests to his ISP nameserver.  
</p>

<p>
As I said above, it would be really nice, in such cases, to run a
recursive nameserver (and not just Dnsmasq) on the gateway appliance, 
forwarding queries to it rather than elsewhere.  That's beyond the scope
of my friend's immediate needs, however.  Also, I've only lately, in
playing with OpenWRT on a couple of actual WRT54G v.3 devices received
as gifts, realised how thin most such appliances' hardware is:  My units
have 16 MB total RAM, challenging even for RAM-thrifty Unbound.
</p>

<p>
My friend isn't likely to cobble together a static-IP server machine
just to run a recursive nameserver, so he went for the only alternative:
running such software locally, where the machine's own software can
reach it as IP 127.0.0.1 (localhost).  The obstacle, then, becomes DHCP,
which by design overwrites /etc/resolv.conf (the DNS client
configuration file) by default every time it gets a new IP lease,
including any "nameserver 127.0.0.1" lines.
</p>

<p>
The simple and elegant solution:  Uncomment the line "#prepend
domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;" that you'll find already present in
/etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf .  Result:  The local nameserver will be
tried first.  If it's unreachable for any reason, other nameserver 
IPs supplied by DHCP will be attempted in order until timeout.  This 
is probably exactly what people want.
</p>

<p>
(If, additionally, you want to make sure that your DHCP client never requests
additional "nameserver [IP]" entries from the DHCP server in the first 
place, just edit the "request" roster in /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf to 
remove item "domain-name-servers".)
</p>

<p>
Second alternative:  Install package "resolvconf" (a utility that aims
to mediate various other packages' attempts to rewrite /etc/resolv.conf), 
and add "nameserver 127.0.0.1" to /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head so
that this line always appears appears at the top of the file.  This is
pretty nearly the same as the first option.
</p>

<p>
Last, the time-honoured caveman-sysadmin solution:  "chattr +i
/etc/resolv.conf", i.e., setting the file's immutable bit (as the root
user) so that neither your DHCP client nor anything else can alter the
file until you remove that bit.  It's hackish and unsubtle, but worth
remembering for when only Smite with Immense Hammer solutions will
do.

<h1>The Village of Lan: A Networking Fairy Tale</h1>

</p>

<p>
<p>
There was a time, about a year ago, when I was trying to tell people
on a LUG mailing list why they should consider using a genuine,
full-service recursive nameserver on their local networks, rather 
than just the usual forwarders and such.  One of the leading lights of
that LUG countered with his own suggestion:  "Run a caching-only or
caching-mostly nameserver".  Argh!  People get so mislead by such 
really bad terminology.
</p>

<p>
The concept of a "caching" DNS nameserver really doesn't tell you
anything about what the nameserver really does.  <em>All</em>
nameservers cache; that's not a name that conveys useful
information.
</p>

<p>
What I needed, to clarify the matter, was a compelling and vivid 
metaphor, so I conjured one up.  Here's what I posted back to the LUG
mailing list, reproduced for the possible entertainment of <em>Linux
Gazette</em> readers:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Although it's true that some recursive-nameserver configurations are
(sloppily) referred to as "caching", e.g., by RHEL/Fedora/CentOS, that's
a really bad name for that function -- because caching is orthogonal to 
recursion.
</p>

<p>
Theoretically, you could write a nameserver that does recursive service
but doesn't cache its results.  (That would be a bit perverse, and I
don't know of any.)  Conversely, nameserver packages that cache but know
nothing about how to recurse and instead do less-helpful alternative
iterative service
<a href="http://www.inetdaemon.com/tutorials/internet/dns/iterative.shtml">iterative service</a>
are common: dnsmasq, pdnsd, etc.  
</p>

<p>
Last, it's also not unheard-of to create a really modest caching
nameserver package that doesn't do even <em>iterative</em> service of its own,
but is purely a forwarder that knows the IP of a <em>real</em> nameserver -- 
or leaves that job up to the machine's resolver library (DNS client). 
I believe dproxy and nscd would be good examples.
</p>

<p>
And, whether they cache or not (and pretty much <em>everything</em> caches
except OS client resolver libraries), nameservers that aren't
<em>just</em> forwarders offer either recursive or merely iterative
service, which makes a big difference.
</p>

<p>
I know it's not your fault, but terms like "caching-only" and
"caching-mostly" obscure the actual important bits.  Fortunately, I
think I've just figured out how to fully de-obfuscate the topic.  Here:
</p>


<p>
The mythical village of Lan has some talkative people (programs) in it.
Oddly, they spend most of their time talking about DNS data ;-&gt; , but
all have quirks about their respective conversational styles.
</p>


<ul>

<li>
<p>
   Larry, the local DNS library (the crummy BIND8-derived code bundled
   into GNU libc), is the guy with all the questions.  He's the guy 
   who goes around asking other people about DNS records.  Larry has 
   a really awful memory (no cache), so he ends up asking the same
   questions over and over.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
   Nick (nscd, the nameservice caching daemon) is a kid whom Larry
   has ride on his shoulders occasionally.  Although he doesn't 
   accept queries himself, exactly, he listens to answers Larry 
   gets from others, remembers them, and whispers them in Larry's
   ear when the forgetful old guy is about to go bother others about
   them yet again.  Larry's glad to carry Nick around, to help
   compensate for his memory problem.  On the downside, Nick's a
   bit sloppy and doesn't bother to commit to memory the data's
   spoiled-by dates.  (He doesn't cache TTLs.)
</p>

<p>
   (I hear that the Linux nscd implementation's rather severe fault of
   not caching TTLs is slated to soon be fixed.  Meanwhile, smart people
   don't use its host caching functions.)
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
   Frank is a forwarder (a copy of dproxy).  He's not really bright,
   but has a pretty good memory.  If you ask him a DNS question, he
   either says "Dunno, so I'll ask Ralph", or he says "Hey, someone
   asked me that just yesterday, and I got the answer via Ralph.
   Let's see if I still have the paper... yes.  Here's your IP (or
   other requested datum -- and you're in luck, as it still has 6
   days remaining in its TTL)."  Thus, he forwards all queries he 
   receives -- always to Ralph only, never anyone more suited to the 
   query -- and caches whatever Ralph tells him.  
</p>

<p>
   When Larry gets such answers, he might also seek some context
   information from Frank.  (Remember, Larry has sucky short-term
   memory.)  "Hey, Frank, thanks.  Is that answer something you know
   from your own knowledge?"  "No, man, it's just what I hear."
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
   Nils is an authoritative nameserver (running the "nsd" software), 
   charged ONLY with answering questions of the form "What is
   [foo].lanvillage.com?"  When Larry asks him such a question, he
   answers and adds that it <em>is</em> from his own knowledge (authoritative).
   If you ask him about anything outside lanvillage.com, he
   frowns and say "Dunno, man."
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
   Ralph is a recursive nameserver (an instance of PowerDNS 
   Recursor).  Ralph is a born researcher:  He doesn't have any
   DNS knowledge of his own (offers no authoritative service), but 
   absolutely lives for finding out what DNS data can be unearthed
   from guys in other villages.  If you ask him a DNS question, 
   he'll figure out whom to ask, go there regardless of where it
   takes him, if necessary chase around the state following leads,
   and only bother you when he has the final answer.  (This is 
   the "recursive" part.  Compare with the iterative approach,
   below.)  Like everyone else in this village except Larry, he
   has a good memory (caching).
</p>
   
<p>
   Let's say, Larry asks Ralph, "What's uncle-enzo.linuxmafia.com?"
   In the worst case, if Ralph is just back from vacation (has a
   depleted cache), Ralph goes off for a while, and says:  "I
   looked on my desk to see if the answer were there (in cache),
   but it wasn't.  So, I checked to see if answers to the question
   'Where are nameservers for the linuxmafia.com domain?' were there,
   but they weren't either.  So, I check to see if answers to the 
   question 'Where are nameservers for the .com top-level domain?'
   were there, but they weren't either.  So, I finally fell back
   on my Rolodex's list of 13 IP addresses of root nameservers, 
   picked one, and visited it.  I asked it where I can get answers
   to .com questions.  It gave me a list of .com nameserver IPs.
   I picked one, visited it, and asked who knows about linuxmafia.com
   DNS matters.  It gave me a list of linuxmafia.com IPs, I picked
   one, visited it, asked it where uncle-enzo.linuxmafia.com is,
   brought the answer back, and here y'are.  Oh, and I've made a 
   note who knows where .com information is, where specifically
   linuxmafia.com information is, and also where
   uncle-enzo.linuxmafia.com is, just in case I'm asked again."
</p>

<p>
   Larry's fond of Ralph, because Ralph does all the work and
   doesn't come back until he can give either the answer or
   "Sorry, this took too long", or "There's no such host", or 
   something similarly dispositive.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
   Dwayne is a nameserver offering iterative service only 
   (running dproxy).  You can get any DNS answer out of him
   <em>eventually</em>, but he's not willing to bounce around the state
   following leads.  A conversation with Dwayne is sort of 
   punctuated:<br>
   "Do you know where uncle-enzo.linuxmafia.com is?"  "No."<br>
   "Well, do you know who knows?"  "No."<br>
   "Well, do you know who knows where to find .com nameservers?" "No."<br>
   "Well, can you ask the root nameserver where to find .com
      nameservers?"  "OK."  [Gives list of 13.]<br>
   "Can you ask .com nameserver #1 who answers for linuxmafia.com?"
      "OK."  [Gets list of five nameserver IPs.]<br>
   "Can you ask linuxmafia.com nameserver #1 where
       uncle-enzo.linuxmafia.com is?"  "OK."  [Queries and gets answer.]
</p>

<p>
   Next time Dwayne is asked any of the first three questions, his
   answer is no longer "No", because he is able to answer from memory
   (cache).
</p>
   
<p>
   Notice that Dwayne, although not as helpful and resourceful as
   Ralph, is at least going about things a bit more intelligently
   than Frank does:  Dwayne is able to look up the chain of people
   outside to query (iteratively) to find the right person, whereas
   Frank's idea of research is always "Ask Ralph."
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
At the outskirts of the Village of Lan is a rickety rope-bridge to the
rest of the state.  (Think "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom", or 
"Samurai Jack and the Scotsman".)  All of Lan's commerce has to go over
that bridge (an analogy to, say, a SOHO network's overburdened DSL
line).  Frank or Dwayne's bouncing back and forth across that bridge 
continually gets to be a bit of a problem, because of bridge congestion.
Ralph's better for the village, because he tends to go out, wander
around the state, and then come back -- minimising traffic.  And all of
these guys with functional short-term recall (everyone but Larry)
is helping by avoiding unnecessary bridge crossings.
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
    On the far side of the (slow, rickety, congested) ropebridge is
    Ollie (the OpenDNS server).  Ollie is willing to do recursive
    service the way Ralph does, but instead of saying "I checked,
    and there is no such DNS datum" where that is the correct answer,
    it says "guide.opendns.com" (IP 208.67.219.132), which is the
    IP of a OpenDNS Web server, advertising-driven, that tries to 
    give you helpful Web results (plus ads) -- something that's 
    less than useful, and in fact downright harmful, if what's 
    attempting to use DNS isn't a Web browser.  (Gee, ever heard
    of e-mail, for example?)
</p>

<p>
    I don't know about you, but I think "That place doesn't exist"
    is a better answer than "guide.opendns.com, IP 208.67.219.132",
    when "That place doesn't exist" <em>is</em> in fact the objectively 
    correct answer.  Ollie says:
</p>

<code>
$ dig i-dont-exist.linuxmafia.com @resolver2.opendns.com +short<br>
208.67.219.132
</code>
 
<p>
    By contrast, my own nameserver gives the actually correct answer:
</p>

<code>
$ dig i-dont-exist.linuxmafia.com @ns1.linuxmafia.com +short<br>
$
</code>

<p>
    (Specifically, it says "NXDOMAIN", which means "That place doesn't 
    exist.")
</p>
</li>

</ul>


<p>
Getting back to Larry:  Larry can outsource all of his queries across
the rickety, thin, congested ropebridge to Ollie -- and spend time 
waiting for Ollie and watching him barge continually across it every
time there's a query -- and know that Ollie gives bullshit answers every
time the correct answer <em>should</em> be "That place doesn't exist."
</p>

<p>
Larry can use Dwayne's services -- something of an exercise in
frustration but better than nothing.  He can tap Frank, which is
<em>barely</em> better than nothing.  Or, he can use Ralph.
</p>

<p>
Regardless of whom he asks, he <em>can</em> let Nick ride on his shoulders and
serve as his aide-memoire -- with the drawback that Nick carelessly 
disregards something really, really important (TTLs).
</p>

<p>
Personally, if I were Larry, I'd give Frank, Dwayne, and Ollie a pass, 
dump Nick, and give Ralph a call.

<h1>A Quick Lookup Script</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/okopnik.html">Ben Okopnik</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
Over the years of using computers, as well as in the process of growing
older and more forgetful, I've discovered the value of having quick,
focused ways of accessing important information. As an example, I have a
password-protected, encrypted file containing my passwords and all the
information related to them (i.e., hostname, username, security questions,
etc.), as well as a script that allows me to look up the information and
safely edit it; I also have a quotations file that I've been assembling for the
last 20-plus years, and a script that looks up the quotations and lets me add
new ones easily. In this article, I'll show yet another, similar script -
one that lets me keep track of often-used commands and various tips and
tricks that I use in Linux, Solaris, and so on.
</p>

<p>
For those familiar with database terminology, this is a minimal version of
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a>
(create, read, update, and delete) interface, minus the 'delete' option -
as an old database administrator, I find even the thought of data deletion
distasteful, anyway. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> Updating is a
matter of adding a new entry with a distinct search string - and if you've added
something that you decide you don't need later, all you have to do is not look
it up.
</p>


<h3>Keeping shell scripts from blowing up</h3>
<p>
One of the things I've found out in writing and using this type of script
is that there are pitfalls everywhere: any time you write something that
takes human-readable information and tries to parse it, you're going to run
into interface problems. Not only are the data items themselves suspect -
although that's not an issue in this case, where the information is just a
textual reminder - but also the user interaction with the script has edge
cases all over the place. As a result, 99% of this script is tests for
wrong actions taken by the user; the actual basic function of the script is
only about a dozen lines. The most amusing part of how things can break is
what you get after a while of not using the script and forgetting its
quirks: even I, its author, have managed to crash it on occasion! These
were always followed by half-amused, half-frustrated muttered curses and
fixes - until there wasn't anything left to fix (at least, based on the
problems that I could stumble across, find, imagine, or create.) As always,
I'd appreciate feedback, if anyone discovers a problem I haven't found!  
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>
On my system, the script is simply called 'n' - as I recall, I was
originally thinking of 'note' at the time that I named it. You can download
the latest version from <a href="http://okopnik.com/misc/n.gz">here</a>,
although <a href="misc/okopnik/n.gz">the one on the <em>LG</em>
server</a> isn't likely to go stale any time soon; this script hasn't
changed in quite a while.  
</p>

<p>
The run options for this script are deceptively simple, and can be seen by
invoking it with '-h' or '--help' as an argument:
</p>

<pre class="code">
ben@Jotunheim:~$ n -h

  n [-h|--help] | [section] [comment_search_string]
  
  If invoked without any argument, asks for the section and entry text to
  be added to the data file. If an argument is provided, and matches an
  existing section, that entire section is displayed; if two arguments
  are supplied, displays the first entry matching arg[2] in the section
  matching arg[1].

</pre>

<p>
Here's an example of adding a new entry:
</p>

<pre class="code">
ben@Jotunheim:~$ <strong>n</strong> 
Current sections:
awk
date
find
grep
mencoder
misc/miscellany/miscellaneous/general
mount
mp3/ogg/wav
mplayer
netstat
perl
shell/bash/ksh
sort
tcpdump
vi/vim
whois
Please enter the section to update or a new section name: <strong>perl</strong> 
Please type in the entry to be added to the 'perl' section:
<strong># Interactive Perl debugger</strong>
<strong>perl -d scriptname</strong>

ben@Jotunheim:~$ 
</pre>

<p>
Note that each entry requires a comment as its first line, and is
terminated by a blank line. The comment may be continued on the subsequent
lines, and is important: the default action for lookup (this may be changed
via a setting in the script) is to search only the comment when the script
looks for a specific entry in a given section. In other words, if I wanted
to find the above entry, I'd search for it as
</p>

<pre>
n perl debug
</pre>

<p>
This would return every entry in the 'perl' section that contained 'debug'
in the comment. If you wanted a "looser" type of search, that is, one which
would match either the comment or the content, you could change the
'search_opt' variable near the top of the script as described there.
Personally, I prefer the "comment-only" search - but, in this, I'm taking
advantage of my "Google-fu", that is, my ability to formulate a good search
query. The trick is that I also use the same thing, the same mode of thinking,
when I <em>create</em> the comment for an entry: I write comments that are
likely to match a sensibly-formed query even if I have absolutely no memory
of what I originally wrote.
</p>

<p>
So far, so simple - but that's not all there is to it. The tricky part is
the possibly-surprising features that are a natural consequence of the
tools that I used to write the script. That is, since I used the regex
features of 'sed' to locate the sections and the lines, the arguments
provided to the script can also be regexes - at least, if we take care to
protect them from shell expansion by using single quotes around them. With
those, this script becomes much more useful, since you can now look for
more arbitrary strings with more freedom. For example, if I remember that I
had an entry mentioning 'tr' in some section, I can tell 'n' to look for
'tr' in the comment, in all the sections:
</p>

<pre class="code">
n '.*' tr
</pre>

<p>
However, if the above search comes back with too many answers (as it will,
since '<strong>tr</strong>ailing', 'ma<strong>tr</strong>ix',
'con<strong>tr</strong>ol', and so on will all match), I can tell 'n' to
look for  'tr' as a <em>word</em> - i.e., a string surrounded by
non-alphanumeric characters:

<pre class="code"> n '.*' '\&lt;tr\&gt;' </pre>

<p>
This returns only the match I was looking for.
</p>

<p>
I can also look for entries in more than one section at once, at least if I
remember to use 'sed'-style regular expressions:
</p> 

<pre class="code">
n 'perl\|shell' debug
</pre>

<p>
This would search for any entry that has 'debug' in the comments, in both
the 'perl' and 'shell' sections.
</p>

<p>
This can also go the other way:
</p>

<pre class="code">
n perl 'text\|binary'
</pre>

<p>
Or even:
</p>

<pre class="code">
n 'awk\|perl' 'check\|test'
</pre>

<p>
One of the convenient options, when creating a new section, is to use more
than one name for it - that is, there may be more than one section name
that would make sense to me when I'm thinking of looking it up. E.g., for
shell scripting tips and tricks, I might think of the word 'shell' - but I
might also think of 'bash', 'ksh', or even 'sh' first. (Note that case
isn't an issue: 'n' ignores it when looking up section names.) What to do?
Actually, this is quite easy: 'n' allows for multiple names for a given
section as long as they are separate words, meaning that they are delimited
by any non-alphanumeric character except an underscore. So, if you name a
section 'KSH/sh/Bash/shell/script/scripting', any one of these specified as
a section name will search in the right place. Better yet, when you add a
new entry, specifying any of the above will add it in the right place.
</p>

<p>
Since the data is kept in a plain text file, you can always edit it if you
make a mistake. (The name and the location of the file, '~/.linux_notes',
is defined at the top of the script, and each user on a system can have one
of their own - or you could all share one.) Just make sure to maintain the
format, which is a simple one: section names start with '###' at the
beginning of the line, comments start with a single '#', and entries and
sections are separated by blank lines.  If you do manage to mess it up
somehow, it's not a big deal - since the file is processed line by line,
every entry stands on its own, and, given the design of the script,
processing is fairly robust. (E.g., multiple blank lines are fine; using
multiple hashes in front of comments would be OK; even leaving out blank
lines between entries would only result in the 'connected' entries being
returned together.) Even in the worst case, the output is still usable and
readable, and any necessary fixes are easy and obvious.
</p>

<h3>'n' as a template</h3>
<p>
One of the things I'd like the readers of <em>LG</em> to take home from
this article is the thought of 'n' as a starting place for their own future
development of this type of scripts. There are many occasions when you'll
want an "update and search interface", and this is a model I've used again
and again in those situations, with only minimal adjustments in all cases.
Since this script is released under the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License ">GPL</a>,
please feel free to tweak, improve, and rewrite it however you will. Again,
I'd appreciate being notified of any interesting improvements!

<h1>The things I do with digital photography on Linux</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/silva.html">Anderson Silva</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<p>
	  I've been a Linux user for almost fifteen years, and a digital
photography enthusiast for about ten. I bought my first digital camera back
in the late 90s while in college, which I used mostly for sharing pictures
of my family with my parents, who live in Brazil.  About five or six years
ago, I crossed the line from family photos to photography as a hobby. I
still cannot quite put into words exactly what photography means to me. All
I can say is that it is a form of art, and I find it beautiful and
inspiring. One of the things I have discovered throughout the years is that
a lot of photography is not about having the big, expensive equipment, but
being at the right place at the right time. The trick sometimes is
realizing that you are there.
</p>
    
<p>
	 That is when I started to carry my camera with me more often. I started
carrying it around with me everywhere I went; from going to work to getting
my car's oil changed at the local mechanic. I got so used to carrying it
around with me that I became a fan of compact, point-and-shoot cameras: I
could simply carry it in my jeans pocket, and pull it out anytime I thought
a moment was worth capturing. Believe it or not, I decided to purchase
a 'bigger, better' camera only just a couple of months ago, and I have finally made
the transition to a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_single-lens_reflex_camera" id=eo-9
title=DSLR>DSLR</a> camera, which has provided me with quite a bit of
flexibility to shoot photos -- yet, not as easy to drag around everywhere I
go, and that is why, even with my DSLR, I still keep my point-and-shoot
around. Even though it is rare, there have been occasions where I was
presented with a moment that I so desperately wanted to capture that I
even used my cellphone camera to do so. That is how desperate I get to take
photos. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
</p>
    
<p>
      In this article, I will attempt to share with you how I use Linux to
manage, edit, and share my photos. With that said, I will warn you right
now that I am not a professional photographer: it is something I enjoy,
something I am constantly learning about, yet what I do with my photos may
or may not be what a professional photographer would recommend.
</p>
    
<p>
      So, how does one start talking about all that? Since I am not quite
sure, I decided to just pick a starting point: equipment.
</p>
    
<h3>The Equipment</h3>
    
<p>
      Currently, I have three different devices to take photos. They are:
</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        iPhone 3G
      </li>
      <li>
        Samsung TL34hd (a.k.a. Samsung NV100HD outside the US)
      </li>
      <li>
        Canon EOS Rebel XSi w/ lenses:
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Canon EF-S 18-55 mm IS
      </li>
      <li>
        Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM
      </li>
    </ul>
    
<p>
	 Yes, you read it right, I consider my cellphone's built-in camera good
enough to be part of my hobby in photography. The one thing that all of the
above devices have in common is that Linux, at least my distribution of
choice (<a href="http://www.fedoraproject.org" id=bg3n title="Fedora
Linux">Fedora Linux</a>), recognizes all of them as storage devices -- and
GNOME, my desktop manager of choice, automatically prompts me to
import the photos directly from my phone or SD Cards via <em>gthumb</em> . In
this very first step of importing my photos, I must decide two things:
</p>
    
<p>
      First, the directory structure in which I am going to save my photos:
I usually archive my photos based on the dates I have taken them, using the
'YYYYMMDD' format. For example, the photos I transferred today were
saved under ~/Pictures/20091101. The second decision is whether I want to
keep the original photos on my SD card or delete them after the transfer is
complete. I usually delete them.
</p>
    
<div id=n.w1 style=TEXT-ALIGN:center>
      <img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_38djb7ffcj_b.jpg" style="WIDTH:648px; HEIGHT:405px">
</div>

<h3>The Process</h3>

<p>
	 Once you have your photos on your file system, you have a few choices
of applications to manage your work. I personally prefer using <a
href="http://picasa.google.com/linux/" id=faez title="Google's
Picasa">Google's <em>Picasa</em></a> - but it is not open source, usually lags
behind the Windows version, and uses a customized version of WINE to run.
In this article, I am only going to discuss using Picasa, but if you want
to stick with 100% open-source solutions, take a look at: <em>F-Spot</em>,
<em>Shotwell</em>, and <em>DigiKam</em>, which I will actually mention a
bit more, later on.
</p>
    
<div id=ri_9 style=TEXT-ALIGN:center>
      <img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_39d8fwbcgk_b.jpg" style="WIDTH:648px; HEIGHT:405px">
</div>

<p>
      There are four simple, main reasons why I use Picasa over an
alternative open-source application:
</p>
    
<ol>
      <li>
		I am able to do a lot of the mass editing I need to do with my
photos. Picasa offers a limited but very well defined set of
functions that I can apply to my photos. I can crop, tweak shadow,
highlight and modify lighting, saturation, and sharpening levels. I can reduce red
eye, rotate photos, auto enhance (something I try not to do often), and
apply some standard effects like: black &amp; white, sepia, glow, and tint. 
      </li>
      <li>
		One of the online services I use to share some of my photos is <a
href="http://picasaweb.google.com" id=j72k title="Google's Picasa Web
Album">Google's Picasa Web Album</a>, and even though both F-Spot and
DigiKam can also upload photos to it, Picasa is the only one (at least that
I know of) that lets you backup your existing online photos to your hard
drive.
      </li>
      <li>
	 I find that Picasa's effects and tuning tools work better on the
photos than those of F-Spot or DigiKam, but, then again, I think that is mostly a
personal preference.
      </li>
      <li>
		Finally, the most important reason why I choose
Picasa over other alternatives is because Picasa is also available for
Windows and Mac OS. I find it easier to suggest to others who may not
use Linux an application that I also have access to, and can
help them use to solve their own issues with photo management.
      </li>
    </ol>
  
<p>
    Once I have all my photos organized, edited, and tweaked on Picasa, I
usually ask myself one question: Is this a photo I want to share with my
family or with the world? If the answer is 'family', and most of them are,
I usually select the photos in question and upload them to Picasa Web
Album. Now, if the answer is 'world,' at least three things will happen:
</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
       I will tweak the photo a bit more on Picasa, sometimes adding extra
shadows or fading away the color to give a more 'artsy' feeling to it.
    </li>
    <li>
	  I will export the photo from Picasa, usually at the 1600px size and
the highest image quality, and then apply some final touches using The
GIMP.
    </li>
    <li>
	  Finally, I will upload the final product to Yahoo's <a
href="http://www.flickr.com/" id=cjh6 title=Flickr>Flickr</a>. I have grown to
really enjoy Flickr, not only due to its functionality, but because of the
community that grew up around it. I have learned a lot from other Flickr
users by exchanging ideas on each other's photos and by simply being
inspired by the work of others. Flickr also provides a very easy and
intuitive way to keep your photos 'Open Source' under the <a
href=http://creativecommons.org/ id=jyga title="Creative Commons">Creative
Commons</a> License.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
<h3>
  The GIMP
</h3>

<p>
   In the world of digital photography, it is very hard to carry out a
conversation or write an article without mentioning Adobe Photoshop.
Virtually all professional photographers use it, and a lot of hobbyists do
as well. In our world, the Open Source world, there have been many
discussions and articles about where <em>The GIMP</em>
 can and cannot fill the void for Photoshop users.  This article is not
about that, since I am not good enough with either The GIMP or Photoshop. I can
use both just enough to be dangerous, but not enough to be good. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
</p>
  
<div id=ik-b style=TEXT-ALIGN:center>
	<img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_41cktxdsgp_b.jpg" style="WIDTH:648px; HEIGHT:405px"><br>
        <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afsilva/3898492514" id=pf4q title=http://www.flickr.com/photos/afsilva/3898492514>http://www.flickr.com/photos/afsilva/3898492514</a>
</div>

<p>
      One of my favorite tricks to use with The GIMP, which works almost the
same way in Photoshop, is to create a duplicate layer of the photo you are
editing, and then:
</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        Select the top layer
      </li>
      <li>
        Go to Filters -&gt; Blur -&gt; Gaussian Blur...
      </li>
      <li>
        Change both Horizontal and Vertical Blur Radius to somewhere between 20 and 30
      </li>
      <li>
        Click OK
      </li>
      <li>
        Under the floating window of Layers, Channels..., change the Mode from Normal to Multiply.
      </li>
    </ol>
    
<p>
      The result is usually a ghostly, foggy photo that adds a lot of
emotion to your shot. If the photo turns out too dark, I also tweak the
Opacity slide bar right underneath the Layer Mode.
</p>

<p>
      The above photo was also created in The GIMP by creating multiple
duplicate layers of a color photo and a black and white photo, and using the
magic wand to erase certain areas of the black and white photo exposing the
color underneath.
</p>
    
<h3>Panoramas</h3>

<p>
	 One special type of photos that I have started working on recently is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panoramic_photography" id=htu8
title="panoramic photos">panoramic photos</a> , a technique for
capturing photos with an 'elongated field of view.' The proper way to
create usually requires setting the camera in the portrait position (AKA
standing up) on a rotating-head tripod, and taking a series of overlapping
photos of your subject. Then, you download your shots and stitch your
photos together with some specialized piece of software. I don't have a
tripod (yet), but still have fun putting these together.
</p>
    
<div id=dx.g style=TEXT-ALIGN:center>
      <img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_43gthgcmd2_b.jpg" style="WIDTH:648px; HEIGHT:259.2px">
</div>

<p>
		The above is my attempt to create a panoramic photo of Lake
Raleigh, NC. It took a total of thirteen shots and using the Open Source
application <em>hugin</em>, which is available for most current Linux
distributions as well as for other operating systems. Some distributions may
not include the 'auto-stitch' feature, which basically just means you have
to go through your photos and add common points between your photos so the
program can stitch each photo correctly.
</p>
      
<div id=jcfg style=TEXT-ALIGN:center>
        <img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_44hd67bq4t_b.jpg" style="WIDTH:500px; HEIGHT:191px"><br/>
        <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afsilva/4031388689/" id="y.5:" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afsilva/4031388689/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/afsilva/4031388689/</a>
</div>
      
<p>
	 Above is the final result.
</p>
        
<h3>Facebook and Mobile Photos</h3>

<p>
	 How many of you are on Facebook? <em>Linux Gazette</em> is (see: <a
href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=110960368283" id=dkds
title=http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=110960368283>http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=110960368283</a>
). As I said in the beginning, I even use my cellphone to take photos,
more often than not the photos taken with my cellphone get uploaded
directly to Facebook, never to be shared with anyone outside of my
friends list. But sometimes, I do want to share them on Picasa Web Album or
Flickr, and the original from the cellphone is no longer there.
</p>
    

<div id=hy1b style=TEXT-ALIGN:center>
      <img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_46nj8qhcf5_b.jpg" style="WIDTH:648px; HEIGHT:405px">
</div>
    
<p>
     The solution is to use the <em>kipi-plugins</em> on <em>digiKam</em>, 
and import your Facebook photos. It is a great way to recover old
cellphone photos, and to backup any other photos that may have been uploaded to
Facebook.
</p>
    
<h3>What's Next?</h3>
    
<p>
	 The next technique that I would like to play with, in photography, is <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging" id=emnt
title="High Dynamic Range (HDR) image processing">High Dynamic Range (HDR)
image processing</a>, which is a way to "allow a greater dynamic range of
luminances between the lightest and darkest areas of an image". The open
source application that I will be working with is <em>qtpfsgui</em>, 
and when I do have some decent results to show off, I will surely 
write up some steps on how to get them working.
</p>
    
<p>
     And finally, if you are interested in learning more about
photography and terms like aperture, exposure, wide
angle and telephoto, I highly recommend Volumes 1, 2, and 3 of <a
href="http://www.kelbytraining.com/product/the-digital-photography-book.html"
id=n62h title="The Digital Photography Book">The Digital Photography
Book</a> by Scott Kelby. It will give you several tips on what type of
techniques, software, and hardware the professional photographers are
using in the 'real' world. Enjoy!
</p>

<p class="editorial">
[ Keeping one's own photographs in order is an important task. In case you want to
automatically rename your digital images using metadata from the camera itself you
might want to check out the <a href="http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/">jhead</a> tool,
which can query and modify the JPEG header and EXIF information. -- Ren&eacute; ]

<h1>The Thin Line Between "Victim" and "Idiot"</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/starks.html">Ken Starks</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
<em>This is not meant for Linux users' consumption. Rather, it is meant to be
passed along to your friends who still use Windows. It has some irrefutable
arguments within.</em>
</p>

<p>
<img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;

/>

</p>

<p>
<strong><em>Idiot...</em></strong>
</p>

<p>
That's a fairly strong word.  I can't think of a situation where most
people would not find it offensive.
</p>

<p>
Or rude.
</p>

<p>
Let me tell you something else that is rude; the offensive part I will
leave to personal opinion.
</p>

<p>
Asking a friend to repeatedly fix your computer.
</p>

<p>
Not "fix" as in "something inside the computer broke" - like a hard drive,
or a power supply.
</p>

<p>
I'm talking about your forays into Myspace and astalavista.box.sk.

</p>

<p>
I'm talking about having to repeatedly clean the garbage off your
computer so it will run halfway decently again.
</p>

<p>
You seem to have no shame when it comes to this.
</p>

<p>
I personally stopped "fixing" Windows computers three years ago.  That
included my wife's computer.  Ahem... now my ex-wife, but that goes a bit
farther than the scope of this discussion.
</p>

<p>
See, many of us have found a way to run our computers where we don't
have to worry about that crap anymore.
</p>

<p>
Ever.
</p>

<p>
Many of us have told you of this miraculous operating system and have
gone as far as to offer to install it on your computer for you... free of
charge.
</p>

<p>
For many of us, the motive is far from altruistic.
</p>

<p>
We're sick of cleaning up your messes.  If we install GNU/Linux and
free software on your computer, we simply won't have to be bothered again.
I don't speak for all Linux users, but enough of them to hear the applause
in the background.
</p>

<p>
And trust me, it is a bother, whether we verbalize it or not.
</p>

<p>
In 2004, a variant of the Sasser worm infected my three-city network,
and, by the time the dust settled, had cost me $12,000.00 in business.
My machines were fully protected and fully patched.  See, that's the
problem with Windows exploits. These viruses and worms mutate quicker than
the anti-virus software makers can issue the fixes.  In my case, Symantec
was 72 hours away from fixing this variant. I was one click away from
disaster.
</p>

<p>
It's convenient to blame the virus writers and anti-virus software
makers, but ultimately it is your fault that you get this crap on your machine.
You are using a system that not only allows it: It fosters it.  Let it be
known that, by reading further, you will learn that you have a choice in how
you operate your computer.  A free-as-in-cost and
free-as-in-no-restrictions choice.
</p>

<p>
You will no longer be able to identify yourself as a victim.
</p>

<p>
The cost I incurred was in business loss.  Today's viruses are not in
it for the mischief: They are in it for the money.
</p>

<p>
<a
href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/05/zeustracker_and_the_nuclear_op.html">Take
a look at this</a>.
</p>

<p>
These people are not going to stop.  They are stealing billions of
dollars a year by infecting your computers.  There is too much money in
this for them to even think about taking a break.  What's worse, they are
operating out of Russia and Nigeria for the most part: We can't get to
them, to stop them.
</p>

<p>
Yeah.  It's not going to happen to you, is it?
</p>

<p>
Right.
</p>

<p>
It wasn't going to happen to me either.
</p>

<p>
Linux is an alternative operating system much like Microsoft
Windows -- and no, it's not a "program".  "Programs" run within an operating
system.  Think of it as a walnut.  The shell of the walnut is your
operating system.  The goods within the walnut shell are the programs.

</p>

<p>
I'll not bore you with the details.  If you are interested in finding
out why Linux is safer and better, you can go <a
href="http://www.whylinuxisbetter.net/items/viruses/index.php?lang=">here</a>,
<a
href="http://www.whylinuxisbetter.net/items/security/index.php?lang=">here</a>
and <a
href="http://www.whylinuxisbetter.net/items/old_and_sluggish/index.php?lang=">here</a>.
There is a fairly comprehensive explanation as to why <a
href="http://www.linux.com/feature/60208">you don't need anti-virus
software</a> here.  Here is an article from a long-time Mac and Windows
user who <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2342703,00.asp">has
seen the superiority of Linux</a>, and has put it on his own computer.
</p>

<p>
But this isn't a lesson on computer usage.
</p>

<p>
It's a wakeup call for common sense.
</p>

<p>
Did you know that most computer repair shops, once they "repair" your
system, project future profits based on the fact that you use Microsoft Windows?
They know for a fact that you are going to need them again in six months.

</p>

<p>
They put their kids through private schools and upper-crust colleges
because you are a Microsoft Windows User and are not able to adequately
protect your computer.
</p>

<p>
It's getting harder and harder to do so.  And don't look to Windows 7
for your salvation:  You will still need to load your system with the same
anti-virus garbage and registry cleaners you did with XP and Vista.
There's an even-money chance that they are going to fail anyway.  So you've
paid for what?
</p>

<p>
There is however, a thin line between being a victim and being an
idiot.  If you do not know you have a choice and bad things happen to you,
then you are a victim.
</p>

<p>
If you know you have a choice and still insist on personally using a
system over and over again that will ultimately lead to the same
problems....
</p>

<p>
I think the descriptor of idiot is fair.
</p>

<p>
You disagree?  You <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style:
italic;">know</span> that Windows is the problem...you <span
style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">know</span> that it's just a
matter of time before you have to do it all over again.  You <span
style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">know</span> you have an
alternative, but you insist on putting the source of the problem back on
your computer.  You may be uncomfortable with the term "idiot":  You give
me another name for it, then.
</p>

<p>
And if you have to use it at work, I understand.  Unfortunately, as
flawed as it is, it is still a Windows world.  The good news?  Slowly but
surely, businesses across the globe are making the switch.  Even those that
are not yet Linux companies are letting some employees run their choice of
operating systems on their work computers.  That choice is Linux.
</p>

<p>
Look.  Here is the way it is.
</p>

<p>
When you buy a new computer, chances are it will have Microsoft Windows
on it.  That didn't come free: The price of the computer is jacked up
anywhere from $100.00 to $300.00 to pay Microsoft.  It's known as <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Microsoft">the Microsoft
Tax</a>.  Microsoft has entered into deals with many of the computer
manufacturers to ensure that Windows is on about every machine they sell.
The kicker here?  Those agreements are secret and you and I cannot see
them.  We've <a
href="http://linuxlock.blogspot.com/2009/05/whos-running-dell.html">written
about this</a> before.
</p>

<p>
Microsoft has a virtual monopoly on new computer sales.
</p>

<p>
Now there are independents such as <a
href="http://www.zareason.com/">zareason.com</a> that sell nothing but
GNU/Linux computers, and they are great folks to deal with.  In fact, I have
never encountered service like what Earl and Cathy Malmrose provide -- and, for
the most part, they provide it for free.  Dell has also begun selling Linux
computers.  Do you think Dell would sell a system on their machines that
would cause them to lose money or damage their reputation?
</p>

<p>
When you call Microsoft for support, the first thing they ask for is a
credit card.
</p>

<p>
So, suppose you have bought a new computer and here comes the first 90
days: You start getting pop-ups saying your anti-virus protection is about
to expire and that, if you want to continue to "be protected", you need
to renew your subscription.  
</p>

<p>
What?
</p>

<p>
Yep, now some anti-virus companies go an entire year before they
expire but still: Eventually, you are going to be frightened into shelling
out more money in exchange for your peace of mind.
</p>

<p>
In other words, <em><strong>you have to purchase software to ensure that the software
you've already purchased is going to work.</strong></em>  Did you read that carefully?
And you are okay with that?
</p>

<p>
If I did that, I'd be in jail by now... and so would you.
</p>

<p>
Linux amputates that part of the computing experience completely.  Some
people cannot get their heads around the fact that they don't need to pay
this extortion fees anymore.  You have no idea what a sense of liberation this
brings.  Now some of you are sure to comment:
</p>

<p>
"I've run Windows for years without a problem."
</p>

<p>
Congratulations.  You wanna Google it and see how many others have not?
I suppose as long as your computer is okay, then all is right with the world.

</p>

<p>
We can open almost any attachment without fear. We can visit Web sites
that will bring a Windows machine to its knees -- and we don't notice
anything.  And please, don't be foolish and say that Linux is too hard for
the normal Windows user.  We have 10 and 12 year-olds <a
href="http://www.heliosinitiative.org/">picking it up in a couple of
hours</a>: They never look back.  Entire nations have already switched or are in
the process of switching to Linux.  Many countries in Asia and South
America have made the switch.  India is booting out Microsoft in their
schools and migrating to Linux, as we speak.
</p>

<p>
So.  You've been told.  You do have a choice, and it doesn't cost you
one thin dime.  If you choose not to at least look into it, and trust me,
most of you won't, don't ask us to come fix your infected computers.
</p>

<p>
We know which side of that thin line you stand on.
</p>

<p>
EDIT:  A friend of boh was kind enough to send us this faux-sign...just
seemed to fit the theme of the day.<br /><a

<p class="editorial">
[ While a long-time GNU/Linux user myself, I would add that there's
something to be said about a product's built-in security features. Most
operating systems, and the software running on top of them, have bugs that
need to be reported, fixed and patched. Few users realise the effort
behind this process, and rely on the automatic updates they receive. (This
is true for many users of free software and proprietary software alike.)
Measuring the security record of a computer system depends on a lot of
additional factors, not only on the operating system alone. Attackers
concentrate on common OS types that are well accessible.  Currently, this
is Microsoft Windows. Tomorrow, it could be a different OS.  This does
not mean that other platforms do not need any protection at all - on the
contrary:  All systems require a thoughtful and well-planned deployment,
when it comes to security. -- Ren&eacute; ]

<em>
<p>
Born September 22, 1969, in Gardena, California, "Penguin" Pete Trbovich
 today resides in Iowa with his wife and children. Having worked various
 jobs in engineering-related fields, he has since "retired" from
 corporate life to start his second career. Currently he works as a
 freelance writer, graphics artist, and coder over the Internet. He
 describes this work as, "I sit at home and type, and checks mysteriously
 arrive in the mail."
</p>

<p>
He discovered Linux in 1998 - his first distro was Red Hat 5.0 - and has
 had very little time for other operating systems since. Starting out
 with his freelance business, he toyed with other blogs and websites
 until finally getting his own domain penguinpetes.com started in March
 of 2006, with a blog whose first post stated his motto: "If it isn't fun
 for me to write, it won't be fun to read."
</p>

<p>
The webcomic <em>Doomed to Obscurity</em> was launched New Year's Day,
 2009, as a "New Year's surprise". He has since rigorously stuck to a
 posting schedule of "every odd-numbered calendar day", which allows him
 to keep a steady pace without tiring. The tagline for the webcomic
 states that it "gives the geek culture just what it deserves." But is it
 skewering everybody but the geek culture, or lampooning geek culture
 itself, or doing both by turns?
</p>

&gt; I've just released en-es 0.7.0. I'm not a big fan of release notes, so
&gt; here's the changelog:
&gt;
&gt; Sat Dec Â 5 15:23:45 GMT 2009
&gt;
&gt; Â * Release 0.7.0 ('More of an escape than a release')
&gt; Â * Vastly improved handling of Anglo-Saxon genitive in transfer (Mireia)
&gt; Â * 'Apostrophe genitive' (Jesus' etc.) in analysis
&gt; Â * Pre-transfer processing of apostrophes/genitive (based on an idea by
&gt; Â  Â Jacob Nordfalk/Francis Tyers)
&gt; Â * Greatly increased vocabulary (most notably, Paul "greenbreen" Breen)
&gt;
&gt; In addition, this version has some generation support for the two main
&gt; dialects of English, British and American, though this only currently
&gt; supports simple spelling differences for the moment ('favour' vs.
&gt; 'favor').
&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Oh, and because I like to collect amusing translation errors, this
error from 0.6 is fixed in 0.7:
<pre>
0.6, es-&gt;en
'Fondo Monetario Internacional' -&gt; 'International Monetary bottom'
0.7, es-en
'Fondo Monetario Internacional' -&gt; 'International Monetary Fund'
</pre>

<h3>Dear Readers...</h3>
<p>
Ever since I took over running the Linux Gazette, I've found it to be a
fascinating experience: it's presented me with a variety of surprises,
required a lot of hard thinking about the larger issues as well as dealing
with problems that pop up out of nowhere and demand immediate action - and
much of it has been just plain hard work. It's also been a blast - and I'm
so grateful to my fellow contributors, staff and authors both, that words
fail me in trying to express it adequately (and that's quite the statement
for someone who considers himself a crafter of words and a lover of
language!) To all of you who have made LG what it is, I'm truly grateful -
both as a Linux user and as the Editor-in-Chief. Doubly so as the latter,
since your contributions have built LG into a fun, useful, informative
vehicle for sharing Linux info and thereby gave me a chance to explore my
own abilities and experience my own limitations (as a friend of mine was
fond of saying when speaking of painful experiences, "...and much learning
occured therefrom.") If you hold learning in the same regard and respect as
I do - and having been a teacher during most of my professional life, as
well as always believing that education is one of the keystones to a better
future for the entire world, I hold it in high esteem indeed - that is one
of the best gifts one could ever receive.
</p>

<p>
This does not, however, mean that there are no problems or difficulties
here. If anything, it means that there are <em>more</em> of them than ever
- and that they mutate in shape, size, charm, spin, and flavor. Daily. <img
  src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
As you probably already know, good system design requires feedback; without
it, control input means little or nothing, and such systems either spend
most of their time idle or shift into destructive run-away conditions and
fail, sometimes spectacularly and with much attendant fallout. For any
publication, that feedback is very important; For a web-based, volunteer
effort like ours, it's critical. And yet...
</p>

<p>
I'm not a marketing guru; far from it. In fact, I know next to nothing when
it comes to promoting LG or getting its name out there, beyond doing the
best job I can of putting out a quality publication. I am, however, very
aware that this is not all there is to running a publication like LG... and
I feel that lack quite strongly and am rather troubled by my inability to
figure out a strong, direct method of addressing it.
</p>

<p>
In short, it boils down to the question of "can a volunteer-run publication
survive and prosper in a world of glitzy commercial ones, and can it
continue to provide quality content without sponsorship?" I feel sure that
it can - but despite having put a lot of thought into it, I don't (yet)
know what that means in terms of direction, planning, or action. If any of
you, dear readers, have relevant ability or expertise, your advice and help
would be much appreciated.
</p>

<h3>The month in review</h3>
<p>
Last month, in this very space, I asked for you, our readers, to write in;
to let us know that you were reading LG, that it mattered to you - in
short, to tell us whether LG's continued existence was a value to the Linux
community, as I believe it is. The response has been nothing short of
phenomenal and tremendously heartening: for the last month, I've been
buried under a huge pile of supportive email from all over the world, with
a number of offers of help and ideas for improvement. It was amazing to
see, and again, all of you have my thanks.
</p>

<p>
One thing stands out most clearly, though: it seems that we are "pricing
ourselves out of the market" by producing content with great quality. It's
funny when you think about it - and not a little aggravating when seen from
another perspective.
</p>

<p>
You see, at the end of every month, our editors and proofreaders put in a
lot of work to polish all those articles - and after they're done, I and my
wife go over them with a fine-tooth comb to make sure that they're as
readable and as clear as possible. At times, that last edit can be like
sweating blood, and can involve anything from basic spelling correction to
rewriting entire paragraphs to make them clearer, more comprehensible.
Many of the comments that we've received contain high praise for the
clarity and readability of our articles; I don't find this at all
surprising, since we all put in a very large amount of work to make it so.
</p>

<p>
<strong>However,</strong> the *bad* effect here is that it makes us look
<em>so</em> professional that many of our readers think <em>"Wow, I could
never write like that.  My stuff would look really amateurish next to all
these professionals. I shouldn't even bother trying!</em> I saw a whole lot
of that in the responses; lots and lots of people who would be happy to
write, but... only... there's this REALLY HIGH BAR to jump over...
</p>

<em><h2>ARRRRRRRRGH!!!</h2></em>

<p>
This is just... <strong>wrong</strong>, in many different ways and for a
variety of reasons. For one, you only get to be a good writer by
<em>writing</em> - and I like to think that, over the years, we've helped
quite a number of people become good, or at least much better writers (I
would like nothing better than for LG to be known, among other things, as a
resource for people who want to learn to write well.) For another, your
writing - yes, even yours! - can look pretty darn polished if you 1) can
take criticism and 2) have a good proofreading/editing team - and we have
one here, all shiny and capable and ready for your use, <strong>free of
charge</strong>. Trust me, folks - that's a great offer, and if you have
any aspirations as a writer and want to write about Open source topics,
this is <em>the</em> place to do it.
</p>

<p>
Most of all - writing from the just-started, not-sure-what-I'm-doing new
Linux users is what we want most desperately. Please, remember this always:
LG is all about looking at the world with a fresh set of eyes. It's about
exploration; it's about making mistakes and learning from them. Most of
all, it's about growing by learning. Just like Linux itself, and the
community around it. It's about all of us, and the force that we bring into
the world to oppose the stodgy, inbred, stale world created by proprietary
computing and closed-source practices. It's about the willingness to stay
open, alert, and sensitive in the face of challenges, and dealing with
Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt - the weapons of the proprietary world - with
courage, creativity, and laughter. It is, as I'm reminded by my 2-year-old
son's outraged squeal of "mySE'F!!!" ("I'll do it myself!") when I try to
do something for him that he knows how to do, about doing things your own
way, in your own time - because "I'll do it <em>instead</em> of you" is at
most a temporary good, is of limited utility, and is proper only to small
children and incompetents. To have a valid claim to being an adult and a
responsible human being, you have to sweat and struggle and bleed and do it
all wrong, again and again - because a thousand instances of having it done
for you, no matter how quickly or well, still leave you an ignorant slave,
but doing it on our own even once, even in some barely-functioning fashion,
grants you not only the learning experience, which you'll own for the rest of
your life, but your independence and freedom.
</p>

<p>
And <em>this</em> is the best reason to write, contribute, and participate:
we're designing, building, and maintaining freedom.
</p>

<p>
Please join us.

Ben is the Editor-in-Chief for Linux Gazette and a member of The Answer Gang.
</p>

<p>
<em>
Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became interested in electricity
at the tender age of six, promptly demonstrated it by sticking a fork into
a socket and starting a fire, and has been falling down technological
mineshafts ever since. He has been working with computers since the Elder
Days, when they had to be built by soldering parts onto printed circuit
boards and programs had to fit into 4k of memory (the recurring nightmares
have almost faded, actually.)
</p>

<p>
His subsequent experiences include creating software in more than two dozen
languages, network and database maintenance during the approach of a
hurricane, writing articles for publications ranging from sailing magazines
to technological journals, and teaching on a variety of topics ranging from
Soviet weaponry and IBM hardware repair to Solaris and Linux
administration, engineering, and programming. He also has the distinction
of setting up the first Linux-based public access network in St. Georges,
Bermuda as well as one of the first large-scale Linux-based mail servers in
St. Thomas, USVI.
</p>

<p>
After a seven-year Atlantic/Caribbean cruise under sail and passages up and
down the East coast of the US, he is currently anchored in northern
Florida. His consulting business presents him with a variety of challenges
such as teaching professional advancement courses for Sun Microsystems and
providing Open Source solutions for local companies.
</p>

<p>
His current set of hobbies includes flying, yoga, martial arts,
motorcycles, writing, Roman history, and <strike>mangling</strike> playing
with his Ubuntu-based home network, in which he is ably assisted by his <a
href="../authors/tanaka-okopnik.html">wife</a> and <a href="../authors/okopnik1.html">son</a>;
his Palm Pilot is crammed full of alarms, many of which contain exclamation
points.
</p>

<p>
He has been working with Linux since 1997, and credits it with his complete
loss of interest in waging nuclear warfare on parts of the Pacific Northwest.
