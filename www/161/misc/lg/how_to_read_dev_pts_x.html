Hi Gang...
</p>

<p>
here's the situation:
Suppose I log on into server A twice using same user ID (let's say
johndoe). Technically, Linux in server A will create two /dev/pts for
johndoe, likely /dev/pts/0 and /dev/pts/1
</p>

<p>
Is there any way that for johndoe in pts/0 to read what the other
johndoe type in pts/1? Possibly in real time? Initially I thought it
could be done by using "history" command (in bash shell), but it
failed.
</p>

<p>
Thanks in advance.
</p>

<p>
regards,
</p>

<p>
Mulyadi.

Hi Mulyadi and list,

<p>
Two solutions:
<pre>
1) first login does: screen
    second login does: screen -x
</pre>
Now both see the same and can fight over who controls the keyboard <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<pre>
2) take a look at conspy, there you can also specify to only watch the 
other login.
</pre>

<p>
Hope that helps,
</p>

<p>

Have you considered 'script'? From the manpage:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
   -f      Flush output after each write. This is nice for
   telecooperation: One person does 'mkfifo foo; script -f foo' and
   another can supervise real-time what is being done using 'cat foo'.
</pre>

<p>
...although I would just do 'script -f /tmp/foo' in one terminal and
'tail -f /tmp/foo' in the other one. Works great.

<p>
'conspy' only works for the console. It does this via the /dev/vcsa
devices which are the console devices  and <strong>not</strong> the /dev/tty devices
which are the tty devices associated with the console.
</p>

<p>
In addition to 'screen', this can also be achieved by 'ttysnoop'
and more recently 'tmux'. In each case, the method by which
'johndoe' must "co-operate" with the snooping differs.
</p>

<p>
This all for "two-way" interaction. For one way interaction, you can
use the solution proposed by Ben.
