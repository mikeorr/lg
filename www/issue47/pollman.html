<p>Everyone has a backup plan. Unfortunately, most of us use the "No Backup"
plan.
<p><b>Disclaimer: </b>This article provides information we have gleamed
from reading the books, the HOWTOs, man pages, usenet news groups, and
countless hours banging on the keyboard. It is not meant to be an all inclusive
exhaustive study on the topic, but rather, a stepping stone from the novice
to the intermediate user.&nbsp; All the examples are taken directly from
our home networks so we know they work.
<p><b>How to use this guide:</b>

<b>Prerequisites:</b> If you have Linux installed, you will have everything
you need.
<p><b>Backup Plan</b>: For the home network, you have to have some sort
of backup plan.&nbsp; Although hard drives will crash, the real value in
the backups is restoring accidentally deleted, or changed, files. Sooner
or later you will delete, or change, something important, and without a
backup, you could render your computer unbootable.&nbsp; I am embarrassed
to admit this, but I actually deleted /root on one occasion. Note: backups
should be considered compromised if you have been cracked.&nbsp; Backup
plans need to be simple to implement or they will not get done - especially
at home. A&nbsp; backup plan for home should cover two areas: how much
are you going to backup, and how are you going to do it with the least
amount of effort.
<p>How much to backup: I try to minimize the amount I backup because storage
space costs money.&nbsp; I only backup directories, not the entire file
system. Most of /usr and /opt are on the install cdrom, so if the hard
drive crashes, I will install them by default with a new install.&nbsp;
/etc and /home are the most important as they contain the configuration
and custom settings files.&nbsp; Your backup plan should include full backups
of the selected directories every so often, and then backup just the changes
(incremental backups) daily.
<p>How to backup: tape drives are usually too expensive for the home network,
and floppies are impractical. (Note: I gave up on floppies when the disk
count went over 132!)&nbsp; We believe the best compromise is using a spare
hard drive.&nbsp; Notice we said hard drive and not partition! Every time
I have had problems with hard drives, the entire drive died or became corrupted,
not just a partition. Hard drives are so cheap that using one solely for
backups is the most cost efficient method. It is not the most secure way
to save your files as a cracker can get to them, but there are limits to
how far we are willing to go to make home backups.
<p><b>Backup Programs:</b> There are three common programs used for backups
that come with almost all un*x distributions: tar, cpio, and dump.&nbsp;
Each has its strengths and weaknesses.
<p><b>TAR</b>: Tar is the most commonly used backup program for small networks.
It has been around quite a while and will likely remain for quite some
time.&nbsp; Most people do not know, however, that although tar was designed
to put files on tapes, it was not designed for backups. Instead, its purpose
is to put the files on the tape so they can be installed on other computers.
As such, its incremental backup function is weak.
<p><b>CPIO</b>:&nbsp; cpio is similar to tar in that it does not have an
incremental backup function. In fact, it does not even have a "file list"
function: you have to feed it the name of the files you want to archive
by piping them from the find program.&nbsp; cpio has two advantages over
tar: it creates a smaller uncompressed archive, and it does not die if
part of the archive is corrupted.
<p><b>DUMP</b>: dump is completely different from tar or cpio.&nbsp; It
backups up the entire file system - not the files. dump does not care what
file system is on the hard drive, or even if there are files in the file
system. It dumps one file system at a time, quickly and efficiently, and
it supports 9 levels of incremental backups. Unfortunately, it does not
do individual directories, and so, it eats up a great deal more storage
space than tar or cpio.
<p><b>Our Backup Solution</b>: <a href="misc/pollman/run-backup">Click here</a> to see
our backup script - named run-backup. Save it your hard drive and then
make it executable by typing:
<blockquote><i>chmod 777 run-backup [Enter]</i></blockquote>
<b>What part of the script you need to modify:</b> This script is designed
to run on any computer by changing only the four variables: COMPUTER, DIRECTORIES,
BACKUPDIR, and TIMEDIR.&nbsp; Currently we are running it on 2 linux boxes
and 2 solaris boxes. The BACKUPDIR is nfs mounted on our machines, but
it could be another hard drive on the computer. We suggest that you set
this script up and run it for a month before making major changes.
<p><b>What the script does</b>: when the script is run, it first looks
to see if today is the first day of the month. If it is, it makes a full
backup of the files listed in the variable DIRECTORIES, names the tar ball
after the computer and date, e.g. myserver-01Nov.tgz and puts it in the
BACKUPDIR directory. Since this is a unique file name, it will stay in
the BACKUPDIR until you delete it.&nbsp; Next, if today is not the first
of the month, but it is Sunday, the script will make a full backup of the
DIRECTORIES, and overwrite the Sunday file in BACKUPDIR.&nbsp; In other
words, there is only one Sunday file in the backupdir and it is overwritten
every Sunday. That way we do not waste much space on the hard drive but
still have a full backup that is at most one week old. The script also
puts Sunday's date in the TIMEDIR directory. If today is not the first
or a Sunday, the script will make an incremental backup of all the files
that have changed since Sunday's full backup. As such, each day's backup
after Sunday should get larger than the last.&nbsp; This is the trade-off:
you could do an incremental backup of just the files that changed in the
last 24 hours and keep each day's backup quite small, but if your hard
drive goes south on Friday, you will have to restore Sunday's, Monday's,
Tuesday's, Wednesday's and Thursday's backups.&nbsp; By doing an incremental
backup from Sunday each day, the backups are larger, but you only have
to restore Sunday's and Thursday's backup. Here is an abbreviated look at
the backup directory:
<blockquote><tt>root&nbsp;&nbsp; 828717 Oct&nbsp; 1 16:19 myserver-01Oct.tgz</tt>
<br><tt>root&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14834 Oct 22 01:45 myserver-Fri.tgz</tt>
<br><tt>root&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5568 Oct 18 01:45 myserver-Mon.tgz</tt>
<br><tt>root&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14999 Oct 23 01:44 myserver-Sat.tgz</tt>
<br><tt>root&nbsp; 1552152 Oct 24 01:45 myserver-Sun.tgz</tt>
<br><tt>root&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5569 Oct 21 01:45 myserver-Thu.tgz</tt>
<br><tt>root&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5570 Oct 19 01:45 myserver-Tue.tgz</tt>
<br><tt>root&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5569 Oct 20 01:45 myserver-Wed.tgz</tt></blockquote>

<p><br><b>How to run the script</b>: We run this script as a cron job at
one o'clock in the morning every day. If you need help with cron,<a href="misc/pollman/cron.html">
click here</a>. Note: the incremental backups need the time of the Sunday
backup. If you start in the middle of the week, you need to create the
time file in the TIMEDIR. Using the script above as an example, the file's
name is: myserver-full-date, and its consists of a single line:
<p><i>26-Sep</i>
<p><b>Restoring:</b> Restoring is relatively easy, with only one thing
to remember: tar does not include the leading / on files. So,if you wanted
to restore /etc/passwd, you would first have to cd to /, and then type:
<blockquote><i>tar -zxvf {wherever_file_is}/myserver-Sun.tgz&nbsp; etc/passwd</i></blockquote>
