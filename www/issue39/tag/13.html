Hi!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
You <EM>may</EM> remember me from a couple of months ago, when I wrote you in
my first weeks of using Linux, asking about the correct way to put
together a bash script to remove spaces from filenames being copied from
a Win98-generated CD.  Since then, I've fallen for Linux like a stone,
and I only return to Win98 when I need to do something with minimal or
no support under Linux.  (I'm working on the C chops, but they're
nowhere near close to solving many of my problems elegantly.  Grrrr.)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
One of these things is the operation of a WebCam.  Now, I've been
through the bttv etc. sites and tried a number of things, but I'm forced
to face the fact that my capture card is <EM>not</EM> supported under Linux.
</STRONG></P>

<p><em>[ Did you try WebCam World?  Their developer's area seems to be 
	trying to track all software that supports webcams, including
	Linux based apps, at 
<a href="http://developers.webcamworld.com/slist.html"
	>http://developers.webcamworld.com/slist.html</a>
</em></p>
<p><em>With our fast pace of development it's also worthwhile to keep checking.
I found this by feeding "<tt>+webcam software +linux</tt>" to Yahoo!
	-- Heather ]</em></p>

<P><STRONG>
My first thought was that I'd put together a driver in C for the card.
After the laughter quieted to a dull roar, I dropped that idea.  My
second thought was that I'd just have to buy a new capture card.  Not
bad, but I do like a fair amount of the software I have that works with
my current card.  Hmmm.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Third thought:  Build a mini-LAN.  Rehab the old 90MHz Pentium in the
closet, throw an ethernet card in it, and run the webcam/software on
that box, but get access to the images/clips it produces from my "main
system" running Linux.  I like this idea because it seems like it will
work well for most things I like to do with my cam, and because I can
learn a ton about networking in the process.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Pardon my circumlocution.  I'll get to the point:  (hehe)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I've done some looking at the most available docs, including the
networking HOWTO and a couple of books I bought on general Linux things,
but none of them address my situation directly, and I'm a complete
novice to networking, so I'm having trouble bridging the gaps.  Perhaps
you can help...
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Question 1:
What networking protocol should I aim for?  A friend who runs a major NT
based network suggested setting things up with NetBEUI, since I'd have
next to zero configuration to do before getting things running.  I
haven't seen this addressed anywhere directly.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

	>
NetBIOS/NetBEUI "native" protocols are not supported
under Linux.  They probably won't be supported under future
versions of NT.  They are non-routable and extremely
"noisy" (involving many broadcasts which force the
software on all hosts to sift through many of the packets
that would be more targeted and handled in ethernet hardware
on other protocols).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You want TCP/IP.  In a <EM>real pinch</EM> you might use IPX (the
Novell protocols).  However, the whole Internet uses TCP/IP
and even the latest versions of Netware and Windows prefer TCP/IP.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
Question 2:
I need to be able to access the mini-LAN and my PPP connection from my
linux box concurrently so, for example, I can have the webcam generate
and stamp a .jpg image on my w98 box, and have a background job on the
linux box ftp'ing the files to my ISP's web server.  What are my major
concerns here?  If I can't avoid a using an IP-based protocol on my LAN
(so my w98 box needs an IP address), how do I make this work?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
You can have multiple interfaces on a Linux system.  Each
interface will have it's own IP address.  Typically, on
small home LANs you'll have one IP address from your ISP ---
usually a dynamically generated one like <tt>206.123.234.56</tt> ---
and you'll use "reserved/private net" addresses (as
defined by RFC 1918) for all of your other systems.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Thus your PPP interface will use the "real" IP address
and all of your other systems will speak to the Internet
through that one system (which is then your "router" and/or
your "proxy").
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is a technical, though somewhat blurred, distinction
between a "router" and a "proxy host."  Linux can act as
either or both concurrently.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
One feature that's built into Linux is "IP masquerading" a
particular form of "NAT" (network address translation).
This allows it to re-write packet headers <EM>as it routes</EM>
packets.  When properly configured this will allow a whole
network LAN to look like a single, busy, system to the
rest of the Internet.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, let's assume that you set up an ethernet.  You decide
to use <tt>192.168.99.*</tt> for your IP addresses.  According to
RFC 1918 you can use any of the <tt>192.168.*.*</tt> addresses,
and/or you can use <tt>10.*.*.*</tt> and/or you can use <tt>172.16.*.*</tt>
through <tt>172.31.*.*</tt> (now you don't have to read the RFC ---
since that's all of the most important notes from it right there).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, your Linux system sees that as <tt>eth0</tt> (the first, and
probably only ethernet interface on your host).  So you'd
have a script that looked something like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>ifconfig eth0 192.168.99.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.99.255
route add -net 192.168.99.0 eth0
ipfwadm -F -a acc -m -S 192.168.0.0/16 -D 0/0
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... which would configure the interface, add the route
(automatically done in 2.2.x --- but necessary in 2.0.x and
earlier), and add a special entry to the "forwarding" table
for the kernel's IP packet filtering (so-called "firewall").
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Your PPP configuration would set the default route (out
to the Internet).  You might use manual dialing or a
program like '<tt>diald</tt>' to automatically dial your ISP whenever
packets get directed for it (dial on demand).  I've heard
that newer versions of the PPP daemon (pppd) support
dial-on-demand directly --- though I haven't tried it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Search through the back issues of my column.  I've
described IP masquerading, diald, PPP, and routing in
considerable detail and on a number of occasions.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are also HOWTOs on these subjects --- look at

I realize this is a pretty broad question for this forum, but any advice
you can send my way would be greatly appreciated.  I also figure there
are probably a fair number of people out there making the Windows-&gt;Linux
transition who might be interested in a similar solution for a multitude
of problems.

Look back through my back issues.  It's all there,
somewhere.  Then again, maybe I've consolidated enough
(by linking to the related HOWTOs) to obviate all that.
