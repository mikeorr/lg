<h1>PostgreSQL - import of large texts and dynamic content</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/borisov.html">Anton Borisov</a></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>PostgreSQL is an enterprise-level database. It is an open-source software, 
competes by some features with products from Oracle, so it is no surpise that 
more and more projects delegate such important duties like data-mining and 
data handling to PostgreSQL. And what's more important, the architectural 
design for this database is extremely powerful and conforms to KISS principal 
very close, so it is really very fun to deal with PGSQL internal programming, 
as well as maintaining it.
</p>

<h3>The task</h3>

<p>One of the projects that I need to take care of is based on PostgreSQL and 
Liferay Portal, which in turn is based on Tomcat. Actually, it has a 3-tier 
architecture, where Tomcat works as a web-server, i.e. it basically is a front-end, 
that serves requests from around the world. Liferay's web-pages can be as: 
(a) plain HTML, (b) JSP (Java Server Pages), (c) or can be programmed as 
servlets (portlets) as well. The latter two scenarios require you to have 
an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) with JSP-, portlet-, JDBC-bindings 
deployed. Basically, either JSP, or portlet contains code, that just fetches 
actual SQL-data from database instance (for example, news_portal) and prepares 
lovely HTML-page, which shows today's weather forecast, or currency rates. However, 
you might be interested in generating the same page without doing time consuming 
efforts like downloading and installing IDE, programming new servlet and deploying 
it afterall. How to make it happen? Simply execute necessary SQL-requests at 
backyard, i.e. within operating system space, where Tomcat and PostgreSQL servers 
reside. You can program it in 10 minutes - in bash, python or any other scripting 
language. In my case I generate HTML-page, that consists of thousand lines of text, 
and push it back into Liferay's CMS database engine (news_lportal), so HTML contents 
of this page is to be displayed by Liferay itself. I also scheduled via cron how often 
I regenerate this information page, so Liferay would always show up-to-date news, 
rates, etc.
</p>

<h3>Data manipulating with PSQL</h3>

<p>There's a native client, that comes with PostgreSQL server, called psql. 
Although psql is console application only it has essentially the same 
capabilities as it's counterpart - a GUI, GTK-based PgAdmin. If you don't 
have it installed in your system, please run aptitude (for Debian):
</p>

<pre class="code">
# aptitude install postgresql-client
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
Reading extended state information      
Initializing package states... Done
Reading task descriptions... Done  
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  postgresql-client postgresql-client-8.3{a} postgresql-client-common{a} 
0 packages upgraded, 3 newly installed, 0 to remove and 6 not upgraded.
Need to get 2028kB of archives. After unpacking 5276kB will be used.
Do you want to continue? [Y/n/?]
</pre>

<p>
Listing 1. Postgresql package consists of psql as well as other auxiliary utilities
</p>

<p>
It will install psql, as well as pg* utilities (pg_dump, pg_restore and others).
</p>

<p>
Surely, you can install a GUI application as well for performing complex tasks, 
like data analysis:
</p>

<pre class="code">
# aptitude install pgadmin3
</pre>

<img src="pgadmin.png" alt="PgAdmin" align="center" style="margin-right: 50px; margin-bottom: 15px;" />

<p>
Figure 1. PgAdmin - graphical application for handling SQL-queries
</p>

<p>
With the help of psql you can quite easily run any SQL-statement, like this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
psql -q -n -h 127.0.0.1 news_lportal -U root -c "select userid, emailaddress from user_"</pre>
<p>where used:</p>

<pre class="code">
	host to connect to - <b>127.0.0.1</b>
	desired database within PostgreSQL pool - <b>news_lportal</b>
	username, which is granted to execute SQL-command - <b>root</b>
	and SQL-command itself - <b>select userid, emailaddress from user_</b>
</pre>

<p>
Alternatively, you can run psql with <i>update operator</i>, like this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
psql -q -n -h 127.0.0.1 news_lportal -U root -c "update journalarticle set content = '&lt;H1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/H1&gt;' where id_ = 24326"
</pre>

<p>
Where ID with number 24326 is my HTML document previosuly created by CMS-engine 
on top of Liferay and stored inside PostgreSQL database - news_lportal.
</p>

<p>
In such a way, you could refresh any information, that is stored inside <b>journalarticle</b> 
table. The only thing you should remember about is the correct ID for your article.
</p>

<p>
However, in real life this update trick won't work as it should. I've prepared 
an update script (import_table.sh), where the contents of <i>table_news.html</i> 
file should be uploaded into PostgreSQL.
</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh
    ct=`cat table_news.html`
    psql -t -l -q -n -h 127.0.0.1 news_lportal -U root -c "update journalarticle set content = '$ct' where id_ = 24326;"
</pre>

<p>
Listing 2. Very simple import script (import_table.sh), first version
</p>

<p>
Argh! It didn't work out - PostgreSQL client refused to run an update command.
</p>

<pre class="code">
$ ./import_table.sh 
./import_table.sh: line 4: /usr/bin/psql: Argument list too long
</pre>

<p>
At first glance, the file <i>table_news.html</i> seems to be quite good. 
But a closer look shows another catch-up - the file is a bit too large - 400Kb in size.
</p>

<pre class="code">
$ file table_news.html
table_news.html: UTF-8 Unicode text, with very long lines
$ cat table_news.html | wc
    617    2505  408460
</pre>

<p>
Is there a mechanism to load any text file larger than 2Kb into database? Yes! 
Luckily, PostgreSQL has import/export functions that will ease communicating 
with file I/O operations. Let's declare our own procedure get_text_document_portal() 
that will load into database any text file.
</p>

<pre class="code">
- Function: get_text_document_portal(character varying) 
-- DROP FUNCTION get_text_document_portal(character varying); 
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_text_document_portal(p_filename character varying) 
  RETURNS text AS 
$BODY$ SELECT CAST(pg_read_file(E'liferay_import/' || $1 ,0, 100000000) AS TEXT); 
$BODY$ 
  LANGUAGE sql VOLATILE SECURITY DEFINER 
  COST 100; 
ALTER FUNCTION get_text_document_portal(character varying) OWNER TO postgres; 
</pre>

<p>
Listing 3. Our new procedure will call pg_read_file() function and read text file from disk
</p>

<p>
In order to load a text file into the database named news_lportal, I've written 
the script below (import_table_2.sh), which takes filename - in this example, 
<b>table.text</b> - as a parameter for get_text_document_portal() procedure and 
places it's contents into corresponding field of table journalarticle. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh
    psql -q -n  -h 127.0.0.1 news_lportal -U root -c "update journalarticle set content = get_text_document_portal('table.text') where id_  = 24326;"
</pre>

<p>
Listing 4. Import script (import_table_2.sh) that triggers our new pgsql-procedure
</p>

<p>
All you need to do is to change the source HTML file, named table.text 
and run import_table_2.sh. Please pay attention to a location, where 
the imported file should be placed - this is a subdirectory <b>liferay_import</b> 
under /var/lib/postgresql/8.3/main/ tree.
</p>

<pre class="code">
$ ls -l /var/lib/postgresql/8.3/main/
total 48

lrwxrwxrwx  1 root     root       38 Nov  9 10:20 server.key -> /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
</pre>

<p>
Listing 5. Owners' information for PostgreSQL disk storage pool
</p>

<p>
It is owned by postgres and can be written by this user only. Or, by root 
account. Of course, you could add an entry into root's crontab, but a good 
practice is - split jobs between different accounts. Assigning database jobs 
to postgres only, and every other task trust to, for instance, tomcat account. 
So how can tomcat user be able to write to <b>liferay_import</b> directory 
with postgres owner access bits? By making a link - symlink doesn't work, 
but hardlink will do!
</p>

<pre class="code">
# ln /var/lib/postgresql/8.3/main/liferay_import/table.text	/home/tomcat/db/table.text
</pre>

<p>
Listing 6. Hardlink allows to override owners' limitations provided by symlink 
</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh

        /home/tomcat/db/prepare_table_news.sh > /home/tomcat/db/table.text
        /home/tomcat/db/import_table_2.sh
</pre>

<p>
Listing 7. Script (mk_db.sh), that prepares arbitrary HTML-document and loads it into database
</p>

<p>
Hooray! Now I can place an entry into tomcat's crontab and get the news 
information updated every hour. And this is done from under tomcat account. 
Really nice.
</p>

<pre class="code">
$ crontab -l
# m h  dom mon dow   command
0 * * * * /home/tomcat/db/mk_db.sh > /dev/null
</pre>

<p>
Listing 8. One entry in tomcat's crontab that should be executed every 
hour in order to update news 
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
There exist different approaches how to provide up-to-date information when 
you deal with Liferay Portal and portlet-technology. First way requires to 
have dedicated developer environment preinstalled (NetBeans IDE with portlets 
bindings), whilst another way needs only to have a basic shell-scripting 
knowledge and be able to correctly construct SQL-queries. Of course, the better 
way is a good full-time developer with hands on IDE, JSR168 / JSR268 portlet 
standards, that would program whatever web-application you need, especially 
HTML-page with dynamically changed information. However, you can achieve the 
same results much quicker - simply rely upon casual Linux console tools.
