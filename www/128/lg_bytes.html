<h3><img title="lightning bolt" alt="bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Eclipse Callisto shines in FOSSw world</h3>

<p>"Callisto" is a coordinated, simultaneous release of some 10 new 
or upgraded releases of major projects. This includes version 3.2 of the 
Eclipse Platform and these other new releases: </p>
<p>* Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools (BIRT) Project<br>
* C/C++ IDE<br>
* Data Tools Platform<br>
* GEF - Graphical Editor Framework<br>
* Eclipse Project [v. 3.2]<br>
* Eclipse Test and Performance Tools Platform Project<br>
* Eclipse Web Tools Platform Project<br>
* VE - Visual Editor and <br>
* Eclipse Modeling and Graphical Frameworks<br></p>

<p>Callisto was a major undertaking for the Eclipse community, involving 10 
different project teams, 260 committers and over 7 million lines of code. 
Demonstrating the multi-vendor and global nature of the Eclipse community, 15 
different ISVs contributed open source developers to work on the projects 
included in Callisto. </p>
<p>The coordination took the better part of a year and involved Bjorn 
Freeman-Benson, technical director of infrastructure at the Eclipse Foundation, 
and Ward Cunningham, Director, Committer Community Development, who left 
Microsoft in 2005 to work with Eclipse. [Cunningham has been described as the 
father of the wiki.] Eclipse presenters from IBM at JavaOne had described the 
level of maturity and coordination built into the Eclipse process during a 
morning keynote and also at a JavaOne BOF. This is based in part on advanced 
collaboration tools shared by all Eclipse project leads [IBM suggested that it 
may productize some of the process tools]. It also involved coordinating bug 
fixes with Bugzilla. </p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" alt="bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">RSA folds into EMC</h3>

<p>EMC had an expensive lunch at the end of June. For a whopping $2.1 billion, 
it acquired security and identity company RSA, orignially founded by the 3 
cryptologists whose initials make up its name.</p>
<p>Although financial analysts were skeptical about the potential integration 
issues and the high cost, EMC's CEO Joe Tucci called the purchase "critical 
technology" for adding security to storage solutions. One area of possible 
synergy is regulatory compliance, where data security is of increasing 
importance. However, RSA has not been primarily a sales organization, as EMC is, 
and the corporate cultures may clash. </p>
<p>RSA put itself up for auction several months ago, according to NY Times reports.</p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" alt="bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif"> Red Hat Enterprise 
Linux 5 beta starting in July</h3>
<p>Beta 1 of the next RHEL server may to be available in late July. The 
now-available Fedora Core 5 is viewed as alpha code for RHEL5. Red Hat hopes to 
incorporate the next Fedora Core 6 build into its Beta 2, planned for release in 
mid September.</p>
<p>RHEL 5 will include the Xen open source virtualization hypervisor -- a key 
element of the release and a necessary addition due to Novell's inclusion of Xen 
in Suse 10 -- as well as integration with the Red Hat's directory and 
certificate servers. It will also offer support for Intel and AMD virtualization 
extensions, stateless Linux clients, and single sign-on. </p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" alt="bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">JBoss Unveils OSSw Enterprise Management Strategy with implementation of agent technology </h3>

<p>JBoss, now a division of Red Hat, is open sourcing the core systems 
management agent in JBoss Operations Network (ON) to create and drive broadened 
adoption and collaboration around its open management platform. This 
announcement, backed by the JBoss developer and ISV community, provides software 
vendors and customers a foundation for building their own management agents, 
which will enable interoperability across heterogeneous IT environments.</p>
<p>This strategy is an important step in putting customers in charge of their IT 
infrastructures. As a subscription-based offering, JBoss ON delivers dramatic 
savings in total cost of ownership (TCO) and provides a holistic environment for 
inventory management, administration and configuration, monitoring, software 
updates and provisioning of applications based on JBoss Enterprise Middleware 
Suite (JEMS). Red Hat is working with other network and systems management 
vendors to ensure that management data can be shared with existing customer 
management installations. JBoss ON subscribers will also be able to leverage 
existing open source agents from projects such as Nagios.</p>
<p>By bringing its JBoss management agent to the open source community, Red Hat 
will enable systems to expose its manageability functions in an extendable and 
pluggable way - underscoring the company's commitment to support heterogeneous 
customer environments. For example, other vendors can extend the agent to manage 
their products. As part of its strategy, JBoss will create blueprints, 
certification toolkits and methodologies that vendors can use to validate their 
extensions and plug into the management process used for JEMS today. </p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" alt="bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">JBoss Releases JBoss Seam 1.0, a Web 2.0 framework for SOA technologies</h3>
<p>JBoss also announced the general availability of JBoss Seam 1.0, a new 
application framework for Web 2.0 applications that unifies popular 
service-oriented architecture (SOA) technologies such as Asynchronous JavaScript 
and XML (AJAX), JavaServer Faces (JSF), Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) 3.0, Java 
portlets, business process management (BPM) and workflow. Since its initial 
developer release, JBoss Seam has seen strong community interest and has played 
a driving role for a new standards initiative for Web Beans through the Java 
Community Process (JCP).</p>
<p>Designed to eliminate complexity at the architecture and application 
programming interface (API) level, JBoss Seam enables developers to assemble 
complex web applications with simple annotated POJOs (plain old Java objects), 
componentized UI widgets and simple XML. To accomplish this, JBoss Seam extends 
the annotation-driven and configuration-by-exception programming model of EJB 
3.0 into the entire web application stack. It bridges the artificial gap between 
EJB 3.0 and JSF in the Java Platform Enterprise Edition 5.0 (Java EE 5.0) 
architecture. The result is a unifying, tightly integrated application model 
that enables stateless, stateful, transactional and process-driven applications 
such as workflow and page flow. </p>
<p>Gavin King, founder and project lead of JBoss Seam and founder of Hibernate, 
commented: "Enabling the next generation of web development requires a major 
reconsideration of the underlying web application architecture. Until EJB 3.0, 
that had not been possible. As the first unifying ... framework for SOA 
technologies, JBoss Seam offers developers a rapid development environment and 
programming model that extends from the simple to the most complex web 
applications."</p>
<p>Key features of JBoss Seam 1.0 include:</p>
<p>-- EJB-based development. EJB 3.0 has changed the notion of EJBs as 
coarse-grained, heavy-weight objects to EJBs as lightweight POJOs with 
fine-grained annotations. In JBoss Seam, everything is an EJB. JBoss Seam 
embraces the Web 2.0 concept that the web is the platform, and as such, JBoss 
Seam eliminates the distinction between presentation tier components and 
business logic components. Even session beans, for example, can be used as JSF 
action listeners.<br>
-- AJAX-based remoting layer. JBoss Seam Remoting allows EJB 3.0 session 
beans to be called directly from the web browser client via AJAX. The session 
beans appear as simple JavaScript objects to the JavaScript developer, hiding 
the complexity of XML-based serialization and the XMLHttpRequest API. Web 
clients may even subscribe to JMS topics and receive messages published to the 
topic as asynchronous notifications.<br>
 -- Declarative state management for application state. Currently, Java EE 
applications implement state management manually, an approach that results in 
bugs and memory leaks when applications fail to clean up session attributes. 
JBoss Seam eliminates almost entirely this class of bugs. Declarative state 
management is possible because of the rich context model defined by JBoss 
Seam.<br>
 -- Support for new types of stateful applications. Before Seam, HTTP session 
was the only way to manage web application states. JBoss Seam provides multiple 
stateful contexts of different granularity. For example, developers can write 
web applications with multiple workspaces that behave like a multi-window rich 
client.<br>
 -- Support for process-driven applications. JBoss Seam integrates transparent 
business process management via JBoss jBPM, making it easier than ever to 
implement complex workflow and page flow applications. Future versions of JBoss 
Seam will allow for the definition of presentation-tier conversation flows by 
the same means.<br>
 -- Portal integration. JBoss Seam supports JSR-168 compliant portals such as 
JBoss Portal.</p>
<p>JBoss Seam 1.0 is free to download and use under the GNU 
Lesser General Public License (LGPL). JBoss Seam 1.0 works with any application 
server that supports EJB 3.0, including JBoss. For download and additional

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" alt="bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Webinar Series on Clustering JVM, Tomcat Sessions</h3>



<p>Terracotta, Inc., announced a free Webinar series for Java professionals 
about the technology and benefits of the company's clustered JVM (Java Virtual 
Machine) solutions The series is a response to the market's growing interest in 
clustering at the JVM level, instead of at the application level.</p>
<p>Designed for Java developers, architects, and anyone needing fault tolerance 
and linear scalability, the webinars will cover all aspects of clustering the 
JVM. Highlights will include benefits, new features, installation, usage, 
management, demos, and technical Q&amp;As. Webinars will be archived for those 
who cannot attend. </p>
<p>The first webinar, on June 28, addressed clustering the JVM with Apache 
Tomcat, which Terracotta currently supports. The Panelists included Jim 
Jagielski, CTO, Covalent Technologies; Gary Nakamura, vice president, 
Terracotta; and Sreeni Iyer, senior manager/field engineer, Terracotta</p>
<p>Terracotta Sessions clusters the JVM, instead of the application, so no 
coding or tuning during development is needed while achieving high availability 
and linear scalability. Developers can easily replicate sessions to other 
servers for high availability, without sacrificing performance. The product is 
fee for developers.</p>
<p>Future Webinars will focus on the Spring Framework from 
Interface21, which Terracotta will support in Q3, and additional open source

converters, etc. </p>
<p>Opera's expanded functionality makes it possible to selectively block content

holding down the Shift key and clicking on specific images, ads and other 
componentsto be blocked on the next visit.</p>
<p>Quoting from the eWeek review: "A new site-settings feature made it possible 
to define controls and settings on a site-by-site basis. So, for example, we 
could define how we wanted to deal with pop-ups or cookies on a site.</p>
<p>"Now integrated directly within the Opera browser is a BitTorrent client, 
useful for downloading very large files (legal and non-legal). This client 
worked very well in our tests, and during downloads of Linux ISO files it 
provided good feedback and was very lightweight. However, BitTorrent users 
should keep in mind that if you close the browser, the download stops. Many 
BitTorrent clients, in contrast, just switch to a minimized mode. "</p>

<p>The MEPIS team released the second release candidate of 
SimplyMEPIS 6.0, on June 21. RC2 adds bug fixes, security updates, and screen 
resolution detection, founder and lead developer Warren Woodford said. The 
distribution now also includes monitor resolution autodetection.<br><br>[Monitor 
resolution autodetection] is a feature that has been requested for a long time," 
according to Woodford. "If the user does not specify their desired display 
resolution when booting the CD, we attempt to obtain it from the EDID data 
returned by the display card, and then the optimum screen resolution is chosen 
automatically. Unfortunately there are a lot of monitor-display card 
combinations that do not return this data, so this feature will work only for 
some users."<br><br>A bug was found in RC1 that broke the "install on entire 
disk" option, Woodford said, and it has been fixed for RC2. By popular demand, 
the apt-notify applet was improved to support transparency in the panel. Firefox 
now runs much faster out-of-the-box, due to some configuration improvements 
suggested by the community, he added. <br><br>RC2 incorporates more security

<h3>"Blue Pill = Security Nightmare"</h3>
<p>From Joanna Rutkowska on the 'theinvisiblethings' blog:</p>
<p>"Over the past few months I have been working on a technology code-named Blue 
Pill, which is just about that - creating 100% undetectable malware, which is 
not based on an obscure concept.</p>
<p>"The idea behind Blue Pill is simple: your operating system swallows the Blue 
Pill and it awakes inside the Matrix controlled by the ultra thin Blue Pill 
hypervisor. This all happens on-the-fly (i.e. without restarting the system) and 
there is no performance penalty and all the devices, like graphics card, are 
fully accessible to the operating system, which is now executing inside virtual 
machine. This is all possible thanks to the latest virtualization technology 
from AMD called SVM/Pacifica."</p>

<p><strong>--Soon-to-be-Proposed Digital Copyright 
Legislation Would Tighten Restrictions</strong>      
</p>
<p>Despite efforts of computer programmers, tech companies and academics to get 
Congress to loosen restrictions imposed by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 
(DMCA), an even more stringent copyright law is expected to be introduced soon. 
The Intellectual Property Protection Act of 2006 would make simply trying to 
commit copyright infringement a federal crime punishable by up to 10 years in 
prison. The bill also proposes changes to the DMCA that would prohibit people 
from "making, importing, exporting, obtaining control of or possessing" software 
or hardware that can be used to circumvent copyright protection.</p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" alt="bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">New Berkeley DB Java Edition 3.0</h3>


<p>The new Berkeley DB 3.0 is a high performance, transactional storage engine 
written entirely in Java. Like the original, highly successful Berkeley DB 
product, Berkeley DB Java Edition executes in the address space of the 
application, without the overhead of client/server communication. It stores data 
in the application's native format, so no runtime data translation is required. 
Berkeley DB Java Edition supports full ACID transactions and recovery. It 
provides an easy-to-use, programmatic interface, allowing developers to store 
and retrieve information quickly, simply and reliably.</p>
<p>Berkeley DB Java Edition is designed to offer the same benefits of Enterprise 
Java Beans 3.0 (EJB3) persistence without the need to translate objects into 
tables.</p>
<p>Most persisted object data is never analyzed using ad-hoc SQL queries; it is 
usually simply retrieved and reconstituted as Java objects. The overhead of 
using a sophisticated analytical storage engine is wasted on this basic task of 
object retrieval. The full analytical power of the relational model is not 
required to efficiently persist Java objects. In many cases, it is unnecessary 
overhead. In contrast, Berkeley DB does not have the overhead of an ad-hoc query 
language like SQL, and so does not incur this penalty.</p>
<p>The result is faster storage, lower CPU and memory requirements, and a more 
efficient development process. Despite the lack of an ad-hoc query language, 
Berkeley DB Java Edition can access Java objects in an ad-hoc manner, and it 
does provide transactional data storage and indexed retrieval, as you would 
expect from any database. The difference is that it does this in a small, 
efficient, and easy-to-manage package. Using the Persistence API, Java 
developers can quickly and easily persist and retrieve inter-related groups of 
Java objects.</p>
<p>Berkeley DB Java Edition was designed from the ground up in Java. It takes 
full advantage of the Java environment. The API provides a Java 
Collections-style interface, as well as a programmatic interface similar to the 
Berkeley DB API. Its architecture supports high performance and concurrency for 
both read- and write-intensive workloads.</p>
<p>Berkeley DB Java Edition is not a relational engine built in Java [like 
Derby]. It is a Berkeley DB-style embedded store, with an interface designed for 
programmers, not DBAs. The architecture is based on a log-based, no-overwrite 
storage system, enabling high concurrency and speed while providing ACID 
transactions and record-level locking. Berkeley DB Java Edition efficiently 
caches most commonly used data in memory, without exceeding 
application-specified limits. </p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" alt="bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">BlueCat Networks and Mirage Networks Defend Network Access</h3>



<p>BlueCat Networks and Mirage Networks announced that the companies have formed 
an alliance to deliver the strongest DHCP-based network access control (NAC) 
available. Through this partnership, BlueCat Networks is adding support for 
Mirage NAC to its lineup of network appliances. The combined solution will 
enable customers to cost-effectively authenticate users and control their access 
to network resources. </p>
<p>A recent Gartner report, states "To protect their networks, many network 
managers are implementing network access control (NAC), based on technologies 
such as 802.1x and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)." This reflection 
of industry requirements and drivers has spurred the development of this 
partnership.</p>
<p>BlueCat selected Mirage NAC for its abilities to provide a future-proof 
approach that provides security no matter the IP device or operating system. Its 
award-winning design offers complete access control by:</p>
-- Addressing policy violations and threats -- even day zero -- at all 
points on the network<br>
 -- Enforcing DHCP-based authentication for dynamic IP addresses<br>
 -- Providing 
safe quarantining and mitigation of offending devices

<p>"There are no safe havens in the network: every endpoint, from the network 
printer to the VoIP phone to the Windows desktop is vulnerable to threats," 
stated Michael D'Eath, vice president of corporate and business development, 
Mirage Networks. "BlueCat is clearly a leader in the IPAM, DNS and DHCP Space. 
With this partnership, BlueCat can securely authenticate and attach any 
endpoint, managed or unmanaged, to the network, without the need for expensive 
switch upgrades, cumbersome client software or reactive signature updates."</p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" alt="bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Forum Systems Launches Web Services Security Software Development Kit</h3>

<p>Forum Systems has released the Forum Java Web Services Security (JWSS) 
Software Development Kit (SDK) version 1.0 offering developers a comprehensive 
library of application programming interfaces (API's) to leverage in coding Web 
Services applications. The JWSS SDK v1.0 addresses the need for security to be 
enforced within the application itself in order to ensure privacy and integrity 
of Web Services and SOA applications.</p>
<p>Forum JWSS SDK v1.0 allows developers to administer and apply security 
policies within J2EE compliant Application Servers using a declarative security 
model and API's for XML message authentication and authorization. The 
Application Server is then responsible for applying these security constraints 
to the code at runtime. Adding XML security within business logic prevents 
transactions from bypassing third-party enforcement points that would violate 
regulatory compliance or work flow security. Companies should complement this 
developer-centric approach with an "interception" model using a SOA Gateway or 
XML Firewall within a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) for a global and scalable SOA 
security and acceleration strategy.</p>
<p>"There are business applications in which security must be enforced at the 
exact location where information is being processed for privacy reasons," said 
Walid Negm, vice president of marketing for Forum Systems. "In certain financial 
services and government settings, the origin of messages must be verified at the 
point of consumption to ensure that they were not physically intercepted. When 
using XML Encryption within the application, Forum's JWSS SDK v1.0 equips the 
developer with XML security functionality to decipher and verify the message 
contents," Negm added.</p>
<p>Forum Seamless Security Solutions Architecture (Forum S3A) is an adaptive 
approach to building security-minded service-oriented applications and 
data-level networks using life-cycle solutions including vulnerability 
management, testing systems, firewalls and gateways. Forum products are 
available as software, PCI-card and appliance options and comply with government 
requirements including CheckPoint OPSEC Certification, FIPS Certification, 
Common Criteria EAL 4+ (in process) and JITC DoD PKI Certification. Forum 
Systems is an active a member of OASIS and WS-I helping mature standards such as 
WS-I Basic Profiles, SAML and WS-Security. </p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" alt="bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Virtualization Software Allows SPARC Applications to Run on Linux</h3>
<p>Transitive Corp recently announced the first two products in its series of 
products that are being developed as part of its new Solaris/SPARC Migration 
Initiative: </p>
<p>-- QuickTransit for Solaris/SPARC-to-Linux/Xeon and <br>
-- QuickTransit for Solaris/SPARC-to-Linux/Itanium </p>
<p>Transitive Corp previously developed Rosetta which allows Macintosh 
applications written for the PowerPC chip to run on the new Intel-based versions 
of the Macintosh.</p>
<p>The new products are the first results of the collaboration with Intel 
announced in March of this year to accelerate the migration from RISC-based 
platforms to Intel-based platforms, and they allow Solaris/SPARC applications to 
run without any source code or binary changes on Linux/Xeon- and Linux/Itanium 
2-based servers respectively. The products dramatically reduce the barriers IT 
organizations face when migrating Solaris/SPARC workloads to Linux/Xeon- and 
Linux/Itanium-based servers. Future products will allow SPARC applications to 
run on various other hardware platforms. </p>
<p>"One of the biggest obstacles to migrating from one server to another is 
getting your internally developed and commercial applications ported to the new 
server," said Bob Wiederhold, President and CEO of Transitive Corporation. "In a 
large IT organization this can take years to accomplish. Since SPARC 
applications can now run on your target platform without the burden of porting, 
this migration barrier is eliminated and IT organizations can immediately 
realize the full benefits of their new strategic server platform." </p>
<p>Transitive's QuickTransit hardware virtualization products allow SPARC 
applications to run with full functionality, including interactive and graphics 
performance. The use of QuickTransit is completely transparent to the end-user 
and easily managed by IT system administrators. Commercial and in-house software 
development teams can easily support their applications with QuickTransit 
because no source code or binary changes are required. </p>
<p>Transitive expects to deliver the first  product, 
QuickTransit for Solaris/SPARC-to-Linux/Xeon, in Q3 2006.  The second 
product, QuickTransit for Solaris/SPARC-to-Linux/Itanium, is expected to be 
available by the end of the year 2006.

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" alt="bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">AMD to gradually introduce DDR3, FB-DIMM; will be used in next gen Cray supercomputer</h3>
<p>In a recent supercomputing win, AMD Opteron processors were selected for a 
multi-year contract that Cray, Inc. signed with Oak Ridge National Laboratory 
(ORNL) to provide the world's first petaflops-speed (1,000 trillion 
floating-point operations/second) supercomputer. The contract calls for 
progressive upgrades to ORNL's existing Cray XT3&trade; supercomputer, starting with 
Next-Generation AMD Opteron processors with DDR2 memory, followed by upgrades to 
use quad-core AMD Opteron processors, which will be socket compatible. These 
upgrades will accelerate peak speed to 250 teraflops (250 trillion 
floating-point operations per second), planned in late 2007. </p>
<p>ORNL is then expected to install a next-generation Cray supercomputer in late 
2008. This system, currently code-named 'Baker,' is designed to deliver peak 
performance of one petaflops, making it roughly three times faster than any 
existing computer in the world. All systems provided for in the contract will 
utilize current and future versions of the AMD Opteron processor. </p>
<p>At the May Processor Forum, Senior Fellow Chuck Moore described a gradual 
process of innovation for AMD multi-core chips. This involved supporting 
advanced RAM technology as the price points come down near current DDR2 pricing. 
</p>
<p>At the presentation, AMD indicated that new architecture products from Intel 
will roughly halve the power consumption advantage AMD now enjoys. AMD will add 
better power management to keep its lead on future products in the 2007 and 2008 
timeframe.</p>
<p>AMD also hopes to improve HyperTransport technology to handle up to 5.2 
gigatransfers per second. AMD is encouraging motherboard manufacturers to add 
HTX slots that use the high speed data transfers.</p>
<p>AMD has plans to add an on-chip L3 cache, shared by all CPU cores, while 
maintaining the localized L2 caches for each core. Depending on its size and the 
use of pre-fetch algorithims, this feature would keep CPU cores running longer 
between pipleline stalls.</p>
<p>AMD will simplify its product portfolio by dropping the 939 and 754 
processors in July and will offer steep discounts of up to 46% to stay ahead of 
Intel on chip pricing. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Intel may have delayed the anticipated shipment of its 'Conroe' 
Duo and Extreme processors by up to four days, according to Taiwanese 
manufacturers. [ But the delay was not officially confirmed by Intel. ] The 
graphics chipsets to support the CPUs will also have a July 27th ship date [and 
this may be the cause]. Also, its entry-level Celeron D 360 CPU, now the last 
part to use the Pentium 4 NetBurst microarchitecture, will be introduced on 
September 1. [So there may be a back-to-school price war in September.]
