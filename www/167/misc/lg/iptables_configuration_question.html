Hello list,
</p>

<p>
Hope you all are well. It is nearly 2 weeks I am working with iptables
configuration and stuck poorly at a very interesting point. Among
several others feature of my firewall, one I like to implement is
limit_total_connection_of_a_service. There is already rate-limiter like
a user can't get more than 2 ftp connection per min from the same source
IP. I have used hashlimit for this. It can also be extended to restrict
*all total*  2 connection per min . 
</p>

<p>
- But what to do to restrict all total 2 ftp connection from a particular source ?  
</p>

<p>
- And to restrict all together 5 ftp connection to the server ?
</p>

<p>
Could any one suggest a iptables configuration or iptables module to
achieve these two objectives ?  Thanks
</p>

<p>
PS: Please CC me.
</p>
