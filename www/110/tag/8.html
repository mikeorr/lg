<blockquote><em><font color="#006600">This started as a complaint about Mailman's administration interface. Over

Sure -- I was looking for something I could set WWW::Mechanize on
anyway. Does anyone have a sample setup I can be let loose on, because
Mandrake seem to have done a wonderful job of fucking up everything
related to email.

Awesome! Thanks, Jimmy; that damn thing <EM>is</EM> a regular pain. I wish
there was a way to tell Mailman to just delete every single one of them,
but I've never found a way to do so. This way, I can maybe cron it up
and forget about it.
</STRONG></P>

See the attached file for a sample. The only things that need to happen
are
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>a) The "Action to take" needs to be switched to "Discard", and
b) "Submit all data" needs to be triggered.

It's actually something I need to learn about at some point, so I'll be
very interested in what you code up.

All it does is check that a username and password have been passed, and
if so, regurgitate everything the script sent. It seems to work, based
on the HTML in that sample. If it doesn't work, uncomment the two
'print' statments and send me the results.

This is probably not what you want - you'll just get a hashref as a
result. However, just in case it <em>  is,  </em> for some reason, I'm sending the
output along (but I'll be tweaking the script so that it does produce
something useful from the above.)

I forgot to remove that from the original, when I thought I was using
basic authentication; it prints a hashref, but it also prints the HTTP
status code. Not something to rely on, but it worked well enough to let
me see where I was going wrong (I was forgetting to prepend 'Basic ' to
the base64 encoded user/pass pair).

Well, you said already that it's not getting inside the if statement, which
is strange. If it was that there was a missing value that needed to be
submitted to the form, that'd be one thing, but as it is, only the default
stuff is getting submitted.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Hang on... the first submit works, but that doesn't use
{name =&gt; adminpw, value =&gt; &quot;}, it's {adminpw =&gt; &quot;}; so maybe I should have
the array made up of {$regex_match =&gt; 3}. I'm not so hot with using anything
other than scalars, so you may need to fix the syntax inside the if statement.

Neither; you've never defined a %name hash. What you've got is a
reference named $name pointing to an anonymous hash. "fields" does
indeed expect a hashref, though. So,
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>$name-&gt;{$1} = 3;
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
should be simply
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>$name{$1} = 3;

and %name should be declared in a "my" somewhere; "fields" should point
to "\%name".

Heck, I've read the module docs by now. That's how I finally hammered my
end of it into shape. Actually, it looks like you should be able to do
the whole task with WWW::Mechanize (TokeParser is obviously needed
simply for its regex capabilities) - that might be worth looking at

I was thinking that too. The doubt that was lurking in the back of my mind
came out of hiding: it'd need something extra -- an option to pass message
ids to not delete. (Not a problem, it's just the nagging of the "you're
forgetting something" thought).

"do" is pretty special in Perl, and doesn't have anything to do with
conditionals (although it can be used with loops.) Sure, you can have
a statement block after "unless" (it's just syntactic sugar for "!if");
what you can't have is an "elseunless".  :)
