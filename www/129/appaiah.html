<h1>Making XMMS Effect plugins</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/appaiah.html">Kumar Appaiah</A></b></p>

<p>Most of us will agree that though there are many audio players for
GNU/Linux and the BSDs, the most popular by far is XMMS. Not only is it
similar to Winamp, which eases things for people coming from Windows, it
is also simple and has all the features one would expect in a complete
multimedia player. Best of all, it is extensible with additional plugins
for added functionality, file support, visualization and, of course, sound
effects.</p>

<p>In this article, I will present an introduction to some functions
provided in the XMMS plugin library for developing our own effects, along
with some useful techniques. Using an example (a simple echo plugin), I
shall walk through the steps, introducing the functions one by one. The
only requirement is that you should know C, but you needn't be an audio
engineer (I'm not one!) to be able to churn out some simple effects.</p>

<p>Before we begin - an effect plugin, or, for that matter, any other
plugin for XMMS, is a shared object (.so) file. Make sure you have
gcc, make and other development tools on you machine, along with the
XMMS plugin development headers and libraries.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>Check if the XMMS plugin library is installed already on your
system. The presence of headers, /usr/include/xmms or
/usr/local/include/xmms, is a good indication of this. If it isn't,
install the xmms-devel (or equivalent) package from your
distribution.</p>

<h3>Technique</h3>

<p>Though this article should be only about writing XMMS plugins, I
also thought that it would be appropriate to mention a buffering
technique used <em>all the time</em> in audio processing, called
<strong>circular buffers</strong>. In our case, let us say we want to
make the echo sound, say 370 ms (0.37 seconds) later. If we are
working with data sampled at 44100 Hz, then the size of the buffer
required would be 0.37 * 44100 = 16317 elements each for left and
right (assuming you are providing separate echoes for the two
channels). Now, the obvious way to solve our problem is, as soon as we
get a new sample, we can retrieve the most delayed sample from the
buffer for the echo effect, then shift the contents of the buffer so
that the second element goes to the first place, third to second and
so on and push the new sample to the last position, just like a FIFO
queue. However, this would mean about 16317 memory read and write
operations have to be executed for every sample processed, which is
quite expensive when it comes to CPU use.</p>

<p>A simple solution to this problem is to treat the buffer as
<em>circular</em>. Here, we create an index or pointer to the element (or
an index) in the buffer which you mark as the last element to be read for
the delay, read that element for the echo effect, write the new sample into
the <em>same</em> memory location, and increment the index. If the pointer
or index reaches the end of the array, it just loops back to the first
element. The following picture should give you an idea.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; padding: 10px;"><img alt="Circular buffer picture" title="Circular buffer picture"
src="misc/appaiah/circbuf.png" border="1" /></p>

<p>With this, we have reduced the memory operations per sample to just
one read and write; many times more efficient than the previous
case. For more details, see the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer">Wikipedia
article</a> on this topic.</p>

<h3>Writing the Plugin</h3>

<p>Now, we start writing a minimal plugin that will create a fixed echo
effect. The full source is available in <a
href="misc/appaiah/exampleecho.c.txt">exampleecho.c</a>.</p>

<p>A plugin is registered with XMMS
using the following function:</p>

<pre>
EffectPlugin
*get_eplugin_info(void);
</pre>

<p>First, we create the buffers for the echo effect. I have chosen a
16384-sample delay, which is about 0.37 sec. Since we will use these as
circular buffers, we shall keep two integers to index the location in the
buffers.</p>

<pre class="code">
#define BUFFER_LENGTH 16384

static gfloat *buffer_left = NULL;
static gfloat *buffer_right = NULL;
static guint index_left = 0;
static guint index_right = 0;
</pre>

<p>Now, we observe the requirements of the <tt>EffectPlugin</tt>
structure, defined in <tt>/usr/include/xmms/plugin.h</tt>:</p>

<pre class="code">
typedef struct
{
	void *handle;		/* Filled in by xmms */
	char *filename;		/* Filled in by xmms */
	char *description;	/* The description that is shown in the preferences box */
	void (*init) (void);	/* Called when the plugin is loaded */
	void (*cleanup) (void);	/* Called when the plugin is unloaded */
	void (*about) (void);	/* Show the about box */
	void (*configure) (void);	/* Show the configure box */
	int (*mod_samples) (gpointer *data, gint length, AFormat fmt,
	gint srate, gint nch);	/* Modify samples */
	void (*query_format) (AFormat *fmt,gint *rate, gint *nch);
}
EffectPlugin;
</pre>

<p>Though most of the functions specified are optional and you can
just make them NULL, we see that we need to write some functions for
our plugin to be useful. I will call these <tt>query</tt>,
<tt>init</tt>, <tt>cleanup</tt>, <tt>configure</tt>, <tt>about</tt>
and <tt>mod_samples</tt>, though you can name them whatever you like. Of
these, we will first write <tt>about</tt>, since it seems to be the
easiest!</p>

<pre class="code">
static char *about_text = "Kumar's test reverberation plugin!";

void
about(void)
{
	static GtkWidget *about_dialog = NULL;
	if (about_dialog != NULL)
		return;
	about_dialog = xmms_show_message("About Example Echo Plugin",
					 about_text, "Ok", FALSE,
					 NULL, NULL);
	gtk_signal_connect(GTK_OBJECT(about_dialog), "destroy",
			   GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC(gtk_widget_destroyed),
			   &amp;about_dialog);
}
</pre>

<p>Next, we write the <tt>query</tt> function. The query function
informs XMMS what type of audio data we wish to process. This is a
good idea, because our plugin may not function as expected for data
with different attributes, such as a different sampling rate. To make
it more clear, let us say we want an echo after 0.1 seconds, that is
0.1 * 44100 samples later when 44100 Hz is the sampling rate. But it
should be changed to 0.1 * 22050 for a file with 22050 Hz sampling
rate. Yes, it can be done on the fly, but I leave such tricks for you
to try out.</p>

<p>We'll make our plugin work with 16 bit little-endian stereo data,
sampled at 44100 (stereo) samples per second.</p>

<pre class="code">
void
query(AFormat *afmt, gint *s_rate, gint *n_channels) {
	*afmt = FMT_S16_LE;
	*s_rate = 44100;
	*n_channels = 2;
}
</pre>

<p>The <tt>init</tt> function is used to initialize your plugin's settings,
and you may also want to initialize your audio buffers here. This function
is called the moment the plugin is <em>enabled</em>, or whenever the plugin
loads (like when XMMS is started). In our plugin, we use two audio buffers
to hold past left and right samples, which need to be zeroed initially to
avoid &quot;noise&quot;. Note that <tt>g_malloc0</tt> is a GLIB function.
In general, it is convenient to use GLIB functions and data types, and
there are no extra requirements because XMMS needs them and uses them
anyway.

<pre class="code">
void init(void)
{
	if (buffer_left == NULL) {
		buffer_left = g_malloc0(sizeof(gfloat) * BUFFER_LENGTH);
	}
	if (buffer_right == NULL) {
		buffer_right = g_malloc0(sizeof(gfloat) *
		BUFFER_LENGTH);
	}
}
</pre>

<p>The <tt>cleanup</tt>, as the name very well suggests, is to free
any resources you might have allocated and prepare for releasing the
plugin. It is called the moment the plugin is disabled, or when XMMS
exits, if the plugin remains enabled at that time. Here, we just free
the buffers that we have allocated.</p>

<pre class="code">
void
cleanup(void)
{
	g_free(buffer_left);
	buffer_left = NULL;
	g_free(buffer_right);
	buffer_right = NULL;
}
</pre>

<p>The <tt>configure</tt> function is used to allow the user to modify
some characteristics of the plugin. It is called when the user clicks
"Configure" for your plugin in the Preferences dialog box. In our
plugin, I have left it blank, since I wanted to avoid adding a lot of
GTK code. However, this is fairly simple, and left as an exercise for the
reader. I would suggest that you refer the source of the plugins which
come with XMMS for ideas.</p>

<p>Note that the <tt>xmms_cfg_*</tt> functions make the use of the
XMMS configuration extremely easy, with XMMS doing the dirty work of
reading and writing the configuration file. They are present in
<tt>/usr/include/xmms/configfile.h</tt></p>

<p>Finally, we come to the most important function of the effect
plugin, <tt>mod_samples</tt>, in which the samples are provided and
are to be appropriately modified. The declaration of this function is
as follows:</p>

<pre>
gint
mod_samples(gpointer * d, gint length, AFormat afmt, gint srate, gint nch);
</pre>

<p>Here, <tt>d</tt> is the pointer to the data (samples), and length is the
number of bytes of data provided to the function in a given instance. This
function is called again and again with successive data; that is, in one
pass, you are provided the first set of samples, in the next one, the next
set of samples and so on, in order. The format of the data is given by the
<tt>AFormat</tt> value. By checking the <tt>afmt</tt> value, you can
dynamically adjust to changes in data type, etc.; however, we are going to
just assume it is what we specified in the <tt>query</tt> function.</p>

<pre class="code">
gint mod_samples(gpointer * d, gint length, AFormat afmt, gint srate, gint nch)
{
	/* Read data as 16 bit values */
	gint16 *data = (gint16 *) * d;
	gint i;

	/* We have "length" bytes, so "length / 2" samples */
	for (i = 0; i &lt; length / 2; i += 2) {
		gfloat echo_val;

		/* For the left sample */
		echo_val = buffer_left[left_index]; /* Retrieve delayed value */
		buffer_left[left_index++] = data[i]; /* Store latest sample */
		data[i] = (1 - ECHO_SCALE) * data[i] + ECHO_SCALE * echo_val; /* Set the echoed value */
		left_index = left_index % BUFFER_LENGTH; /* Circular buffer shift */
		/* Do the same for the right channel samples */
		echo_val = buffer_right[right_index]; /* Retrieve delayed value */
		buffer_right[right_index++] = data[i + 1]; /* Store latest sample */
		data[i + 1] = (1 - ECHO_SCALE) * data[i + 1] + ECHO_SCALE * echo_val; /* Set the echoed value */
		right_index = right_index % BUFFER_LENGTH; /* Circular buffer shift */
	}
	return length; /* Amount of data we have processed. */
}
</pre>

<p>We are expected to process the samples and write the modified
values back into the same memory locations. There are two things which
you must note here. First, since we have to process samples which are
16 bits (or two bytes) each, the number of samples is actually half
the number of bytes. So, <tt>length / 2</tt> is the actual number of
samples we have. That explains the cast to <tt>gint16</tt>. Also,
since we are handling stereo audio, successive samples alternate
between left and right. So, we actually have <tt>length / 4</tt>
number of left and an equal number of right channel samples, such that
<tt>data[0]</tt> is a left sample, <tt>data[1]</tt> is a right sample,
<tt>data[2]</tt> is a left sample, and so on.</p>

<p>Finally, we register the plugin with XMMS as follows:</p>

<pre class="code">
EffectPlugin e_plugin = {
	NULL,
	NULL,
	"Example Echo plugin",
	init,
	cleanup,
	about,
	configure,
	mod_samples,
	query};

EffectPlugin *
get_eplugin_info(void)
{
	return &amp;e_plugin;
}
</pre>

<h3>Build, install and test</h3>

<p>The compilation and linking is just like for any other shared
object file; note that we have to take care of the GTK and GLIB
dependencies. You can see the <a
href="misc/appaiah/Makefile.txt">Makefile</a> for details. I
also add a line to copy the plugin to <tt>$HOME/.xmms/Plugins/</tt>
after every compile. This ensures that I don't forget to put it there
manually after each build. It is very useful for testing!</p>

<p>I strongly recommend that you initially compile your plugin with
the <tt>-g</tt> option, so that you can debug it using
<tt>gdb</tt>. There are many ways to use <tt>gdb</tt> to debug the
plugin. I generally start <tt>gdb</tt> as <tt>gdb /usr/bin/xmms</tt>,
or find the PID of a running XMMS process and use <tt>gdb --pid
&lt;PID&gt;</tt>.</p>

<p>For best performance, once you are done with debugging the plugin,
recompile it with <tt>-O2</tt> or a similar optimization to allow the
compiler to optimize your code. You may also wish to consider using a
profiler to optimize the code further.</p>

<h3>Further details</h3>

<p>Now that you are ready and raring to write your own XMMS effect
plugins, enjoy yourself. I'd also recommend that you go through the
source code of various effect plugins available at <a
href="http://www.xmms.org/plugins.php?category=Effect">xmms.org</a> to
get an idea of the techniques and possibilites. Also, for serious DSP
advice, <a
href="http://groups.google.co.in/group/comp.dsp">comp.dsp</a> is
<em>the</em> place to go. <a href="http://www.dspguru.com">dspguru</a>
also has a good collection of DSP tricks and ideas. <a
href="http://www.harmony-central.com/">Harmony Central</a> is an
excellent place to learn more about artificial sound effects.</p>
