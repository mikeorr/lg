<I>Where will Linux be in two to three years?</I>

<UL>
   <LI><B>Sunil Saxena</B>:  ``It's all on my foil right here.''
      <UL>
         <LI>Among internets / intranets / ISPs, Linux will continue to grow,
             especially in corporate America; we'll see continued adoption.
         <LI>There will be new growth in the areas of E-commerce and
             business-to-business Internet EDI (electronic data exchange).
         <LI>It will start showing up in all sorts of Internet appliances,
             including wearable computers, video-conferencing systems, etc.
         <LI>We'll see 64-bit Linux on the IA-64 (Merced).
         <LI>Linux will move into the data center via high-availability clusters
             and 16- to 32-way SMP systems.
         <LI>Other spiffy features like I2O, hot swap, serial-based server
             management and control, etc., will be supported.
         <LI>Linux developers will be granted early access and increased access
             to specs and Intel engineers.
         <LI>``Please come talk to us and tell us what we can do.''
      </UL>
      <P>

   <LI><B>Larry Augustin</B>:
      <UL>
         <LI>One big prediction:  kernel 2.2 will be released within three
             years (``and that's pushing it'').  <FONT COLOR="#006600">[<I>much
             laughter</I>]</FONT>
         <LI>He also took the opportunity to thank Leonard Zubkoff for the
             four-way Xeon port being demoed by VA Research in the rear.
             Apparently he modified (added?) 20 lines of code at the last
             minute without even having all of the sources there.
      </UL>
      <P>

   <LI><B>Robert Hart</B>:
      <UL>
         <LI>Two to three years is an eternity for Linux--even a week is a long
             time.
         <LI>People are lazy, and laziness leads to creativity, which means
             great improvements for Linux.
         <LI>He again noted that it's the only non-MS operating system to gain
             market share and that it's being actively courted by large vendors
             such as Intel.  He also noted that it's generating strong media
             interest, and not only that, but the reporting is generally both
             accurate and useful.  (He thanked the representatives of the press
             in the audience.)
         <LI>There will be a strong showing of easy-to-use apps.
         <LI>Linux will be the dominant server platform, not just on Intel but
             across all platforms.  I believe he mentioned ``64-bit, 4-way
             Merced,'' too.
         <LI>He mentioned that it was Bastille Day and recalled how, in 1788
             and 1789, the people rose up and stormed the IT department and
             gave freedom to oppressed machines.  ``They even executed some
             people.''  But he disputed his own comparison and said that Linux
             isn't so much a revolution as an evolution; it didn't happen just
             once.
         <LI>He concluded by predicting that in two to three years, Linux will
             be ``very nearly everywhere.''
      </UL>
      <P>

   <LI><B>Linus Torvalds</B>:
      <UL>
         <LI>``I'm really bad at predictions.''  For example, a few years ago
             when he was asked about SMP support, his reaction was, ``I dunno,
             it's too expensive''; he said he didn't care much about it and
             didn't find it interesting.  But for the last year he's worked
             almost exclusively on SMP.
         <LI>2.2 <I>will</I> be out by then. <FONT COLOR="#006600">[<I>much
             more laughter</I>]</FONT>
         <LI>The kernel is really just a vessel for what one can do; he claimed
             that it was inappropriate to ask him such a question--``what's
             really exciting is apps'' (and the journaling file system is
             ``slightly exciting'').
         <LI>Servers will be big. <FONT COLOR="#006600">[<I>Do we sense a theme
             here?</I>]</FONT>
         <LI>The interesting part will be ``pretty'' apps that traditionally
             haven't been Unix-based.
      </UL>
      <P>

   <LI><B>Jeremy Allison</B>:
      <UL>
         <LI>He used to keep track of every minor release of every piece of
             free software; these days no one can do so for even 10% of it,
             and there be some incredibly cool things in that other 90%.
         <LI>Linux will be a ``killer server platform.''
         <LI>Everyone at Cisco Systems already use Linux every time they print,
             whether they know it or not.  <FONT COLOR="#006600">[<I>See
             <A HREF="http://laulujoutsen.pc.helsinki.fi/~mjr/linux/cola.archive/1998-07/mjr.1998-07-17.018"
             >this c.o.l.a announcement</A> for details about the printer-admin
             tool used at Cisco.</I>]</FONT>
         <LI>At least one major PC vendor will start shipping PCs with Linux
             pre-installed.  (And if not, Robert will start such a company...)
         <LI>With regard to applications, vendors are already ``not as greedy''
             as they've traditionally been on Unix systems; Linux apps are
             priced similarly to Wintel apps, not five times more.  Linux will
             be ``where the mothers are''--on the desktop--and one will be able
             to buy almost any app for Linux.
         <LI>Linux is likely to overtake something, but I missed what...
         <LI>And again, he predicted that Linux will be installed on 20% to 25%
             of shipping Intel systems.
