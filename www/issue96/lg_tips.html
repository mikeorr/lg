<P>
Of course a number change doesn't really mean all that much more than
that Linus Torvalds might be trying to push 2.6 out the door a little
faster than what happened with 2.4.  Also, for what it's worth, Joe
Pranevich has just put out a draft version of the Wonderful World of
Linux 2.6, posting this to the kernel list:

Hello,
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
I've recently put together the first draft of a features document
describing the changes in Linux 2.6. (I did similar documents for
both Linux 2.2 and Linux 2.4.) It's based almost entirely on
BitKeeper changelogs (with clarifying information pulled from the
lists and the web), so there is a chance that I misunderstood
something or that I missed something else entirely. Please give it
a look over and if you see anything that needs a look-over, please let
me know. As it stands now, I feel pretty good about how it
turned out so I'm finally comfortable mailing what I have around.
(There are still a couple areas that need expanding on, I think...)
</P>
<P>
As of right now, you can find the latest versions of the document
available online.

<P>
You need a new modutils variety entirely for 2.5x, and 2.6 kernels.
Under <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> the package name to fetch is called
module-init-tools

<A HREF="ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rusty/modules"

As <EM>LG</EM> goes to press the current available is 0.9.15-pre2.

The nice thing is, it doesn't conflict with modutils.

The current version of 2.6 (test 9) fixes some nasty memory leaks in the
VFS layer for filesystem management.  If you've been experimenting along in
the 2.5.x/2.6 series, an upgrade is highly recommended.

<P>
My solution may or may not be OK for you. I have a little P75 laptop that
acts as a NAT for my local area network. It runs <A HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</A> with user PPP. I
am unsure whether user PPP is available for Linux. Maybe you can use pppd
and ipchains (or whatever its called now).
</P>
<P>
User PPP is configured in "auto" mode such that a request makes it dial out
if its not connected. So if my wife requests an html page, PPP dials out,
connects, and she gets her page. She uses Windows and is NATed thru the
P75.
</P>
<P>
No users are on the P75. I have had two windows boxes, one <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A> box, and
the P75 (ntpd) all sharing the same internet connection concurrently.

So.. on localhost I should be able to do:
"ftp localhost 1234" and connect via ssh to remotehost ftp remote files.
The problem is, it doesnt work. Is such a thing possible?

is SSH2 only. Are you sure your connection is protocoll level 2? Check with
"-v".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To put localhost in there confused me for a moment, but it seems to be fine.
You might want to out a real hostname to make it less confusing. Assuming
your ssh is to the ftp-target "remotehost" would do fine.

I get the error:

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
it just sits there. ftp localhost 1234 gets me a ftp interface which is
unconnected. I don't have an ftpd running so I can't test further.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It would be a <EM>lot</EM> easier to answer anything if you would have sent the
error message or what exactly does not work.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I'm not familiar with the ssh2 "-s" option. I've never used it. But I've
successfully tunneled  (using -L) http, smtp, ssl-imap and news ports through
a firewall -- so basically it should work as long as ftp is in passive mode.

Reading through the answer to this question I noticed that the hyperlink

	>http://ltsp.org</A> was incorrect, included a &gt;, as well as the link for
SIAG office suite was completely wrong. He said <A HREF="http://www.siag.org"
	>http://www.siag.org</A> when
it should have been <A HREF="http://siag.nu"

OK, that "he" to which Dave refers was actually me. However, as this

Cool idea - thanks for voluntering! We'd love to have a proofreader. I

Hi,
</P>
<P>
I was reading comp.unix.programmer and came across a comment about setting
the LD_DEBUG environmental varible to 'help' and running a dynamic
executable. Okay, let's try it:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>~$ export LD_DEBUG=help
~$ ls
Valid options for the LD_DEBUG environment variable are:

  libs        display library search paths
  reloc       display relocation processing
  files       display progress for input file
  symbols     display symbol table processing
  bindings    display information about symbol binding
  versions    display version dependencies
  all         all previous options combined
  statistics  display relocation statistics
  help        display this help message and exit

To direct the debugging output into a file instead of standard output
a filename can be specified using the LD_DEBUG_OUTPUT environment variable.

Thanks, Jason - that's a really fine tidbit. It now reposes comfortably

If you are using evolution , then in your home directory you will find a
folder called evolution which will have all the mails + contacts + other
settings. If you want to just find your emails, you will find them in
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
~/evolution/local/Inbox .
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A piece of advice, if you back up your mail to a CD and then restore it,
you will have the files which are read-only. I would suggest that you
tar and gunzip your evolution folder before burning it to the CD , that
way your file-permissions will be preserved.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Thomas] 
Actually, that is inaccurate -- one <EM>can</EM> preserve permissions on CD quite
easily, if they're copied with "cp -p". Also, why put them on CD at all?
You could easily move them to another partition, which would preserve file
permissions as well.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[JimD]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
More obviously you can simply create an archive (tar, cpio, dump, pax)
which will preserve the ownership and permissions.  That's what Unix
archives do, archive data with meta-data.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Then burn the .tar (or whatever) file into your CDR.  Basically you'll
create an ISO containing just one or a few archive files.

are more than that it's a popular programming and scripting exercise.
</P>
<P>
Almost all of them are simply GUI, command line or curses (text dialog)
driven front ends to Joerg Schilling's cdrecord and mkisofs
Some also support cdrdao, mkybrid, or related command line tools.
</P>
<P>
As for DVD-R/RW and DVD+R/RW drives, the support for them seems to be
a bit sketchy.  I think they're getting closer but I still haven't
gotten my Ikebana DVD+R/RW drive working yet (except as a CD-R/RW).

<BR>Question by Hans Borg (Hans.Borg from physics.umu.se)

<P><STRONG>
Sorry if this is not a "pure" linux item, but I take the chance.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Am trying to convert (import) Eudora (version 3.0.5) .mbx files to the <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A>
Kmail. For this  I have used the Eudora2Unix.py script. That seems to
work. It reports eg. 529 messages found for a given "folder".
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The problem: When having moved the converted .mbx to the appropriate
Kmail folder, I only see the first mail. I can guess that it depends on
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
the fact that Kmail keeps each mail in a separate file, while my Eudora
stacks them in a single file referred to as folder (thus not a real
folder in normal terminology). It should not be too hard to split the
messages into separate files, but then comes the file naming convention
in Kmail. What I have seen, it looks like a fancy (many digits) running
number.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
So, have I missed something with Kmail (option to set) or are there any
s/w available to fix eg. messages -&gt; separate-files.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Hoping for some hints.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Have you tried kmailcvt?
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks for your answer.
I have found out the problem. KMail have two folder modes,
maildir and mbox. I happened to move the Eudora mbox folder
into a KMail maildir folder.

Ahhh, I see; it's sort of like Ian MacDonald's bash-completion package.
It adds context sensitive completions and adds support for displaying
the docstrings (.<EM></EM>doc__ attributes for any function, module, or class)
and apparently it displays the function signatures (argument list)
as well.

I'll have to play with it.

to read them.  Basically the first one should explain the concepts and

the problem, and the others may help if you're still fighting with it
beyond that.  In other words, I don't expect you to read all of those,
just read enough to solve the problem (or at least to be able to better
explain it).

<BR>Question by Mythili Srinivasan (s_mythili from da-iict.org)

<P><STRONG>
Hi!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I'm in need of your help. I'm trying to flash some programs into
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Simputer and tried using pfc. The configuration for serial communication
is 115200/9600 baud and I get the following response on pfc's debug window.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Debug Messages are Displayed Here..
</STRONG></P>
<P>
At first it wasn't clear how this is Linux-y...
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>&gt; Using port /dev/ttyS0
<br>&gt; Please wait... Initializing....
<br>&gt; This will take about a minute..
<br>&gt; []
<br>&gt; []
<br>&gt; [This is a PicoPeta Simputer...you are assimilated]
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
:D
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>&gt; Simputer booted
<br>&gt; Preparing...
<br>&gt; Sending [init 2]
</font></code></blockquote>
<P><STRONG>
At this time the progress bar stops and the application hangs forever.
Similarly, when I tried using minicom(9600 8N1),I get response from
simputer till the 'Simputer login' prompt and when I entered the login
name, the getty process in Simputer doesn't respond with authetication
validation or anyother message it is suppose to send. I saw the
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Is it expecting a PPP connection?  or does it have the wrong parity and
databits setting?
</P>
<P><STRONG>
rc.sysinit file which spawned a getty with 9600 baud... As in someother
place where I was looking for the solution mentioned that we got to set
the serial port for 115200 baud, I tried to change in the file even
after providing write permission but couldn't write on to the file. So,
</STRONG></P>
<P>
You almost certainly have to be root to write into <TT>/etc/inittab</TT>, and I
cannot imagine any good reason that a regular user account should have
writable access to it.
</P>
<P>
rc.stsinit itself might not be the right place to put this.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I killed the old getty process and spawned one with the new baud rate.
Set the ispeed and ospeed to same... But,it doesn't work. One thing
clean about the scenario is that from simputer the messages reach the PC
which the other way it is not. It would be of great help if I can get it
working.
Thanks in Advance.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
regards,
<BR>Mythili
</STRONG></P>
<P>
The most popular program to run on Linux boxes to answer on their serial
port, is called 'mgetty'.  It has a man page which is amazingly enough,
usually kind of useful, and the typical <TT>/etc/inittab</TT> has an example line
about how to activate it, commented out.  getty is good, but mgetty has
some special features for dealing with serial lines.
</P>
<P>
115200 is a common max speed for old style serial ports.  9600 is the
bits frequency if using common voice (300 baud or so) with a fairly
popular old line discipline to get bits on different parts of the
carrier wave.  Compression tricks are most of what gives faster modems
their claimed speed.
</P>
<P>
Hope that helps.

iam unable to access it through telnet as superuser.

<P>
Access which one of those two?

<P>
Maybe you are trying to login as "root" directly at the telnet login. This is
not allowed. You can login as an user and then change to root by using the "su"
command.

I know very little about Linux. I've ran it a few years ago on a 386.

Windows applications reliably?

Umm, I think <EM>reliably</EM> is the operative word. If it is stability you're
after then I would recommend running that application in its native
environment -- windows. However to answer your question, <A HREF="http://www.winehq.com/">WINE</A> is what

<P>
If your main home network is a wireless network, you don't want to
wake up in the morning and find some joker has printed many pages of
stuff to your networked printer. Put the printer on a wired, private
network segment, and print to it with ssh.
</P>
<P>
To do this, install this script as lpr on your wirelessly connected
laptop:

</P>
<P>
If you have a lengthy command-line task, such as building complicated
software, and need to catch an error that whizzes by in the middle,
use script. It will run a shell and log all input and output to a file
called "typescript" that you can then search or submit with a bug

<h4 align="center"><br>Cure Num Lock Madness
</h4>
<P>
When you boot Linux, the kernel turns off Num Lock by default. This
isn't a problem if, for you, the numeric keypad is the no-man's-land
between the cursor keys and the mouse. But if you're an accountant, or
setting up a system for an accountant, you probably don't want to turn
it on every single time.
</P>
<P>
Here's the easy way, if you're using <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A>. Go to K --&gt; Preferences --&gt;
Peripherals --&gt; Keyboard and select the Advanced tab. Select the radio
button of your choice under NumLock on KDE startup and click OK.
</P>
<P>
If you only run KDE and want Num Lock on when you start a KDE session,
you're done. Otherwise, read on.
</P>
<P>
To set Num Lock on in a virtual console, use:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>setleds +num
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
If you choose to put this in a .bashrc file to set Num Lock when you
log in, make it:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>setleds +num &amp;&gt; /dev/null
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
...to suppress the error message you'll get if you try it in an xterm or
over an SSH connection.
</P>
<P>
Finally, here's the way to hit this problem with a big hammer--make
the numeric keypad always work as a numeric keypad in X, no matter
what Num Lock says. This will make them never work as cursor keys, but
you're fine with that because you have cursor keys, right? Create a
file called .Xmodmap in your home directory, and insert these lines:

The last line takes the now-useless Num Lock key and makes it an extra
Escape key. If your favorite accounting software uses one of the F
keys frequently, you might prefer that.
</P>
<P>
The number to the left of the equals sign is an X "keycode", the key
on the keyboard you pressed, and the number or name to the right is an
X "keysym", the character or function X thinks it is. You don't have
to look these up in some X manual. To find out the keycode and keysym
for any key, run xev in an xterm, move the mouse to the small white
xev window and watch the keycodes and keysyms scroll by in the xterm.

<HR width="10%" align="center">
<h4 align="center"><br>SSH a little too forward, use more keys
</h4>
<P>
If you'd like to do SSH port forwarding with a passphrase, but require
a passphrase to run commands, make a separate key for port forwarding
only.
</P>
<P>
Dramatis personae
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>   dmarti: example user name
<br>   bilbo: your desktop system
<br>   frodo: host running sshd
<br>   linuxjournal.com: some web site
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
Port forwarding also is called tunneling, so I'll call the key
"tunnel". cd to your .ssh directory and create the key:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>dmarti@bilbo:~/.ssh$ ssh-keygen -t dsa -f tunnel
Generating public/private dsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in tunnel.
Your public key has been saved in tunnel.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
77:b4:02:d9:32:c2:cc:18:58:c3:23:0a:13:46:a7:fa dmarti@capsicum
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
Now edit tunnel.pub and add the following options to the beginning of
the line:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>command="/bin/false",no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-pty
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
That means this key is no longer any good for anything but port
forwarding, because the only command it will run is <TT>/bin/false</TT>, and it
won't forward X or agent commands.
</P>
<P>
sshd understands the options only when reading the key from
authorized_keys, but if you put the options into the original .pub
file, they'll stay with the key wherever it goes.
</P>
<P>
Now copy tunnel.pub to the end of your .ssh/authorized_keys at all the
hosts to which you want to tunnel, and try it:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>dmarti@bilbo:~$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/tunnel frodo
Connection to zork.net closed.
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
No errors, nothing runs; that's what you want. If you get errors, you
may have mangled the authorized_keys file on the server end; if you
get a shell you need to check and fix the options.
</P>
<P>
Another possibility is that if you're running with ssh-agent and have
the SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment variable set, you could be using a key
provided by ssh-agent instead of the one on the command line. Put env
-u in front of the command line to be sure not to use the agent.
</P>
<P>
Tunnel time! Let's use the long-suffering linuxjournal.com web server
as a guinea pig and make a tunnel:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>dmarti@bilbo:~$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/tunnel -N -L 8000:linuxjournal.com:80 frodo
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
To review that command line:
</P>

<blockQuote><ul>
<LI>-i ~/.ssh/tunnel to use our tunnel-only ssh key

<LI>-N to not run a command (this is necessary, otherwise SSH will run
       only /bin/false and exit)

<LI>-L 8000:linuxjournal.com:80 to forward local port 8000 to port 80
       on linuxjournal.com.

<LI>And finally, the hostname to which we're making the connection--it
       doesn't have to be the same as the host to which we're tunneling.
</ul></blockQuote>
