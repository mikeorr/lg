OK, Here's a quick one for you.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I mostly use Blackbox as my window manager, and it doesn't come with a <EM>lot</EM>
of tools. Often, I need to view a calendar, and since there's no native
calendar function for Blackbox, I quickly invented one.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
It consists of two parts:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
Part 1 is a script that I call ~/bin/Xcal. It displays the results from cal(1)
in an xmessage window, and has buttons to move forward and backward through
the yearly calendar, and a button to quit the calendar completely.
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
This script looks like...
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>  [exec] (Calendar)  {~/bin/Xcal }
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
And that's it. One click brings up the calendar for the current year. I can
move backwards and forwards in it, a year at a time, and dismiss it when I'm
done. A simple, straight forward, lightweight solution to my desk calendar
requirements.

One comment/question
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
In blackbox, the window controls (i.e. "kill client" or the "x" close button)
won't terminate the script. That's because the exit status isn't one of the
three in the list.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
So, try this tweak...

Seems like just changing 'Quit' to '*' should do it - since any option
other than 'Next' or 'Prev' should exit.
</blockQuote>
<P><STRONG>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> 
Yes. I thought of that. The only reason I coded it the way I did was for the
convenience of the next 'tweaker'.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
If I dropped the "Quit" regex from the case statement, it wouldn't be clear as
to how the xmessage Quit option is handled. OTOH, adding a match all ('*')
regex gives the next tweaker the clue that there are conditions other than
'Quit' that can (or should) cause the script to exit.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
In any case, the next tweaker might decide that the exit status from a WM
cancel should be different than the exit status from a 'Quit' button press,
and recode the case statement to something like...
</STRONG></P>

Note that with the '-default
Quit' option, even hitting 'Enter' while Xcal has the focus will cause
it to exit.
</blockQuote>
<P><STRONG>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> 
True, but I didn't try that :-)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I tried clicking the WM 'kill client' decoration instead, and the script
didn't exit.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Never overestimate the end user's capabilities. I've learned that in my other
life (an 'IT Specialist' for a large Canadian bank, and a specialist in
banking application programming). ;-)

[grin] That's my take on what I do, too. It's one of those <EM>good</EM>

Since you've mentioned calendars, does anyone know of any calendar programs
that can deal with recurring events without having to use ical?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
My work schedule looks like this:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
(Beginning June 6th on week 1 (i.e. I'm on Week 4 now), where the hours are
7.20 [AP]M to 7:50 [PA]M, except for one day)
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>        Fri  Sat  Sun  Mon  Tue  Wed  Thu
Week 1  PM   PM   PM             AM   AM
Week 2                 PM   PM   PM   PM
Week 3
Week 4  4pm  AM   AM   AM   AM
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
Is there anything around that can take a simple, text input and show what
hours I'm working on a given date? The ical-based calendars mostly work, but
most don't really handle overnight events and those that do take too bloody
long to set up.
</STRONG></P>

There's the motif-based application: "plan".

Damn. I meant to say 'console-based'. I might give it a look, even if it
does need such an obscure library :)

plan <EM>has</EM> a commandline interface for a quick check of appointments and
I think even setting.... yes: manpage has plenty of commandline options.
Give it a go, but the "gui" is motif based. The whole is in three parts,
the plan program, a deamon doing the "alarms" and a notifier popping up
the alarm windows. It can also send mail.

Compiles with lesstif, too.  (Ugly as sin, either way.)

I used to use the clunky old thing at a prior firm.  Frankly, I
much preferred my PalmPilot.

A while ago, I saw a CGI prog that was intended to demonstrate the Palm
- and did a pretty darned good job of it, if I recall correctly (it's
one of the things that helped me make up my mind about buying one, back
when.) Let's see if I can still Google well...

Ah, there it is:

Looks cool. Haven't tried it out yet, but calendaring is on the TODO
