<P> Because the baby-boom generation will soon be the senior population, 
the market for voice-activated telephone services will be tremendous.  An 
open-minded company such 
as IBM or Hewlett-Packard will surely find a way to meet the market demand.
     What is needed by this aging population is a unified messaging system --
preferably voice-activated -- that lets the user check for caller ID, receive 
short messages, check for incoming and outgoing e-mail, access address books 
for both telephone numbers and e-mail addresses, and place telephone calls.  

<P>  Everything that is now done by typing and text will be more quickly and 
easily performed with voice recognition.  That is, a voice will identify a 
caller, read short messages aloud, provide e-mail services in both 
text-to-voice reading of the incoming e-mail and voice-to-text for outgoing 
e-mail, voice access of address books, and voice-activated placing phone calls
(and ending them when you're done).   
         Once the users are able to answer, make and end a call using just 
their voices, working with the telephone will be a breeze and seniors will 
not feel isolated and lonely.  What a boon to society voice-activated 
telephone services will be.  
     Whether or not users are at all computer-savvy, e-mail will also be an 
option applied to the telephone.  It is, after all, a form of communication 
as is the telephone. It is a Linux-based unified communication system. 

<P>  Of great value to the user would be e-mail and its corresponding address 
book.  As e-mail comes  in, messages could be read by way of  a text-to-voice 
method.  
Also of great value would be a telephone system with its corresponding 
address book and numbers.  Short messaging could be read through 
text-to-voice technology and short messages can be left using voice-to-text 
methodology.

<P> One of the most advanced and productive uses of such simple Linux-based 
communication devices is to search the web without going on-line to a  search 
engine. Instead, one can just send an e-mail to Agora in Japan and do multiple
Google searches with a single e-mail. You do not even need a browser.  For
example, we are interested how Linux has been recently doing in the press in
connection with the life sciences and medical applications. Just send a single
e-mail to a free service such as <STRONG>Agora at dna.affrc.go.jp</STRONG>.

In the body of a single e-mail one can put a number of searches. Of course, 
one can modify the search terms:

<PRE>
Send http://www.google.com/search?q=Linux+press+2003+life*sciences\&amp;num=50

Send http://www.google.com/search?q=Linux+press+2003+medical*devices\&amp;num=50

Send http://www.google.com/search?q=Linux+press+2003+telemedicine\&amp;num=50
</PRE>

Within thirty minutes or so, depending on the time of the day and
the load the Agora server is under, you get a number of e-mails back, one for 
each send command in your email. Each e-mail lists the URLs, accompanied by a 
one-paragraph review of the corresponding web site, which fits the keywords 
one has specified in the send command. Then just simply select the reference 
number next to the URL you are interested in and list them in a reply email 
back to Agora, and they will send the web page you have selected. Or you can 
use the deep command to get the entire web-site for the URL. To learn more 
send a Help e-mail to the Agora server for details.

<P> How productive one can get, but do not abuse these fine services since 
they are for the researchers. Use it when it's nighttime in Japan: after 7pm on
the US west coast, after 4pm on the US east coast, and after 11am in western
Europe.

<P>  Anything that allows independence for the user is bound to be helpful to 
every aspect of society.
 
<P>  With the attractive price of a Linux-based unified communication device 
encompassing all the applications mentioned above, users can be connected and 
productive without the need for an expensive Windows system.  

<H2>Resources</H2>

<P> There's a list of Agora and www4mail servers at
<A HREF="http://www.expita.com/servers.html">http://www.expita.com/servers.html</A>.
Two other (less reliable) Agora servers are <STRONG>agora at kamakura.mss.co.jp</STRONG>
(Japan) and <STRONG>agora at www.eng.dmu.ac.uk</STRONG> (UK).  

<P> Www4mail is a very modern type of server that works similar to Agora.
Two servers the author has tested are <STRONG>www4mail at kabissa.org</STRONG> and
<STRONG>www4mail at web.bellanet.org</STRONG>.  Send an e-mail with the words
"SEND HELP" in the body for instructions.
