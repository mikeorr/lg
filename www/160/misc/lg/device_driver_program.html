<p>
Hello,
</p>

<p>
 I have read the article of yours from
<a href='../../../136/anonymous.html'>http://linuxgazette.net/136/anonymous.html</a> . Sounds interesting and it was
very informative too. Thanks for sharing it.
</p>

<p>
I have a requirement, i need a device driver program which reads ctrl
+k, this key sequence will send a SIGUSR1 signal to another
application program which will just do a multiplication or sort of few
numbers once its recieve the SIGUSR1 signal.
</p>

<p>
We have written the application program, which is pretty easy though. Now in
need of a device driver program which reads ctrl + m and send SIGUSR1
signal.
</p>

<p>
I will be really thankful if you could help me in this.
</p>

No, what you have is homework - and you're trying to get someone else to
do it for you. Please stop doing that.
</p>

<p>
That's in your interest, too: if your professor happens to read the
Linux Gazette, he's going to see your name, find out that you tried to
cheat, and... well. I know what I would do if I was in his position.
Suffice it to say that you would be a very, very unhappy student - and
so would the person paying your tuition.

<p>
I'll give you a hint: you don't need a "device driver program" to
intercept keystrokes. Study the source code for "xev" and "showcode" for
ideas. You'll still be cheating to an extent, but at least you will have
done <em>some</em> work in order to get there - and you might even end up
learning something by doing so.

Ben, you're a true educator!!!!! Wish we have more like you in our

longer.

Hello Ben,
</p>

<p>
Oh no!!... I am not a school student anymore , i have been working with one
of the leading software companies in India for the past 4.5 years. So no
cheating business<img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
I am working in embedded firmware testing all these while, so i have
actually knowledge in tcl and shell script, not in C. I do know C but not
the very extent that i could write a  device driver program.
</p>

<p>
Wondering why i need this program?  its for actually our internal
requirement.
Anyway i understand your emotions, but you made the statements too
early without knowing the fact.<img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
It would be great if you[or anyone] could help, else thanks a lot for the
article and your reply.
Thanks and Regards,
Maneesh

That's interesting. How is it that someone supposedly working in the
field - a programmer, no less - can be unaware of standard methods for
writing a program? The language is irrelevant; the process varies very
little. You show absolutely no understanding of that basic principle;
score -100 on the believability scale.
</p>

<p>
Next, the "problem" that you're asking about is purely a learning
exercise. There has never been, and there will never be a company with a
desperate need like this:
</p>


<pre>
&gt; &gt;    i need a device driver program which reads ctrl
&gt; &gt;    +k, this key sequence will send a SIGUSR1 signal to another
&gt; &gt;    application program which will just do a multiplication or sort of
&gt; &gt;    few numbers once its recieve the SIGUSR1 signal.
</pre>

<p>
...unless your company's name is 'SIGUSR1 Generators' or something
similar. That's another -100, right there.
</p>

<p>
So, did I speak too soon? Well, no: you tried to "explain" your
situation too late. If I catch someone in the act of sneaking off with
my wallet in their pocket, I'm fully justified in assuming that they're
a thief - although I'd be willing to listen to their story about how
they were REALLY just trying to save my life because the Martians were
about to invade our planet and were going to kill everybody with this
kind of wallet in their pocket. This would at least entertain me while I
handed the jerk over to the cops (or, if I was feeling merciful, just
took my wallet back and left the print of my big shoe on his ass.)
</p>


<pre>
&gt;    Wondering why i need this program?  its for actually our internal
&gt;    requirement.
</pre>

<p>
Uh-huh. Maneesh, "internal requirement" might impress somebody else -
but for me, "I need it because we need it" is just another strike
against your believability.

It is if you do APL.  The APL community prefers its recruits to know
nothing about programming whatsoever, because it is so conceptually
different.

That's a tradition here at LG: even if we have to administer a spanking,
we try to make sure that it has some value. We've had a number of
querents on this list who very wisely decided to stop doing the wrong
things and keep on doing the right ones; they've done well as a result.
</p>

<p>
In that vein, I strongly suggest reading "Asking Questions of The Answer
Gang" at '<a href='../../../tag/ask-the-gang.html'>http://linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html</a>'. This should be
helpful not only here, but in any help forum.

I try to do my best, although sometimes I feel like I'm pushing that big
rock up the mountain for the thousandth time. In some places, it seems,
cheating is an ancient institution - and it's not about to go away since
it does pay off in the short term. I won't go off on a rant of my own
about how that becomes a race to the bottom, with bad money driving out
good money and so on.

It's fine by me; I have my own kit of rants that pop up once in a while.
