Hey guys:

I'm just getting 'round to reading this months Gazette.  Anyway, about the
'talk' and 'talkd' issue, make sure you also mention that probably every
distribution these days disables 'messages', which means that users wouldn't
even be notified that someone is trying to 'talk' with them.  Check it with
an xterm or in console:

Actually, it is the default for it to be on, for any Linux system that I
have come across, but I am not going to argue the point.

The way I <EM>fixed</EM> this issue was to modify my global preference file
'<TT>/etc/profile</TT>' (within <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> systems):
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>EDITOR=/usr/bin/vim
PAGER=/usr/bin/less

umask 002

mesg y

Adding it to <TT>/etc/profile</TT> is not something <EM>I</EM> would do - it should not
be a system-wide policy - making it a local user issue is a better idea.
Leave your poor users alone.

WHOOPS. As Thomas has already pointed out, this is a <EM>very</EM> poor
practice in most cases. There's not much wrong with setting the PAGER to
"less", but making "vim" the default editor means that new users can get
horribly confused by an unresponsive beeping application that they don't
know how to exit. Worse yet, setting the umask to 002 sets up a security
risk every time a user creates a file - one of which they will usually
be unaware. These things should not be set by <EM>policy</EM> (i.e., in
<TT>/etc/profile</TT>) but via an <em>  informed,   per-user   decision;  </em> that's why
individual .profile mechanisms exist.

By adding the last line to your 'profile', users messages are turned on by
default.  I also modify my local '~/.bash_profile' file with the same entry
since <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> and friends sometimes don't play nice with the global settings

Admittedly, setting a global "mesg y" is not something that'll
accidentally destroy the world, but tweaking <TT>/etc/profile</TT>, as a rule of
thumb, is to be approached with much forethought, trepidation, and a
stout shock prod.

As to why KDE is ignoring this, you need to make sure that you either
start $SOME_TERMINAL_EMULATOR invoked as a login shell, so that the
global files are read. Or, alternatively, source ~/.bashrc from
~/.x{session,initrc}

<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Ben] 
Thomas, to the best of my knowledge, <TT>/etc/profile</TT> is read as soon as you
log in, as long as your login shell is anything that had the Bourne
shell in its family tree. The question of whether you ran an xterm or
not shouldn't even be applicable. Do you have some information to the
contrary?
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

It is if you login to a console -- <EM>not</EM> via a DM. Kdm and friends are
notorious for this. This is why so many people get confused as to why
their nice $PS1 prompts don't appear in xterms and the like.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
So you either force the shell to be a login-shell, or if you have
defined various environment vars in ~/.bashrc, to source this from
within ~/.x{session,initrc}

Wow, <EM>evil</EM>. I've got to say that I'm a bit shocked - why the heck would
they break a working system that way?
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
All the more reason I'm glad I've avoided *dm for all these years,
then...

	> [Thomas] 
Break? No, That's <EM>exactly</EM> the way it should be, Ben. Sure, when you
open up an xterm, the subshell is supposed to be inheriting environment
variables from somewhere, but then that's why the user sets it up.

<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

The broken part is, why would it have to be set up twice? If I've spent
time configuring my CLI environment, it shouldn't change if I decide
that I now want to start X via *dm. Sure, sourcing the rc files from
~/.xsession isn't that hard - but you have to know enough to do it.

<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

The X startup files are <EM>not</EM> supposed to source anything shell related such
as <TT>/etc/profile</TT> by default. Why? It has no reason to -- <EM>that</EM> operation
is to do with shells only.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Of course, as I have said, this is where ~/.xsession shines.

Except that, by allowing the user to log in <EM>without</EM> doing so, it now
changes his environment without any reason for it - and violates the
programming principle of doing "the least unexpected" thing.

As far as I can see, this is one of those "active developer/backward
compatability" (AD/BC) issues. The AD wanting to move to GUI (yes, it
<EM>was</EM> a while ago but we CLI types don't die easy 
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">) Unfortunately,
when the "shell" was designed it was assumed (ah-ha!) that no one would
run programs (except daemons) other than from the command-line or from
other running programs and so on recursively.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
One solution. Have a file say $HOME/.environ and ensure that it is
sourced at all session-startups CLI or GUI.
</blockQuote>

<font color="#660000"><blockquote><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Thomas] But this is why /etc/environment is used. If PAM is setup to use it, then it will. We're fortunate that /etc/environment in this instance is the only shell-agnostic file available. So it is ideal for these sorts of situations. Although it should not be mis-used. It's also not very portable.

So why not use $HOME/.profile instead. Not because of (t)csh folks 
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
The problem would be that a .profile could do a number of CLI specific
thnigs---in fact shell users have had extremely complicated .profile's in
the past. It is a mess as any AD/BC issue generally is.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The problem with TLU thing is to decide who the target user is---the one
who read the part of the manual which said "keep .profile simple" or the
one who read the juicy bits about all the fancy features of the latest
shell and didn't enclose those in "if [ -n "$PS1" ] ... fi". The latter's
X session will probably crash if her/his .profile is sourced.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I think there was long thread on Debian once about <TT>/etc/environment</TT> but
IIRC the idea was dropped. Perhaps (I tremble to start another war here)
PAM's session mechanism could be used to setup session variables.

Heh, I avoided *dm's too until I started back to scewl (~40ish hippie strikes
again).  I was using pure Debian, then I upgraded entire system hardware and
decided to use <A HREF="http://www.libranet.com/">LibraNet</A>.  I was so pleased with Libranet that I put it on my
new-2-me laptop too.

This has been an interesting thread.  Thanks for the responses.

One trick I learned about for KDE's Konsole is adding
"%i %m -ls" to the Command stanza on the Execute tab (Properties).  With this
little tweak, the .rc files are read on launch.  My brother added some very
handy Debian-centric stuff that I'm lost without these days, and it's nice to
be able to use Konsole with its tabbing capabilities.  If I was a better
person, I'd spend some time to learn what each of those little dewhickymobobs
do!
