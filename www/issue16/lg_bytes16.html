Hardware Forums in Dallas, Texas
</H3>
<p> Readers in the Dallas, Texas area may be interested in two forums for
purchasing hardware that may not exist in other areas. The first is the
North Texas PC Users Group meeting. This monthly meeting is held at the
Infomart in Dallas (I-35E at Oak Lawn). The meeting is held on one
Saturday a month and opens at 8:00 AM. A number of reputable local
vendors show up to sell hardware and software. (In fact, a few months
ago the vendor area was moved from the basement to a larger room because
they were running out of space.) Prices at the NTPCUG meeting are
generally cheaper than these vendors have in their own stores, and these
vendors offer warranties and support as well. Call NTPCUG at ? to find
out when the next meeting is. And stop by the local Linux User's Group
booth and say hi, or ask them to load Linux on your newly purchased
machine for free.
<p> The other venue is truly unique. The First Saturday Sale is a monthly
flea market held (surprise) on the first Saturday of every month. It is
held outdoors under the Ross Street bridge. Take the Pearl Ave. exit to
get there. Hang a left on Ross and follow the crowd. Selling officially
starts at 6:00 AM, but feel free to show up earlier.  
Again, many of the vendors own local storefronts and offer
the same service and warranty their storefront customers receive.
<p> While these markets may not be the best place for a beginner to shop, a
knowledgeable buyer can walk away from either of these markets with a
crate of new gear at significant discounts.

Linus News
</H3>
 
<p>Linus Torvalds
received Uniforum's "Lifetime Achievement Award" for his work on Linux.
<p>Linus (as always) pointed out that he would accept the award, but that it
really belonged to the entire Linux development community.
<p>The award, which has been presented annually since 1983, recognizes individuals
or groups whose work has significantly advanced the cause of open systems over
time, or has had an immediate and positive impact on the industry with long
term ramifications.
<p>To give the idea of others who have received it, James Gosling also accepted
an award at this meeting for his work on Java.  Linus was in good company.

SafePassage Web Proxy
</H3>

<p>Oakland, CA -- C2Net Software, Inc., and UK Web, Ltd., announced 
the 1.0 release of a new product, "SafePassage Web Proxy." This
product, developed entirely outside of the United States, provides
full-strength, non-escrowed cryptography for users of any standard
web browser.

<p>SafePassage is an enhancement for "export" browsers, an add-on product
that works with any standard web browser. Acting as an intermediary,
or proxy, it intercepts weakly encrypted connections on their way out
and transforms them to use full-strength cryptography.  "The weak
connection never leaves your PC," explains Parekh, "it gets decrypted
and then re-encrypted with a full-strength cipher."

<p>SafePassage provides secure connections using strong cryptography for
any browser that supports standard SSL tunneling, a feature normally
used by firewall software. It currently runs on Windows 3.1, Windows
95, and Windows NT.

<p>Evaluation versions of SafePassage can be downloaded at no cost from
UK Web's site at:<a href="http://stronghold.ukweb.com/safepassage"> http://stronghold.ukweb.com/safepassage</a> It is
currently unavailable for distribution within the US and Canada, but a
domestic version will be made available in the near future. A single-
user license is $49, prices for volume licensing start at $995 for
fifty users.

Announcing Ghostscript System 0.2.0
</H3>

  <p>The Display Ghostscript System is a free software implementation of a
Display PostScript(tm) System.  A Display PostScript System provides a
device-independent imaging model for displaying information on a screen.
The imaging model uses the PostScript language which has powerful
graphics capabilities and frees the programmer from display-specific
details like screen resolution and color issues.

 <p>The Display Ghostscript System is composed of a PostScript
interpreter (Ghostscript), the Client library, and the pswrap
translator.

  <p>The Display Ghostscript System uses a client/server architecture.
Applications are linked with the Client library which communicates with
the PostScript interpreter residing in the server.  The application
utilizes the procedures and data structures in the Client library which
are independent of the actual PostScript interpreter.

   <p>The pswrap translator allows you to take custom PostScript language
programs and wrap them with a C function interface thus allowing your
applications to call them directly.  pswrap programs are generally more
efficient then performing the same PostScript program purely with the
Client library procedures.

<p>The dgs-0.2.0.tar.gz distribution file has been placed on
<a href="ftp://ftp.gnustep.org/pub/gnustep">ftp.gnustep.org/pub/gnustep</a>

<p>The program requires gcc 2.7.2.1 or higher.

<p>The `.tar' file is compressed with GNU gzip.  Gzip can be obtained by
anonymous ftp at any of the GNU archive sites.

<p>For info about FTP via email, send email to <a href="mailto:ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com">ftpmail@decwrl.declcom</a>
with no subject line, and two-line body with line one `help' and line
two `quit'.

GA Plug-In for NExS Spreadsheet Available Now

</H3>

<p>X Engineering Software Systems (XESS Corp.) announces the immediate
availability of a genetic algorithm (GA) plug-in for its NExS spreadsheet.
Those interested in the genetic algorithm plug-in can download the source
code and a PostScript manual from www.xess.com. A free, 30-day version of
the NExS spreadsheet and the new conNExions-BETA API can also be downloaded
for the HP/UX, AIX, Digital UNIX, SunOS, Solaris and Linux platforms.

<p>Genetic algorithms (GA) solve optimization problems by modeling potential
solutions as chromosomes which can breed with one another to produce better
solutions through the forces of natural selection.

<p>The GA plug-in provides one new NExS function: @GENALG(...) which optimizes
a fitness function that is affected by a group of 1/0 variables in the
sheet. Any NExS function or combination of functions can be used to specify
the fitness function.

<p>The GA plug-in interacts with the NExS spreadsheet through the
conNExions-BETA API. The source code for the plug-in is being made available
for modification and customization.
