<h1>Songs in the Key of Tux: KGuitar</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/oregan.html">Jimmy O'Regan</A></b></p>


<p>
It's been quite a while since my last "Songs in The Key of Tux" article,
and, to be honest, I had given up on using Linux-based programs for my
tablature needs. 
</p>

<p>
 The main problem is that, as a metal guitarist, I <em>need</em> to be
able to represent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_muting">palm
muting</a> in my tablature &mdash; I've tried in the past to give tablature
to people that lacked palm muting information, and ended up having to show
them how to play the riffs, which defeats the purpose of tablature. 
</p>

<p>
 Fortunately, I finally got around to trying out <a 
href="http://kguitar.sourceforge.net/">KGuitar</a>, which does support 
palm muting.
</p>

<h3>KGuitar</h3>

<p>
 As well as palm muting, KGuitar has a number of great features. It's
able to import Guitar Pro files, up to version 4; it has a visual fretboard,
so you can see how a chord would look on the guitar neck; a chord analyser
(like Guitar Pro's) that gives you a choice of fingerings based on a chord
name, or provides you with chord names for a chord you input; and, a
feature that seems to be unique to KGuitar: the ability to tap the rhythm
of a bar using the mouse or keyboard. 
</p>

</p>

<p>
 If you've ever used a Windows-based tablature editor, KGuitar will seem
familiar to you. Most editing is done with the keyboard: use the arrow keys
to go to the section of the tablature you want to edit, and type the number
of the fret of the note you want to add. 
</p>

<h3> The Chord Constructor</h3>

<p>
 The Chord Constructor is one of KGuitar's most interesting features. 
For those who are interested in music theory, it allows you to construct a
chord by selecting the root note, and editing the type of the chord using
the three lists on the top left of the window. It then gives a list of 
icons of possible fingerings on the bottom of the window. 
</p> 

<p>
 To launch the Chord Constructor, either select 
<tt>Note-&gt;Insert-&gt;Chord</tt>, or type <tt>'Shift-C'</tt>:
</p>

<p>
 For those of us who don't know music theory, it allows us to fake it:
simply click on the relevant frets in the chord box in the middle of the
window, and it will give you a list of possible chord names on the right.
You can then use it to find alternate fingerings: you might just find an
easier way to play your music! 
</p>

<h3>Using the Rhythm Constructor</h3>

<p>
 The Rhythm Constructor is an interesting idea, and quite useful for the
majority of guitarists, who don't read music: simply enter the notes for a
bar (or several bars), select <tt>Note-&gt;Insert-&gt;Rhythm</tt> (or
<tt>'Shift-R'</tt>), and tap out the rhythm using the mouse: tap on the
<tt>Tap</tt> button, then press <tt>Quantize</tt> when you're 
finished. 
</p>

<p>
 I tried it out using a <a href="misc/oregan/rhythm1.kg">simple 
sample file</a> (<a href="misc/oregan/rhythm1.mid">MIDI</a>). The 
<a href="misc/oregan/rhythm2.kg">result</a> (<a 
href="misc/oregan/rhythm2.mid">MIDI</a>) was different, but my mouse 
clicking is more to blame than KGuitar is. I'm sure that, with 
practise, it could be quite a useful tool. 
</p>

<h3>Importing from TuxGuitar</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.tuxguitar.com.ar">TuxGuitar</a> is a Java-based
tablature program which can import Guitar Pro 5 files. Although it can't
represent several features of Guitar Pro tablature, as it lacks those 
features, it does an admirable job of importing files. (Though I have
encountered one bug: see below).
</p>

<p>
 It also claims to be able to export files in Guitar Pro 3 and 4 formats,
although my every attempt to import those files into KGuitar gave me
screens full of this output:
</p>
<pre class="code">
kguitar: WARNING: readDelphiString - first word doesn't match second byte
kguitar: WARNING: Chord INT1=-1, not 257
kguitar: WARNING: Chord INT2=-1, not 0
kguitar: WARNING: Chord INT4=-1, not 0
kguitar: WARNING: Chord BYTE5=255, not 0
</pre>

<p>
 I also encountered a strange bug when importing tablature of one of my
exercises: (right-click on these links to download either the TuxGuitar's
<a href="misc/oregan/exercise.gp4">GP4</a> or the <a
href="misc/oregan/exercise.kg">KGuitar version</a>.)
</p>
<img src="misc/oregan/tuxguitar-bug.png" alt="TuxGuitar bug">

<p>
 To explain that for those who read neither tablature nor music, the
tablature doesn't match the music notation. It should have looked something
like this (using KGuitar's ASCII export, slightly corrected): 
</p>

<pre class="code">
E|--------------------------|-------------------------|
B|--------------------------|-------------------------|
G|--------------------------|-------------------------|
D|--------------------------|-------------------------|
A|-------7-----------10-----|------7-----------10-----|
D|-0-7-8---8-7-0-7-8----8-7-|0-7-8---8-7-0-7-8----8-7-|
</pre>

<p>
 You could be forgiven for thinking that this is a font problem; that
a 0 with a line through it and an 8 look similar, but TuxGuitar's playback
follows the tablature line, and plays D (0) instead of A sharp (8). 
</p>

<p>
 I'll take a closer look at TuxGuitar (and <a 
href="http://dguitar.sourceforge.net">DGuitar</a>, a Java-based Guitar Pro
viewer) in a future article, when I've set up Java on my system. Until then,
here are <a href="misc/oregan/gp5.tar.bz2">some sample files</a> to try
with TuxGuitar. Some of them are quite complicated, so they should give a 
good indication of what TuxGuitar can do.
