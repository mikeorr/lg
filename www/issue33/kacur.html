The fifth International Linux Congress was held June 3-5, 1998,
at Cologne University in Germany. This was only a few days after the
Linux Expo held at Duke University in North Carolina, U.S.A. (May
28-30), which made for a few tired participants including some of the
speakers who attended both events. On the first day of the Congress,
intensive tutorials on various subjects were offered in both English and
German. These included ``Becoming a Debian Developer'' by Bruce
Perens, ``KDE Programming'' by Kalle Dallheimer and Matthias
Ettrich, and ``ISDN4 for Users'' by Klaus Franken.
<p>
The talks began the next day, opening with the keynote speaker, Jon
``maddog'' Hall. Jon's talk, entitled ``Economics of
Computing for the 21st Century'', began with a historical survey of
computers. He talked about early computer systems, which cost three times more
than what his parents paid for a house and were much less powerful
than modern home systems which are now inexpensive enough to buy with
credit cards. He predicted that in the near future, one will be
able to buy a computer in the check-out line at the local supermarket.
Indeed, at least two grocery stores in Germany already sell inexpensive 
PCs. He ended his talk by expressing the need for Linux
to reach the ``Moms and Pops'' of this world and with a plea to lobby
not just for Open Source software but for open hardware standards.
<p>
After the keynote speech, participants got to choose between two talks
running in parallel. The format was forty-five minutes per speaker,
with breaks every ninety minutes. The majority of the talks were held
in English, to accommodate guests from the United States, Canada,
England and the Netherlands, with a few held in German. Although it was
possible to attend up to six talks a day, some participants expressed
regret that they couldn't attend all the interesting talks due to
simultaneous scheduling. 
<p>
During the breaks, participants had an opportunity to
explore the various booth displays. S.u.S.E., a company which makes a popular
German Linux distribution, offered free demo CDs with their newest 5.2
version. O'Reilly had a nice book display with offerings in both English
and German. The KDE group had a very popular display showing off their
attractive desktop environment. John Storrs, who also presented a talk,
had a display demonstrating the use of Real Time Linux for the purpose
of CAD/CAM design. 
<p>
The University also provided the Congress with a
small number of Linux computers connected to the Internet for those
participants who found it hard to be away from the keyboard for
too long. Among the many interesting talks presented on the first day was one entitled
``Designing an Ext2fs Resizer'', given by Theodore Y. Ts'o. Theodore
has made contributions to the development of the Ext2fs system in the past
and is presently working on a method for enlarging and reducing the size
of an Ext2 file system and adding B-tree support. 
<p>
Christian Gafton, one of the programmers from Red Hat, gave a talk entitled ``Migration
to glibc''. He said the use of glibc is no longer as controversial in
the fast-moving Linux world as it was when Red Hat first adopted
it. With the latest versions of glibc available on the Internet,
the most common problems with porting code to the library occur when
programmers write code which is dependent on bugs which exist in the old
libc libraries, or when programmers use bad programming practices such as the 
use of <tt>#include&lt;linux/foo.h></tt> instead of the recommended
<tt>#include&lt;sys.foo.h></tt>.
<p>
A few sessions were purposely left open. The organizers called
these ``Birds of a Feather Sessions'' where the congress attendees
could get together for ``spontaneous and informal meetings for
presentation or discussion of any interesting subject''. Some 
people from Debian took advantage of this opportunity to discuss various
issues concerning their Linux distribution. 
<p>
That evening, participants
got a chance to socialize and experience a bit of German culture. The
social event was held at a local pub reserved for the Linux Congress. There
was a wonderful smorgasbord and the waiters were very quick to fill our beer
glasses with Cologne's famous k&ouml;lsch. Everyone enjoyed themselves
and hopefully some long term computer friendships were formed. 
<p>
The talks continued on the third day with interesting topics such as 
IEEE-1394 (also known by the commercial name Fire Wire) by Emanuel Pirker. 
Emanuel designed support for this technology as part of his work as a
university student in Austria. Warwick Allison gave an interesting account of 
the QtScape Hack, in which a small group of programmers created a port of
Netscape to Qt in a five-day programming spree while on vacation in Norway.
<p>
The final panel board discussion was perhaps the most interesting, and
certainly the most contentious topic of the congress. The subject was
GNOME vs. KDE. (See <i>Linux Journal</i>, May 1998.)
Participants included Miguel de Icaza of the Gnome Project, Kalle
Dalheimer of the KDE project and Bruce Perens who helped to define the
Open Source License. The people from the KDE project,
which is already in its second year, felt that Linux was in need of a
comfortable desktop environment. Linux has already captured the server
market, but has not reached the desktop widely because the technical
capabilities required are beyond that of the average user. They also felt that
Linux is about choice, and that since the GNOME project is now being
financed by Red Hat, people would be unduly influenced to use GNOME. 
<p>
The people from GNOME countered that Red Hat had no influence on the direction
of their project, and the reason KDE is not included in the Red Hat
distribution is because of its use of the Qt-toolkit. Many people were
of the opinion that although the KDE project is further ahead than the
GNOME project, its use couldn't be wholeheartedly embraced by the Linux
community because of the non-GNU license of the Qt-toolkit. They fear a
similar situation to the Open Group who recently changed the licensing
policy of the X server. Some members of the audience informed
the Congress that a project to make a GNU clone of the Qt-toolkit was
underway, and other audience members expressed the opinion that the two
KDE and GNOME groups should work more closely, but still acknowledge the 
positive creative push of healthy competition. Any hurt feelings were laid to 
rest and all friendships renewed as we said our goodbyes at the O'Reilly 
Publishing House. 
<p>
The O'Reilly team invited participants of the 
Linux Congress ``zum Kl&ouml;nen bei K&ouml;lsch'' or for a chat 
and beer. Participants agreed the fifth annual Linux Congress was 
a success and look forward to next year's Congress, which the 
organizers promised us would not be quite so soon after next year's 
Linux Expo!
