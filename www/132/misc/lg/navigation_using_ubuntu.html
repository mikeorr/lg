Hi, Steve -

&gt; Hi Ben
&gt; I've started using Ubuntu which is so great compared to Windoze and if I
&gt; can manage to run some navigational software I could eliminate Windoze
&gt; altogether. (It would be like getting rid of an abcessed tooth). Any
&gt; ideas? Will Wine run Nobeltec? Or do you know of any Nav software
&gt; available in open source?
</pre>
</p>

<p>
I've actually posted about this on the 'origamiboats' list a while back,
but I'll repeat it and expand on it a bit. If you don't mind, I'm also
going to CC this exchange to The Answer Gang at the Linux Gazette; this
is actually a question that I get asked on a regular basis by other
sailors who use Linux, and I believe a number of people could benefit
from the answer.
</p>

<p>
I've checked out a number of programs intended for navigational use
under Linux; all of these have been useful to some degree, and some,
like SeeMyDEnc (<a href="http://www.sevencs.com/index.php?page=123">http://www.sevencs.com/index.php?page=123</a>) are becoming
more and more useful day by day, as NOAA and other chart-producing
agencies convert more and more of their charts to the S-57 and other
modern charting formats; in fact, S-57 charts and viewers have become so
good that they are now treated as a legal equivalent of paper charts in
commercial shipping regulations (!). These converted charts,
incidentally, are available free of charge at
<a href="http://chartmaker.ncd.noaa.gov/">http://chartmaker.ncd.noaa.gov/</a> - a service that's worth thousands of
dollars to cruisers, given the average cost of paper charts.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, the two programs that I use most of all in my navigation are
'xtide' and Mayko's 'mxmap'; the former shows a list of currents and
tides for any location in the world, while the latter is a very
featureful chart viewer. 'mxmap' reads BSB charts, does GPS tracking,
allows you to construct/follow routes, set markers, "scribble" on the
charts, and do lots of other goodies. It also allows you to use, e.g., a
scan of a map or a chart - you just set the lat/long of diagonally
opposing corners, and away you go.
</p>

<p>
The only problem with 'mxmap' is that it is unmaintained; the developers
(Mayko), as far as anyone seems able to tell, have disappeared off the
face of the earth leaving us with this really nice piece of software.
Maybe they went cruising. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
Since Ubuntu is Debian-based, you should be able to install 'xtide' via
the standard installation mechanism ('apt-get install xtide' as root);
"xmap" can be found at <a href="http://fresh.t-systems-sfr.com/linux/src/">http://fresh.t-systems-sfr.com/linux/src/</a> (look
for three files with 'xmap' in the name - one of them is a bunch of
sample maps, the other two are static and dynamic versions of the
program.)

Hehe.  I love xtide.  It's such a simple program and colourful.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">  It
was invaluable for me back home to know when to fish, etc.  It even
piqued my my stepdad's interest in Linux.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

He's at the KDE junction at the moment.  Alas for me, FVWM isn't
anywhere on the radar, but I live in hope.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

A pleasure, Steve. It's possible that someone here in TAG, or one of our
readers, might have even more info; I like to experiment with new
software, but when I find something really solid to cover a given need,
I go on to other areas.  I'm sure that there's much more
navigation-related Linux software, but I just haven't looked beyond what
I've mentioned...
</p>

<p>
Good luck, and let us know if you discover anything interesting. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

&gt; Hi Ben
&gt; I thought I'd let you know I am able to Kiss Windoze goodby! I have VM
&gt; installed under Ubuntu and all nav software runs in a virtual win2000
&gt; window. Works better, and faster than with windows OS.

Congratulations! Don't forget that TAG (tag at lists.linuxgazette.net) is
here to answer Linux-related questions if you run into any problems.
And do feel free to let me know if you discover any interesting new
navigational software. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Although the assertion that W2k runs faster does surprise me a bit, I will
easily go along with the "works better" part.  My experience has been that
the monopoly's family of OSes does seem to fare better in terms of
improved stability when run in a VM environment as opposed more typical
installation where they interact directly with the machine hardware, for
whatever reason.  My WAG is that in the latter case the abomination known
as the registry doesn't isn't manipulated as much since all the hardware
seen by the OS is virtual, and tends to stay relatively constant between
sessions, so is less likely to become corrupted.
