<P> Linux Demo Day is coming up in September.  This is a very exciting time
for me and for linux, and I am going to give something back to the

<P> I would love to post something on your site, or advertise a paragraph in
your magazine.  I am low on cash, so I can't pay you right now.
I just need a few sentences to invite any riders/hackers who want to be

Benchmark specialist invites Microsoft and Red Hat to a rematch
</font>
</H3> 

<P> Chicago, IL -(June 1999) - Neal Nelson, benchmark guru and founder of the
world's largest independent client/server testing facility, has extended an
invitation to Microsoft and Red Hat to participate in an open, public
performance comparison between hot operating system rivals Windows NT and
Linux.

<P> Nelson issued the invitation as a result of a recently published study
sponsored by Microsoft.* One of the conclusions of the study is that
"Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 is 2.5 times faster than Linux as a File
Server and 3.7 times faster as a Web Server."

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>*Study conducted by Mindcraft, Inc., a software testing
company based in Los Gatos, CA.</FONT>

<P> Many have questioned the test results because different tuning levels were
used for NT than those used with Linux.  For example, NT was tested with NT
tuning, benchmarking and technical support from Microsoft, as well as
Internet Information Server 4.0 tuning information from the Standard
Performance Evaluation Corp.

<P> Linux however, received almost no additional tuning, support or involvement
from Linux-based technical sources.  The testing lab cited difficulty in
obtaining tuning information from Linux knowledge bases, and a query with
Red Hat ended up going  through the wrong channels.

<P> Ebiz Enterprises and its Linux Store unit have released what they call the
Pia, a $199 device that will be marketed through Internet service providers.
Prodigy, one of the Internet's oldest service providers, has already signed up
to promote the Pia, which stands for Personal Internet Appliance.

<P> The online service sees Linux, a rebel open-source operating system, as a
good way to power either cheap Internet appliances or servers at the center of
high-speed home computer networks, Prodigy chief technology officer Bill
Kirkner said today. "This provides a very effective, low-cost alternative,"
Kirkner said....

<P> In the longer term, Ebiz is planning to sell its Pia device bundled with
Internet access for about $20 a month for two years, Rassas said. Prodigy
wouldn't comment on whether it was pursuing such a deal with Ebiz, but a
spokesman said the company is "working on expanding the relationship."...

<P> "We created the SmartBeak.com website to address the need in the Linux and
Open Source Software community for a more structured approach to providing
knowledge and managing support issues," said Jit Saxena, Chairman and CEO of
Applix. "We are seeking to position SmartBeak.com as the website that brings
users and developers together in one place and helps them to work together
in a collaborative fashion. Futhermore, we believe that usage of this
website will help foster the development of Open Source Software
applications."

<P> SmartBeak.com users are able to search a knowledge base for documents
containing information for solving their issues. The information is made up
of How To, Frequently Asked Questions, HTML, and support database texts
which SmartBeak.com automatically updates and indexes.

<P> According to Michael Prince, Chief Information Officer, Burlington Coat
Factory, "We are preparing to roll out a distributed network of Linux
workstations and this project provides us with the challenge of obtaining
support for certain components of our solution." He continued,

<P> 
<P> [note: This announcement was written by Linux Laptops Ltd.]

<P> San Jose, CA, June 30, 1999 -- The Debian Project has claimed another

<P> Linux Laptops is the only hardware vendor devoted exclusively to
delivering portable computers with Linux software installed and

and for the huge number of application packages the project
maintains," says Nathan Myers, Linux Laptops Ltd.'s president. 
"Our customers leave installing to us, and a graphical installation 
tool would just get in our way. The Debian Project has concentrated 
its efforts on reliable operation and easy, safe upgrades, because 
you only install once, but you live with the software for years after."

<font color="green">Stormix: an easy to use, Debian-based Linux distribution
</font>
</H3> 

<P> Vancouver, Canada - July 6, 1999: Stormix Technologies announces the
alpha version of a new Linux distribution called Storm Linux. Based on the
Debian GNU/Linux distribution, Storm Linux is designed to be easy to use and
simple to install. Its target market is both the server and the desktop market.
   
<P> The Debian distribution is already stable and secure, says Kevin Lindsay,
project leader and developer for Stormix. By using Debian as our starting
point, we can bring Linux to new levels of excellence and user accessibility.
   
<P> All development for Storm Linux will be Open Source. We believe that
the Open Source model is a strong one, Lindsay says. We will be using
the GPL or a related license for all of our products.

<P> For administrators, a key feature of Storm Linux is the Storm
Administration System (SAS). Designed for local and secure remote
administration, SAS features a single code base for all administration
modules, which reduces the number of bugs. By separating the
application from the client interface, SAS also improves remote
connectivity and allows the quick creation of graphical and text
interfaces.

<P> For end-users, Storm Linux includes a choice of:
<UL>
	<LI> text-based or graphical X Windows install
	<LI> automatic or custom partitioning
	<LI> KDE or GNOME desktops
	<LI> recent versions of text and X Windows programs, including X Free
86 3.3.3.1, enlightenment 0.15.5, apt 3.7, and Netscape 4.6
</UL>
    
<P> Depending on the install choices, a new user can be running Storm
Linux in as little as fifteen minutes.

<P> The final release of Storm Linux is expected for the fourth quarter of
1999.

<P> Stormix Technologies was founded in February 1999 with the goal of
providing the tools and applications that Linux needs to enter new
markets. Initial investors include David Talmor, NetNation
Communications Chairman and CEO, and Joseph Kabul, NetNation
Communications COO.


<P> After using the Linux operating system to build a world class web site
hosting service, we were convinced that Linux has huge potential, Mr.
Talmor says. As a result, we decided to establish a new company that
focused specifically on the creation of a powerful and user-friendly
distribution of the operating system. That distribution is Storm
Linux.

<P> Stormix Technologies is an independent company, and not directly
affiliated with NetNation Communications.

<P> Copies of the alpha version of Storm Linux are available via FTP at
<A HREF=ftp://download.www.stormix.com>ftp://download.www.stormix.com</A> 
or from the company web site at
<A HREF=http://www.stormix.com>http://www.stormix.com</A>.

<P> We welcome detailed feedback from alpha testers, Lindsay says. We're
looking for users with the enthusiasm and commitment to take part in
an exciting new direction for Linux.

</font>
</H3> 
<P> SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. - June 29, 1999 - TurboLinux, the leader in
high-performance Linux, today announced it is shipping its newest English
language offering, TurboLinux Workstation 3.6.
Based on the 2.2.9 Linux kernel, TurboLinux Workstation 3.6 retails for
$49.95 and is currently available from the company's web site at
www.turbolinux.com. It will be available in North America through retail
outlets and resellers later this summer.

<P> "TurboLinux is best known as the Linux leader in the Pacific Rim through our

CEO of TurboLinux. "TurboLinux Workstation 3.6 is the first of a series of
forthcoming Linux offerings that are designed to meet the needs of high
performance Linux users in North America and illustrate our ongoing
commitment to this market. On TurboLinux Workstation 3.6 we've also improved
the installer that Forbes Online and other reviewers described as the best
in the market."
<P> TurboLinux, formerly called Pacific HiTech, is quickly emerging as a
dominant, global player in the Linux industry with offices in the U.S, Japan,
China and Australia. It recently announced major alliances with IBM, Computer
Associates and Hewlett-Packard. The company has shipped more than two million
units of its Linux products in the past 18 months.  After TurboLinux 3.0's
December 1998 introduction in Asia, it rapidly outsold Microsoft's Windows NT
(2000) at Japanese retail point of sale outlets, according to the Asia-Pacific
high technology analyst firm, Computer News.  Further, the product was voted
"Editor's Choice Best Software Product for 1998" by Byte Magazine in Japan.

<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>
	[Different-language editions of TurboLinux have different version 
	numbers.  The current English edition is 3.6.  The current Japanese
	edition is 3.0.  The Chinese edition is 3.0.2. There is also a
	TurboLinux Server 1.0 Japanese.  -Ed.]
