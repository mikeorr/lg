Quoting Darlene Wallach (freepalestin@dslextreme.com):

<pre>
&gt; Is there a percentage of the disk size I should calculate for
&gt; swap?
</pre>

<p>
The amount of desirable swap on your system, and its placement, really
isn't directly related to disk size (except in the "you have to have X
amount of space in order for allocating Y from it to be reasonable"
sense):  It's more related to total system physical RAM than anything
else, and secondarily to your usage patterns with that RAM (number of
active apps, RAM footprint of each of those).
</p>

<p>
The rule of thumb on all *ixes that you'll see quoted ad nauseam is that
total swap space should <em>generally</em> be somewhere from 1.5x to 2 or 3x
total physical RAM.[1]  If your system has multiple physical hard
drives, all of which are roughly similar in overall speediness, then
ideally you want to put some swap on each physical drive -- max no. being
32 ;-&gt;  --  so that the (fairly intelligent) swapper process can split
the necessary seeking[2] activity between them, for best performance
through parallelism.  By contrast, if any of the drives is markedly
slower[3], it's still worth putting some swap on it, but you'd want to
specify a lower swap priority to the swapper process.  (See "man 2
fstab" or "man 8 swapon" for details.)
</p>

<p>
Ideally, you would also want to physically place the swap partitions
between other partitions in a manner calculated to (you hope) reduce
average seek time by keeping the heads in the general vicinity more
often than not.
</p>

<p>
As if all this detail wasn't enough to contend with, it turns out that
Linux swap <em>files</em> (as opposed to partitions) are a contender again.
They were common in very early Linux days, but fell out of favour when
it emerged that swap partitions yielded much better performance.
However, it turns out that, with the 2.6.x kernel series, swap files
once again have competitive performance, and might be worth using. See:
<a href="http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/29/3">http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/29/3</a>
</p>


<p>
[1] This is an OK rough heuristic, but obviously doesn't fit all usage
models.  In general terms, you want enough swap so that you're very
unlikely to get tasks killed by the out-of-memory killer for lack of
virtual memory, even when your system is heavily loaded.  Too much swap
really only wastes disk space, which is relatively cheap and plentiful,
so most people are wise to err slightly on the side of overallocation.
</p>

<p>
Theoretically, if you had huge gobs of RAM, e.g., 64GB RAM, in relation
to your usage, some would argue that you should have <em>no</em> swap (and
certainly not 128GB of it!), since you're basically never going to need
to swap out files or processes at all.  But actually, memory pages managed
in virtual memory don't always back files at all, as Martin Pool points
out in the page you cited
(<a href="http://sourcefrog.net/weblog/software/linux-kernel/swap.html">http://sourcefrog.net/weblog/software/linux-kernel/swap.html</a>).
</p>

<p>
This whole field remains debatable in many areas, because real-world
usage is difficult to model, theoretical knowledge is a fallible guide to 
reality, and available documentation is a bit poor and obscure (with the
notable exception of Mel Gorman's book), so intuition and plausible but
non-definitive theories are common.
</p>

<p>
[2] Seeking is the process of moving the drive heads between concentric
tracks, and is by orders of magnitude the slowest operation a hard drive 
needs to do.  Therefore, anything that reduces seek time or average seek
distance will considerably improve virtual-memory performance and
extend HD life.
