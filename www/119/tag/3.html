What's up with that, you might wonder?  Well, Mailman has a feature,
unused by most listadmins, to bidirectionally (or otherwise) <em>  gate  </em> any
mailing list with an NNTP newsgroup.  Once set up, any mailing list post
shows up (across the gateway) within a few minutes, as an article in the
relevant group's news spool -- and, conversely, any article posted to
the newsgroup's spool likewise gets hustled the other direction across
the gateway within a few minutes, and mailed out by Mailman to mailing
list subscribers.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Please note distinction:  I did <em>  not  </em> say the mailing list goes out on
Usenet.  Usenet is <em>  a  </em> (very) large system of NNTP newsgroups, but
many people also operate private newsgroups that have nothing to do with
Usenet (other than also relying on NetNews Transport Protocol).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
In my case, I use leafnode's 2.x betas to support local newsgroups,
which I don't offer to other news servers.  (At this date, you have to
compile 2.0 betas, as local groups are a prerelease feature not included
in the 1.x release series.)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
For example, my local LUG, CABAL, has a mailing list called "conspire"
-- <A HREF="mailto:conspire@linuxmafia.com"
	>conspire@linuxmafia.com</A>.  At the time I set that up, I also compiled
leafnode 2.0b7, configured it to run under inetd, and added this line to
/etc/leafnode/local.groups:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>  cabal.conspire	y	Local newsgroup for the CABAL Linux user group.
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
Then, I enabled Mailman's gateway feature for <A HREF="mailto:conspire@linuxmafia.com"
	>conspire@linuxmafia.com</A>,
et voila.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Basically, all I needed to do, today, was enable the gateway function
for <A HREF="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net"
	>tag@lists.linuxgazette.net</A>, and add this second line to
/etc/leafnode/local.groups:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>  lg.tag	y	Linux Gazette's The Answer Gang
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
For a very long time, I had open posting to anyone who wished to connect
to my machine using NNTP.  That came to an end a few months ago on
account of... guess what?  NNTP spammers.  So, at that point I locked
down access using <TT>/etc/hosts.deny</TT> (using Wiese Venema's TCP Wrappers
library):  Anyone wanting remote NNTP access can still get it, but you
have to send me your fixed IP address (if you have one) -- and I then
add a permission line to <TT>/etc/hosts.allow.</TT>
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
What's so great about newsgroups, you ask?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Let's say you become interested in CABAL's mailing list <TT>/</TT> newsgroup
today, May 24, 2005.  You can, of course, join the mailing list --
allowing you to read and respond to <em>  new  </em> posts.  (Older posts are
browseable only via the Pipermail archive at
<A HREF="http://linuxmafia.com/pipermail/conspire"
	>http://linuxmafia.com/pipermail/conspire</A> , and you can't easily respond
to them.)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Or you can participate in it, in its newsgroup form.  You have instant
access to <em>  all posts ever made ,</em>  all the way back to December 2000 --
and can continue the thread on any of them.  You don't need to subscribe
before you can post, or unsubscribe to stop being barraged with stuff.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
And newsgroups settled the infamous private-versus-group reply issue
<em> properly ,</em>  long ago.  There are no dumbass flamewars over Reply-To,
because "Followups" (group responses) are treated distinctly from mailed
(private) responses.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The only drawbacks are (1) people being unfamiliar with newsreaders and
how newsgroups work, (2) people confusing the general concept of
"newsgroups" with whatever they've heard about Usenet, and (3) people
stuck behind poorly designed firewalls that don't allow NNTP access
(119/tcp) but do permit e-mail.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Fortunately, adding NNTP access to a Mailman list doesn't impair
"regular" mailing list functions, but does allow a second avenue of
access.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
One little problem I haven't figured out how to fix:  Mailman sends
over only to the news server only <em>  new  </em> mailing list posts, starting
with establishment of the gateway.  So, lg.tag's news spool has only the
five or six latest TAG posts in it, whereas cabal.conspire's has that
entire mailing list's history.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Ben, if you feel like a challenge (since you have a shell account,
here), Mailman keeps the mailing list's mbox at
<TT>/var/lib/mailman/archives/private/tag.mbox/tag.mbox</TT>, which you'll be
able to read/copy, even though you can't "ls" the directory it's in.
(List members can fetch that file as
<A HREF="http://lists.linuxgazette.net/mailman/private/tag.mbox/tag.mbox"
	>http://lists.linuxgazette.net/mailman/private/tag.mbox/tag.mbox</A> .)
Leafnode has the corresponding mail spool inside <TT>/var/spool/news/lg/tag/</TT> .
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
If you or anyone else can figure out how to get the <em>  rest  </em> of the mbox's
contents into that news spool, I'd be grateful.
</STRONG></P>

There is a service run by news.gmane.org which turns publicly available
mailing lists to news (or usenet posts, I am not sure of the correct
term).  They have a free nntp server running at news.gmane.org and you
can follow quite a lot of mailing lists using you favorite nntp client.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I find it quite useful in following mailing lists in which have a bit
of interest.

Excellent tip!  I note that they have 6929 newsgroups, including
"gmane.org.user-groups.linux.cabal".  But, of course, anything you post
there isn't going to get gated back into the mailing list in question:
It's a unidirectional gateway, only.

It is bi-directional <A HREF="http://gmane.org/post.php"

Well, I know that it <em>  isn't  </em> for the CABAL conspire mailing list, for
example.  I suspect it ends up being bidirectional only for mailing
lists that permit posting from non-subscribers -- which have been
becoming rare.

I am not sure about the CABAL mailing list, but I use the gmane nntp
interface to mail to the php.general mailing list
(<A HREF="http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.php.general"
	>http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.php.general</A>). The first time I put a
mail into that mailing list, I got a mail from Gmane asking you to
respond to it (the mail), to verify that I am a real human being not a
spammer.  After a few minutes, the posting appeared on the mailing list.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I checked on other archives of the php.general ( for example
<A HREF="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=php-general"
	>http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=php-general</A> ) to verify that it was
appearing not only on the gmane's archive but on the real php-general
mailing list .
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
php-general accepts mail from a "list of pre-approved mail addresses" --
basically an email id which has replied to its challenge when the user
posted mail for the first time. I guess you can say it can accept mail
from non-subscribers.  I will check some mailing list which requires
subscription (for example Linux-india-general
<A HREF="http://news.gmane.org/gmane.user-groups.linux.india.general"
	>http://news.gmane.org/gmane.user-groups.linux.india.general</A>) and let
you know the results.
</blockQuote>
<P><STRONG>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> 
At a guess, php-general may be set up the same way CABAL's conspire list
is:  Postings are accepted from subscribed addresses, while any from
non-subscribed addresses are held for listadmin vetting.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
<em> That  </em> mailing list's subscriber roster includes, for example, member
"<A HREF="mailto:goulc-conspire@gmane.org"
	>goulc-conspire@gmane.org</A>", which no doubt is the script that grabs and
translates all new mailing list postings to articles in gmane.org's
news spool.  If someone who is not a mailing list subscriber, such as
you, duly joins Gmane (the "proving you're a real human being not a
spammer" bit -- a delightful turn of phrase, by the way), and then
follows up an article in newsgroup "gmane.org.user-groups.linux.cabal",
a different script grabs your article from the spool and generates an
e-mail to the mailing list address -- where it's held for listadmin
attention as a non-subscriber post.  I as listadmin would undoubtedly
respond by approving the post manually, and adding your address to the
roster of non-subscribed addresses whose postings will be auto-accepted
anyway in the future.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I suspect something similar happened with your Gmane-based posting to
php.general:  Either it was merely manually approved by a listadmin and
that's it, or it was approved by such a listadmin and then your address
was cleared for subsequent acceptance.
