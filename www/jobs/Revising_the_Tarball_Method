The LG method of archiving its issues is mildly broken, and needs to be
reconsidered. The current scripts build an archive (lg-[number].tar.gz) by
compressing the current issue subdirectory and they rebuild the "accessory
files" archive (lg-base.tar.gz) - i.e., all the standard LG images, FAQs,
style files, etc. - from scratch every time. The problem is that anyone
trying to keep a list of issues has to keep re-downloading lg-base with
every new issue... and that's getting to be a pretty big file.

Requires some basic scripting skills and the ability to think around
corners. :)

Time commitment:
	One-time project; varies with skill
