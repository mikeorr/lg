Recently, My GNU/Linux system (Fedora Core 3) was shut down
uncleanly. It booted to single-user mode and told me to run fsck
manually, which I did. After asking whether it should correct a number
of error (to which I replied 'y'), it reported that the file system was
altered and the system should be rebooted. So, I entered the 'exit'
command and the system rebooted.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
When it rebooted, the system again reported the system had shut
down uncleanly. It ran fsck again, and it produced the same error
messages. It fixed these, and I rebooted. This happened again . and
again . and again.. more than 5 times. I booted off a live CD (KNOPPIX)
and verified that all the system files were actually there - they were.
What should I do?

Yup, this sometimes happen.  I'd boot off the knoppix CD, chroot over to
your FC installation and use "tune2fs":

<blockquote><pre>tune2fs -c 100 -C 1
</pre></blockquote>

I had a crash with <A HREF="http://www.slackware.org/">Slackware</A> one time and was able eventually to get it
booting by reading the manual for e2fsck and typing
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>e2fsck -b 16385 -n /dev/hdb2
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
(linux is on hdb2, not mounted)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
-b means use alternate superblocks because the regular one got messed
up during the crash.  Linux keeps extra copies.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
16385 is one of my alternate superblocks.  When you first run mke2fs it
gives you a list of about five of them spread out over the partition.  My
partition was 1 or 2G.  Larger partitions have them in different places
and you can probably look up likely superblocks on the web and try this
approach.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
-n means answer no to all questions, or you can do that manually
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
superblocks seem to be multiples of a base number plus 1:
8193 16385  (and probably 3 and 4x 8192 + 1, etc.)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Maybe someone else with your size drive can suggest where they are.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I have e2fsck on a 2-floppy linux for this sort of use.

	> [Heather] According to the man page for mke2fs, you could ask it where it put
them:
</blockquote></font>

<blockquote><pre>-n     causes mke2fs to not actually create a filesystem, but display
       what  it  would do if it were to create a filesystem.  This can
       be used to determine the location of the backup superblocks for
       a  particular filesystem, so long as the mke2fs parameters that
       were passed when the filesystem was originally created are used
       again.  (With the -n option added, of course!)
