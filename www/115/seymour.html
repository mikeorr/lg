<h1>Design Awareness</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/seymour.html">Mark Seymour</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3>Logo is as logo does</h3>
<p>
I've stumbled across a hitherto-unnamed design concept:
<em>logomatopoeia</em>.
</p>

<p>
Many people will recognize <em>onomatopoeia</em>; these are words whose sound
('bang' and 'buzz' are good examples) imitates what it names. (There are
far more in Japanese than in English, oddly enough; see this <a
href="http://web.mit.edu/anime/www/onomatopoeia.html">site</a> for a long
list, but my favorite is definitely <em>bashi</em> <em>bashi</em>, the sound of
smacking someone on the head.)
</p>

<p>
The word <em>onomatopoeia</em> itself comes from the Greek <em>onomos</em>,
'name', and <em>poein</em>, 'to make'. Thus <em>logomatopoeia</em> ('to make a
sign' might be a rough translation) is the use of a visual reference to
what is named within the logo.
</p>

<p>
The concept was discovered (<em>Eureka!</em>, to quote another Greek) when I
noticed a restaurant directly across the street from a gas station in my
neighborhood:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="misc/seymour/ChilisStandard.jpg" alt="" height="90" width="165"
border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/LukoilDrop.jpg" alt="" height="90"
width="303" border="0">
</p>

<p>
In both cases, your brain automatically incorporates the picture as a
verbal component of the company name; you don't think
&quot;Luke-drop-il&quot;, you think &quot;LuckOil&quot;. In the Chili's
logo, of course, the apostrophe is silent, but it is still encapsulated in
the name.
</p>

<p class="editorial">
[ For the Russophones reading this, the parallel is even more amusing:
"luk" means "onion" in Russian, and the "drop" on which Mark bases this
connection is certainly very onion-like. Since the company itself is
Russian, it is certainly more than just coincidence, and works well in two
languages - although if the commodity was onion juice rather than oil, it
would be perfect. -- Ben ]
</p>

<p>
As a beginning of standards-setting for logomatopoeia, the use of the
chile image as an apostrophe is good, but the use of a droplet as the O is
much better.
</p>

<p>
<a id="Chili" name="Chili"></a>There is an alternate logo on the <a
href="http://www.chilis.com/">Chili's site</a> which works even better as
logomatopoeia (and may well prove to be <em>the</em> standard for excellence
in logomatopoeia, though it's too early to declare a winner), but they may
have feared people wouldn't be able to 'pronounce' it:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="misc/seymour/Chilis.jpg" alt="" height="90" width="165" border="0">
</p>

<p>
The Russian mother company of the Lukoil USA subsidiary also falls back on
a more traditional (and far less successful) logo on its corporate <a
href="http://www.lukoil.com/">site</a>:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="misc/seymour/Lukoil.jpg" alt="" height="43" width="149" border="0">
</p>

<p>
The LUK symbol would seem to represent chemical equipment, but it's really
the acronym of the original Russian company,
<em>LangepasUraiKogalymneft</em>. Given the history of the company (&quot;by
the Resolution of the USSR Council of Ministers No.18 of November 25, 1991,
a state-owned oil concern was set up, uniting on a voluntary basis three
oil-producing enterprises, <em>Langepasneftegaz</em>, <em>Uraineftegaz</em>,
and <em>Kogalymneftegaz</em>&quot;, as only a Soviet-era document could
phrase it), that may have been the best they could do. Besides, I defy any
designer to make LANGEPASURAIKOGALYMNEFT work as a logo...
</p>

<p>
There are others out there, of course. Currently tied with the Chili's <a
href="#Chili">alternate logo</a> as the logomatopoeia gold standard is the
still-classic <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/forrest-gump">Fruit
Company</a> logo:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="misc/seymour/Apple.jpg" alt="" height="100" width="100" border="0">
</p>

<p>
But there are also a slew of i-heart-whatever graphics that qualify as
low-grade logomatopoeia, starting with the original:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="misc/seymour/iheartny.jpg" alt="" height="162" width="184" border="0">
</p>

<p>
Logomatopoeia (like the one above) also qualifies as a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebus">rebus</a>, and one of the reasons
it appeals to me is that when I was a child my father used to leave me
messages written in rebus form. (An early use of rebuses was in <a
href="http://digiserve.com/heraldry/pimb_r.htm">heraldry</a>; for those
interesting in these mind puzzles, try this rebus <a
href="http://www.unclerebus.com/">site</a>.) And while text messaging on
cell phones and PDAs uses the same content-compression style, though with a
limited character set, we have all written a particular rebus at least once
since our days in junior high:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="misc/seymour/iheartu.jpg" alt="" width="116" height="81" border="0">
</p>

<p>
While it might be hard to pull off a rebus-based logo, both these
Rebus-named companies share alarmingly similar (though rebus-less) logos:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<a href="http://www.rebus.com/"><img src="misc/seymour/Rebus.jpg" alt=""
width="131" height="70" border="0"></a> <a
href="http://www.rebushr.com/"><img src="misc/seymour/RebusHR.jpg" alt=""
width="150" height="70" border="0"></a>
</p>

<p>
But logomatopoeia is a tricky thing, and there are many <a
href="http://www.bartleby.com/59/3/closebutnoci.html">close-but-no-cigar</a>
logos, of which I chose only two:
</p>

<p>
Named after its founder, Gary Bell, the <a
href="http://www.tacobell.com/">Taco Bell</a> logo doesn't actually
incorporate its symbol as part of the name, so technically it's not an
example of logomatopoeia, but it's <em>so</em> close:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="misc/seymour/TacoBell.jpg" alt="" width="89" height="112" border="0">
</p>

<p>
This <a
href="http://www.libertybellbank.com/lbb/website/index.lbb?linkId=3">bank</a>
logo shows another example of a good image (actually quite a nice rendition
of the concept) that's not logomatopoeia either:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="misc/seymour/LibertyBellBank.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="97" border="0">
</p>

<p>
So now I'm looking for more logomatopoeia. If you find any, please <a
href="http://linuxgazette.net/authors/seymour.html">email me</a> and I'll
list them (and credit you; there's no LinuxGazette t-shirt in it, bubba,
merely the glory) in an upcoming column.
</p>
<hr width="20%">

<p>
As an admonition about careless or trendy design, a friend pointed me
toward this <a
href="http://www.thestreet.com/tech/internet/986150.html">column</a> on
overused logo styles, and I found it piercingly true: the 'swoosh' is now
officially ubiquitous. Here are several other excellent sites on the entire
swoosh phenomenon:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://lekowicz.com/library/logohell/logohell.html">LogoHell</a> 
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://50cups.com/swoosh/index.asp">50cups</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.37signals.com/enormicom/index.html">37signals</a>
</p>

<p>
There's also a <a
href="http://www.biz-logo.com/pre-designed-cat05.shtml">site</a> where you
can purchase your very own swoosh logo for only $95.90 (though I wonder how
they arrived at that precise pricing). 
</p>

<p>
And even one on the sidestep from the swoosh to spirals:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.splorp.com/critique/">Splorp</a>
</p>

<p>
For those interested in further meta-study of logo themes you can visit
this <a href="http://logotypes.designer.am/srch/search.php">site</a>
listing thousands of existing corporate logos. If you find another overdone
trend like the swoosh, please let me know.

Next column (per a reader's request): more on the use of color and how it
affects the viewer's perception of your material.

<em>
<p> I started doing graphic design in junior high school, when it was still
the Dark Ages of technology. Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were both eleven
years old, and the state of the art was typing copy on Gestetner masters.
I've worked on every new technology since, but I still own an X-acto knife
and know how to use it.

<p> I've been a freelancer, and worked in advertising agencies, printing
companies, publishing houses, and marketing organizations in major
corporations. I also did a dozen years [1985-1997] at Apple Computer; my
first Macintosh was a Lisa with an astounding 1MB of memory, and my current
one is a Cube with a flat screen.

<p> I've had a website up since 1997, and created my latest one in 2004. I'm
still, painfully, learning how web design is different from, but not
necessarily better than, print.
