<center><H1>The Open Source Definition</H1></center
<P>
Open Source(TM) Software doesn't just mean access to the source code.
The distribution terms of an Open Source program must comply with the
following criteria.
<P>
<H4>1. Free Redistribution</H4> 
<P>
The license may not restrict any party from selling or giving away the
software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing
programs from several different sources. The license may not require a
royalty or other fee for such sale.
<P>
<H4>2. Source Code</H4> 
<P>
The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in
source code as well as compiled form. Where some form of a product is
not distributed with source code, there must be a well-publicized means
of downloading the source code, without charge, via the Internet. The
source code must be preferred form in which a programmer would modify the
program. Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed. Intermediate
forms such as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed.
<P>
<H4>3. Derived Works</H4> 
<P>
The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow
them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original
software.
<P>
<H4>4. Integrity of The Author's Source Code</H4> 
<P>
The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified
form _only_ if the license allows the distribution of "patch files"
with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build
time. The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built
from modified source code. The license may require derived works to
carry a different name or version number from the original software.
(This is a compromise. The Open Source Trust encourages all authors to not
restrict any files, source or binary, from being modified.)
<P>
<H4>5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups</H4> 
<P>
The license must not discriminate against any person or group of
persons.
<P>
<H4>6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor</H4> 
<P>
The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program
in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the
program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic
research.
<P>
<H4>7. Distribution of License</H4> 
<P>
The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the
program is redistributed without the need for execution of an
additional license by those parties.
<P>
<H4>8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product</H4> 
<P>
The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's
being part of a particular software distribution. If the program is extracted
from that distribution and used or distributed within the terms of the
program's license, all parties to whom the program is redistributed should
have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with
the original software distribution.
<P>
<H4>9. License Must Not Contaminate Other Software</H4> 
<P>
The license must not place restrictions on other software that is
distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the
license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the
same medium must be Open Source software.
<P>
<H4>10. Example Licenses</H4> 
<P>
The "GPL", "BSD", and "Artistic" licenses are examples of licenses
that we consider comformant to the Open Source definition.
<P><HR> <P> 
<H4>Attribution</H4> 
<P>
The Open Source definition is derived from the Debian Free Software
Guidelines. I composed the original draft, and then it was refined
using suggestions of the Debian GNU/Linux Distribution developers in
e-mail confernce during most of June, 1997. They then voted to approve
it as Debian's publicly stated policy. It was revised somewhat and
Debian-specific references were removed at the origination of the Open
Source Trust in February 1998.
