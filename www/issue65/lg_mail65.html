<P>
Dear Answer Guy,
</P>
<P>
I really hope you can help me in my quest to change from Windows to Linux.
Here is what I have done so far:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
I've got a 2 year old standard PC:  PII 333MHz, 128MB RAM, 4.3GB, CD-ROM,
Modem, ESS soundcard.
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
I've downloaded the ISO file from <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> and it is called
live-evaluation-i386-70.iso
</P>
<P>
I've put this onto a CD.  I can see the file on the CD under Windows.  When
I try to boot up using the CD ROM it ignores it.  My BIOS is seto to Boot
From CD and it will boot from a Windows OS CD so I know the capability is
there.
</P>
<P>
I'm starting to feel that there is something I need to do to the ISO file
when writing it to the CD.  I've seen mention of doing this by "Burning the
Image" - whatever that is.  I've read the HOW-TO for CD and ISO and it
doesn't explain how to do this under Windows only.  It assumes you have a
working Linux environment.
</P>
<P>
I came across your page, and dozens of others on this subject, and I thought
I had found the holy grail as the question is exactly what I was going to
ask.  The thing is your answer is for a working Linux system - the guy had
this as well as Windows - there is no mention of how to do this under
Windows.  Then the person who asked the original question writes back
saying:
</P>
<BLOCKQuote>
<p>
"Jim,
</P><p>
Thanks for your information. And ironically, shortly (next day) after I
wrote you the email, I did find out what was going wrong and how to fix it.
</P>
<P>
WinOnCD did have the capability, but it was somewhat a "hidden" feature of
sorts.
</P>
<P>
I do appreciate your response, though.
</P>
<P>
-Lewis"
</P>
</BLOCKQuote>
<P>
He didn't even mention how he did it in WinOnCD!!!!  ARRggghhh!  I can find
this software on the Web but I still need the knowledge to find the "hidden
feature".  Oh this is so frustrating., so close yet so far.
</P>
<P>
Please please please can you help me to make my ISO file, which took hours
to download, into a bootable CD so that I can install my first ever Linux
OS?
</P>
<P>
Thanks,
EK.
</P>

<blockquote>To trim it down considerably, he has tried Nero Burning software
but couldn't make sense of it, and the image that seems to result doesn't
work.  YaST2 booted from floppy gets as far as reaching for the CD, then 
continues to complain that the CD isn't valid.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Usually the Gang would suggest a rescue disk - our perennial favorites
wouldn't help, they don't have cdrecord aboard, but you could try muLinux
(<a href="http://mulinux.nevalabs.org/"
>http://mulinux.nevalabs.org/</a>) boot that from floppy, and use the Linux
software on it to mount up your DOS filesystem, then cdrecord according 
to the normal HOWTO to burn the SuSE CD.  I have no idea if it would work 
though it seems worth a shot.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Would some kind soul out there who lives in both worlds point
us to a reliable CD burning app for Windows, along with some fairly 
simple instructions?  We'd be glad to let you put the article in the
Gazette if it will help enough potential Linux'ers out there. -- Heather

<P>
I read Ben Okopnik's <a href="../issue62/okopnik.html">article in the 
February issue</a> of Linux Gazette titled
</P>
<P>
No More Spam! (a "procmail"-based solution with tips on "fetchmail" and
"mutt")
</P>
<P>
and I tried implementing some of his suggestions. My problem seems to be this:
While fetchmail will get my e-mail, and pass it off to procmail, which
delivers it to a designated file, I can't seem to read the e-mail with kmail.
I've set my designated file as a local mailbox for kmail to read, but when I
try to read it using kmail I get 1 of 2 behaviors:
</P>
<ol>
<li> kmail ignores the e-mail in the local mailbox
<li> kmail nukes the contents of the local mailbox, and does not
transfer the contents to my kmail inbox.
</ol>
<P>
I tried setting up kmail to read from the local mailbox with the following
lock file options:
<br>mutt dotlocked
<br>mutt dotlocked priveledged
<br>Procmail lockfile
<br>FCNTL
<br>None
</P>
<P>
Any of the above will cause either behavior 1) or 2).
</P>
<P>
Anyway, I'm hoping you might be able to help me figure out how to
read my local mailbox with kmail.
</P>
<P>
--Rod
<br>P.s. Included is a <a href="misc/wanted/rodrigo.kmail.png">snapshot of 
my kmail configuration</a> for reading the local mailbox into my inbox. 
Hopefully, it will be of some use to you for diagnosing my problem.
<br>P.p.s. Thanks in advance for any help you can give me on this.
<br>P.p.p.s. Here are the configuration files for the various utilities:
(I blanked my password in the .fetchmailrc file in this e-mail, for security
reasons

Hi, I'm fighting with syslog-ng, trying to centralize the logs of all a
network to a log server. Till now, I'm justing testing it between two
machines ... I've already been on it a long time and still no result,
simply nothing appears in the final log on the logserver ...
I've attached the syslog-ng.conf of the client and the server's one too.
</P>
<P>
You must know that for the server's source, I've already tried to enter
parameters (I mean an ip and a port) but it doesn't work either so at
the moment, I'm trying to use the defaults. The same thing for the
client ...
<br>Can you help me on this?

AnswerGuy,
</P>
<P>
I hope you can help me with this problem.
</P>
<P>
We've upgraded our kernel from 2.0.0 to 2.2.14-5.0 (<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> 6.2). We have a master node that is connected to a total of 14 nodes. In the past, when we rsh'd into a node and wanted to reboot we would just type at the prompt 'reboot'. We would immediatly be kicked back to the master node prompt while the other node was rebooting. This worked out fine.
</P>
<P>
However, when we rsh into a node and type 'reboot' the terminal hangs, for several minutes, until the node has completed rebooted and then it drops us back to the master node.
We want it to work the way it has in the past. Is there some file or configuration I'm missing, some flag to turn off or on?
</P>

<p>Any of you gentle readers with experience in this kind of clustering,
if you have any idea what it might be, then feel free to lend a hand.  We'll
publish your answer here. -- Heather</p>

<P>
I would like to define keyboard shortcuts not specific to a Window
Manager.  I have read documentation on xmodmap, but the information I
have found only talks about and show examples of changing key actions to
another pre-defined action.  That is, being able to change the caps lock
key to function as an escape key.  How would I go about assigning a
command to a lctrl + F1 key code?
</P>
<P>
The ultimate use for this is to help a fellow LUG member.  He wants to
be able to assign text strings to "hot keys" whereby the text string
would be copied to the window he is working in.  He wants to be able to
save the text strings as he is working so that they can be used in other
session; and have the ability to delete or change these text strings.  I
can proably figure out a script to do this, but I am stuck on defining
the keyboard shortcut.

<BR>Ken Ramseyer <a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net&cc=ken.ramseyer@lmco.com">(ken.ramseyer from lmco.com)</a>


<!-- sig -->

<P>
On our project if an established client socket connection on a remote
chassis is suddenly terminated (e.g., the chassis is powered off), the
socket connection on the local chassis changes from ESTABLISHED to
FIN_WAIT1.  If we then try to restart our application on the local
chassis, it does not work because the socket connection is stuck in a
FIN_WAIT1.  After 5-10 minutes the socket connection stuck in FIN_WAIT1
clears itself and we can successfully restart our application on the
local chassis, but this wait is too long.
</P>
<P>
Do any of you know how to expedite the process of clearing FIN_WAITs on
a Linux/UNIX chassis under these conditions?  The only we can get them
to clear is to either wait 10 minutes or perform a chassis reboot (sync;
shutdown -r now).  Is there a system call that can be used to tell the
operating system to close/delete/clean-up/remove all socket connections
immediately?
</P>
<P>
The only thing I have run across so far is to possibly make a kernel
change (e.g., change #defines in <TT>.../include/net/tcp.h</TT>), or set a socket
option which causes the sockets to close/clean-up faster.  Note: these
changes may be risky if we shorten the timeouts too much.
</P>
<P>
Any help would be appreciated.
</P>

Thanks,

Hi
<br>I've read the articles from issue 57 of the Linux gazette, but am unable
to get my cd-rw to work.  I don't think I am managing to emulate scsi
correctly, although I have followed the things sugested. I have a sony
cd-rw (CRX 145E ATAPI) and run mandrake 7.0, I also have a iomega 100Mb
zip drive on hdb,  a dvd-rom on hdc and the cd-rw is on hdd.  This is
what I've done and what the comp says:
</P>
<P>In <TT>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</TT> added</p>
<BLOCKQuote>
<code>/sbin/insmod ide-scsi</code>
</BLOCKQuote>
<P>
In <tt>/etc/conf.modules</tt> added
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>alias scd0 srmod
alias scsi_hostadapter ide-scsi
options ide-cd ignore=hdd
</pre>
<br> (also tried replacing srmod with sr_mod)
</blockquote>
<P>
In <TT>/etc/lilo.conf</TT> added</p>
<blockquote><tt>append="hdd=ide-scsi"</tt></blockquote>
<P>
then in console typed</p>
<blockquote>
<tt>lilo</tt> (and tried <TT>/sbin/lilo</TT>)
</blockquote>
<P>
then rebooted, then
dmesg gives at the end:
</P>
<Pre>

</Pre>
<P>
For some reason I can't get the machine to emulate scsi on anything
other than hdb.  <tt>cdrecord -scanbus</tt>
only lists the zip drive too.  The <TT>/sbin/insmod ide-scsi</TT> comand also
stops the zip drive from working.  Have  you any ideas as to what might
be going wrong?
</P>
<P>
Many thanks for any advice you can offer

We are just crystallising our thoughts after the fruitful 
<a href="../issue61/lg_answer61.html#tag/6">discussion</a>
with TAG (Jan 2000 issue) and have decided to first install all the
relevant packages on a RedHat partition of our PC, find the library
dependencies, make a "library farm" and use ldconfig after adding
the libraries in the library farm to the <TT>/etc/ld.so.conf</TT>. To check
what problems this gives we will then make a "zeroth" version of
our CDROM and installation script and try installing all on the
SLACKWARE (my dream distro) partition of our PC. Test the software,
check if anything else goes wrong, etc .. It seemed to work for
scilab and octave when I did a manual check. From what I have read
till now about libraries (not much at all, maybe I should read up
and write an article for the <i>LINUX GAZETTE</i> -&gt; best way to
learn something) this does not seem to be a wrong thing to do.
</P>
</STRONG>

<p>Thanks, Manoj, we'd love to see your article!  -- Heather</p>

<STRONG>
<P>
Another thing is we are not trying to make a platform
independent package or installer, but just want to install some
selected scientific software packages on any old/new Linux PC.
We hope to make a zeroth version, test it at our institute PCs
and only after thorough testing keep it for download at some
voulenteering site or mail it to anyone who pays the posting
and CDROM cost.
</P>
<P>
PS: We are still looking for some server to host our site. We do
thank freeservers, but the it would be nice to host the site
at some server that displays Linux related advts only.

<p>Once upon a time we had the complete "normal" navbar as well as the
TAG bnavbar, but people said it was confusing.  They kept hitting next
article when the meant next TAG item, or vice versa.  Having a pointer
to the TOC doesn't sound so bad though.  So, I've added that into the
tag sub-items navbar.  Let me know how you like it.  -- Heather</p>

I'm glad you're using mailto's that include the TAG address. The problem
is the URL construction was incorrect.
</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>
It should be an equals sign (=) after the cc parameter. A quick run through sed
should fix this before you get too many messages pointing out the error.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
If there's any way to add the subject, you could make the URLs look like
this:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
mailto:user@domain?amp;subject=Re:%20SUBJECT
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Note that the subject has to go through a filter that replaces spaces with
the hex code "%20" to keep the URL legal. In perl, I'd do this:
</STRONG></P>
<blockquote><STRONG><code>
$mailto_subject =~ s/ /%20/g;
</code></STRONG></blockquote>
<P><STRONG>
You can quickly test the functionality of a mailto URL by typing
variations directly into the address/URL box of the target browser and see
if it calls the mail client as you intended.

Thanks, Tony, you win the AnswerBubble for the month.  I like it when
folks not only nail us for a bug (that one was me, I'll go fix
the script so it'll be right next time 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=";&gt;" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> ... 
but also send us Tip grade material about fixing it.  I tried it, and I
ran it against some browsers we have around the place.  My scripts work
great ... but the browsers don't accept subject values reliably, and I
don't want to inflict any extra problems on our readers, considering 
that what it did when it misbehaved was to generate a bunch of insane "To:"
values.  Oh well

Her greeting in The Answer Gang is beautiful.  I'm a relative newbie to
Linux (It took me a week of reading and playing to compile a kernel that
would find my NICs).  I understand the open source idea, and love it.  I
deal in 2 other fields where this idea (in a general sense) applies.
Emergency Medical Services where we share ideas, issues, and solutions, not
for money, but for the knowledge of helping others.  Also in restoring old
cars,  Things are learned, forgotten, learned again, and most importantly
past on.  By sharing, we (Linux users) end up with a better app or method.
</P>
<P>
Again, Thank you
</P>
<P>
Remember, there are people out there who really appreciate the work that is
done.

<P>
In the
<A HREF="../issue64/dellomodarme.html">article on ssh, scp, and sftp</A> in the
March issue, there is an important area that isn't covered: client/server
compatibility.
</P>
<P>
If you're just doing a basic ssh (to get a remote shell), you're
using a standard SSH protocol and any program named "ssh" is likely
to work with any remote system that offers a service it calls "ssh."
</P>
<P>
But scp and sftp are not standard protocols.  If you run the scp
program from openssh against a remote system that's running an
original ssh server, it will not work.  (And when I learned this the
hard way, it was very hard indeed:  the error message isn't "this
server doesn't implement this scp protocol."  It is, for reasons
that took a day of debugging to figure out, "invalid file descriptor"!

<STRONG>
<P>
First off let me apologize to all the developers or others who I have
offended with my <A HREF="../issue64/fevola.html">views</A> on the Linux Router
Project (LRP).  By no means did I want to start a flame war.  The truth is that
I wrote about something outdated.  Second, that article was entirely my own;
not the work or opinions of Linux Gazette.
</P>
<P>
Since I wrote "Mean Thoughts" I have received a great many meaningful and
insightful messages from LRP users and developers.  If I wrote any 
<EM>untrue</EM>
information I want to know about it.  One point of contention for example
was whether the ip command is 'nonstandard.'  This is purely subjective.  If
ip really is standard, it should replace ifconfig or route like ipchains
replaced ipfwadm.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless my views on the LRP have changed.  I received such an education
that I feel obligated to state for the record I have learned uses for each
of the three main LRP distributions, EigerStein
(<A HREF="http://lrp.steinkuehler.net/DiskImages/Eiger/EigerStein.htm"
	>http://lrp.steinkuehler.net/DiskImages/Eiger/EigerStein.htm</A>"),
Oxygen
(<A HREF="http://leaf.sourceforge.net/pub/oxygen/"
	>http://leaf.sourceforge.net/pub/oxygen</A>),
LRP 2.9.8
(<A HREF="http://www.linuxrouter.org/"
	>http://www.linuxrouter.org</A>) --even in embedded systems.
I am not brand-loyal.  Advocacy is fine, but fanaticism has got to go.  I'll
use the best tool for the job, and <EM>how</EM> I determine what is the 'best tool'
is purely subjective.  Five years ago I preferred 3Com to any other NIC.
Why?  Two reasons:  The founder of 3Com invented Ethernet, and the cards
were recognized by all the OSs that the company used.  I knew I would not
have to worry about cross platform compatibility.  Now I prefer SMC.  Why?
Mainly because all the OSs recognize them but also because I can
jumper-select IRQ &amp; I/O on the models I use.
</P>
<P>
Would I write another 'anti-Linux' article?  Sure.  But not one that could
potentially insult anyone like when I said, 'developers wasting time'.
Linux is merely a product.  Windows NT is also a product.  Never mind the
fact that I despise products from Redmond, Washington: I don't think it's a
sin to admit that NT is better than Linux at being a "Domain Controller."
It does not change how much I like Linux.
</P>
<P>
Look at the article and notice its verbosity.  It's an opinion, not a
review.  I did not write it solely for explaining <EM>my</EM> (i.e., not Linux
Gazette == Don't shoot the messenger.) thoughts on the LRP, I also wanted to
express and present other information that may be useful to the Linux
community, for example the bit on standardization.  I did not write it to
maliciously annoy anyone.  Also to my knowledge there is no technically
inaccurate information.  I wrote specifically, "I have not done a lot of
work/research with LRP incarnation at linuxrouter.org as such but I am
familiar with the Materhorn Project."  My mistake was that I equated &lt;Linux
Router Project&gt; with one flavor, Materhorn.
</P>
<P>
I may or may not follow with a "Nice Thoughts on the Linux Router Project"
article. 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=";)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="bottom">  In any case, I'd like
to put all hard feelings aside and hope that anyone who I have offended
would do the same.

We received several complaints about the article, feeling that it attacked the
LRP unfairly.  Dave Cinege, the creator of the LRP, was going to write a
response addressing the inaccuracies he felt were in the article, but he did
not have time to finish his letter by press time.  I encourage readers with an
interest in routing to follow the links above to the projects' home pages and
decide for themselves if the LRP and its offspring are right for them.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Oxygen, EigerStein and 2.9.8, 
<A HREF="mailto:dcinege@psychosis.com"
	>Dave</A> writes:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
They are derivatives of stable releases of LRP, which is currently 2.9.8.
I have been creating a new OS similar to LRP for quite some time now.
Many things have come out of this are a new multi-packaging system (standard?)
that is more powerful then rpm or deb, yet not tied to any specific OS.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Regarding the 'ip' command, he writes:
</P>
<BLOCKQuote>
ip allows you to control the extended routing features of 2.2 and 2.4,
IE multiple routing tables. Ifconfig still works for the primary routing table
and interface configuration. ip can replace ifconfig, but ifconfig is still the
known standard.
</BLOCKQuote>
<P>
A few letters questioned <EM>LG</EM>'s editorial policy in allowing this article
to be published.  <EM>LG</EM>'s policy is pretty open.  If an article is about
Linux, contains hard facts or cultural value (e.g., humorous articles, cartoons
and articles about Linux VIPs), covers a topic relevant to a significant
portion of the readership, is not an advertisement in disguise, and would still
be relevant several months from now, we'll probably publish it.  There are
borderline cases, and this was one of them.
</P>
<P>
<EM>LG</EM> does not have a technical review board to screen every article,
although I do send a few questionable articles to The Answer Gang
for comment.  You, our readers, are <EM>LG</EM>'s technical review board,
and usually this system works very well.  99% of <EM>LG</EM>'s articles are
published without complaint.
</P>
<P>
In any case, please remember this article describes <EM>one person's</EM>
experience with certain routing programs.  It's not meant to be gospel,
in spite of the letter I received that said, "But newbies will read it and
think it's gospel!"  That's not how it works.  If you want gospel, read several
people's articles and compare them with your own experience.
</P>
<P>
Another thing this article does is raise the question, just because we <EM>can</EM>
use Linux in a wide variety of routing situations, should we?  Are you choosing
a Linux router because it's the most appropriate solution for the task, or
simply because "we're a Linux-only shop"?  Even if the article failed to
present LRP in a fair light, these are still questions worth asking.
</P>
<P>
As always, if you have any comments about an article, whether good or bad,
send them to <EM>LG</EM> and we will forward them to the author.
