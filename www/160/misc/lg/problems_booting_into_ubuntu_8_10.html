<p>
Hello everyone!
</p>

<p>
A student here brough to me a problem i couldnt solve, so i'm
forwarding it to tag.
</p>

<p>
After an hibernation, his laptop froze and he had to do a
hard-shutdown on it, and after that ubuntu stopped booting, giving him
this kernel panic message:
</p>

<pre>
[ 2.222518] Kernel panic - not sycing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on
unknown-block(0,0)
</pre>

<p>
After a few trys, he noticed that he can boot into other kernels he's
got on his machine, but they don't work properly (weird beeps,
auto-mount doesnt work, compiz - that kind of stuff)
</p>

<p>
Heres some messages:
<pre>
Mounting something without su:
DBus error org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NoReply: Did not receive a reply.
Possible causes include: the remote application did not send a reply,
the message bus security policy blocked the reply,
the reply timeout expired, or the network connection was broken.

/usr/bin/metacity
</pre>

<p>
--- Then several of the above errors ---
</p>

<p>
I checked his menu.lst, and heres the entry for the problematic kernel:
<pre class='code'>
title		Ubuntu 8.10, kernel 2.6.27-11-generic
uuid		1ac63e0f-dff7-48f8-9506-ce783a5dd383

splash
initrd		/boot/initrd.img-2.6.27-11-generic
quiet
</pre>

<p>
I noticed that weird root=UUID= on kernel, and changed it to
root=/dev/sda2 UUID=**** but it didnt work
</p>

<p>
Well, this is all for now - thanks for reading

<p>
Hello, try omitting the /dev/sda2 part from the root line or just omit the
entire uuid part. both should refer to the root partition but you only need
one or the other.
</p>

<p>
Help this helps, cheers.

compiz is probably not useful unless the hardware supports GL.

In any case, for such a system, getting a command line environment
first should be the first priority.

<p>
That is probably not a good idea! The UUID is a unique identifier for
the root block device. It is possible (for example) that the root
device is on a logical volume (or a logical volume on an encrypted
partition etc.) in which case the UUID may be the best way to
identify the block device.
</p>

<p>
Here is some information that would help in trouble-shooting:
</p>

<p>
1. To what extent the student is interested in/capable of messing
around with the system to figure out what went wrong. It may be
easier to re-install and (if this was not done already) create a
separate "/home" directory so that if something goes wrong, the
user files are recoverable.
</p>

<p>
2. The disk layout (fdisk and if LVM is used then that fact should be
mentioned).
</p>

<p>
3. The messages you get when you suppress the "quiet" in the grub menu
and in the kernel command line.
</p>

We have an almost fully working system - even gnome works, but some
weird stuff happens, making the system not 100%

<p>
He didn't want to have to format it - it is his first Linux
installation, and he fully customized it and everything (and didnt
know he could do a separate /home) - he's able to do that if there's no
other way
</p>


<pre>
&gt; 2. The disk layout (fdisk and if LVM is used then that fact should be

</pre>

<p>
I'll check with him later - for now all I know is that he's on ReiserFS
and has got an ntfs partition for some stuff, no LVM.

&gt; 3. The messages you get when you suppress the "quiet" in the grub menu

<p>
If it's only a few parts of the system that are buggered, he can
probably still take a backup of his home directory, so if he does need
to format and reinstall he's still got all his customisations there and
he can put them on a separate partition for next time.

<p>
It's not down to you to go changing that; so you broke it further, and
hopefully handed your student with even more broken pieces.  Sigh.

<p>
There's nothing wrong with trying a different 'root=' setting in GRUB;
it doesn't break anything more than what's already broken, and changing
it to the correct setting is all that's necessary either before or after
such a change.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, 'root=UUID=&lt;blah&gt;' is perfectly valid syntax - and is
even exactly the right thing to use if you have a reason for doing so
(i.e., you're going to shuffle the hardware in your system weekly just
for the heck of it.) If you don't, but you do know that your /dev/sda2
contains your root FS, then you should ask GRUB very politely to
</p>

<pre>
root=/dev/sda2
</pre>

<p>
What is NOT a good idea is engaging in cargo-culting (i.e., doing
something without understanding why you're doing it - such as copying
just a part of a commandline and trying to run it.) There's no 'UUID='
option for GRUB - that was part of the "address" given to the 'root='
argument - so Don't Do That.
</p>

<p>
Since I seem to recall Deividson mentioning being able to fire up the
system to at least some degree, I'd suggest running 'sudo /sbin/blkid'
to get the UUIDs for the system. Conversely, 'sudo tune2fs -l /dev/hdXN'
can be used to see the UUID for partition N of hard drive X.
</p>

<p>
Taking a broader view of this - since the system <em>does</em> come up, at
least somewhat, it seems that GRUB is doing its job (the boot would fail
part-way through - <strong>no</strong> applications would run - unless a valid FS was
found.) Given that, I'd check to see if all the required partitions were
mounted; "/usr" would cause no end of problems if it failed to come up,
while absence of "/home" would wreak all sorts of havoc for the
user-specific apps.
</p>

<p>
In short, take it easy - step by step. Start with what you know is still
good: boot to single-user and see what the system looks like. If that's
OK, "telinit" to the multi-user level defined for your distro (either 2
or 3 or 5, depending; it's usually 2 for Ubuntu.) Find where things
first start breaking, and fix the first problem [1], then check again.
If compiz, whatever, fail to come up, start X manually and try running
the X apps from the console (you may need to set DISPLAY explicitly to
do so); the error messages should be informative.
</p>



<p>
[1] One of the things that I find myself having to continually hammer on
when teaching programming classes: when you see a huge slew of errors,
don't let it bother you. The greatest majority of the time, fixing the
first error fixes all the rest of them - or at least greatly reduces the
list.

I couldn't figure out anything about this error tho - and this seem to
be what stops everything that doesn't work from working:
</p>

<pre>
DBus[1] error org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NoReply: Did not receive a reply.

the message bus security policy blocked the reply,

<p>
[1] Not always DBus
</p>

<p>
I'm considering telling him to boot with a livecd and backing up his
whole /home as Jason said.

Perhaps I was unclear -- changing it bears no relation to the other
symptoms for the stated problem.

<p>
Well, that applies to compiling, to perl, to anything
programming-related.  The <strong> first </strong> error is always the one that
counts.  It's common sense though, which is invariably why it needs to
be taught.

<p>
Well, that's quite the clue. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> Seems like GRUB doesn't know what you
want it to use as the root of your FS. if you're in any doubt of what
that might be, play around with it at the boot prompt (i.e., interrupt
GRUB and edit the boot command line.) Be aware that GRUB uses a slightly
different numbering scheme than the FS: e.g., 'root=(hd0,0)' represents
hda1; 'root=(hd1,2)' would be hdb3 and so on. You also need to make sure
that the kernel is in the right place and that you know which partition
contains '/sbin/init' (you can find this stuff out by running 'find
/vmlinuz' and 'find /sbin/init' from the GRUB command line.)
</p>

<p>
Once you've got that, you can use
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
root (hd0,0)
kernel /vmlinuz root=/dev/hda1
boot
</pre>

<p>
OR
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
kernel (hd0,0)/vmlinuz root=/dev/hda1
boot
</pre>

<p>
at the GRUB command line. The resulting fireworks should be grand. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
 
Do note that the two seemingly-conflicting 'root=' statements have
nothing to do with one another: the first one tells GRUB where to root
the FS; the second one is an argument to the 'kernel' keyword, and tells
GRUB where /sbin/init lives.
</p>

<p>
Incidentally, I've often seen the above kernel panic resulting from the
absence of the 'initrd=' line in 'menu.lst' after "update-grub" was
executed. Might be something to look for. If it's gone, you should
restore it for that stanza.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I checked his menu.lst, and heres the entry for the problematic kernel:
&gt; title		Ubuntu 8.10, kernel 2.6.27-11-generic
&gt; uuid		1ac63e0f-dff7-48f8-9506-ce783a5dd383
</pre>

<p>
As I recall, many versions of GRUB have problems with the 'uuid'
keyword. You're better off specifying it in the 'root' line, just as it
is.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; kernel		/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.27-11-generic
&gt; root=UUID=1ac63e0f-dff7-48f8-9506-ce783a5dd383 ro locale=pt_BR quiet
&gt; splash
&gt; initrd		/boot/initrd.img-2.6.27-11-generic
&gt; quiet
</pre>

<p>
Seems OK. Do check that all of the above is correct; stuff like 'blkid',
'vol_id', and 'ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/' can be very helpful here.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; I noticed that weird root=UUID= on kernel, and changed it to
&gt; root=/dev/sda2 UUID=**** but it didnt work
</pre>

<p>
Not surprising - as I'd mentioned elsewhere.

&gt; Perhaps I was unclear -- changing it bears no relation to the other
&gt; symptoms for the stated problem.
</pre>

<p>
The error said it couldn't mount - mount during boot time reminded me
of grub - and as I said before, I added a new option on grub, I did
not remove the old one - so, no, I did not break anything <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

&gt; &gt; In short, take it easy - step by step. Start with what you know is still
&gt; &gt; good: boot to single-user and see what the system looks like. If that's
&gt; &gt; OK, "telinit" to the multi-user level defined for your distro (either 2
&gt; &gt; or 3 or 5, depending; it's usually 2 for Ubuntu.) Find where things
&gt; &gt; first start breaking, and fix the first problem [1], then check again.
&gt; &gt; If compiz, whatever, fail to come up, start X manually and try running
&gt; &gt; the X apps from the console (you may need to set DISPLAY explicitly to
&gt; &gt; do so); the error messages should be informative.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; [1] One of the things that I find myself having to continually hammer on
&gt; &gt; when teaching programming classes: when you see a huge slew of errors,
&gt; &gt; don't let it bother you. The greatest majority of the time, fixing the
&gt; &gt; first error fixes all the rest of them - or at least greatly reduces the
&gt; &gt; list.

&gt; I couldnt figure out anything about this error tho - and this seem to
&gt; be what stops everything that doesnt work from working:
&gt; 
&gt; DBus[1] error org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NoReply: Did not receive a reply.

Is 'dbus-daemon' running?
</p>

<p>
Sample 'ps ax' output:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
ben@Tyr:~$ ps ax|grep '[d]bus'
 5108 ?        Ss     0:00 /usr/bin/dbus-daemon --system
 6315 ?        Ss     0:00 dbus-daemon --fork --print-address 24 --print-pid 26 --session

&gt; [1] Not always DBus
</pre>

<p>
Easily checked for other things, as well.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; Im considering telling him to boot with a livecd and backing up his
&gt; whole /home as Jason said.
</pre>

<p>
It's certainly a good idea no matter what else happens.
