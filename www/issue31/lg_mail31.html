I'm trying to find an e-mail to pager gateway. So for example if I send a
e-mail to 123456@mydomain.com it will send it to the pager system but if
I send and e-mail to evargas@mydomain.com leave the message in my pop

For quite some time now I've been wondering how to set up my SyQuest 
EZ 135 removable disk drive under Linux. If you haven't seen one, 
it's kind of like a ZIP drive, but less of an industry standard. I 
got it for free, otherwise I don't think it would have been worth it. 
Anyway, I have about six 135MB disks for it and I'd like to give some 
of that to Linux. Any ideas? I've seen a driver around before, but I 
don't remember where to get it.

Subject: <B>The Other Side of the Story</B> 
<P>
In the article, Installing Microsoft & Linux, by Manish P. Pagey, we
were treated to a (possibly justified) diatribe about the difficulties
in integrating Linux and Win95.  However, to have a more balanced view,
one might also note the following:
<P>
I like Linux thus far.  But I never mistake what I like with that is
simpler for the average person out there to use.  Linux is as user
friendly as a hurled brick.  Installing Linux puts you at a $ or #
prompt with no clue of where to go afterwards.  I'm a Novell CNE with
many years experience working with PCs and networks, so I'm not daunted
by a non-intuitive prompt.  And I already had a WIN95 machine set up so
I could access the net, download the truly excellent Linux Journal
online, and get support on how to install RPMs, etc.  Had that not been
the case, however, I'd have been hard pressed to iron our the wrinkles
in my install, or to know which files to edit, or programs to run, to do
basic configuration.  By comparison, win95 starts off in the gui mode,
allowing for rather intuitive productivity immediately.  And yes, I
agree...it IS less stable.  But crashing once a week (and I don't, by
the way... I applied the service pack to it, and I am very stable) is
still far better than not being able to even find out how to connect to
the net.  
<P>
When Linux finishes installing, you're left with a # prompt.  When WIN95
finishes installing, you've a fairly intuitive GUI that allows you to
quickly and easily install and run programs, connect to the net, and
**apply updates without re-compiling the kernel**.
<P>
So is win95 better than Linux?  Nope.  But neither is it inferior.  Each
tool for the right job.  If someone wants to set up their own PC and get
working quickly, the average person without experience in EITHER of the
OS's will have an easier time with win95.  The trade off for that is
that yes, it IS less stable in the long run, and yes, you DO have to pay
for it. But considering that for the novice, the alternative is a PC
that he/she cannot use, the answer seems clear that one should get the
more easily installed and usable system.  And that is not yet Linux.  
<P>
I believe firmly that it one day WILL be.  Many of the Linux Accolytes
have decried the attempt to enhance the functionality and ease of use
for Linux as the equivalent of "Starting down the Dark path of the
Force."  (shrug)  A bit melodramatic, if you ask me.  Consider this...
that if we don't make it more user friendly, it will STAY a tiny share
of the home and small business market, which in turn means less software
written for it, and less call for us to support it for a living.  Which,
given all it's virtues, seems a shame, doesn't it?
<P>
Let's keep the tight, elegant kernel that is Linux, and add ease of use
to it.  If we do this, then like IBM's iron fisted dominance of the PC
market that faded, so too will Microsoft be "The Giant That Was." 
However, if we insist on keeping Linux the OS that commands a religious
like fervor with a select few, and keeping it un-usable for the vast
majority of home and small business users, we'll continue to watch Mr.
Gates... the richest man in the world... sell upgrades to a kludgy OS
for more money than ANY current version of Linux gets.  And we'll hear
his laughter.

Subject: <B>RedHat Service Pack 1</B> 
<P> 
A badly organized yet sketchy editorial, upon these themes:
<P> 
Just when Linux was starting to get a little more of the limelight,
Red Hat releases a new version of its popular distribution, the
regrettably buggy RH5.1 (a few weeks ahead of whatever product from
Redmond).
<P> 
Many Linux beginners will probably start with Red Hat, because of the
ease of installation and the collection of software.
bo 
Many or most beginners who want to give Linux a try will be installing
on their home machines, and will want to connect to the Internet by
modem afterwards (sorry -- PPP module not supported by kernel).  Note:
this feature makes it difficult for home users to download patches from
FTP sites.
<P> 
Furthermore, all users might want to install additional RPMs from CDROMS
(sorry -- unable to mount iso9660 filesystem).
<P> 
[Strangely, when I upgraded an RH4.2 system to RH5.1, I did not have
trouble with PPP or CD-ROM support, but when I did an RH5.1 installation
from scratch, I did have problems.  On that troublesome system, I
reformatted and reinstalled RH4.2.]
<P> 
Many (or at least I) passed over RH5.0 (because I had read it needed a
lot of patching) and waited for RH5.1 to come out.
<P> 
The Linux press doesn't appear to have commented on this situation.
Maybe I'm not looking hard enough, but I haven't come across any product
reviews or editorials in the on-line Linux press chastising RedHat for
rushing a defective product to market (ala Microsoft).
<P> 
In spite of the above, "Me, I'm a Red Hat Man".
<P> 
I'm no expert user, but I am a fan of the Linux phenomenon and certainly
of Red Hat, and I guess I'm just disappointed by the possibility that
potential newcomers might be frustrated and turned away from Linux by
the current Red Hat distribution.
<P> 
I wish the people at Red Hat well, and will probably even send some money
their way, in appreciation of their 4.2 distrib as well as their ongoing
efforts.  However, I might wait for RH5.2 or at least give the most
crucial of the RH5.1 patches enough time to make it onto the official CD
pressings.
<P> 
[To be fair, I should note that I obtained RH5.1 on a $1.99 CD from
CheapBytes, but from reading the newsgroups, I don't believe that this
undermines the points made above.  Also, I don't imagine that RedHat's
own commercial CD releases and their FTP site would be much out-of-sync,
and CheapBytes probably relies on the RH FTP site for its pressings.]

two implementations of wxWindows 2.0, the Windows version, available

GTK based Unix version wxGTK, available from
http://www.freiburg.linux.de/~wxxt/ . Both versions are ready for
development right now ( We are using it to implement quite a large
e-mail application, http://Ballueder.home.ml.org/M ). A third version,=20=
<P>
based on Motif is under development.

You also mentioned the "side project" of a port of wxWindows which
doesn't require the Motif libraries. This "port", called wxXt has been=20=
<P>
around for many years and is probably the most-used wxWindows version
on Linux. It provides a complete Motif-lookalike interface, without
requiring Motif.
<P>
I find that if you look at the newer wxWindows releases, especially
wxGTK, they provide a much more complete environment and a much
improved user interface than other toolkits. Unfortunately, your
screenshots based on the older Motif version don't show this.

<P>
  Thank you for responding to my e-mail. However, my feelings were not of offense
but of total irritation that the Linux literature at all levels is saturated
with the debasing of others and their operating system.
<P>
There are forums where people can vent their dislikes but they do a disservice to
the Linux community by littering Linux literature all of types their personal
dislikes of others and their efforts.
<P>
Linux is being touted as the operating system of the future and it could very
well be that some day it will mature to this status. However, the Linux community
will have to mature with it if they expect this to happen. The type of article
will only repel people rather than attract them. Sell the features and benefits
of the Linux operating system and people will use it, denigrate others and their
efforts and Linux will languish.
<P>
Perhaps, it would be timely to include the 'Advocacy Mini How-to' by Paul L.
Rogers in a future edition in an effort help Linux users understand that tirades
and even snide remarks are counter to their goal of promoting Linux and are
destructive instead.

I listened intently to the Internet audio broadcast when Steve Jobs
supplied the voice over to the great race between a 333 MHz Pentium II
and Apple's G3.  Of course, for those who did listen, we were to learn
that G3 ate Pentium's lunch when the two processors 'drag raced' through
a run-time application of Photoshop followed by animation, courtesy of
Macromedia Director. After listening to the Inter-cast, the world
suddenly became aware of the power of G3.
<P>
So.... Why not host a drag race on the Internet between Win 95, Win NT 4
and Win 98 and Linux?  Hell, throw OS/2 Warp and Novell in there also.
(of course, using identical computers - processors, networking cards,
etc.). Ballyhoo the event with home page and search engine banner ads
(paid for by Red Hat, Caldera, and anyone else who'll make a buck out of
the event). Invite C|NET, Andover Net and ZDNet to cover the event. Run
Linux on Apache or however the Linux-meisters see fit, but let's see
once and for all just what this OS can do not only for speed but for
reliability. Then, and only then, will people not only take notice of
the product, but will, in fact, try it (buy it in some cases) and use
it.

Subject: <B>the cruel reality</B> 
<P>
Note: This essay assumes that the DoJ (Department of Justice) is nonexistent.
<P>
While I am a vocal Linux (and Unix) advocate and am deeply alarmed at
the thought of a Redmond controlled world, once in a while it helps to
sit down and examine reality.
<P>
Linux, at this point in its development, is still too much of a learning
curve for the majority of PC users. Most of the Linux users I know,
including myself, are software engineers, systems programmers, system
administrators, or some other variant of systems professional. All but
one use a commercial Unix variant at work.  Some PC aficionados showed
genuine interest in my Linux box with its various GUIs during its
lifetime. The interest seemed to fade when they saw the command line
tricks still lurking under most of the more interesting things you can
do with Linux, even if these tricks are eventually launched from the
window manager. Until the time comes that Linux can be installed,
configured and maintained from a fright free interface, it will stay in
the realm of techies.
<P>
All is not hopeless though. Looking back 20 years to the beginning of
personal computing we see that the innovators and early adopters were
overwhelmingly techies and electronic hobbyists. We also see that
traditional IT types dismissed the early PC as inappropriate for
business use. Big Iron would rule the glass tower forever. PC advocates
retorted that they would eventually take over and the centralised
systems of MIS would be phased out as dinosaurs. Even respectable
periodicals like The Economist spouted drivel about PCs replacing
mainframes. The reality that has developed since the early 80's has been
neither a continuation of Big Iron nor a clean sweep by Wintel.
Centralised computing in the form of servers, including the new
generation of mainframe class systems, is doing just fine. Wintel PCs
have occupied most of the lower niches and are rising into new ones, but
will this rise continue until Wintel everywhere is a reality?
<P>
Most of the decision makers in IT right now are either managers who were
flexible enough to allow PCs into the systems framework back in the 80's
or they rose through the ranks during the last 15 years of PC centric
computing. Many of them honestly believe in Wintel's manifest destiny.
They have either known no other reality except Wintel dominance, or if
they have, it was one of IBM dominance. In either case the mind set is
very similar. Just like in the early 80's, a closed IS mind set seems
dead against branching from the safe and tried road and into new and
fresh territory. Fortunately, similar to what happened in the 80's, a
few courageous thinkers can see the widening cracks in the Windows.
<P>
To these "aware" techies the dream of an inexorable upward rise of the
Wintel PC into the world of workhorse systems is turning into a
nightmare. More people are starting to see this. The interest in Java,
the NC concept, managed PCs, Citrix ICA, all are early signs of a
growing dissatisfaction with the legacy of DOS. Windows boxes are
notoriously troublesome, but where are the alternatives? Linux is
showing itself to be promising, but it is _not_  yet ready to be adopted
by the herd. PC makers are aware of this and continue to bundle MS OSes,
you're better off with the devil you know.
<P>
The great hope of the Windows world is NT. With Windows98 showing itself
to be a yet another troublesome incarnation of DOS/Windows, NT is the
last refuge.
<P>
Strangely, instead of making NT the solid crash proof system people
crave, Redmond hacks and bloats up NT in hopes of getting it into higher
margin roles that are still too much for it to handle. Redmond pushes,
and reacts to criticism of its baby with patches, hacks and bloat.
Redmond keeps pushing, and NT continues to show itself as being unready
for the big leagues. Redmond say, "Wait! NT version 5.0 will have all
sorts of new features and capabilities that will make it perfect for
enterprise computing." More likely is NT 5.0, with it's 30+ million
lines of code, 24+ million of them new and untested, may just turn out
to be the most bug ridden bloated carcass of ugly hacks we've ever seen.
Redmond will once again have egg on its face, but this time will it be a
permanent stain?
<P>
If NT 5.0 turns out to be a huge disappointment, then the alternatives
will have to be ready to entice a growing pool of would-be defectors.
Linux will have to be more usable and manageable by the WinHerd. It will
have to be viable enough to convince OEMs that they can afford to break
their devil's bargains with Microsoft. If Redmond trips and once again
the lack of viable alternatives allows it to get on its feet and
continue building its empire, we have only ourselves to blame. We have
two years, can we do it?

Please pass on my congratulations on a wonderful
article to Alex - his CHAOS system apparently caused 
my coworkers to think of me, and my WHOPPeRS (Wacky
Hastily Organized Parallel Processesing Research Scheme)
system, which looks a lot like CHAOS.  Only difference
is that mine is sitting on my bedroom floor... ;-)
