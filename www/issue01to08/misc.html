Sometimes it seems that the supply of unix/Linux software is inexhaustible!
I've begun to realize that it would take several lifetimes to learn to
use all of this stuff.  What is gratifying is finding utilities and
applications which suit your work habits and style.  <P>
This month I'd like to make brief mention of several packages which
have shown up on the ftp sites recently.<P>

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="nedit">A Nedit That Works!</A></H3></CENTER>

I first tried the Nedit editor, a Motif-linked application from the Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois, soon after my first Slackware
installation.  The first impression it made on me was favorable; an intuitive,
easy-to-use, and reasonably powerful editor which also was visually
appealing.<P>

But then it began to crash, especially when attempting to use the
font-changing window.  Eventually I deleted it and went on to other things.  A
few months later a Linux executable of a new version (4.01) showed up on the
Sunsite mirrors, so I thought I'd give it another chance.<P>

This time it is an ELF executable compiled on a Slackware version 3.00
machine, which is probably about as generic an environment as you'll find in
the Linux world.  It seems to be as solid as a rock now and I unhesitatingly
recommend it if you like to use a pleasingly designed editor which has all of
the basic editing functionality you would need for ninety per cent of typical
editing tasks.<P> One useful feature is Nedit's use of the X clipboard, rather
than an internal private clip-buffer.  This opens up the possibility of using
the venerable but still useful utility, xclipboard, which is usually part of
the default installation of a Linux distribution.  Xclipboard is a multiple
sliding clipboard utility (a new clip pushes the previous one down one level
in the stack), and the contents of this clipboard are available to any other X
program with that capability.  A surprising number of editors don't have this
ability, Gnu Emacs being an obvious example.(Or does it?  Let me know if there
<EM>is</EM> a way!). Netscape uses the X clipboard, which leads me to surmise
that there is something in the Motif libraries which facilitates the
clipboard's use.<P>

The keyboard macro facility is simple and intuitive; the
resultant macros are saved in your ~/.nedit file.<P>

A feature which I didn't see mentioned in the online help, but which is nice
for those who have to access files from a DOS partition: text copied or cut
from a msdos file and pasted into a Linux file is automatically stripped of
the extraneous ^M carriage returns.<P> The main drawback of a
statically-linked Motif app like Nedit is the longer load time, about the same
as emacs in an X session, and the greater memory needs.  But it so pleasant to
look at...<P>

<H3><A NAME="auis">Elf-Based Andrew User Interface System </A></H3></CENTER>

A year or so I saw some bulky, mysterious packages on a Slackware CD.  After
reading the introductory readme files I still couldn't quite comprehend this
&quot;AUIS&quot; system.  After filling a major fraction of a hard disk with the EZ
editor and the Mail package, nothing would run at all, so all that organized
data evaporated into random electrons again.  <P>

Last winter a new set of packages, bulky as ever, appeared on the Sunsite
mirror sites.  Ever a sucker for new software, I downloaded it all one snowy
evening and unpacked it into a self-contained text-and-image processing world
unto itself.  <P>

As I began to explore the interconnected modules, the text-editor/word
processor, the email facility, the image processors, I began to feel weary.  I
already had Linux programs which perform these functions and had learned their
quirks.  The Andrew programs are different enough from the typical X program
that it's like starting from scratch. <P>

The Andrew System programs are certainly visually well designed and laid out.
They have that &quot;Motif&quot; look about them.  What I finally began to realize is
that they just didn't seem to fit in with the motley collection of other Linux
programs I had installed.  They have their own fonts, as an example.<P>

A phrase that came to mind was &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot; but after further
consideration &quot;coinventing the wheel&quot; seemed more appropriate.  Think about
it: work began on the AUIS in the early eighties, a collaboration between IBM
and the Carnegie-Mellon Institute, back in the dark ages of personal
computers.  During the evolution since then of GUI interfaces, evidently a
team of programmers (paid?  volunteers?) has been toiling away in parallel on
the AUIS.  The present work is really quite an achievement but I'm curious as
to how many actual users the system has.<P>

I admit I didn't spend enough time with the system to really become familiar
with it.  Some of my facts are probably wrong, and certainly my opinions and
conclusions could be way off-base.<P>

I invite anyone who has used this system, or who has worked on it, to submit
to the LG any other points of view.  I'm still curious; I searched usenet
archives for postings concerning AUIS but didn't come up with much.  The
multimedia/MIME capabilities of the mail system are interesting but I didn't
want yet another independent mailbox on my system.  Has anyone used the mail
system extensively?<P>

Perhaps in the next issue we shall be treated to some more informed opinions
and impressions than mine!<P> <HR>

<CENTER> <H3><A NAME="fte">FTE: A Folding Editor From the OS/2
World</A></H3></CENTER>

I was using OS/2 long before I discovered Linux, and
an ongoing programming project I've followed with great interest for a couple
of years now is Marco Macek's FTE editor.<P>

Basically a programmer's editor,
it is distinguished by an integrated system of folding, using regular
expressions.  Originally the editor read a long series of editable text
configuration files when started up, which made customization of
file-suffix-specific behaviour and syntax hi-lighting an easy process. This
system has been refined (for speed reasons) in recent builds.  Now after
editing the config files they are then compiled (with a small compiler
included in the package) into a small ~/.fterc file.<P>

A month or so I was intrigued by an announcement on

<A HREF="http://ixtas.fer.uni-lj.si/~markom/fte/">
Marko Macek's Webpage</A>

stating that an alpha Linux version was available for download directly from
the page.  The first two attempts I installed didn't work too well, but the
current beta 0.39 build (26 May 1996) has been stabilized and works well in
both the console and X versions.<P>

This is one of those nicely pliable editors which can be configured in to suit
any tastes.  The *.fte config files are commented and easily comprehended.
Configuring support for a new programming language would be no chore.<P>

Both the X and console versions have drop-down menus beneath the titlebar, and
these can be different for varying file types.  As an example, when an *.html
file is opened the editor goes into html-mode, loading tag macros and adding
an &quot;HTML&quot; section to the menubar.  The neat part about this is that you can
read the uncompiled *.fte files and see just how this is done.<P>

After an FTE editing session I noticed two new dot-files in my home
directory. Upon inspection these turned out to be saved desktop information;
in other words when FTE is restarted the last file edited in the previous
session is reloaded, and the other files which had been loaded in that
previous session are in the new edit ring, without being loaded into memory
until specifically invoked. This feature is handy for any sort of
programming.<P>

Another new feature is a well-integrated drive and directory browser.  If the
editor is started up without a filespec a listing of the CWD is displayed.
<P>

This editor I think is deserving of note partly because few programs have been
ported from OS/2 to Linux.  Of course, many unix and GNU programs have been
ported from unix to OS/2, and I think a cumulative effect might be discerned
now: many OS/2 users have become familiar with the peculiar unix world because
of these ports, and many of them have begun using Linux as well.  The unix
free software tradition may well take root in OS/2 soil; FTE, though not
designated as being under the GPL, is nonetheless freeware and may possibly
remain so.  The Linux version I'm sure will!<P><HR>

<CENTER> <H3><A NAME="tkedit">TkEdit</A></H3></CENTER>

From

<A HREF="mailto:kowallik@ifh.de">Rainer Kowallik</A>

in Zeuthen, Germany comes what is in my opinion the best of the few text
editors programmed entirely in Tcl-Tk.  This editor,according to the author,
was in part a reaction against the &quot;emacs way of doing things&quot; .  <P>

Being programmed in Tcl gives the editor the advantage of having a very
powerful macro language built right into the guts of the program.  An
interesting aspect of this application is the variation on the usual tendency
to have a single .*rc startup file in the home directory; TkEdit instead has a
~/.Tkedit_macros subdirectory in which the user places whichever of the
preconfigured macros suit his or her editing style.  New macros can be placed
there as well.  An extensive collection of these is installed in a
subdirectory off of the /bin directory TkEdit lives in; they can be loaded
while the program is running as well as from the start-up directory.<P>

This editor does take some getting used to.  The default keyboard
configuration I thought was odd (no page-up or page-down; instead you
shift-up-arrow-key and shift-down-arrow-key).  The default keys can of course
be changed.  Many advanced programming features are included, as well as
convenient little utilities like quick stripping of dos-style CR from files or
marked blocks.  <P>

What looks to be a slick implementation of menu-driven function-key
macro-recording is an unusual feature; other editors have macro-recording, but
it often takes longer to find the documentation describing the feature than to
actually do it.  I know I'm more likely to develop a collection of editor
macros if I can do it without having to take a tutorial first!<P>

I thought I'd include a screenshot of this editor, as its interface is rather
unusual.  There is quite a bit of function packed into that tool/menubar.<P>

<CENTER> <A HREF="../gx/ayers/tkedit.gif">TkEdit Screen</A></CENTER><P>

This is one of those programs to keep an eye on; it's
still being developed but, while perhaps its not at an utterly dependable
stage, it works well enough for everyday work.  What I like about Tcl-Tk apps
like this one, TkDesk, etc. is that while configuring and using them you begin
to understand a little how John Ousterhout's programming creations
tick.<P><HR>

<CENTER> <H3><A NAME="process_monitors">A Couple of New Process Monitors</A>
</H3></CENTER>

For some reason there seems to be a plethora of process monitors available for
Linux.  One reason for this is that the needed information (cpu-load, etc.) is
easily accessible to running processes.  The /proc directory contains a wide
variety of information about the session and these monitors typically tap
right into it and display the results graphically.<P> Lately two new monitors
have appeared which I think are worthy of note, Procmeter and Xmemuse.<P><HR>

<CENTER><H4>Xmemuse</H4> </CENTER>

<IMG SRC="../gx/ayers/xmem.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>

From the Netherlands comes Xmemuse, by

<A HREF="mailto:harm@es.ele.tue.nl">Harm Arts</A><P>

This is an Xmemuse window running in a well-loaded Linux session, with
Netscape, Emacs, and several other applications running in different virtual
desktops. The free swap space is at the top; you can see this begin to
diminish as the programs are started.<P>The blue band at the bottom is
buffered memory, while directly above that is a thin green band of free
memory.The thin yellow line marks the amount of shared memory.&nbsp;(One of
these days I <EM>must</EM> get around to changing those default colors!)  <P>

If the categories sound familiar, it's because these colored areas represent
the same information reported by the &quot;free&quot; command.  Xmemuse just gives you
another way to visualize that information.<P>

This is hardly an essential utility, but it's nice to have around when you
want an inside look at how those SIMMS are being used.<P><HR>

<CENTER><H4>Procmeter</H4> </CENTER>

<IMG SRC="../gx/ayers/procmeter.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>

<IMG SRC="../gx/ayers/procm2.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>

Procmeter
has resemblances to several other process meters available, but the author,
Andrew M. Bishop, has distinguished his program by reducing the overhead
needed and making a choice of views quick and menu-driven.

If the Procmeter title just beneath the title bar is clicked, a menu with
twenty-five different entries drops down.  Choices include network activity,
paging, disk activity, and cpu activity, with each being represented by
several variants.The program starts with whatever default views you like, but
while it's running you can view and dismiss any of the others.  As an example,
there is little point in monitoring packet transfer when you're not
online!<P>

The display is a vertical-bar graph similar to xload.<P><HR>

It is interesting to consider just what it is that gives these monitor
utilities their appeal. For me, at least, an occasional glimpse into the
mysterious inner workings of the operating system and hardware serves as a
reminder of what amazing technology this is.  (On a more prosaic note, the
utilities help in optimizing a system's performance... but let's not get
prosaic!)<P>

<CENTER>
<H4>Availability</H4></CENTER>

I originally found these programs in Georgia Tech's Incoming directory, but
since then they have been moved to

<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cc.gatech.edu/pub/linux/system/Status/">

this directory.</A><P> <HR>
