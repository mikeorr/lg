<p>
A discussion on Slashdot in October would have you believe that
there aren't any good CAD programs for Linux. In fact, nothing
could be farther from the truth.
This discussion started with the GPL release of a 2-D CAD
package called Qcad. From there it evolved into what is a
``<tt><I>GOOD</tt></I>
CAD'' and who wanted what commercial package on Linux someday.
<p>
Once and for all I would like to set the record straight. There
are options out there today.
Several different packages are available, each with a different
level of power and capability. Each package fits a different
budget.
<p>
<H3>Qcad</H3>
<p>
Qcad is the first (to my knowledge) working GPL CAD package for
Linux. There are several projects currently listed as
work-in-progress, but Qcad is here now. Qcad has a simple 2-D
editor and uses DXF as it's native format. Qcad gets its name
from the Qt tool kit. For those who do not use KDE, relax; it is
not desktop-dependent. I have used it with both Xfce and
AfterStep and have not seen any problems. With a simple icon menu
it is functional and easy to learn. After a few minutes, I was
working on my daughters new bed design. All the basic functions
are at your finger tips.
<p>
Lines can be drawn by coordinates,
clicking or offsetting an existing line. Circles and arcs can be
created just as easily. Construction geometry can then be trimmed
or extended to clean up the drawing and ready it for detailing.
The font selection did seem to be a little limited. If you are
willing, however, there is a means to create new fonts by
copying an existing font file to a new name and modifying it.
I imported one of my ``OLD'' title blocks and found that it required
very little fixing or tweaking. Again a better selection of fonts
would have helped with this problem.
<p>
I also pulled up several
NACA wing sections none of which were corrupted in any way.
For a final test I edited one of the sections, saved it and then
pulled it up and extruded it with AC3D. For those who use AC3D,
Qcad makes a very nice flat-pattern editor.
<p>

at <A HREF="http://www.qcad.org/index.php3">http://www.qcad.org/index.php3</A>.
<p>
<H3>CAM Expert</H3>
<p>
CAM Expert is the commercial big brother to Qcad. It has a
similar interface to Qcad, but with extended features leaning
more towards the creation of NC-programs. These features include
but are not limited to: NC Import, NC Creation, Optimizing way,
Optimization for Cutting Machines, (Cutting Contours From Inside
To Outside), Individual Configuration of the NC Output Format,
CAM Simulation, Regulating Simulation Speed, Smooth Simulation and
Show Rapid Move. I would be interested in hearing from those who
have put this software to use as I do not have the proper
equipment.
<p>

<p>
<H3>SISCAD-P</H3>
<p>
SISCAD-P is a 2-D parametric CAD system from Staedtler.
Installation was a little more complex than for some of the
others (especially for non-SUSE users), but it is well worth the
effort. For those familiar with Sketcher (2-D editor for CATIA), SISCAD-P
reminds me of it only with many more features and a bit
easier to use. The features include: parametrics, variational
geometry, inference sketching, a fully customizable user
interface, constraint-based modeling and feature-based modeling.
Also if all of the smart geometry becomes too overwhelming you
can turn it off and just treat it like a simple 2-D CAD Package
with all the standard line, arc, circle, and text commands that
you'd expect to have at your disposal.
<p>
The downloadable version
is a demo that is limited in the size of a file it will
save. From the menu, I selected the LOAD/DXF and imported the same
bed design I had started in Qcad. After adding some more detail,
I inserted the same title block as I had with Qcad only to
receive a message stating that I had exceeded the limit (of the
DEMO). I would have liked a little more room to play, but it did
give me enough time to see that I should have taken the time to
get this one going sooner.
<p>
My earlier attempts had been on a
Mandrake and various Red Hats. This was my first try with SuSE and
that seemed to make the difference. To download the demo go to:
<A HREF="ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages/cad/">ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages/cad/</A>. There are
instructions on how to register and get a full license in the
documentation, but I've been told that Staedtler is no longer in
the software business and will not support it.

<h4>Figure 3. SISCAD-P</h4></center>

<p>
<H3>ME10</H3>
<p>
ME10 is a 2-D parametric CAD by CoCreate, a subsidiary of
Hewlett-Packard. If an award is given for the fastest learning
curve then this is the winner. I've always preferred a text-based
menu over icons. I think icons only make sense to the person who
creates them. The oversized menu section takes up a lot of the
screen but it makes up for it with the ease you can move
through the commands. Whatever you need, it's right there.
<p>
According to the web page, it features parametrics with a ``parts
concept'': an assembly may contain multiple copies or instances of
a part. When the part is modified all the instances would update
as well. By the same concept, sub assemblies may be inserted as
an instance in other assemblies. This can be repeated creating an
intelligent tree for your part structure.
<p>
ME10 has it's own
internal browser for previewing drawings and symbols. Also
included is a parts library and engineering symbols. Although it
does have an IGES translator, DXF would have been nice. I would
have liked to bring in some of my older geometry, but it's all
DXF. There is a demo available that is well-worth the time to
download. Again, the demo is limited in the size of the file
that it will save. For more information and the demo check out
the home page at
<A HREF="http://www.cocreate.com/english/products/2d/index.htm">http://www.cocreate.com/english/products/2d/index.htm</A>.

<p>
<H3>CADDA</H3>
<p>
The CADDA is from DAVEG. I did not find any kind of demo to try
out on the home page, but it appears very nice. In response to my
e-mails I was given the following to share:
<p>
<blockquote>
The CADDA software is a true CAD/CAM solution that offers CAD and
CAM functionality within one user interface. CAD-data can be
imported as 3-D or 2-D models. The CADDA user selects, verifies
and corrects the data during the preparation process. A postprocessor
generates a ready to use CNC-machine program.
<p>
CADDA supports following technologies: 2 1/2-D milling/drilling, 3-D
free form milling, turning, erosion cutting, sink erosion and
grinding. The newest branch of CADDA is the CAD/CAQ-module. It is
working like CADDA CAD/CAM, but the preparation and post-processor
system produces a ready-to-use program for a
CNC-measurement machine. The CADDA application extends 3D-CAD
produced data to become directly processable by the CNC-machine-equipped
factory. If necessary, a direct connection between CADDA
and the CNC-controls is deliverable. As an option, CADDA-CAD/CAM
can include a full 2-D drawing capability to enable the staff with
limited-modelling capabilities.
<p>
CADDA has been under continuous development by DAVEG for 15 years.
HP-UX was the system basis up to 1998. In 1998, DAVEG offered a
first version of a LINUX-based CADDA with PENTIUM II Hardware.
Today DAVEG has installed 300 seats with LINUX: the results
are extremely good. Customers are impressed with performance and
stability.

<p>
<H3>Varicad</H3>
<p>
Varicad offers 3-D solids and 2-D drafting at a very nice price.
The user has the options of the icon panels or the pull-down
menus. Although I like the text-based menu (pull down), I did
find the ``Commands'' nested a bit too deep. This makes the
pull-down menus slow. The icon panels work much faster, but the icons
are not always obvious as to their meaning. Also, you can enter
commands at a command prompt.
<p>
Varicad is another one that has
been around for Linux for many years. More people are probably
familiar with Varicad than any of the others. Part of this is
because of a very good article about it in <I>LJ</I> last year.
<p>
Varicad can import and export both DXF and IGS. You can extrude or
revolve 2-D geometry. Other types of solids include: prisms,
cylinders, filled elbows, truncated pyramids, truncated cones,
cone pipe, helix and square to round transitions. In addition to
the standard boolean add (union) and cut (subtraction), you also
have cut save tool, save part, cut save part and tool, and
add cut part. Other additional functions include fillet, chamfer,
hole, milling and groove. A simple intersection would have been
nice. One thing I do appreciate very much was a good undo/redo
that was easy to find. in fact it's hard to miss. Once the
solids have been created they can be analyzed for anything from
distance between objects to center of mass and moment of inertia.
<p>
<p>

<img alt="figure" src="gx/frost/varicad.jpg">
<h4>Figure 5. Varicad</h4></center>

<p>
There is a non-saving demo which can be downloaded for free. In
addition there is a 30-day trial key which you can obtain to
allow you to save for those 30 days. Varicad has announced that they are
now a member of opendwg. What this means is that varicad will import and
export (read  and write) the AutoCAD DWG format. For the demo and more information go to the Varicad home page at <A HREF="http://www.varicad.com/">http://www.varicad.com/</A>.
<p>
<H3>Microstation</H3>
<p>
Bentley is well known for it's Microstation line of cad products.
Although there is not a commercial version for Linux there is an academic
version. If you venture to the home page
there is also a page where you can ``petition'' for a full
commercial version. Word is they will not go commercial
unless there is more interest. The academic version seems to have
most of the functionality of the regular UNIX version except
there are no Parasolid libraries. Modeler, TriForma and MS/J all
use the Parasolid libraries. So if you're working 3-D, it will be
wireframe and surfaces. Once again, if there is enough interest
to justify the port this may change. All of the 2-D tools to
create, edit and detail geometry are present.
<p>
One of the things
that I have always like about Microstation is that it creates a
very nice RIB file for rendering, with BMRT or other Renderman-compliant
renderers. It also has the ability to render within the
application itself. Try some of the sample files included to get
a better idea of what can be done. There are no demo's or
downloads to my knowledge, but there is a wealth of information on
the Bentley home page at
<A HREF="http://www.bentley.com/academic/products/linux2.htm">http://www.bentley.com/academic/products/linux2.htm</A>.

<p>
<H3>Varimetrix</H3>
<p>
Varimetrix has been in the Linux CAD market for over three years.
Their previous generation product was renamed VX Classic.
The newest product line from Varimetrix is called Vision. Both
Vision and VX Classic are Commercial applications whose prices
are probably beyond what most people could afford for personal
use. For this reason, the information I have given is based on
their home page, and an article in <I>Cadence</I> magazine.
There is a demo disk for Vision, but don't get your hopes up. I
sent off for it to help me with this article--what I received
was not what I consider a demo. It was a presentation program
that duplicated the information from the web page. If you do
order a copy, don't panic when it says Windows 95 or better, it
works well with Linux/Wine.
<p>
VX Classic is broken down into modules. The first module for VX
Classic is VX modeling. Using their own in-house modeling engine
called Unified Parametric Geometry (UPG), they did not have to
wait for some one else to port it to the platforms they wish
to support. VX Classic offers the choice of 3-D wireframe,
surfaces and solids. In
addition to having the choice of modeling methods, you also have
the ability to transform geometry between types. Solids can be
created by constrained/dimensioned geometry created from its
intelligent sketcher. In addition to the traditional boolean
operations, you can also sculpt the solids with a collection of
spatula functions. For the Perl buffs out there, guess what they
use for user scripting? Hint, it starts with ``P'' and has four
letters. There is also a C interface called OpenVX.
<p>
The Second Module, VX Assembly, allows intelligent positioning of
the details both in relation to other geometry and also with the
bill of materials. Concurrent control of the assemblies is
provided so that multiple designers can work within the same
project without splintering the design. BOMs can be created
automatically. A schematic representation of the BOM tree is also
available. Parts can be analyzed to show CG, overall mass,
moments of inertia, and collision between parts.
The third module, VX Drafting, takes the details and assemblies
created and gives the user all the tools needed to turn these
into engineering drawings. The Drafting module can also work
independently of the other modules. You may use layout templets,
arrays, blocks or multiple instancing of geometry. VX Drafting
provides automatic hidden line removal, and both automatic and
interactive dimensioning. There is also a complete list of 2-D
drafting utilities, all using constraint-based geometry. The list
of features goes on and on and on.
<p>
The final module for VX Classic, VX Manufacturing, is a complete
suite of CAM tools. VX Manufacturing uses the dataset from the
modeling module. All forms of geometry can be used by this module
wireframe, surfaces, and solids. Up to five axes are supported.
Once again the list of features go on and on.
<p>
Vision for Linux should have been commercially available already.
You would never have known this from the web page. The web pages
on Vision never even mention Linux. I had mailed Varimetrix last
year and received a replay saying ``Our new product line called VX
Vision will also be running under Linux soon (mid-summer).
Actually, it runs now but we are still testing.'' There was an
article on Vision in the July/99 issue of <I>Cadence</I> magazine.
Although the article was based on the NT version it does mention
that there is a Linux version. For those who wish to migrate from
NT to Linux this might be a good starting point.
<p>
You can find out
more on VX Classic and VX Vision by going to their home page at
<A HREF="http://www.vx.com/">http://www.vx.com/</A> and clicking on products.
<p>
<H3>Conclusion</H3>
<p>
As I have stated, there are options available ranging from free
GPL to high-dollar commercial products. What may prove even more
interesting are the other projects and products still in the
works. Matra Datavision has released
their Cascade libraries as open source. Keep your eyes on this
one. Check out their web page at <A HREF="http://opencascade.org/">http://opencascade.org/</A>.
<p>
I think it is time we started to recognize and support both the
GPL projects and the Commercial CAD companies that are here and
willing to support us today.
