Very first television I ever watched was _The Prisoner_ and _Doctor Who_ 
(Third Doctor; Jon Pertwee) on Rediffusion Television (sort-of the local
ITV franchise), while Clan Moen lived at 7B Bowen Road, Flat 19A,
Victoria, Hong Kong RCC in the 1960s.  
</p>

<p>
My boyhood nightmares often featured a white weather balloon.
</p>

<p>
Broadcast offerings in HK at the time tended to be either Rediffusion TV
or Cantonese opera.  (Mum and I had fun inventing dialogue for the
latter:  MST3k was invented there, first.)

<p>
Yes, we're all well aware, around here.  (The San Francisco Bay Area is
something of a hotbed of Prisoner and McGoohan fans.)
</p>

<p>
My somewhat mordant comment when I first heard the news:  "Odds are he
won't live to see tomorrow."  (Funny only if you're familiar with the
Johnny Rivers theme song used during rebroadcast of Danger Man in the
US.)
</p>

<p>
Although certainly many fine people who take better care of themselves 
don't have the privilege of living to 80 years, I started getting the
impression in McGoohan's 1970s appearances -- where he was looking very
badly aged -- that the man was drinking himself to death.  I could be
entirely wrong, but what's that old expression?  "Is life worth living?
It all depends on the liver."

<p>
Even before McGoohan's demise, I was busy reassessing what I'd
remembered, and revisiting old clips of both Danger Man (/Secret Agent) 
and The Prisoner.
</p>

<p>
There's a saying (attributed to one Peter Graham) that "The golden age
of science fiction is twelve", i.e., that what you first encounter as a
child becomes, for you, the functional prototype of that thing and
somewhat immune from critical scrutiny.  With me, the applicable age was
eight, but the same principle applies.  So, with my memory of there
having been something utterly magical about The Prisoner being, well, at
least ripe for re-examination, I've been intending to watch the whole
thing properly, again -- to see how much was groundbreaking and
wonderful, and how much was 1960s delusion and self-important but vapid
portentiousness.
</p>

<p>
A couple of things have already become apparent:  One is a reminder of
how much the British society of my youth was rather misogynistic by
modern standards (including, of course, those of modern Britain), though
I couldn't see it at the time.  I've read a number of comments by Diana
Rigg about her years doing The Avengers, that support my conclusion on
that matter:  She was treated not as a real co-star, but rather as just
another disposable actress.
</p>

<p>
Another is a matter that will be familiar to TAG posters:  The knee-jerk
suspicion of <em>computers</em> as being automatically an instrument of
oppression (e.g., Prisoner episode "The General") seems quaint and
clueless in retrospect.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, it's a real kick to see London as it was then (title scenes,
plus concluding episode), and what's different and what's not.  (I said
to Deirdre:  "Look, no London Eye!")
</p>

<p>
McGoohan turns out to have been born in Astoria, Borough of Queens, New
York City, to Irish parents.  The fact that he was of Irish origins
would be obvious to anyone who wasn't an eight-year-old expatriate
American trying to absorb all of British society wholesale -- and even I
in my uncritical state of mind might have grasped that, if I'd known his
full name:  Patrick Joseph McGoohan -- which in retrospect is about as
quintessentially Irish a name as my wife's (Deirdre Saoirse Maloy).  I
myself, at the time, thought of McGoohan as being the very prototype of
a good British actor.
</p>

<p>
His parents moved back, however, to County Leitrim, Irish Republic,
where he lived on a farm until age seven, when they all moved to
Sheffield -- young Patrick's own Golden Age city.
</p>

<p>
So, he seemed to come out of nowhere as a powerful stage actor
(especially in the lead role in Ibsen's "Brand") in the 1950s,
pole-vaulting directly into being a leading man in Lew Grade's ITV --
but was reportedly perceived as being a really good Irish actor, despite
being a young man from Sheffield.
</p>

<p>
In at least one of the Prisoner episodes he wrote, he used the pseudonym
"Paddy Fitz".  As people say in California, it seems likely he Had Issues
-- i.e., over being regarded as an outsider in British society.  My
point, of course, is that, again, Things Have Changed:  People can speak
of Freema Agyeman as a British actress with no eyebrows being raised.
(Hey, she's from Hackney and Islington, f'rheaven's sake.)

Indeed -- I believe I've heard this before, and for me it would have
to be the original "Lost In Space".  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">  That was so bad, it's almost
considered good.

<p>
Oh absolutely -- she was one of many of her generation who suffered
the same consigned fate -- she was dispensable, although she managed
to survive as appearing in James Bond after her stint in The Avengers.
 Alas, the timing of all of that was very much a male-dominated acting
period (c.f. Simon Templar in The Saint (Roger Moore -- his female
companions sufffered simialr fates.)

Heh.  But you're getting old it seems, Rick.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">  The Eye is an
unnecessary clutter, if you ask me.  When I went to London for the
first time in my childhood in the late eighties, it was nice -- dim,
dank, busy... now, it's full of... I don't know what, where buildings
are the main focus rather than industry.  Mind you, pockets of London
do still retain their worth (Soho for instance.)

unlikely it was ever recorded.   I've looked for a long time and never
found such a thing, alas.

<p>
Well, I am, indeed -- and it's an odd sort of thing, because I
consistently hear my age guesstimated as around 35 even by people who
know me well[1], which means that I've so far done well in the genetic
lottery and haven't made any horrific strategic mistakes -- which
typically seems to mean cigarettes or boozing.  And also because my
father was killed at the age of 47 -- which means that (on an emotional
level) I just never expected to survive to anything beyond that.
</p>

<p>
This matter wasn't really driven home to me until late last year, when I
finally got around to attending an alumni event, after decades of
ignoring my local club, Princeton Club of Northern California (but
paying its dues).  Deirdre and I went to San Francisco to attend the
club's annual dinner, partly because of the wonderful after-dinner
speaker, a digression I'll skip over, at this point. 
</p>

<p>
Before the dinner, I was wandering the hall, trying not to be too
obvious about peering at name-tags, searching to see if anyone from my
class (1980) happened to be present.  I figured:  Look for people who
appear to be about my age, then look at class years on their nametags.
But every time I found someone who <em>looked</em> about like my age, his/her
class year turned out to be 1997 or so.
</p>

<p>
I never did find any 1980 alumni/alumnae, but all of the nearby class
years appeared to be, well, quite aged.  Something horrific in the water
in central New Jersey that I had luckily avoided?  It was all a bit
discomfiting.  Of course, I do recall that, again, alcohol was very 
big in the prevailing Ivy League social culture, so that might be part
of the problem.
</p>



<pre>
&gt; The Eye is an unnecessary clutter, if you ask me.
</pre>

<p>
But very handy if you're a Nestene Consciousness needing a transmitter.
</p>

<p>
(I personally consider the London Eye pretty tacky, and actually
declined an offer to accompany Deirdre and my mother-in-law Cheryl on a
spin.  I went for a stroll around my old neighbourhood in Southwark,
insted.)
</p>


<p>
[1] When I was working at VA Linux Systems, my co-worker Neil Doane
asked me idly if I'd "watched GI-Joe when I was a kid"  I said:  "I
think you're off by a few decades."  (Mom and Dad were not big on "war
toys" during the Vietnam War era when I was a boy, and that was a time
when "GI-Joe" referred to small plastic soldier figurines, only -- and
broadcast cartoons came only two decades later.)  Intrigued, Neil asked
me how old I <em>was</em>, since I considered his question a bit comical.  I
told him ("I'm an Eisenhower kid, Neil"), and he said "Dude!  No way!"
</p>

<p>
My own current co-workers seemed to have had the same sort of
perception:  I saw double-takes when I mentioned having run doorbells
for Bobby Kennedy's presidential campaign.
