<h1>Away Mission: JavaOne, SemTech, and Velocity</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>

<p>
In June, there were three great conferences within three very different
spheres of the computer technology. One of these, JavaOne, is a 
long-time major conference. However, this may be the last year with
a separate JavaOne: Oracle has been sweeping the user conferences of
its new acquisitions into its own Oracle OpenWorld user conference, and
Java development is already highlighted at OpenWorld. 
</p>

<p>
The other two are up-and-coming conferences with very technical
audiences. However, each is also recommended and well regarded in its
own community.
</p>

<!-- this should probably say, in LG#161-->
<p>
For the April <em>LG</em>, I noted O'Reilly's Velocity: Web Performance
and Operations Conference, in comparison to Web 2.0 Expo. The name
says it all. It's aimed at technical people, mostly sysadmins, while Web
2.0 Expo focuses on Web-page developers and related marketing efforts.
Basically, there is no comparison, and the better sessions from Web 2.0
Expo will be presented at Velocity. Readers of <em>Linux Gazette</em>
will feel more comfortable here, and will get their technical questions
answered. 
</p>

<p>
Velocity brings together the go-to people from companies like Google,
Facebook, Microsoft, eBay, etc., who present the best current
performance and operations work for the Web.
</p>

<p>
Steve Souders, co-chair of Velocity, is back, and will present the
update to his SRO talk, Even Faster Web Sites, renamed this year to
Website Performance Analysis, on the best practices he developed while
working as a Performance Engineer at both Google and Yahoo. That
improved presentation is the kickoff talk this year. 
</p>

<p>
One talk I intend to catch this year is "Fixing Twitter: Improving
the Performance and Scalability of the World's Most Popular
Microblogging Site" by John Adams of Twitter's Operations group.
Twitter runs on a combination of Ruby, Java, and Scala - all on x86 and
Linux.
</p>

<p>
Another talk on my short list is "The Fast and the Fabulous: 9 Ways
Engineering and Design Come Together to Make Your Site Slow."  Check out
the full catalog at
<a href="http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2009/public/schedule/full/">http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2009/public/schedule/full/</a>.
</p>
 
<p>
Presentations from Velocity 2008 are here:
<a href="http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2008/public/schedule/proceedings/">http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2008/public/schedule/proceedings/</a>
</p>

<p>

(Presentation slides from June's Velocity are here:
<a href="http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2009/public/schedule/proceedings/">http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2009/public/schedule/proceedings</a>)
</p>

<p>
Velocity takes place June 22-24, 2009 at The Fairmont hotel in San Jose,
CA. The Semantic Technology conference also takes place in San Jose,
but earlier (June 14th-18th). This year's SemTech is the fifth annual
event, and is one of the major events in the Semantic Tech community.
</p>

<p>
SemTech attendees will hear about the latest semantic software
advancements, from medical records management to bio-terrorism
preparedness. The most recent SemTechs had technical people from
those secretive three-letter agencies, discussing ways intelligence
reports are processed into knowledge bases. 
</p>

<p>
More signs of Semantic Tech entering the Web sphere comes from Google's
recent semantics experiment: Google introduced a beta feature that they
call "Rich Snippets", which enhances search and presentation results by
marking up pages with special microformats.
</p>

<p>
SemTech conferences insist that attendees pre-select first- and last-day
tutorials. However, on the last day, extra books from all tutorials are
put out for attendees to take. SemTech perks also include good meals
and a nice conference bag. Check out the conference Web site:
<a href="http://www.semantic-conference.com/">http://www.semantic-conference.com/</a>
</p>


<p>
JavaOne has been <em>the</em> annual Java event on the planet since its
inception back in 1994. Although attendance has been slipping gradually
since the dot-com bust, it still features many definitive talks on Java
technology and emerging industry standards. However, conferences like
Javapolis have emerged as strong regional conferences and viable
alternatives.
</p>

<p>
The main drawing card is that founders and gurus like James Gosling are
in attendance and hold court in keynote talks and panels. then there
are those great t-shirts with original artwork from Gosling, launched
out into the sea of Javaheads with sling shots and home-made mortars. 
</p>

<p>
One 2008 presentation that joined Java and Semantic Tech was "Developing
Semantic Web Applications on the Java Platform" (PAN-5532). This was a
panel moderated by Henry Story, a Semantic Web evangelist, and had as
panelists Lew Tucker, of Radar Networks and Sales Force; Jens Aasmen,
of Franz, Inc.; Brian Sletien, of Siderian; and Dean Allemang from Top
Quadrant. 
</p>

<p>
Each panelist did a short presentation, some with demos. The demo from
Lew Tucker showed off Twine, then a new Web site which translates
between Java objects and RDF tuples. He used this to list friends of Tim
Berners-Lee. Jens Aasmen showed off 
<a href="http://www.franz.com/agraph/">http://www.franz.com/agraph/</a>
with a demo that found meetings attended in a geographic area by his
friends or friends of friends (FoF). He also demoed a "circle of love"
for people who knew each other "well" and were connected via social
networking sites.
</p>

<p>
JavaOne is enhanced by the preceeding CommunityOne day, with Sun opening
its arms to the disparate communities it has been building around Java,
Solaris, and MySQL. Last year, CommunityOne registrants got to attend
a session at JaveOne 2008 for free.  
</p>

<p>
This year, CommunityOne will run for 3 days, overlapping JavaOne. Only
the first day is free, but this free pass will also get attendees into
the JavaOne "expo" and also into keynote sessions. In 2008, most
sessions were technical and most had presentations from members of the
developer community each track targeted. There was, however, a strange
Linux track, where panels from the major Linux distros discussed some
lessons they've learned, and how those may be applied to OpenSolaris.
This track ran concurrently with the OpenSolaris technical track, which
ended in a modest installfest for for 40-50 people (and included at
least one Macintosh).
</p>

<p>
Sun provided box lunches as well as T-shirts and totes to CommunityOne
attendees last year. The lines were a bit long, especially for the
T-shirts, but it was all free. (Sorry to report, there was no box
lunch in 2009, but there were more sessions.) This is certainly one of
the better free deals in the computer industry, and is worth the effort
to register, which, by the way, will also get you earlier access to the
JavaOne archives and allow you to catch the streaming keynotes.  An
all-access pass to both JavaOne and CommunityOne and the earlier classes
at Java University will set you back $3500.
