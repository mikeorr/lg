<p><strong>From Grant Murphy  on Tue, 17 Nov 1998  
</strong></p>
<!-- begin 18 -->
<P><STRONG>
I'm a numerical C programmer and have inherited the system admin
job in a 'small' geophysical exploration company.  We have a fine
collection of lovingly maintained and oftem overhauled equipment
ranging from SunOs4 machines to an NT box, handbuilt aquisition
systems mounted in aircraft, dual real time differential GPS
systems etc. etc.  I know <EM>A LOT</EM> about a number of particular
things in maths, geophysics, unix, world coord systems etc,
but I am a babe in the woods about other things ... networking in
particular.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The problem at hand ( &amp; one that I have searched for FAQ's on &amp;
trolled 
<a href="news:comp.os.linux.networking">comp.os.linux.networking</a>
for the REAL answer to ) is this:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
We have two networks in our office, one is made up entirely of
windows 95 machines and office printers etc.  The other was made
up entirely of SunOS4 and Solaris machines with an A0 HP map
plotter and a versatec plotter ( about the size and weight of a
compacted VW bug ).  The two networks intersect in a single linux
box running a 1997 version of caldera linux, with two network
cards, a dial out modem card for internet access, no keyboard,
no moniter ( well, who needs them )
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The SunOS network now contains two windows machines used for
processing data. One is Win95, the other WinNT workstation.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I **can't** get the two windows machines to see the shared drives
and printers of the win95 machines on the other side of the linux
box.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
1) I have all win machines using TCP/IP with NetBeui disabled
(lots of people seemed to recomend this)
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

That's because NetBIOS/NetBEUI (the "native"
Windows transport level networking protocols) aren't
routable --- they only work within a LAN).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
2) I have samba on the linux box and can mount unix drives and see
them on the network neighbourhood of the win95 box &amp; winNT box on
the unix network.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
What version of Samba is it?  Have all the appropriate
patches and service packs been applied to the Win '95 and
NT boxes?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
That problem probably related to the share "browse
mastering" protocols used by SMB.  There have been many
problems with these browsing protocols.  I don't know the
details, but I've heard that the Samba team has done
quite a bit of work to fix those problems.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

3) The network was split into two rings before I arrived under the
rationale that the traffic of the two networks wouldn't interfere
(some of the geophysical data traffic is pretty big - half
gigabyte files etc)
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
Isolating LAN segments is a classic and effective way
to optimize bandwidth utilization.  I shudder t think
of the amount of money that's been unecessarily and poorly
spent on etherswitches for networks that would have
benefitted far more from simple segmentation and
(in some cases) some server file tree replication.

4) The linux box has two cards:
eth0 with IP address 192.9.200.10 and broadcasting 192.9.200.*
       - all unix boxes, win machines attached through that card
         have IP addresses 192.9.200.* eth1 with IP address 192.168.1.10
        and broadcasting 192.168.1.* - all office machines have
        adresses 192.168.1.*
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
5) I can ftp from the office network to the unix boxes alright .
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
So, TCP routing works between the two.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
I'm under a reasonable amount of pressure to make the network look
easy, people want to access the HP A0 plotter from the office
computers just like they access the office laser printer - Now
that the processing guys have an NT box with word processing
etc. they want to access the office laser printer.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
If the primary resource that is to be shared is
the printer --- I'd connect the printer to the Linux
box, and install Samba.  Let it be the print server as
well as the router between the two segments.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Likewise for the plotter (if that can be driven by
your Linux system.  I'm not familiar with the device
or its interfaces).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
Owing to industry recession, the chances of getting an expert
network guy in to solve it seem to be slim to bugger all.  This is
chewing up time that is better spent working on algorithms to do
noise reduction of 256 dimensioned radiometric data, and
improving field QC software.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
If you have any answers to this conundrum they would be gratefully
received &amp; I am happy to return the favour with answer's to any
posers that you might have about numeric/scientific/geophysical/C
language problems.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
Try installing the latest version of Samba on the
Linux box (try the 2.0. beta that was announced last
week).  Hopefully it will be able to propagate those
pesky browse/share broadcasts from each segment
to the other.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

(I wrote an ANSI C compiler for an early version of MINUX that
was ported to both a transputer array and an ARM6 chipset machine
- none of that involved networking though)
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
Is there any Linux support for transputers?  Are there
modern transputers (PCI, even), or have modern processors
obviated their utility?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

Yours sincerely (&amp; perplexed)
