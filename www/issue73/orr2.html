<P> A letter linked on Slashdot got me thinking.  It was written by Christoph
Pfisterer when he resigned from the Fink project.  
(<A HREF="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">Fink</A> is an attempt to "bring
the full world of Unix Open Source software to Darwin and Mac OS X.")  But
it's not Fink itself I want to focus on, but the fact that it's free software.
A developer is resigning from a free-software project because of the
unappreciative demands of its users.
He writes, "I'm tired of dealing with people who don't
appreciate what they get for free.  I'm tired of dealing with people who
think they have a commercial-grade, 24/7, one hour turn-around time
support contract with Fink....  I'm tired of people who complain loudly
when something doesn't work, but fall silent when asked to help in
fixing it....  I'm tired of putting my professional future at risk by
neglecting my studies."

<P> Here's the original letter:
<A HREF="http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/11114/125/7038861/">
http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/11114/125/7038861/</A>

<P> This is one of the dangers every free-software developer faces.  Have you
hugged your favorite free-software developer today?  OK, I'm joking.  But if
there's a free program you use a lot and really depend on, especially one that
doesn't get a lot of recognition or is maintained by one volunteer, tell them
how much you appreciate it.  Consider giving a financial or in-kind donation to
them or to their favorite free-software organization or charity.  Or send a
donation to the <A HREF="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier
Foundation</A> in their name.  Love makes the world go round, and
recognition (and taking care of the developers' material needs) helps the
free-software world go round.

<P> Another way to show your appreciation is to become a contributing user.
You can code, write documentation, submit bug reports, or answer newbie questions.
Many projects have a TODO list showing work they'd like to do when they have time.
Are any of those goals things you can do?  You may find that one of those TODO
items would actually benefit you too.

<P> As the adage goes, "If you can't code, write documentation."  Are there parts
of the documentation you feel are lacking?  Is there any documentation at all?
What advice did you wish you had when you first installed the program?  Put it
in a HOWTO.  LG has been running several articles about documentation in the
past couple issues, and January and February will bring even more.

<P> Some projects have a closed development team, meaning they don't accept code
from outside the core team.  But even these sites are happy to receive bug reports
from users, especially if the reports include a proposed fix or at least some
research into what might be causing the problem and how to solve it.  OK, maybe
"happy" isn't the right word, because it means more work for them.  But this 
additional work leads to a more bulletproof product.

<P> The more users actively contribute on a project's bugtracker and mailing lists,
the more the core developers will feel that their effort is worthwhile, and that
translates into better software.

<P> Also, participating in the development of your favorite software helps give you
a sense of ownership in it.  Which gives you something to brag about to your friends.
