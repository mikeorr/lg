<h1>Taming Technology: The Case of the Vanishing Problem</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/grebler.html">Henry Grebler</a></b></p>

<h3>Author's Note</h3>

<em>
<p>
I am trying to compile a body of work on an overall theme that I call
Taming Technology. (I have wrestled with several different names, but
that is my title du jour.) The theme deals with troubleshooting,
problem solving, problem avoidance, and analysis of technology failures.
</p>

<p>
Case studies are an important part of this ambitious project.
"Installing Fedora Core 10" is an example. It deals with my attempts
to perform a network kickstart install of Fedora Core 10.
</p>

<p>
Part 1, Lessons from Mistakes, outlines my plans, briefly compares CD
installation with network installation, and proceeds to early success and
unexpected debacle.
</p>

<p>
In Part 2, Bootable Linux, I discuss some of the uses of the Knoppix Live
Linux CD, before explaining how I used Knoppix to gather information
needed for a network installation. I also use Knoppix to diagnose the
problems encountered in Part 1. This leads to the discovery that I
have created even more problems. Finally, I present an excellent
solution to the major problem of Part 1.
</p>

<p>
In Part 3 and 4, I finally get back on-track, and present detailed
instructions for installing Fedora Core 10 over a network, using PXE
boot, kickstart, and NFS. Part 3 details PXE boot including
troubleshooting; Part 4 takes us the rest of the way.
</p>

<p>
I think it's important for people to realise that they are not alone
when they make mistakes, that even so-called experts are fallible.
</p>

<p>
Isaac Asimov wrote a series of robot stories. (I don't imagine for one
moment that I'm Isaac Asimov.) To me, the most captivating facet of
these stories was the unanticipated consequences of interactions
between the Three Laws of Robotics. I like to think that I write about the
unanticipated consequences of our fallible minds: we want X, we think
we ask for X, but find we've got Y. Why?
</p>

<p class="editorial">
[ Highly amusing coincidence: a possible answer to Henry's question is
contained in the "<a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=542341">XY
Problem</a>" - except for the terms X and Y being reversed. -- Ben ]
</p>

<p>
In my real life, I embark on a project, something goes wrong, there is
often the discovery that the problems multiply. After several detours,
I finally get a happy ending.<br>

<hr>

<p>
The Cowboy materialised at the side of my desk. I wondered uneasily
how long he had been standing there.
</p>

<p>
"When you've got some time," he began, "can I get you to look at a
problem?"
</p>

<p>
"Tell me about it," I replied.
</p>

<p>
He looked around, and pulled up a chair. This was going to be
interesting. His opening gambit is usually, "Quick question," almost
invariably followed by a very long and complicated discussion that
gives the lie both to the idea that the question will be short and the
implication that it won't take long to answer.
</p>

<p>
To me, a quick question is something like, "Is today Monday?" The
Cowboy's "quick" questions are about the equivalent of, "What's the
meaning of life?" or "Explain the causes of terrorism."
</p>

<p>
If he had decided to sit down, how momentous was this problem?
</p>

<p>
By way of preamble, he conceded that The Russian had been trying to
install Oracle on the machine in question. He wasn't sure if there was
a connection, but now The Russian couldn't run VNC. It turned out that,
when he tried to run a vncserver, he got a message like:
</p>

<pre>
	no free display number on suseq
</pre>

<p>
Sure enough, when I tried to run a vncserver on suseq I got the
same message. I used ps to tell me how many vnc sessions were actually
running on this machine (ps auxw | grep vnc); a small number (3 or 4).
</p>

<p>
When I tried picking a relatively high display number, I was told it
was in use:
</p>

<pre>
	vncserver :13
	A VNC server is already running as :13
</pre>

<p>
Similarly for a really really high number:
</p>

<pre>
	vncserver :90013
	A VNC server is already running as :90013
</pre>

<p>
This perhaps was enough information to diagnose the problem (it is, in
hindsight), but seemed too startling to be believable.
</p>

<p>
To get a better understanding of why vncserver was behaving so
strangely, I decided to trace it<a id="grebler.html_1_back"></a><a
href="#grebler.html_1">[1]</a>. I used a bash function called 'truss'<a
id="grebler.html_2_back"></a><a href="#grebler.html_2">[2]</a>, so the
session looked a bit like this:
</p>

<pre>
	truss vncserver

	New 'X' desktop is suseq:6

	Starting applications specified in /home/henryg/.vnc/xstartup
	Log file is /home/henryg/.vnc/suseq:6.log
</pre>

<p>
This was even more unbelievable - if I traced vncserver, it seemed to
work! (It doesn't really matter whether it actually worked, or just
seemed to work; tracing the application changed its behaviour.) This
may be a workaround, but it explained nothing and raised even more
question than were on the table going in.
</p>

<p>
At this point, I suggested to The Cowboy that it did not look like the
problem would be solved any time soon, and he might as well leave it
with me. I also thought a few minutes away from my desk wouldn't hurt.
</p>

<p>
After making myself a coffee, I went over to Jeremy and told him about
the strange behaviour with trace. I wasn't really looking for help;
just wanting to share what a weird day I was having.
</p>

<p>
I went back to my desk to do something that would succeed. There are
times during the task of problem-solving when you find yourself
picking losers. Whatever you try backfires. Several losses in a row
tend to send your radar out of kilter. At such times, it's a good idea
to get back onto solid ground, to do anything that is guaranteed to
succeed. Then, with batteries recharged after a couple of wins, your
frame of mind for tackling the problem is immensely improved.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later, Jeremy came to see me. He had an idea. At first, I
could not make any sense of it. When I understood, I thought it was
brilliant - and certainly worth a try.
</p>

<p>
He suggested that I trace the bash command-line process from which I
was invoking vncserver.
</p>

<p>
So, in the xterm window where I had tried to run vncserver, I did
</p>

<pre>
	echo $$
	5629
</pre>

<p>
The number is the process id (pid) of the bash process.
</p>

<p>
In another xterm window, I started a trace:
</p>

<pre>
	truss -p 5629
</pre>

<p>
Now, back in the first window, I invoked vncserver again:
</p>

<pre>
	vncserver
	no free display number on suseq
</pre>

<p>
So, Jeremy's idea had worked! (Trussing bash rather than vncserver had
allowed me to capture a trace of vncserver failing.)
</p>

<p>
I killed the truss and examined the output. What it showed was that
the vncserver process had tried many sockets and failed with "Address
already in use", e.g.:
</p>

<pre>
	bind(3, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(6099),
	sin_addr=inet_addr("0.0.0.0")}, 16) = -1 EADDRINUSE (Address
	already in use)
</pre>

<p>
The example shows an attempt to bind to port 6099. This was near the bottom
of the truss output. Looking backwards, I saw that it had tried ports 6098,
6097, ... prior to port 6099. Clearly vncserver had cycled through a fairly
large number of ports, and had failed on all of them.
</p>

<p>
Why were all these ports busy? I tried to see which ports were in use:
</p>

<pre>
	netstat -na
</pre>

<p>
Big mistake! (I should have known.) I was flooded with output. How
much output? Good question:
</p>

<pre>
	netstat -na | wc
</pre>

<p>
After a very long time (10 or 15 seconds - enough time to issue the
same command on another machine), it came back with not much less than
50000! That's astronomical! On the other machine with the problem,
there were more than 40000 responses - still huge. A typical machine
runs about 500 sockets.
</p>

<p>
After that, the rest was easy. The suspicion was that Oracle was
hogging all the ports. That's probably not how it's meant to behave,
but I don't have a lot of experience with Oracle.
</p>

<p>
I suggested to The Russian that he try to shut down Oracle and see if
that brought the number of sockets in use down to a reasonable number;
If not, he should reboot.
</p>

<p>
In either case, he should then start a trivial monitor in an xterm:
</p>

<pre class="code">
	while true
	do
		netstat -na | wc
		sleep 1
	done
</pre>

<p>
and then do whatever he was doing to get Oracle going. As soon as the
answer from the monitor rose sharply, he would know that whatever he
had been doing at that time was probably responsible. If he was doing
something wrong, he might then have an indication where to look. If
not, he had something to report to the Oracle people.
</p>


<h3>Lessons</h3>

<p>
1. Not all exercises in problem-solving result in a solution with all
the loose ends tidied up. In this case, all that had been achieved is
that a path forward had been found. It might lead to a solution, it
might not. If not, they'll be back.
</p>

<p>
2. Never underestimate the power of involving someone else. In this
case, the someone else came back and provided me with a path forward.
</p>

<p>
Often, in other cases (and I've seen this dozens of times, both as the
presenter and as the listener), the person presenting the problem
discovers the solution during the process of explaining the problem to
the listener. I have been thanked profusely for helping to solve a
problem I did not understand. It is, however, crucial that the listener
give the impression of understanding the presenter. For some reason,
explaining the problem to the cat is just not as effective.
</p>


<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>
<a id="grebler.html_1"></a><a href="#grebler.html_1_back">[1]</a> "Tracing"
is an activity for investigating what a process (program) is doing. Think
of it as a stethoscope for computer doctors. The Linux command is strace(1)
- "trace system calls and signals." 
</p>

<p>
<a id="grebler.html_2"></a><a href="#grebler.html_2_back">[2]</a> After
years of working in mixed environments, I now tend to operate in my own
environment. In a classic metaphor for "ontogeny mimics phylogeny", my
abbreviations and functions contain markers for the various operating
systems I've worked with: "treecopy" from my Prime days in the early '80s,
"dsd" from VMS back in the mid '80s, "truss" from Solaris in 1998, etc.
</p>

<p>
In this case, I used my bash function, "truss", which has all the options I
usually want adjusted depending on the platform on which the command is
running. Under Solaris, my function "truss" will invoke the Sun command
"truss". Since this is a SUSE Linux machine, it will invoke the Linux
command "strace" (with different options). It's about concentrating on 
<em>what</em> I want do rather than <em>how</em> to do it.

<p>
Henry was born in Germany in 1946, migrating to Australia in 1950. In
 his childhood, he taught himself to take apart the family radio and put
 it back together again - with very few parts left over.
</p>

<p>
After ignominiously flunking out of Medicine (best result: a sup in
 Biochemistry - which he flunked), he switched to Computation, the name
 given to the nascent field which would become Computer Science. His
 early computer experience includes relics such as punch cards, paper
 tape and mag tape.
</p>

<p>
He has spent his days working with computers, mostly for computer
 manufacturers or software developers. It is his darkest secret that he
 has been paid to do the sorts of things he would have paid money to be
 allowed to do. Just don't tell any of his employers.
</p>

<p>
He has used Linux as his personal home desktop since the family got its
 first PC in 1996. Back then, when the family shared the one PC, it was a
 dual-boot Windows/Slackware setup. Now that each member has his/her own
 computer, Henry somehow survives in a purely Linux world.
</p>

<p>
He lives in a suburb of Melbourne, Australia.
