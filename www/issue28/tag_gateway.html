<p><strong>From Ron Smith on Sat, 11 Apr 1998 on a newsgroup</strong></p>

<p><strong>
I looked thriugh the FAQ and didn't find any answers to this question.
I hope this is the right forum.</strong></p>

<p><strong>
I am a fairly experienced UNIX developer but I usually leave the
difficult administrative stuff the the SysAdmins.  I have been running a
small LAN for my business using Slakware LINUX (currently version 3.2)
for some time now.  What I really want to do is use the LINUX server as
a gateway to the internet for the rest of my LAN.  I can connect via PPP
to my ISP from the LINUX box with no problems but what I haven't found
any good books or documentation on is:

How do I setup the LINUX server to bridge between my local LAN and the
internet?</strong></p>

	You probably want to read up on IP Masquerading.
	In it's simplest form you use the ipfw (kernel 
	packet filtering features) and configure them with
	a command like:

<blockquote><code>
		ipfwadm -F -a accept -m -S 192.168.1.0/24 -D any
</code></blockquote>

	... which says:  

<blockquote>
		add a rule to accept packets for forwarding from
		the <tt>192.168.1.*</tt> range of addresses, and masquerade
		them to wherever they are going.
</blockquote>

	This assumes you have all your internal systems already 
        configured with 
        <a href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/htbin/rfc/rfc1918.html">RFC 
                1918</a> IP addresses like <tt>192.168.1.*</tt>
	or <tt>172.16.*.*</tt> or <tt>10.*.*.*</tt>, and that you have 
	them all configured to use the Linux system as their default router.
	It also assumes that you are running a reasonably recent 
	kernel with the ipfw options enabled.

<br><br>
	There's quite a bit more to it than that --- but that is the core 
	command that makes it work.  Note that some protocols --- ftp in 
	particular --- don't work reliably through masquerading.  It is often 
	better to get a copy of the 
	<a href="http://www.tis.com/prodserv/fwtk/readme.html">TIS FWTK</a> 
	or <a href="http://www.socks.nec.com/whatissocks.html">SOCKS</a> 
	(application layer proxies) to support these 
	(<a href="#tag_gw_footnote">*</a>).

<br><br>
	Suggestions:  run a caching nameserver and a good caching 
	web proxy (like 
	<a href="http://squid.nlanr.net/Squid/"><tt>squid</tt></a>) 
	on the router (the Linux box).
	Make a "best effort" to "harden" the router's configuration
	and contract to have a thorough security  audit performed
	on it.  If at all possible isolate the gateway on the
	"outside" of an interior perimeter router (which can be
	another Linux box running <em>no</em> services, not even 
	<tt>inetd</tt>).

<br><br>
	Adding the caching for DNS and other protocols can 
	greatly reduce the traffic over the network link and
	only costs a tiny investment in configuration time, RAM,
	and disk space.  Any traffic that's handled by the cache is
	a bit less contention for everyone else using the link and
	everyone between you and the servers that you're accessing
	(i.e. the whole 'net benefits).

	Feh!  I'll try to remember to spool off a copy via e-mail.
	Find a good consultant in your area.  A good one will
	show you how to do all of this and will be able to explain
	quite a bit more because he or she will ask quite a bit
	more about your requirements.  I've glossed over quite a bit
	here -- in particular regarding the security issues.

<ul><li><a name="tag_gw_footnote">Shortly</a> after writing this, but prior
	to "going to press" I hunted around for an alternative to FWTK
	and found <a href="http://wall.etl.go.jp/ysato/DeleGate/">DeleGate</a>,
	which can be used as a SOCKS proxy (semi-transparent but requiring
	client software support) and as a user-driven proxy.  Thus it can be
	used in place if SOCKS and FWTK and seems to be simpler to set up
	than either.  It hasn't been around as long, or used as widely, so
	we can't be as confident in its security and feature set.  But,
	it's well worth a look and has a more BSDish license.
