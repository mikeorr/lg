<p>
Greetings:
</p>

<p>
Do any of you use wicd? I wish to know how to automatically
share the wireless on boot. At the moment, the connection
to the wired setup is automatically done (by dhcpcd/wicd combination).
But the wireless internet sharing has to be set manually.
</p>

<p>
Thanks in advance.

What are you asking?  I use Wicd, it starts at boot; I have an
Internet connection.

Well, NAT and such aren't normally handled by network connection
managers - that's not their job (although you certainly could set up a
script to be run when you connect.) If you want to set up sharing with,
e.g., your wlan0 as the gateway, you need to set up the IP forwarding at
your gateway and appropriate routing at your clients. If you then
auto-run these scripts at start time, you'll be all set.
</p>

<p>
As an example, you could do something like this for the gateway NAT
script:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
#!/bin/bash
# Created by Ben Okopnik on Sat Aug  8 09:23:24 CDT 2009
 
# IP range for which to forward packets
ip=192.168.0.0/16
 
# Enable forwarding in the kernel
echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
 
# Flush iptables, just in case of weirdness
iptables -F
 
# Masquerade any outgoing packets
iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE -s $ip
 
# Forward any packets <em>FOR</em> host (except SpamAssassin)
iptables -I FORWARD -s $ip --protocol tcp --sport ! 783 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I FORWARD -s $ip --protocol udp --sport ! 783 -j ACCEPT
 
# Forward any packets <em>FROM</em> host (except Spamassassin)
iptables -I FORWARD -d $ip --protocol tcp --dport ! 783 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I FORWARD -d $ip --protocol udp --dport ! 783 -j ACCEPT
 
# Display the FORWARD chain as confirmation
iptables -nL FORWARD
</pre>

<p>
Then, on your clients, just make sure that their IPs are in the right
range and give them the right routing info. Assuming that your gateway
is at 192.168.0.100, that would look like this:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
sudo route add default gw 192.168.0.100
</pre>

<p>
At that point, you should be up and running.
</p>

<p>
All the iptables issues have been cleared - thanks
to ufw and the wonderful Arch Wikis. I am pondering
using the scripts option to do preconnection.
</p>

<p>
The issue is while the dsl-pc connection is automagically 
configged, I have to manually set the NAT-ed internal wireless
to 192.168.0.1. Still haven't figured out how to script that
part.

I know the question is about wicd, but the latest versions of Network
Manager allow wireless sharing and it is very easy to set it up. It
uses dnsmasq, if you google for it you will find tutorials on how to
do it.

Erm, silly thing of me to say - don't know what I was thinking. The
<strong>interface</strong> through which you connect your NAT gateway to the world is,
of course, completely irrelevant; its own routing table handles that,
and that's generally not something you need to worry about.

Here is my short story:
</p>

<p>
- Had Fedora 11 x86-64 running but could not figure how to strip it to
  known components.
</p>

<p>
- Changed to Arch64, but some confusion with Avahi - which I was late to
  discover - caused to reinstall to Arch i686.
</p>

<p>
Trying to keep the software as thin as I could. So NetworkManager and
it's dependencies are out of the question.
</p>

<p>
Maybe the reason I haven't solved this yet is because of my bad habit of
trying to do 5 things simultaeneously. At the moment testing 0install,
comparing qemu and VB and trying to migrate my 60GB of data from an EXT3
partition to LVM2 on a total drive space of 80GB. Maybe fsarchiver will
do the trick.
</p>

<p>
Will keep the list posted when I make leeway with the networking.

UFW's documentation made that quite easy to accomplish
(<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFW'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFW</a>)
Though there were a few days when I failed to look at the reflection of
what goes in must come out [What goes out must come in]. Forgot to allow
the answers to the system that sent the request.

Besides avoiding dependencies, NM is a stubborn fellow. It loves to
interfere with user-specified settings. IPv6 isn't yet supported either,
though I don't presently use it. And when NM is disabled it takes the
settings with it deeming the old networks daemon useless.
</p>

<p>
By the way, it seems ipv6 Internet very different from the present
protocol. All the pages I visit have dancing logos (well
ipv6.google.com).

Thnanks for this. This is like a summary of all I have read. Was reading
too late at night/early in the morning, so opted for UFW instead.
</p>

<p>
Below is what I gather from this script you created. (I haven't tested it
yet):
</p>


<p>
<pre class='code'>
#!/bin/bash
##Originated from Ben Okopnik
##
##The UFW option
##Below should be entered in the /etc/ufw/before.rules 
##Start here (remove comments)
#*nat
#:POSTROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]
 
# Forward traffic from eth1 through eth0.
#-A POSTROUTING -s &lt;ip range&gt; -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
 
# don't delete the 'COMMIT' line or these nat table rules won't be
## processed
#COMMIT
##End here
##Set DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY="ACCEPT" in /etc/defaults/ufw
##UFW can use sysctl.conf options. Enable forwarding from there also.
##My attempt at using ufw as a frontend
#Forward to this range (reduced the subnet size)
ip=192.168.0.0/24
 
#Flush tables
ufw disable
 
#Forwarding rules
ufw allow from $ip
ufw allow to $ip
ufw deny from $ip port 783
ufw deny to $ip port 783
 
#Activate tables, logging and firewall
ufw logging on
ufw enable
 
#Display all chains
ufw show raw
exit
</pre>

<p>
That should do it.

<p>
Also to clear up a misunderstanding. There is no problem with NAT. The
problem is automating iwconfig settings to the Zydas wireless adapter,
then automating addressing with wicd.
</p>

<p>
Here is the process that goes on:
boot -&gt; wicd uses dhcpcd -&gt; ufw sets up iptables -&gt; net is ready!
</p>

<p>
The next step needs automation:
(NAT is already functioning; just waiting for the packets)
wicd-client -&gt; create ad-hoc network with $ip on chan 11 and internet
sharing enabled -&gt; done
</p>

<p>
I am going to try to flowchart this.  I am so not used to programming, I
stray away from the recipe when I cook <img src="../gx/frown.png" alt=":-(">.
