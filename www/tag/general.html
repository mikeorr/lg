<a name="formats_html"></a>
<h2>1. Where can I find the HTML version of the <em>Gazette</em>?</h2>

<ul>
        <li> The main Web site - <a href="http://linuxgazette.net">linuxgazette.net</a>.
        <li> <a href="../mirrors.html">Mirror sites in many countries</a>, some translated into <a href="#languages">other languages</a>.
        <li> Indirect mirrors, including the <a href="http://www.tldp.org/mirrors.html">Linux Documentation Project</a> mirror sites.
        <li> In the <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian/GNU Linux</a> distribution, as installable *.deb packages.
	<li> On <a href="http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/">Linux Format's</a> monthly cover DVD, as part of their LDP snapshot.
</ul>

</div>

<div class="content questionbox">

<a name="formats_yes"></a>
<h2>2. Which other formats is the <em>Gazette</em> available in?</h2>

<ul>
        <li> <strong>As a single HTML file.</strong>  Every issue includes a
TWDT (The Whole Damn Thing) file containing a copy of all the articles in one
file.  This is primarily intended for printing, but you may also find it useful
if you have a slow modem. Look for the "TWDT" link near the bottom of the issue's
Table of Contents page.
<p>
        <li> <strong><strike>As a single text file.</strike></strong> We
used to maintain one, but generating one from HTML is trivial - simply
retrieve the TWDT via <a href="http://lynx.browser.org/">Lynx</a> (there's
a Wind0ws version as well as the ones for normal OSes :), 
<a href="http://artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~mikulas/links/">links</a>, 
<a href="http://w3m.sourceforge.net/">w3m</a>, or any other text-mode browser.
<p>
        <li> <strong>As a single PDB file.</strong>  For those who like to
read their LG on a handheld device (e.g., a Palm.) Linked from the index
page of every issue. 
<p>

<a name="ftp"></a>
	<li> <strong>Via FTP.</strong>  Each issue is
available as a *.tar.gz file, containing both the ordinary HTML files
and the TWDT files. See <a
href="http://linuxgazette.net/ftpfiles/README">http://linuxgazette.net/ftpfiles/README</a>
for details. Other FTP sites are listed on our <a href="../mirrors.html">mirrors</a> page.

</ul>

<p> To unpack *.tar.gz files on Unix, do either of these:

<pre>
# If your version of 'tar' doesn't support '-z' (gzip compression)
gzip -dc filename.tar.gz|tar xvf -

# If you use a modern version, e.g. GNU 'tar'
tar xvzf filename.tar.gz
</pre>

There are also graphical decompressor front ends for Linux/Unix such as 
<a href="http://lintar.sourceforge.net/">LinTar</a> and 
<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/mc/">Midnight Commander</a>.
 
<p> Windows users can use a program like
<a href="http://www.winzip.com/">Winzip</a> or
<a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a>. Macintosh users need
<a href="http://www.stuffit.com/download_info.html">Stuffit Expander</a> or
<a href="http://www.polhode.com/info-mac.html">Mac-gzip + suntar</a>.
These programs <em>do</em> recognize *.tar.gz files even though their
native formats are different. Winzip and Stuffit Expander are no-cost but
proprietary ("closed-source"), and Stuffit requires registration, whereas
7-Zip and Mac-gzip/suntar are true open-source.  If anybody knows of other 
open-source alternatives, let us know and we'll be happy to list them.
</div>

<div class="content questionbox">

<a name="email_no"></a>
<h2>3. Can I get the <em>Gazette</em> via email?</h2>

<p> The <em>Gazette</em> is too big to send via e-mail.
Issue #44 is 754 kB; one of the larger issues, #34, was 2.7 MB.  Even the text-only
version of #44 is 146 kB compressed, 413 kB uncompressed. If anybody wishes
to distribute the text version via e-mail, be our guest, but we simply can't
support the bandwidth.  
<a name="lg-announce"></a>There is an announcement mailing list where
issues are announced as soon as they're released: go to <a
href="http://lists.linuxgazette.net/mailman/listinfo/lg-announce">http://lists.linuxgazette.net/mailman/listinfo/lg-announce</a>
to subscribe.  Or read the announcement on <a
href="news:comp.os.linux.announce">comp.os.linux.announce</a>.

<blockquote>
	<strong>Note:</strong> Subscribing with "nospam" in your From:
	address or "dot" instead of "." is <strong><em>not</em></strong> going to
	get you subscribed. It just makes more work for the list administrator, who
	must deal with the resulting bounce messages and then unsubscribing the
	address.
</blockquote>

<p> If e-mail really is your only option, some organizations operate
<a href="../issue59/lg_mail59.html#ftp_email">FTP-via-mail servers</a> you
can use.


<p> <strong>How about on paper?</strong> I know of no companies offering
printed copies of the <em>Gazette</em>. For a free, volunteer-run 'zine
with a readership as large as ours, the economics simply do not work in
that direction.
</div>

<div class="content questionbox">
<a name="subscribe"></a>
<h2>4. How can I subscribe to the <em>Gazette</em>?</h2>

<p> You can't. It's not a subscription magazine. What you see on the Web is
what you get. There is an <a href="#lg-announce">e-mail announcement
service</a> if you wish to receive an announcement when each issue is
posted.
</div>

<div class="content questionbox">
<a name="languages"></a>
<h2>5. Is there a version of the <em>Linux Gazette</em> in my language?</h2>

<p> Maybe. :) See the <a href="../mirrors.html">mirrors page</a>; the
"Translations" section is right near the top. The last time this section
was updated, there was a German, Indonesian, Italian, Korean, Polish,
Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish version in existence; there may be more by
the time you read this.
</div>

<div class="content questionbox">

<a name="old"></a>
<h2>6. Why is the most recent issue several months old?</h2>

<p> You're probably looking at an unmaintained mirror.  Check the 
<a href="http://linuxgazette.net">home site</a> to see what the current issue
is, then go to the <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/mirrors.html">mirrors 
page on the home site</a> to find a more up-to-date mirror.

<p> If a listed mirror is seriously out of date, please let us know (drop
an email to <img src="../gx/lgmail/mirrors.png">.)

</div>

<div class="content questionbox">
<a name="search"></a>
<h2>7. How can I find all the articles about a certain subject?</h2>

<ul>
<li> Use the <em>Linux Gazette</em>
<a href="http://linuxgazette.net/search.html">search engine</a>.
<p>

<li> Use the <a href="../lg_index.html">Index of Articles</a>.  A link to it is 
on the Front Page, at the bottom of the issues links,
called "Index of All Issues".  All the Tables of Contents are concatenated
here onto one page.  Use your browser's "Find in Page" dialog to find
keywords in the title or author's names.

<p>
<li> There is a separate <a href="../faq/kb.html">Answer Gang Index</a>,
listing many of the questions that have been answered by the Answer Gang. However, 
they are not sorted by subject at this time, so you will also want to use
the "Find in Page" dialog to search this listing for keywords. (It's not up to
date either: the updating process is fairly arbitrary and highly sporadic,
pending our finding a volunteer to do it on a regular basis.)
</ul>

</div>

<div class="content questionbox">
<a name="copying"></a>
<h2>8. May I copy and distribute the <em>Gazette</em> or portions thereof?</h2>

<p> Certainly. <em>Linux Gazette</em> is freely redistributable under the
<a href="http://linuxgazette.net/copying.html">Open Publication License
(OPL)</a>. You may copy it, give it away, sell it, translate it into
another language, whatever you wish.  Just keep the copyright notices
attached to the articles, since each article is copyrighted by its author.
We also request that you provide a link back to <a
href="http://linuxgazette.net">linuxgazette.net</a>.  <p> If your copy is
publicly available and regularly maintained, we would like to list it on
our <a href="../mirrors.html">mirrors page</a>, especially if it's a
foreign language translation. Use this <a
href="../ftpfiles/readme.MIRRORS">submission form</a> to tell us about your
site. This is also the most effective way to help <em>Gazette</em> readers
find you.

</div>

<div class="content questionbox">

<a name="generic"></a>
<h2> 9. Is there a generic URL to the current issue?</h2>

<a href="http://linuxgazette.net/current/">
http://linuxgazette.net/current/</a> is now a symbolic link to the current
issue. <strong>Please do not bookmark any article through it.</strong>  The
bookmark will obviously go dead when the next issue is published, or could end
up pointing at the wrong article. Instead, change the "current" to the real
issue number (e.g., "104") in your bookmark.

</div>

<!-- ### I'm not sure why this was there in the first place...

<div class="content questionbox">

<a name="java"></a>
<h2> 11. Do you publish announcements about Java products?</h2>

<p> Occasionally we publish these in News Bytes: Software News, if there is a
specific Linux connection besides simply the fact that it runs on a Linux
server.  (Because all Java programs can supposedly run on a Linux server.)
A zine that specializes in Java would be a better resource for this.

</div>

<!-- ### Old SSC content - is this even worth updating and/or reviving?

<div class="content questionbox">

<a name="rsync"></a>
<h2> 12. How does the <code>rsync</code> server work?</h2>

<p> Rsync was installed May 2000 as a convenient way for <em>LG</em> mirrors
and others to keep their copies of the Web directory and the FTP files 
up-to-date.

<h3>Our system administrator writes:</h3>

<ol>
	<li> You need rsync.  
See <a href="http://rsync.samba.org/">http://rsync.samba.org/</a> <p>

	<li> Some useful applications of rsync: <p>
	<dl>
		<dt> <code>rsync -az linuxgazette.net::lg-all/ /tmp/lg</code>
		<dd> synchronizes everything (web files and tarballs) to <strong>/tmp/lg</strong> (your local directory) <p>

		<dt> <code>rsync -az --exclude ftpfiles linuxgazette.net::lg-all/ /tmp/lg</code>
		<dd> gets just the web files<p>

		<dt> <code>rsync -az linuxgazette.net::lg-ftp/ /tmp/lg</code>
		<dd> gets just the tarballs <p>
	</dl><p>

	<li> The trailing slash in the "from" field is important!! Otherwise
you will get a subdirectory named <strong>lg-all</STRONG> (or
<STRONG>lg-ftp</STRONG>)
inside your destination
directory, and everything underneath that.<p>

	<li> Add 'v' to the option string to see more of what's going on.
There are many, many other options.  For more info, 
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/cgi-bin/man/man.cgi?mode=search&comm=rsync">'man rsync'</a>.

</ol>

<h3> Ewen McNeill &lt;<a href="mailto:ewen@catalyst.net.nz">ewen@catalyst.net.nz</a>&gt; uses:</h3>

<p><code>rsync -rlHtSz -v --stats anonymous@linuxgazette.net::lg-all/ /dest/dir/</code>
<p> This is built up using environmental variables and a script.

<em>The following was written sometime before June 1999 by LG's then-Editor Marjorie
Richardson, and is presented here for historical interest.  (Note that Linux Journal no longer publishes Linux Gazette.)</em>

<blockquote>
<small>
<h2><img ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="../gx/lg_logo.gif">Statement of Purpose</h2>

<p> 
<em>Linux Gazette</em><img src="../gx/tm.gif">, a member of the Linux Documentation Project, is
an on-line WWW publication that is dedicated to two simple ideas:

<ul>
<li>Making Linux just a <em>little</em> more fun
<li>Sharing ideas and discoveries
</ul>

<p>
The basic idea behind these two concepts is that Linux is one cool OS, whose
price for admission is a willingness to read, learn, tinker (aka,
<em>hack!</em>), and then share your experiences. The Gazette is a compilation
of basic tips, tricks, suggestions, ideas and short articles about Linux
designed to make using Linux fun and easy. <em>LG</em> began as a personal
project of John M.  Fisk, and grew to include contributions freely provided by
a growing number of authors. <em>Linux Journal</em> is now publishing the
Gazette using material contributed by outside authors <a
href="author.html">(note to potential authors)</a>.  Without these authors
there would not be a Gazette, and I thank them all.  Drop a note to the author
of anything that you find helpful or instructive &mdash; the author's e-mail
address is included for this very purpose. 


<p>
Thanks to <strong>Matt Welsh</strong> and <strong>Greg Hankins</strong> of the
<strong>Linux Documentation Project</strong>, for graciously bringing the
<em>Linux Gazette</em> under the auspices of the LDP. The material included in
these documents is covered by a designedly liberal copyright.  For information
regarding copying and distribution of this material read the <a
href="../copying.html">Copying License</a>.  <p> A special thanks to Michael J.
Hammel, our Graphics Muse, for the wonderful new logo designed using the GIMP.


<p> 
Thanks to SSC, we now have our own domain name: linuxgazette.com. <em>(FAQ maintainer's note: Subsequently moved to linuxgazette.net.)</em>
<p>
Have fun!
<p> 
Marjorie L.  Richardson, Overseer 
<em>Linux Gazette</em>
