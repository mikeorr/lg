<p>
I'm trying to do something rather abstruse and complex with a weird mix
of software, hardware, and crazy hackery (too long to explain and it
would be boring to most people if I did), but - I need a "magic bullet"
and I'm hoping that somebody here can point me in the right direction,
or maybe toss a bit of code at me. Here it goes: I need a module that
would create a serial-USB device (/dev/ttyUSB9 by preference) and let me
pipe data into it without actually plugging in any hardware.
</p>

<p>
Is this even possible? Pretty much all of my programming experience is
in the userspace stuff, and beating on bare metal like that is something
I've always considered black magic, so I have absolutely no idea.

Hm, I think I saw something like a USB dummy driver somwhere somewhen.
But there is a tutorial for coding USB drivers and even skeleton code.

I think so. Maybe the driver testing tool
(<a href='http://www.linux-usb.org/usbtest/#devices'>http://www.linux-usb.org/usbtest/#devices</a>) has a way of faking devices
and creating devices for I/O.

Does it have to be a serial-USB device?

[Laugh] Funny thing, I was just exchanging mail with Greg Kroah-Hartman
yesterday. Nice guy, and very helpful, but I was only able to get just
so far with his help and no farther. Mostly because the thing that I'm
trying to do now is something that I figured out based on his help.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps I should just wait until I can get back home (I'm teaching a
class in Milwaukee; last night, it was *over a hundred degrees colder*
here than Florida was when I left!) so I can use my GPS as a data source
for this, but I'm impatient. Blame the cold weather. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Eeep. I was hoping it wasn't that complicated - some equivalent of
'netcat' or whatever... maybe I do need to wait.

<p>
Hmm. I just worked my way through that, and it seems that you have to
have <em>some</em> hardware at least; none of the modules in
/lib/modules/2.6.24-16-generic/kernel/drivers/usb/gadget load for me,
all of them dying with a 'No such device' error.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; Does it have to be a serial-USB device?
</pre>

<p>
I'd be willing to try it with a non-serial version, if that's any
easier.

<p>
socat ('netcat++' - <a href='http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/'>http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/</a>) can redirect
serial ports, but nothing about USB there.

<p>
The libusb documentations says: 'Before any communication can occur
with a device, it needs to be found.' (Perl has Device::USB, but it's
a libusb wrapper, so same thing).

<p>
Well, qemu has some virtual usb devices: it can emulate a USB storage
device using a directory, or a USB mouse or tablet using X's. It tends
to attract a lot of experimental patches, so perhaps there's a virtual
serial device floating on the net somewhere.

Erm, the cold obviously got to my brain. I'm in <strong>Minneapolis</strong>, not
Milwaukee... anyway, <strong>one</strong> of those cities that's entirely too close to
the North Pole. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

FWIW, the USB Serial virtual device was integrated into qemu: perhaps

That's actually in the kernel source. I tried compiling it, and it threw
a bunch of compilation errors - not even a question of missing libs,
just some makefile problem:

That's deeper than I want to dig. :\
