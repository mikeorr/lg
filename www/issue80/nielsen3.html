<h3>
<a NAME="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
GDM, or GNOME Display Manager, is a graphical login service for your
computer when it boots up. Basically, it makes a nice pretty screen to look
at before you log in. With the standard 
installation of RedHat, and I assume other distributions, GDM is really
cool. As a user, you can run the program "gdmphotosetup" to set the picture
of you that will show up in GDM when your computer starts. As the "root"
user, you can configure GDM with "gdmconfig" which lets you set a lot of 
cool options. So why am I writing this article when you can do all this 
yourself? I will show you some bad things you are not suppose to do. 

<h3>
<a NAME="config"></a>Configuring GDM naughtily.</h3>
In the gdm.conf file, I changed these options (which you can also 
probably do in the gui setup program). 
<pre>
TitleBar=true
Browser=true

LockPosition=false
SetPosition=true
PositionX=0
PositionY=700
</pre>

<p>
Here is my /etc/X11/gdm/Init/Default script.
<pre>
#!/bin/sh

/usr/X11R6/bin/xsetroot -solid "#363047"

    ### This next item is a huge security risk. 
    ### It basically sets up an xterm with the user "mark". 
xterm -r -fn 6x12 -geometry +0+25 -e '/etc/X11/gdm/mark.sh' &
#xterm -r -fn 6x12 -geometry +0+25 -e '/etc/X11/gdm/dummy.sh' &
    ### This puts a picture on the background.
/usr/bin/xsri -geometry 500x500+600+300 /etc/X11/gdm/im000048.jpg
    ### This puts xeyes on the screen to watch your mouse pointer.
xeyes -geometry +800+650 -bg white -fg green -outline blue &
    ### Christmas all year round. 
xsnow -santaspeed 10 -santa 2 -snowflakes 1000 -whirl 4 -windtimer 30 &
    ### A clock down to the second. 
xclock -digital -geometry +600+650 -update 1 &

    ### The popular mine game. Sorry, doesn't seem like you can position it. 
    ### it just pops up in the middle of the screen.
gnomine &

  ### Maelstrom is pretty cool. 
Maelstrom &
   ## xboard pops up behind GDM, so we can't use it. 
#xboard &
  ### Chromium is a cool arcade-like old fashioned game. 
chromium-setup &
  ### Look at the light shining on the earth.
kworldclock -geometry +750+0 &
  ### A silly creature for your desktop. 
amor &

</pre>

<p>Now the contents of '/etc/X11/gdm/mark.sh'.
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

trap "" HUP
trap "" INT 
trap "" QUIT
trap "" KILL
trap "" TSTP

su -l mark
exit
exit
</pre>
Why is the above script dangerous? Well, people can do stuff without 
logging in. That is why I put a bunch of traps in the script and made
it exit as soon as someone quits as the user 'mark'. I don't want 
anyone to execute root commands, so you have to make it so root exits as
soon as the user 'mark' quits and you have to trap the script so that 
someone doesn't cancel the quit -- which would leave them logged in as root.
Still, the whole thing is bad and you shouldn't do it, even though I do. 
As an alternative to my xterm session, you could use "chroot", which I 
did successfully. It can be a little tricky to setup a chroot environment, 
but you can do it. Here is a sample of an account I calld "dummy". 
Remember, the /chroot/named environment has to look like the root directory
with a /bin, /sbin, /lib, and all the other directories if you want the
user to be able to do anything at all, and of course /etc/passwd.
<p>Now the contents of '/etc/X11/gdm/dummy.sh'.
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

trap "" HUP
trap "" INT
trap "" QUIT
trap "" KILL
trap "" TSTP

chroot /chroot/dummy su -l dummy
exit
exit
</pre>

<h3>
<a NAME="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3>
GDM is really cool, and I assume KDM is just a cool. I just like to 
configure GDM to be nice to look at when I or someone else sits down at
them. 
<p>
You might want to have other games playing in the background of your gdm
session. I tested various games, some work and some don't. Remember, every
program you run is a potential security hole if someone can somehow execute
commands through the program or know how to screw it up causing your
computer to get messed up. Obviously, doing something like this on a client
computer should get you fired.
