Hi there,
</p>

<p>
I'm looking for info on how to fix my login after performing dist-upgrade.
I'm running Deb. Etch. I can sign on a root via term. 
</p>

<p>
However I get errors like...
</p>

<p>
Could not open Network Socket, make sure dcopserver is running. And this one....
</p>

<p>
Could not start kstartupconfig. check your installation. When signing onto my user account.
</p>

<p>
I opened Kuser and crated a new login and that works. But I'd like to fix my old one.
</p>

<p>
 
Thanks,
Christopher Cole
</p>

It sounds like <em>something</em> in KDE broke when you updated it - or you may
be trying to run something (maybe in your .bash_profile?) that worked
with the old KDE version but fails with the new one. Hard to say,
without a whole lot more info.

I'm not sure of what you mean here. If creating a new account works,
then just remove the old one (make sure you don't delete your home
directory, of course) and recreate it. Based on your description, that
should fix the problem.

<p>
How did you "perform" the dist-upgrade?
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I'm running Deb. Etch. I can sign on a root via term. 
</pre>

<p>
via an xterm?
</p>

<p>
Could you please give the commands you typed and the errors which were
returned for each command. It is difficult to know where the problem is
if the exact error is not known.
