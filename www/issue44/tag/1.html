Hello Jim,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I like the look of your web site. Very unique. Well to the
point.  I know you guys make money on consulting so, I will ask
you to help me later when I get ready to setup. But for now, I am
curious about the Windows 95 programs and the operating system
Linux (preferbly RedHat Linux 5.1) I was wondering if it was
possible with a emulator or to edit the kernel to run some Windows
95 programs in Linux or to run Windows 95 as a shell?  Any
references or books you could refer me to, I would appreciate it.
</STRONG></P>

I'm guessing that you've come across my website at
<A HREF="http://www.starshine.org"
	>http://www.starshine.org</A>.  Actually I do very little work on
that these days.  I spend far more time providing content to
the Linux Gazette (<A HREF="http://www.linuxgazette.net"
	>http://www.linuxgazette.net</A>) where I
do the "Answer Guy" column.  (No, I didn't pick the name.
Yes, your question and my answer are being posted there).

I answer general technical support questions (such as this
one) via e-mail and netnews.  Some of them I cross-post to
my editors at LG, who gather them up, run them through a
custom mail2HTML filter (written by my wife, Heather), and
with a few manual touchups, post them to the web where
they can get indexed by Alta-vista, Yahoo!, Deja News, and
all the rest.  LG is also widely mirrored and seems to get
translated into a few other languages (since I occasionally
see parts of my own writing popping up in various languages
that I don't speak).

Officially the Linux Gazette is part of the Linux
Documentation Project (LDP: <A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP"
	>http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP</A>) and
is released under a variant of the GPL (the GNU Public
License) --- in basically the same was as the Linux Kernel
and all of the GNU software which is used to build it and
the GNU software which runs under it.

However, there are better sources of information on the
web, written by people who are actually involved in some of
these efforts.  So far the best collection of links that
I've seen that related to running Windows software under
Linux and other forms of Unix is at the WINE Headquarters
(<A HREF="http://www.winehq.com"
	>http://www.winehq.com</A>) under their listing of "Other
Related Projects" (<A HREF="http://www.winehq.com/others.html"
	>http://www.winehq.com/others.html</A>).

A particularly promising package which was only released
fairly recently is VMWare. This seems to reliably run
Win '9x, NT and even Linux from within a virtual machine.

In issue 30 and again in 32 (above) mentioned the Microsoft
WISE offering (<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/win32dev/base/wise.htm"
	>http://www.microsoft.com/win32dev/base/wise.htm</A>).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
WISE is a cross-licensing deal to allow vendors to port
Windows programs to RISC (non-x86) platforms.  This is also
noted, by name, on the WineHQ page.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The purpose of this is obvious.  Legitimize the use of
Windows products on "non-competing" versions of Unix (those
for non PC hardware platforms) in an effort to curtail the
groundswell of support for the PC Unix variants, particular
the free Linux and Unix systems.  Microsoft also seems to be
releasing "Unix" versions of some of their products --- on
a few *non-PC* platforms (particularly ironic since they
still own a stake in SCO and they steadfastly refuse to
support ports of their own products to that platform).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's impossibly to address this situation from a purely
technical point of view.  The problems are political,
and have very little to do with technology or even
the finances of any particular product.  Microsoft would
make plenty of money if they sold MS Office for Linux.
It would be far more profitable than any sales for AIX,
HP-UX, or Solaris, simply because the size of the Linux
market exceeds all of those combined (and we, as a whole
aren't the cheapskates that many in the press like to
portray).  So, most of my thoughts on this subject are
unabashedly political.

Good luck on the new venture.  Are you considering offering
pre-installed Linux systems through your business?  Do you
have a URL, yet? (If so, I'd suggest putting it in your
.sig).  I grew up in Chicago.  However, I now live in the
Silicon Valley (the computer nerd's "Mecca").
