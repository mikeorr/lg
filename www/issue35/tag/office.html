Is it possible to set up a linux file and print server in an
office of 95,98 &amp; DOS?

It is a very popular application for Linux boxes.  You can
easily take any old 386, 486, or Pentium with 16 or 32 Mb
and an ethernet card (or two) and install Linux and Samba.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Samba is a popular Unix package for providing SMB file and
print services.  SMB is the technical name for the set of
protocols that Windows NT, '95, '98, and OS/2 LANMan and
LANServer (among others) all used for file and print
sharing.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Samba was written by Andrew Tridgell has been enhanced by a
host of others (much like Linux itself).  While much of the
development of Samba has been done on Linux --- it's worth
noting that many of the Samba developers also work on
<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A> and some even 
work on Solaris, SunOS, Irix, and
other traditional forms of Unix.  The code is quite
portable.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The master web server for Samba is at:

>http://samba.anu.edu.au/samba/samba.html</A>
</dl></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
.. there are mirrors world-wide.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note that Samba come with most Linux distributions.  Also
note that the Samba team is pretty close to releasing
version 2.0 which will include some code to support DC
services (allowing your Linux box to act as a "Domain
Controller" a PDC or BDC for your NT systems).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's also worth noting that your MS-DOS machines must be
outfitted with TCP/IP suites to talk to Samba.  I don't know
of a Unix implementation of the NetBIOS networking protocols
(the lower layer protocols over which the "server message
blocks" of SMB are transported).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Another alternative is to run Netware for Linux (available
from Caldera: <A HREF="http://www.caldera.com">http://www.caldera.com</A>) 
and have your MS-DOS systems access their file and print services via IPX
protocols.  (I always found the IPX drivers for DOS to be
the quickest, most stable, and compatible and to have the
most modest memory footprint of any networking drivers on
the platform --- I always attributed Novell's huge success
to those qualities).  There is also a free "Netware
emulator" called "Mars_nwe" --- that may also be sufficient
for your MS-DOS systems.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You may also want to consider switching some of your DOS
systems to Linux with DOSEmu (a BIOS/system emulator for
running a copy of DOS).  You can also consider installing
Caldera/DR-DOS as an alternative to MS-DOS.  Basically MS
isn't upgrading DOS any more, but Caldera and the Linux
community are.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In any event Netware is not free software.  Samba is.
However, you can run them concurrently on the same server
(although I'd suggest a Pentium with 64Mb of RAM if you're
going to run those <EM>and</EM> the obligatory intranet web, mail,
and other services on the one host).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note that processor speed is not much of an issue here ---
all of these services take very little processor power, and
Linux doesn't require that you load the system with alot of
unnecessary support (like all kinds of GUI baggage) when you
just want to run a server in the closet.  If you hook up a
typical cheap laser or inkjet printer or two to the system,
you can configure Linux to handle PostScript (TM) print jobs
using the ghostscript drivers (a package that implements the
PostScript (TM) language on the host computer and supports a
large number of common printers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Be sure to get a printer that is NOT a "winprinter" (a print
engine with essentially no embedded system --- which relies
on PROPRIETARY drivers to drive it).  The problem with these
is that the manufacturers won't (or can't) release the
specifications to allow Linux developers to write Linux
native drivers for them.  So you can only run these printers
from Windows systems.  (Basically it's a ripoff.  You pay
almost as much for a much less sophisticated printer that
will probably be rendered temporarily useless with every
Microsoft OS upgrade --- since the old drivers will almost
never work with their new OS versions).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I suggest that people considering Linux start with the
Hardware-HOWTO at:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><blockquote><code>
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Hardware-HOWTO.html"
>http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Hardware-HOWTO.html</A>
</code></blockquote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(and any LDP mirror).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The SMB-Howto by David Wood seems to be pretty old --- and I
know that Samba has been upgraded quite a bit since August
of '96 --- so we probably need to find someone revise this
HOWTO.  However, most of the principles and examples should
still work --- so it's a good place to look.  Be sure to
read the FAQ at the ANU site, though.  There's a whole
newsgroup devoted to the topic:  news://comp.protocols.smb
--- and Samba is the most common topic of discussion there.
