This article may give me a start, but I am looking for something a
little closer to my requirements. I need to emulate a network of
embedded devices, preferably by creating a pseudo-router with something
that acts like those devices behind it. Every article I have seen
suggests putting the target devices into virtual machines with a router
VM in front. But the embedded devices I need to emulate are neither PCs
nor OS based. We buy the primary device from another company, and it
comes with a Rabbit 2000 and Ethernet interface. That company provides
us with firmware to our specifications, which we simply write into flash
memory with utilities they also provide. I need to emulate a network of
2000 of these devices to do a decent load test on our servers. This
emulation needs to duplicate the behavior of the TCP/IP stack as well as
initiate socket connections, data requests and transactions just as the
target devices do. Some of this behavior will have to be characterized
by analyzing Wireshark traces and some experimentation.

<p>
Any suggestions?

Thank you,

You could go about and change qemu to match the devices you have. Since
qemu already has a wide range of network card (chips) emulated and also
emulates lots of processors (i386, arm, mips, sparc, alpha) you will
have lots of code examples.
