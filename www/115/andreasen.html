<h1>Python for scientific use, Part II: Data analysis</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/andreasen.html">Anders Andreasen</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
In <a href="../114/andreasen.html">Linux Gazette issue #114</a>, we took
the first steps towards understanding and interpretation of scientific data
by using <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> for the visualization.
The next step is to reach a quantitative understanding by performing some
sensible data analysis, such as fitting a model to the data and thereby
extracting useful parameters. This defines the main topic of this part II
of Python for scientific use. As with part I, this article will also be
centered around a few illustrative examples. I assume that the reader is
familiar with either part I of this article or basic Python.
</p>

<h3>Part I: <em>post scriptum</em></h3>
<p>
As a pleasant surprise, I actually got some nice reader feedback related to
Part I of this article. Some readers proposed additional tips &amp; tricks;
I have included them here, to the service of other readers who might find
it useful (at least I did :-).
</p>

<p>
If you want to try out all the examples on a Wind0ws machine (for some
wicked reason), John Bollinger suggested to use <code>os.popen</code> the
following way:
</p>

<pre class="code">
f=os.popen('pgnuplot.exe','w')
</pre>

<p>
Even more intelligently, the following code ensures that the Python script
can be run on both Linux and Wind0ws:
</p>

<pre class="code">
import os
import sys

if os.name == 'posix':
    f=os.popen('gnuplot', 'w')
    print 'posix'
elif os.name == 'nt':
    f=os.popen('pgnuplot.exe', 'w')
    print 'windows'
else:
    print 'unknown os'
    sys.exit(1)
</pre>

<p>
JB also pointed my attention to Michael Haggerty's neat
project, <code>gnuplot.py</code>, 
at <a href="http://gnuplot-py.sourceforge.net/">sourceforge</a>.
</p>

<p>
Cyril Buttay brought to my attention that the default encoding in gnuplot
is insufficient if you want to print special characters, e.g. Danish
ones like &aelig;, &oslash;, and &aring; on the plots. In order to do
so, you need to specify another encoding as described in the <a
href="http://gnuplot.info/docs/gnuplot.html#encoding">gnuplot manual</a>:
</p>

<pre class="code">
set encoding {&lt;value&gt;}
show encoding
</pre>

<p>
where the valid values are
</p>

<pre class="code">
default     - tells a terminal to use its default encoding
iso_8859_1  - the most common Western European font used by many
              Unix workstations and by MS-Windows. This encoding is
              known in the PostScript world as 'ISO-Latin1'.
iso_8859_2  - used in Central and Eastern Europe
iso_8859_15 - a variant of iso_8859_1 that includes the Euro symbol
cp850       - codepage for OS/2
cp852       - codepage for OS/2
cp437       - codepage for MS-DOS
koi8r       - popular Unix Cyrillic encoding
</pre>

<p>
If the encoding is not changed from the default, the special character might
show up on the screen but not in the hardcopy (actually, I think the
special characters only work with <code>terminal postscript</code>, but I'm
not sure). If the desired special character is not available on your
keyboard, it can be accessed though its octal value; e.g., to print a special
character such as the Danish &aring; in the title of a plot, set the encoding to
<code>iso_8859_1</code>:

<pre class="code">
set title "This is a Danish character \345"
</pre>

<p>
which will display <strong>This is a Danish character &aring;</strong> in
the title of the plot. To also use Greek characters, e.g. &alpha; (lowercase
alpha), one should use <code>{/Symbol a}</code> (this requires
<code>terminal postscript enhanced</code>). Similar, &Gamma; (uppercase
gamma), is generated with <code>{/Symbol G}</code>. To find special
characters and their corresponding octal values for, e.g.,
<code>iso8859-1</code> encoding in Linux, just type:

<pre>
man iso_8859-1
</pre>

<p>
or have a look at <a href="misc/andreasen/iso8859_1.ps">this postscript file</a>.
</p>

<p class="editorial">
[ If you're not sure of the exact name of the relevant manpage, just type
<code>man -k <b>string</b></code>, where 'string' is the name, or part of
the name of the encoding you're looking for. This will get you a list of
all the manpages the names of which contain that string. -- Ben ]
</p>


<h3>Example 1: Fitting 2-D data</h3>

<p>
The first example illustrates how to fit a model to 2-D data. The data to
be fitted is included in the file <a
href="misc/andreasen/tgdata.dat">tgdata.dat</a> and represents weight
loss (in wt. %) as a function of time. The weight loss is due to hydrogen
desorption from <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_aluminium_hydride">LiAlH<sub>4</sub></a>,
a potential material for on-board hydrogen storage in future fuel cell
powered vehicles (thank you Ben for mentioning <em>hydrogen power</em> in the
<a
href="../114/lg_laundrette.html#nottag.30"><em>Laundrette</em></a>
in issue #114). The data is actually the same as in example 1 of <a
href="../114/andreasen.html">LG#114</a>. For some
reason, I suspect that the data may be explained by the following function:
</p>

<pre>
f(t) = A1*(1-exp(-(k1*t)^n1)) + A2*(1-exp(-(k2*t)^n2)) 
</pre>

<p> 
There are different mathematical methods available for finding the
parameters that give an optimal fit to real data, but the most widely used
is probably the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenberg-Marquardt_algorithm">Levenberg-Marquandt
algorithm</a> for non-linear <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares">least-squares</a>
optimization. The algorithm works by minimizing the sum of squares (squared
residuals) defined for each data point as
</p>

<pre>
(y-f(t))^2
</pre>

<p>
where <code>y</code> is the measured dependent variable and
<code>f(t)</code> is the calculated. The <a
href="http://www.scipy.org">Scipy</a> package has the Levenberg-Marquandt
algorithm included as the function <code>leastsq</code>.
</p>




<p>
The fitting routine is in the file <a
href="misc/andreasen/kinfit.py.txt">kinfit.py</a> and the python code is
listed below. Line numbers have been added for readability.
</p>

<pre class="code">
     1  from scipy import *
     2  from scipy.optimize import leastsq
     3  import scipy.io.array_import
     4  from scipy import gplt
     5
     6  def residuals(p, y, x):
     7          err = y-peval(x,p)
     8          return err
     9
    10  def peval(x, p):
    11          return p[0]*(1-exp(-(p[2]*x)**p[4])) + p[1]*(1-exp(-(p[3]*(x))**p[5] ))
    12
    13  filename=('tgdata.dat')
    14  data = scipy.io.array_import.read_array(filename)
    15
    16  y = data[:,1]
    17  x = data[:,0]
    18
    19  A1_0=4
    20  A2_0=3
    21  k1_0=0.5
    22  k2_0=0.04
    23  n1_0=2
    24  n2_0=1
    25  pname = (['A1','A2','k1','k2','n1','n2'])
    26  p0 = array([A1_0 , A2_0, k1_0, k2_0,n1_0,n2_0])
    27  plsq = leastsq(residuals, p0, args=(y, x), maxfev=2000)
    28  gplt.plot(x,y,'title "Meas" with points',x,peval(x,plsq[0]),'title "Fit" with lines lt -1')
    29  gplt.yaxis((0, 7))
    30  gplt.legend('right bottom Left')
    31  gplt.xtitle('Time [h]')
    32  gplt.ytitle('Hydrogen release [wt. %]')
    33  gplt.grid("off")
    34  gplt.output('kinfit.png','png medium transparent size 600,400')
    35
    36  print "Final parameters"
    37  for i in range(len(pname)):
    38          print "%s = %.4f " % (pname[i], p0[i])
</pre>

<p>
In order to run the code download the <a
href="misc/andreasen/kinfit.py.txt">kinfit.py.txt</a> file as kinfit.py (or
use another name of your preference), also download the datafile <a
href="misc/andreasen/tgdata.dat">tgdata.dat</a> and run the script with
<code>python kinfit.py</code>. Besides Python, you need to have SciPy and
gnuplot installed (vers. 4.0 was used throughout this article). The output
of the program is plotted to the screen as shown below. A hard copy is also
made. The gnuplot png option <code>size</code> is a little tricky. The
example shown above works with gnuplot compiled against <code>libgd</code>.
If you have <code>libpng + zlib</code> installed, instead of
<code>size</code> write <code>picsize</code> and the specified width and
height should not be comma separated. As shown in the figure below, the
proposed model fit the data very well (sometimes you get lucky :-).
</p>

<img src="misc/andreasen/kinfit.png" alt="Fit of 2-D data" width="600" height="400">

<p> 
Now, let us go through the code of the example. 

<dl>
<dt>Line 1-4</dt> 
<dd>all the needed packages are imported. The first is basic SciPy
functionality, the second is the Levenberg-Marquandt algorithm, the third
is ASCII data file import, and finally the fourth is the gnuplot interface. 
<dt>Line 6-11</dt>
<dd>First, the function used to calculate the residuals (not the squared
ones, squaring will be handled by <code>leastsq</code>) is defined; second,
the fitting function is defined.
<dt>Line 13-17</dt>
<dd>The data file name is stored, and the data file is read using
<code>scipy.io.array_import.read_array</code>. For convenience x (time) and
y (weight loss) values are stores in separate variables.
<dt>Line 19-26</dt>
<dd>All parameters are given some initial guesses. An array with the names
of the parameters is created for printing the results and all initial
guesses are also stored in an array. I have chosen initial guesses that are
quite close to the optimal parameters. However, chosing reasonable starting
parameters is not always easy. In the worst case, poor initial parameters
might result in the fitting procedure not being able to find a converged
solution. In this case, a starting point can be to try and plot the data
along with the model predictions and then "tune" the initial parameters to
give just a crude description (but better than the initial parameters that
did not lead to convergence), so that the model just captures the essential
features of the data before starting the fitting procedure.
<dt>Line 27</dt>
<dd>Here the Levenberg-Marquandt algorithm (<code>lestsq</code>) is called.
The input parameters are the name of the function defining the residuals,
the array of initial guesses, the x- and y-values of the data, and the
maximum number of function evaluation are also specified. The values of the
optimized parameters are stored in <code>plsq[0]</code> (actually the
initial guesses in <code>p0</code> are also overwritten with the optimized
ones). In order to learn more about the usage of <code>lestsq</code> type
<code>info(optimize.leastsq)</code> in an interactive python session
- remember that the SciPy package should be imported first - or read the
tutorial (see references in the end of this article). 
<dt>Line 28-34</dt>
<dd>This is the plotting of the data and the model calculations (by
evaluating the function defining the fitting model with the final
parameters as input). 
<dt>Line 36-38</dt>
<dd>The final parameters are printed to the console as:
<dd><code>Final parameters</code>
<dd><code>A1 = 4.1141</code>
<dd><code>A2 = 2.4435</code>
<dd><code>k1 = 0.6240</code>
<dd><code>k2 = 0.1227</code>
<dd><code>n1 = 1.7987</code>
<dd><code>n2 = 1.5120</code>
</dl>

<p>
<a href="http://www.gnuplot.info">Gnuplot</a> also uses the
Levenberg-Marquandt algorithm for its built-in curve fitting procedure.
Actually, for many cases where the fitting function is somewhat simple and
the data does not need heavy pre-processing, I prefer gnuplot over Python -
simply due to the fact that Gnuplot also prints standard error estimates of
the individual parameters. The advantage of Python over Gnuplot is the
availability of many different optimization algorithms in addition to the
Levenberg-Marquandt procedure, e.g. the Simplex algorithm, the Powell's
method, the Quasi-Newton method, Conjugated-gradient method, etc. One only
has to supply a function calculating the sum of squares (with
<code>lestsq</code> squaring and summing of the residuals were performed
<em>on-the-fly</em>).
</p>

<h3>Example 2: Sunspots</h3>
<p>
In the next example we will use the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">Fast Fourier
Transform</a> (FFT) in order to transform time-dependent data into the
<em>frequency</em> domain. By doing so, it is possible to analyse if any
predominant frequencies exists - i.e. if there is any periodicity in the
data. We will not go into too much detail of the underlying mathematics of
the FFT method; if you're interested, have a look at some of the many
informative pages on the internet, e.g. <a
href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbourke/analysis/dft/">http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbourke/analysis/dft/</a>,
<a
href="http://www.cmlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/cml/dsp/training/coding/transform/fft.html">http://www.cmlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/cml/dsp/training/coding/transform/fft.html</a>,
<a href="http://www.library.cornell.edu/nr/bookcpdf/c12-0.pdf">Numerical
recipes</a>, etc.
</p>

<p>
Let's take a simple example to get started. Consider temperature
measurement at a given location as a function of time. By intuition, we
expect such data to have a dominant frequency component of 1/24h = 0.042
h<sup>-1</sup> simply reflecting the fact that it is usually warmer during
the day (with a maximum around noon) and cooler during the night (with a
minimum sometime during the night). Thus, assuming a period with stable
weather for, say, one week, we may approximate the the temperature
variations as a function of time with a sine wave with a period of 24 h. If
we take the Fourier Transform of this sine wave we find that only one
single frequency is present (shown as a &delta;-function) and that it is
0.042 h<sup>-1</sup>. OK, enough with the simple case, if everything was
this simple we wouldn't need the Fourier Transform. Instead we will move to
a more complex case where intuition is not enough.   
</p>

<p>
The example data we will use is the sunspot activity measurements from year
1700 to year 2004 provided by <a
href="http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/stp/SOLAR/ftpsunspotnumber.html">National
Geophysical Data Center - NOAA Sattelite and Information Service</a>. The
data set is the yearly sunspot observations available via <a
href="ftp://ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov/STP/SOLAR_DATA/SUNSPOT_NUMBERS/YEARLY.PLT">FTP</a>.
The datafile is also included as <a
href="misc/andreasen/sunspots.dat">sunspots.dat</a>. The sunspot data have
been used for illustrating the power of FFT with respect to finding a
periodicity in sunspot activity in various computer languages, e.g. <a
href="http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/math/datafun22.html">Matlab</a>
and <a
href="http://www.physics.odu.edu/~gec100f/cai-lib/simulations.htm#astro">BASIC</a>.
The observations that there is (or might be) a correlation between sunspot
activity and the global temperature have led to controversy when discussing
the greenhouse effect and global warming.
</p>

<p>
The graph below illustrates the sunspot data to be used in this example.
</p>

<img src="misc/andreasen/sunspot_time.png" alt="Sunspots" width="600" height="400">

<p>
The code below shows the python script for analysing the sunspot data. The
shown script is a shortened version with some plots removed. The full
script is in <a href="misc/andreasen/sunspots.py.txt">sunspots.py.txt</a>.
</p>

<pre class="code">
     1  from scipy import *
     2  import scipy.io.array_import
     3  from scipy import gplt
     4  from scipy import fftpack
     5
     6  sunspot = scipy.io.array_import.read_array('sunspots.dat')
     7
     8  year=sunspot[:,0]
     9  wolfer=sunspot[:,1]
    10  Y=fft(wolfer)
    11  n=len(Y)
    12  power = abs(Y[1:(n/2)])**2
    13  nyquist=1./2
    14  freq=array(range(n/2))/(n/2.0)*nyquist
    15  period=1./freq
    16  gplt.plot(period[1:len(period)], power,'title "Meas" with linespoints')
    17  gplt.xaxis((0,40))
    18  gplt.xtitle('Period [year]')
    19  gplt.ytitle('|FFT|**2')
    20  gplt.grid("off")
    21  gplt.output('sunspot_period.png','png medium transparent picsize 600 400')
</pre>

<p> 
In the first few lines we import all the necessary packages. In line 6 the
sunspot data is imported and stored in the variable <code>sunspot</code>;
for convenience the x-values (year) and y-values (Wolfer number) are stored
in separate variables. In line 10 we take the fast Fourier transform (FFT)
of the sunspot data. As shown in the figure below, the output is a
collection of complex numbers (defining both amplitude and phase of the
wave components), and there is noticeable symmetry around Im=0.
</p>

<img src="misc/andreasen/sunspot_FFT.png" alt="FFT(sunspots)" width="600" height="400">

<p>
In order to construct a periodogram, i.e. a graph of power vs. frequency,
we first compute the <em>power</em> of the FFT signal which is simply the
FFT signal squared. We only need the part of the signal ranging from zero
to a frequency equal to the Nyquist frequency, which is equal to half the
maximum frequency, since frequencies above the Nyquist frequency correspond
to negative frequencies. The frequency range is calculated from
<strong>0-N/2</strong> as <strong>N/(2T)</strong> where <strong>N</strong>
is the number of samples and <strong>T</strong> is the sampling time. The
figure below shows the resulting periodogram.
</p>

<img src="misc/andreasen/sunspot_freq.png" alt="sunspots(freq.)" width="600" height="400">

<p>
Thus, we can see that there is indeed periodicity in the sunspot data,
with frequencies around 0.9 standing out. Note that it is easier to
see if we use the period (inverse of frequency) instead of frequency on the
x-axis.
</p>

<img src="misc/andreasen/sunspot_period.png" alt="sunspots(period)" width="600" height="400">

<p>
As seen in the figure we have found out (like many others have) that the
sunspot activity data from 1700-2004 is periodic, and that the sunspots
occur with a maximum in activity approx. every 11 years.
</p>

<h3>Example 3: Fitting multiple 2-D data files</h3>
<p>
The next and final example is a little more complex than the previous ones.
The task it should accomplish is to cycle through a number of data files
(similar to the ones used in Example 3 of <a
href="../114/andreasen.html">Part I</a>) and take a slice of each data
file, corresponding to an <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_diffraction">X-ray diffraction</a>
peak as shown in example 2 in <a href="../114/andreasen.html">Part I</a>.
To this peak a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">Gaussian</a> (bell)
curve should be fitted and the fitting parameters should be stored in a
datafile. The extracted parameters: peak position, peak height, peak width,
all contain valuable information about the sample under investigation
(MgH<sub>2</sub>, another material for solid state hydrogen storage). The
peak position is related to the crystal lattice of the material (actually
the interatomic spacing, if we're to be precise), the peak height
corresponds to the abundance of the material, and the peak width
corresponds to the domain size of the MgH<sub>2</sub> crystallites.
Furthermore, the script should take two command line arguments,
<code>plot</code> and <code>data</code>, enabling plotting of the peak fit
as the script cycles through the data files as well as printing out the
fitting parameters to the screen. This option is mainly of diagnostic
nature. Furthermore, there should be some sort of mechanism evaluating the
quality of the fit and in case the fit is poor it should be disregarded.
Finally, the scripts should generate a plot of the fitting parameters as a
function of time (cycle #).  The length of the script approaches 100 lines
and will not be shown, but it is stored in the file <a
href="misc/andreasen/lgtixrpd.py.txt">lgtixrpd.py.txt</a>. In the
following section, I will go though the main parts of the script. To run
the example yourself you'll have to <a
href="http://andr.dk/wiki/index.php/Supplementary_material#Linux_gazette_115">download</a>
and unpack the data files.
<p>

<dl>

	plotted along the way though the files. In lines 42-53, the state
	of the fit is evaluated. If, e.g., the amplitude is negative or the
	peak position is out of bounds, the fit is disregarded and the
	corresponding fitting parameters are not stored (only zeros are
	stored). If the script is passed a command line argument called
	<code>data</code>, the fitting parameters are printed to screen as
	the data files are cycled through.

<dt>Line 95-98</dt>
	<dd>The plot is shown using <code>ggv</code> and a <code>pnm</code>
	version of the hard copy is created.
</dl>

<p>
The figure below shows the created plot. From the plot, we notice that
during heating (linear) of our sample, the peak position shifts towards
lower values. According to <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bragg%27s_law">Bragg's law of
diffraction</a>, there is an inverse relationship between the peak position
and the lattice spacing. Thus, our sample expands during heating (as
expected). We also observe that when the sample has been heated to
400&deg;C for some time, the amplitude starts decreasing, signaling a
disappearance of MgH<sub>2</sub> due to decomposition accompanied
by the release of hydrogen.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
In this article, a few examples have been given in order to illustrate that
Python is indeed a powerful tool for visualization and analysis of
scientific data. It combines the plotting power of gnuplot with the power
of a real programming language. The SciPy package includes many scientific
tools suitable for data analysis.
