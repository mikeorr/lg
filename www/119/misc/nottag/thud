"I just do zer pictures, Commander," said Otto, looking up with a hurt 
expression. "Anyvay, I couldn't tell you even if I knew, because of zer

"War, Nobby. Huh! What is it good for?" he said.

"Dunno, Sarge. Freeing slaves, maybe?"

"Absol--well, okay."

"Defending yourself against a totalitarian agressor?"

"All right, I'll grant you that, but--"

"Saving civilization from a horde of--"

"It doesn't do any good in the long run is what I'm saying, Nobby, if you'd

It really was an /awful/ garment, that pullover. It had a queasy zigzag pattern,
in many strange unhappy colours. It looked like something knitted as a present

He glanced down at his paperwork. "Salacia Deloresista Amanita Trigestatra
Zeldana Malifee..." He paused, turned over several pages, and said, "I think
we can skip some of these, but they end 'von Humpeding." She is fifty-one, 
/but/," he added quickly, before Vimes could seize on this revelation, "that 
is no age at all for a vampire. Oh, and she'd prefer to be known simply as 
Sally."

'A.E. Pessimal will be quite acceptable, Your Grace,' said the inspector.

'The /A/ standing for--?' Vimes said, taking his eyes off the board for
a moment.

'Just /A/, Your Grace,' said A.E. Pessimal patiently. 'A.E. Pessimal.'

'You mean you weren't named, you were /initialed/?'

'Just so, Your Grace,' said the little man calmly.

'What do your friends call you?' A.E. Pessimal looked as though there was one
major assumption in that sentence that he did not understand, so Vimes took
a small amount of pity on him.

'There are people living hundreds of miles away who can't, I reckon. What

'I put them in No. 4 evidence locker and left the key in the lock,' said
Cheery.

The important thing is not to shout at this point, Vimes told himself. Do

Dwarfs as a whole weren't happy about newspapers, regarding such news as a
lover of fine grapes would regard raisins. They got their news from other

Vimes had never got on with any game much more complex than darts. Chess in
particular had always annoyed him. It was the dumb way the pawns went off
and slaughtered their fellow pawns while the kings lounged about doing 
nothing that always got to him; if only the pawns united, maybe talked the
rooks around, the whole board could've been a republic in a dozen moves.

"Hold it!" Sally thrust both hands in front of her in a gesture of peace.
"There's something we'd better sort before this goes any further!"

"Yeah?"

"Yes. We're both wearing nothing, we're standing in what, you may have 
noticed, is increasingly turning into mud, and we're squaring up to fight.
Okay. But there's something missing, yes?"

"And that is...?"

The plain fact was that while Tawneee had a body that every other woman 
should hate her for, she compounded the insult by actually being very
likable. This was because she had the self-esteem of a caterpillar and, as
you found out after any kind of conversation with her, about the same amount
of brain. Perhaps it all balanced out, perhaps some kindly god had said to 
her: "Sorry, kid, you are going to be thicker than a yard of lard, but the
good news is, that's not going to matter."

And she had a stomach made of iron, too. Angua found herself wondering how
many hopeful men had died trying to drink her under the table. Alcohol 
didn't seem to go to her brain at all. Maybe it couldn't find it.

"That? Oh, it's the jerk syndrome." Angua remembered who she was talking to,
and added: "Er... dwarfs probably don't have that. It means... sometimes a
woman is so beautiful that any man with half a brain isn't going to /think/ 
of asking her out, okay? Because it's /obvious/ that she's far too grand
for the likes of him. Are you with me?"

"I think so."

"Well, that's Tawneee. And, for the purposes of this explanation, Nobby has 
not got half a brain. He's so used to women saying no when he asks them out
that he's not afraid of being blown off. So he asks her, because he figures,
why not? And /she/, who by now thinks there's something wrong with her, is so
grateful she says okay."

"Damn, I lost track. Will it affect us down here?"

Bashfullsson coughed politely. "I don't think so, Commander. This area is too 
dangerous to fight in."

"Well, yes, I can see it would be terrible if anyone got hurt," said Vimes,
climbing over a long heap of rotting timber. "That would spoil the day for
everyone."
