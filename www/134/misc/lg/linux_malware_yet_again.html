This is not flame bait.  Just an observation.  As many of you know, I am a
regular here.  I try to help as many posters as I can.  Though I am not a
guru, I do have some knowledge and often get a "Thanks very much" from OPs. 
I've been using Linux since 1999 for 99.5% of my computer needs, and
have finally made the transition to 100% after I got my scanner working. 
Though it did work for a while, the change to the 2.6.x kernel broke
something needed for my scanner to work.  So I kept a copy of W2K around
just for the occasional image scan.
</p>

<p>
One of the programs I found while still a Windows user was a virus scanner
from Trend Micro called PCcillin.  Probably the best virus scanner for
Windows users available.  I say that because I had tried a few others and
then, when I tried PCcillin it found several viruses the others had missed. 
Take it from someone who had actually had a hacker break into my box and
physically fry my hard drive...this was a lesson well learned.  Since the
time I switched to Linux, I still have friends who use Windows.  And I
always recommend that if they are going to continue using Windows that they
should buy PCcillin...  I don't recommend using Windows, but if they must,
at least they should get the best protection possible.  I've convinced
several people of the wisdom of using this anti-virus software and all have
thanked me several times over.  All have been saved by this program...
</p>

<p>
So, going back to my original question in the title of this article, how do
we know when we're there?  I have several anti-virus and anti-spam
applications that are all free as in cost and free as in freedom installed. 
Also, a couple of rootkit detectors as well as port scan detectors, etc...
So I think I'm pretty safe.  Never have had any problems since I switched OS. 
But I'm sure the day will come when some clever hacker will (finally)
produce a Linux virus... Mark my word, the day will come!  But, as I said,
I'm ready, as I'm sure most Linux users are.  I just wanted to point out
the fact that my favorite Windows anti-virus company has realized that the
Linux users are a substantial market force.  And, after all the wait, there
free as in cost, online virus detection service is available for Linux!
It's called 'House Call' and it works.... Free... Just like in Windows... 
You'll need to use Firefox or, well I forget the other Linux browser that
works, but it does work.
</p>

<p>
I'm NOT saying anyone should spend there money on this product.. Just
pointing out that there is one more commercial company to recognize the
Linux community and offer their services/products.  In the meantime, I'll
just keep using the other free products available to Linux users.  F-Prot
is free for personal use.  Of course ClamAV (with KlamAV front end) is a
must.  Spam Assasin, Bogofilter, etc... are all great programs that I
highly recommend.
</p>

<p>
So I guess I'm just happy to see one of my 'old favorites' from my earlier
days come to my now only OS of choice... My choice for Freedom... Linux.. 
The future, the present, the only OS for me.   Gnu/Linux.  For the rest of
us.
</p>

<p>
P.S.  We ARE there....  (they're not !!)    <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
</p>

<p>
P.S.  Sorry for the rant but after reading so much garbage from the trolls
we need balance and truth.  We try to be fair and balanced... Not like the
Fox Network....   LOL

While downloading the (non-free) Windows version of F-Prot for a client
(who had, all told, 883 virus/trojan/malware infect files on his computer
and no it didn't exactly operate), I noticed in their features listing
they claimed that F-Prot detected and disinfected 603 Unix/Linux
viruses.  From everything I read, there aren't nearly that many in the
wild (something closer to zero, if I recall correctly).  So, is this
just creative advertising, or have I been blithely ignorant?

I noticed searching for an online virus checker for Windows that RAV
antivirus states that they no longer have an online presence or operation
since 2003.  It that the guy who made viruses that only his product
detected or was the first product to detect?  I remember someone got
caught creating viruses especially for his anti-virus product, and now
is a guest at some correctional institute and will not have to pay for
lunches (and coffee is free too) for the next 8 years or so.

Michael, there have been Linux viruses for a decade.  I have a list of
about 50 or so of them on my Linux virus 'rant' page:
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/~rick/faq/index.php?page=virus">http://linuxmafia.com/~rick/faq/index.php?page=virus</a> 
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Mark my word, the day will come !!
</pre>

<p>
OK, let's say I e-mail you a copy of a Linux ELF executable for i386
infected with 'Bliss', the classic ELF-infector virus, written in
September 1996.  I send an accompanying message saying 'Hey, Michael,
run this cool screensaver!'
</p>

<p>
Let's say you're really trusting, today, and don't ask yourself if it
doesn't seem a bit strange to be installing binary software from
strangers, when all of your other SUSE software was installed off your
OS installation media, and it seems to have lots and lots of good
screensavers.
</p>

<p>
You double-click on the little 'attachment' icon.  Nothing particularly
happens, except maybe you get the opportuntity to save the attachment to
your ~/Desktop directory.  You investigate, and find that -- aha!  The
"executable" bit got stripped.  (This is a fairly automatic consequence
of how the umask gets applied on received files, if you're curious.
What I mean is:  Even <em>incompetent</em> authors of e-mail programs would
have to work hard to overcome that.[1])
</p>

<p>
You consider flipping on the 'executable' bit on the received file.
At this point, a warning bell <em>should</em> be trying to get your attention
in the back of your mind:  You're plainly 'fighting' the system to make
a task happen.  Maybe there's a good reason why that bit was stripped?
(At a minimum, you've had an extra opportunity to think about what
you're doing.)
</p>

<p>
You overcome your doubts, and turn on the executable bit.  Then, you use
Konqueror, Nautilus, or some file browser (or just type
'./screensavername' in a terminal).  The decoy program (screensaver)
starts; so does the Bliss code.
</p>

<p>
Bliss looks around for other Linux ELF executables it can infect (to
which you have write privilege).  Case 1:  Rats!  It doesn't find 
any, because unprivileged users like yourself are by intention not given
the ability to overwrite or otherwise modify installed system files
(executables or other).  Those live in places like /usr/bin, /bin,
/usr/X11R6/bin, and so on -- and you can't touch them as a regular
user.  Bliss gives up, and mopes.
</p>

<p>
Case 2:  Yay!  Bliss finds a few small user-compiled programs that
you've seen fit to build yourself in /home/michael/bin .  It Blissifies 
the ELF binaries therein.  Mwuhahaha!  But that gives it no access
whatsoever to anything else, and all you've really done is shot yourself 
in the foot -- a flesh wound, at most.  Bliss has done nothing at all
to your system as a whole, which is entirely intact.
</p>

<p>
Of course, I <em>could</em> have e-mailed you the additional instruction,
'Oh, by the way, Michael, you'll want to do "su -" before running this
cool screensaver, so it can install itself.'  At that point, dude, 
even Linux is at the mercy of someone who (figuratively) honours the 
serial-killer's request that you unlock your deadbolts, open the door to
him, and toss out your weapons.
</p>


<p>
If you want something to worry about, be concerned about buggy
Internet-client apps that can be attacked by deliberately malformed
data, or buggy network daemons left running and not upgraded to fixed
versions, or passwords stolen elsewhere on compromised shared servers
(e.g., at universities).
</p>

<p>
But all but the latter can be addressed by proper use of YOU[2] and 
alternatives.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I'm ready, as I'm sure most Linux users are.
</pre>

<p>
I have good news:  You can lose the anti-viral software and rootkit
detectors.[3]  Or, better yet, install a good file-based intrusion
detection system (IDS), and call it 'anti-viral software'.
</p>

<p>
[1] The malware author, for this reason, might want to mail around 
his wares encapsulated in Zip or tar.gz archives, as those can preserve
the contents' original metadata across e-mail transmission.
</p>

<p>
[2] YaST Online Updater, one of SUSE's package delivery mechanisms.
</p>

<p>
[3] Anyone who relies on 'rootkit detectors' such as chkrootkit and
rkhunter as anything but at tertiary, afterthought measure is already
in trouble.  Their basic design of looking for characteristic filenames
and binary signatures of intruder-hiding software observed in the past
is like detecting burglers by the colognes they're known to favour:  The
tactic suffers from false positives, false negatives, and ignores
more-promising places to prevent and detect intrusion.
</p>

<p>
As to 'port scan detectors', for Heaven's sake, don't bother.  Port
scanning, figuratively speaking, is twisting of your system's doorknob.
Concentrate on keeping the windows and doors locked, instead, and not
leaving the family silverware on the front porch.

Michael --
</p>

<p>
What Rick is saying is true, the lengths we have to go to to run a virus on
our system, and that if we do that then we are much more of a risk than
any virus would be.
</p>

<p>
Then what Darrell says is also true, I think we all know by now that there
is a bit of creative advertising going on in the anti-virus world.
</p>

<p>
There is still the problem that, as with many MS-Win viruses that needed
users to take an action, there will be more and more Linux users coming
into the fold who will be willing to go through the instructions to run the
attachment in their e-mail.
</p>

<p>
I know we could walk away and say 'You're free to be a plonker if that's
what you want to be'.  But the trouble is that such people are still
holding back computing, in the same way MS and its viruses have held
back computing.  They are likely to be still open to be spam relays,
spies (no better tool than a Linux box for packet sniffing), etc.
Anyone who communicates with them is also at some degree of risk due to
the actions of the stupid or the gullible. It is very tempting to say
that we have to force a level of security onto users; maybe we take care
of the gullible with the level of security out of the box in most Linux
distros, but how can we deal with the stupid or the rebel?
</p>

<p>
Plus the other risk which is 'Kewl gimmicky software' with a secret little
payload that won't do anything until 2010.  Of cause, if it is open source
there is the chance of the payload being spotted, except of course that the
payload doesn't have to be present at all until it is needed, as with some
MS viruses.  Which is why I believe Linux must steer clear of self-updating
software. 
</p>

<p>
The real next step security then isn't really anti-virus for Linux, because
that isn't where our problems will come from.  Our next step is for us all
to properly embrace one of the application-caging systems, AppArmor or
SELinux.  Both are very well implemented, and it is very likely that the
current implementation is only a first step.  It has a way to go before it
gives the same level as seperation as in a mainframe/UNIX, but I firmly
believe that it will be necessary to take it closer to that. 
</p>

<p>
At the moment, they are using application caging, and allowing Linux's natural
user security to seperate users and data.  I think in time this will have to
go further, I know it will also cause a few frustrations 'The document I
want is in another branch', but the primary goal must be that we and
anyone who communicates with us become as safe as it is possible to be,
without the need to lose any functionality.
</p>

<p>
Had they tried to leap that far in these first implementations then many
would have simply not bothered with SELinux or AppArmor, so I for one am
really pleased with the implementation and default settings of both, I
think it is much more likely that people will keep it onboard this way.
</p>

<p>
Perspective helps, here:  Any user willing to go through a complicated
series of dumb moves to shoot his/her personal files in the foot using
malware, just because a piece of e-mail tells him/her to, <em>already</em> had
a much bigger problem:  The user could wreak much greater havoc on
those same personal files <em>without</em> malware.
</p>

<p>
That is, users already have an endless variety of ways to delete or
corrupt their own files.  The only remedy is for them to learn to not 
do that (just as the best way to learn why you need tested-good recent
backups is to experience their absence).
</p>

<p>
Dealing with received malware by 'learning to not do that' is part of
that same picture, but very small by comparison.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; ...how can we deal with the stupid or the rebel?

<p>
Papa Darwin is a pretty good (if somewhat violent) teacher.  ;-&gt;
</p>


<pre>

</pre>

<p>
Agreed.  I'd also <em>really</em> like distros to install with AIDE or
equivalent (<a href="http://www.cotse.com/tools/ids.htm">http://www.cotse.com/tools/ids.htm</a>) properly configured 
and running.  File-based IDSes are second only to backups in the
category of 'I know I should be running that, but haven't gotten around
to it.'
</p>

<p>
(No, 'rpm -qa' does not qualify, on many grounds including not aspiring 
to check configuration files and not even trying to deal with non-moron
intruders who replace the stored checksums in the BerkeleyDB files.)

We are still getting news and newspaper reports of people falling for
the 'Give us your bank details' scams.
</p>

<p>
Those same people are likely to go through a series of instructions if
they are told to do so my an official looking e-mail.
</p>

<p>
I have tried over the years to understand those people that fall for 
the scams. But I don't understand them at all, unless it is to say that 
Dr Who is absolutely right, we are still just monkeys.
