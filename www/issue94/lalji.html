<H2>Abstract:</H2>

<P>This article is focused towards Linux newbies providing them with a basic
understanding of /etc sub-directory.</P>


<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>Newcomers to Linux, especially those coming from the Windows background,
often find files in the /etc directory difficult to understand.  In this
article I will give a brief explanation of some of these files and their use.
But, before we dive into the /etc directory I would like to point out that
changes to some of these files can render your system unstable or in some
circumstances  unbootable.  I cannot emphasize this enough that you should make a
backup of the file(s) before making any changes. </P>


<H2>Lets Dive In....</H2>

<b>/etc/exports</b>

<P>This file contains the partition configuration to load NFS (Network File Systems).
It tells how partitions are mounted and shared with other Linux/UNIX systems.</P>


<b>/etc/ftpusers</b>

<P>This file contains login names of users who are not allowed to login via FTP.
It is recommended to add user root in this file for security.</P>


<b>/etc/fstab</b>

<P>This file automatically mounts filesystems which are spread accross multiple
drives or seperate partitions.  This file is checked when the system boots and
filesystems mounted.</P>


<b>/etc/hosts.[allow, deny]</b>

<P>You can control access to your network by using these files.  You can add hosts
to hosts.allow file to which you want to grant access to your network or add
hosts to hosts.deny to which you dont.</P>


<b>/etc/inetd.conf or /etc/xinetd.conf</b>

<P>The inetd file can be called the father of networking services.  This file is
responsible for starting services like FTP, TELNET etc.  Some Linux distributions
come with xinetd.conf which stands for Extended Internet Services Daemon, which
provides all the functionnalities and capabilities of inetd but extends them
further.</P>

<P>It is advisable to comment services which you do not use.</P>

<b>/etc/inittab</b>

<P>This file describes what takes place or which processes are started at bootup or
at different runlevels.  Runlevel is defined as a state in which the Linux box is
currently in.  Linux has 7 runlevels from 0-6.</P>


<b>/etc/motd</b>

<P>This file which stands for "message of the day" is executed and its contents
displayed after a successful login.</P>


<b>/etc/passwd</b>

<P>This file contains user information.  Whenever a new user is added, an entry is
added to this file containing the loginname, password etc.  This file is readable
by everyone on the system. If the password field contains "x" than encrypted
passwords are stored in /etc/shadow file which is only accessible by user root.</P>


<b>/etc/profile</b>

<P>When a user logs in a number of configuration files are executed, including
/etc/profile.  This file contains settings and global startup information for
bash shell.</P>


<b>/etc/services</b>

<P>This file works in conjunction with /etc/inetd.conf or /etc/xinetd.conf files
(see above).  This file determines which port a service mentioned in inetd.conf
is to use, for eg. FTP/21, TELNET/23 etc.</P>


<b>/etc/securetty</b>

<P>This file lists ttys from which root is allowed to login.  For security reasons
it is recommended to keep just tty1 for root login.</P>


<b>/etc/shells</b>

<P>This file contains names of all shells installed in the system with their full
path names.</P>


<H2>In the end....</H2>

<P>I hope you enjoyed this article and hope it helped in understanding the /etc
directory.  You might find other subdirectories beneath the /etc directory which
are application specific for eg. /etc/httpd, /etc/sendmail are
for apache and sendmail respectively.</P>
