Hi gang,
</p>

<p>
I've just read Don's article and think there is a sshd_config option 
omitted. Surely in section 9 one needs
</p>

<p>
  PasswordAuthentication no
</p>

<p>
as well? Enabling PubkeyAuthentication just adds an extra way of logining 
in.
</p>

<p>
cheers
Jim

That sounds exactly right, according to how the article describes it
working. In fact, many sysadmins turn password-based authentication off
in their initial setup these days; given the power of the average
computer these days, passwords are just not that great of a security
measure anymore.

Amazing. It seems that there are over 16k hits on Google for that
non-word. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

[grin] I've written some... amazing, on re-reading... <strong>stuff</strong> over the
years that I couldn't possibly have thought if my brain was actually
awake and present - so I always take this kind of mistakes in that
spirit. In fact, I slip far too easily into free word association; this
makes driving down the street and passing a large number of shop signs a
highly amusing experience, but it's not so much fun if I let my mind
drift for even a moment while I'm writing.

You can always be grateful that it wasn't worse, though (viz., Allen

<p>
Hate to tell you, Chris, but - no. I meant "shop signs" - like "Dollar
General", which my mind quickly turns into "Dirty Genitals". It's
amazing what a bit of Spoonerism, sound-alike matching, letter-swapping,
or one-off substitution can produce.
</p>

<p>
(Some signs don't even need an active imagination or a visual filter;
some time ago, I saw a shop called 'Hatem shoes'. Really. Kinda annoying
that they took away the opportunity to <em>make</em> it funny. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
What sort of thing would you imagine that I'd see in <em>stop</em> signs? That
would be really odd.

Nah. Hate stop signs, actually; I sit there and wait, and wait, and
wait, and the damn things never change to "Go". I always end up sneaking
past'em... <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
