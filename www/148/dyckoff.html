<h3>
SD West Conference
</h3>

<p>
Now run by the Dr. Dobb's arm of CMP Media, the annual West Coast version of
the Software Development Conference has emerged as a leading venue for the
discussion of Agile Methods in IT and software development and is also
becoming a developer-oriented resource for security. See
<a href="www.sdexpo.com/2007/west/">www.sdexpo.com/2007/west/</a>
</p>

<p>
SD West 2007 Searchable Conference Program is here:
<a href="https://www.cmpevents.com/SDw7/a.asp?option=C">https://www.cmpevents.com/SDw7/a.asp?option=C</a>
</p>

<p>
First, you didn't need a full conference pass to enjoy many of the sessions
and events at SD West. Many vendors - including Adobe, Amazon, Intel, and
Sun - hosted free technical sessions in separate rooms during the expo days
and many were worth driving down to the Expo without the promise of free
beer at an Expo party. The Intel presentation, "Performance Tuning for
Multi-Core Processors", focused on Threading Building Blocks, a new library
that enables use of task patterns instead of threads by mapping logical
tasks into physical threads.
</p> 

<p>
Here's a list of the free tech sessions for SD West 2008:
<a href="http://sdexpo.com/2008/west/tech_sessions.htm">http://sdexpo.com/2008/west/tech_sessions.htm</a>
</p> 

<p>
Social and networking activities abounded. There were the 2007 Jolt Awards
and the Dr. Dobb's Awards for excellence in programming. SD West has a
history of great match-ups with its Developer Bowl quiz-show in which teams
from the top technology companies are tested on their knowledge of
the history, technology, and traditions of software development. 
</p>

<p>
There is also the usual party with food and libations for the opening of
the Expo. This past year, the fine Expo event transitioned into a later
party hosted by Google. However, Google booked the space rather late and
had only one third of a main ballroom. The lines were long and the food
scant because of other demands at the hotel. It was a near disaster for
Google and left several developers grumbling, since Google is legendary for
the fine food and snacks at its campuses.
</p> 


<p>
This is a mid-sized conference and notably smaller than it was in the go-go
1990's. But it gets A-level presenters and has a wide range of tracks. That
can make it a little hard to target the best sessions because interesting
sessions in C++ or Java or Ruby or Security may be happening at the same
time. The conference CD has many of the sessions, but never all of the ones
you might consider and the hottest topics are the ones least likely to have
presentations submitted early enough for the conference CD. This is why I
prefer getting a jump drive with most sessions on it and having locations
to update the jump drive as presentations become available - this is what
you get at EclipseCon.
</p>

<p>
This is also a pricey conference, with early-bird rates from the $1695 and
$1895 (conf and tutorials) to the $2395 conference and tutorials rate at
the door. All conference registration includes a one-year subscription to
Dr. Dobb's Journal. There is also the $95 'SD On Demand' add-on that
provides access to conference session audio and PowerPoint (a so-called
$595 value) for 365 days after the event. There are good sessions, but not
all of them are on the conference CD or in the post-conference archive.
</p> 

<p>
Speaking of good sessions, the folks from SPI Dynamics usually give a good
security presentation and Dennis Hurst did not disappoint on the last day
of SD West. His presentation, "The Hackers Goldmine: Methodologies and
Automation for Gaining Access to Confidential Information Through Defects
in Web Applications" had a long title but was succinct in reviewing the
spectrum of Web app deficiencies, especially emerging threats. Topics
covered included SQL injection, cross-site scripting, parameter
manipulation, and session hijacking.
</p>

<p>
The presentation was given at the last hour of the conference on the last
day but was heavily attended, showing the growing importance of securing
Web applications. You can view the entire presentation here:
<a href="http://portal.spidynamics.com/blogs/dennis//attaqchemenets/27960.aspx">http://portal.spidynamics.com/blogs/dennis//attaqchemenets/27960.aspx</a>
</p>

<p>
Geof Hoglund presented "Exploiting Online Games". His thesis was that games
represent a showcase of cutting-edge tech and also have the financial
motivation to bring out the best and worst in skillful programmers. He
discussed memory cloaking, hyper-spacing threads, shadow branching and
kernel-to-user code injection. This was very scary stuff and he repeatedly
suggested that advanced techniques used to subvert multi-player games would
find its way into the exploits of tomorrow. (This idea came up again at IT
SEC World, reviewed below.)
</p>

<p>
I was disappointed to discover that these presentations and a few others I
was interested in did not make it into the archive for SDWest 2007 even
after months of waiting. Fortunately, some authors post their presentations
to public Web sites afterwards, sometimes to guarantee they are not locked
away.
</p>

<p>
And that offers a segue of sorts to a review of security-themed conferences.
</p>


<h3>
IT Security World 2007
</h3>


<p>
MIS Training Institute (MISTI) offers audit and information security
services and training and puts on conferences and symposia for the
information security industry.
</p> 

<p>
Currently, MISTI puts on the CIO Summit, the CSO Forum, InfoSec World, and
IT Sec World, along with 10 other venues. The sessions are mainly focused
on security, auditing and governance and regulatory issues. IT Sec World is
an annual conference aimed at IT security professionals.
</p>

<p>
The two AM keynotes at IT SEC
were stimulating and informative. These were the kickoff
keynote with Peter Coffee, former Technology Editor at eWeek, now with
Salesforce.com, "A Truly World Wide Web: Security on the
Inter(national)net", and the second morning keynote with Gary McGraw, Chief
Technology Officer at Cigital, and a co-author of the recent book on the
subject, <title>Exploiting Online Games</title>.
</p>

<p>
Coffee's main point was that we live connected to a global Internet, and the
threat profile is now also global. He noted that Chinese is second most used
language on the net and its use is growing fast.
</p>

<p>
Consequently, Coffee emphasized that the real payoff for IPv6 was not
address range, it was IPSec and source authentication as part of network
forensics. Coffee also focused on the explosion of personal data and
storage: "<em>there's way too much storage, making it as easy to lose a major
database as losing a stick of gum....</em>" He also noted that 1GB jump drives
are now given out as trade show swag and a lot of these are lost,
misplaced, or stolen.
</p>

<p>
In summary, Coffee thinks there is too much data on too many devices with
way too much access from anywhere. Coffee looks to Identity Management and
forensics in depth to counter the efforts of hackers and crackers.
</p>


<p>
There were several excellent presentations on the technical side,
particularly if you skipped most of the case studies. There were also
industry-specific tracks (Healthcare, Banking, etc.) which may or may not
have been everyone's cup of tea.
</p> 

<p>
I found "Top 10 Web Attacks" by Jeremiah Grossman interesting and up to
date on current exploits. It was Grossman who made the suggestion to
segregate and compartmentalize Web browser use as a major defense against
zero-day attacks - and I want to widely encourage this. Simply put, do
casual browsing with one browser and do financials with a different one
(and employment work with a third perhaps) to minimize the risk for malware
vulnerabilities. It's a kind of a free firewall at the application level.
</p>

<p>
DNS SEC was a technical topic presented by Steve Pinkham and David Rhodes,
both of Maven Security. An updated version of the presentation (for SD West
2008) is now posted in the resources section of the Maven Security Web
site. There are also several other excellent presentations on security
tools, wireless hacking, and Web application security, so
please visit
<a href="http://www.mavensecurity.com/presentations">http://www.mavensecurity.com/presentations</a>.
</p>

<p>
IT SEC World 2007 had a modest Expo with under 50 vendors, many of them
leaders in their vertical niche. Most contributed to the end of conference
drawing so over 30 items were given away to a crowd of under 300 (at least
half of the attendees had already left for local offices or the SFO airport.)
</p>

<p>
The next MISTI IT Security World 2008 Conference Expo will be held on
September 15-17, 2008, at the San Francisco Marriott, near the Moscone
Convention Center. Last year, this conference was at the famous Fairmont
hotel, a breathless walk up to the top of Nob Hill. The new venue is more
accessible and much faster to get to.
</p>

<p>
Next time, we'll take up Digital IDs and the Identity Management (IdM) universe.
