Hi all,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I like to add a reminder software with my system. I have tested
<EM>calendar</EM> and am not satisfied with it. now I have very sophisticated
reminder tool called <EM>remind</EM> . its <EM>tkremind</EM> front end adds special
weight to <EM>remind</EM> by making configuration as easy as <EM>Kalarm</EM> of <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A>.
I am looking for a tool which can make the message (from remind) appear
on my desktop. could any one give any idea ?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Thomas] 
Assuming remind uses some transient form to store the reminder
somewhere, then you can use 'osd_cat' or some other utility to have it
"display" on the screen.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
I have found another tool called <EM>xmessage</EM> -

</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>xmessage -file  &lt;filename&gt;

<P><STRONG>
so you have to write your
message in a file (ascii) first.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Thomas] 
You don't even need to do that.  xmessage can read from STDIN as well.

<P><STRONG>
Hi there,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I'm wondering if it's wise to allow a remote user within
the LAN to log in as root, by adding that user's public key
to root's "authorized_keys" for that machine.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Kapil] 
There is an "sudo"-like mechanism within SSH for doing this. In the
authorized_keys file you put a "command=...." entry which ensures
that this key can only be used to run that specific command.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
All the usual warnings a la "sudo" apply regarding what commands
should be allowed. It is generally a good idea to also prevent
the agent forwarding, X11 forwarding and pty allocation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Here is an entry that I use for "rsync" access. (I have wrapped the
line and AAAA.... is the ssh key which has been truncated).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>from="172.16.1.28",command="rsync -aCz --server --sender . .",
no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-pty
ssh-dss AAAA..... rsyncuser
</pre></blockquote>
<P><STRONG>
I'm writing some scripts to back up data on our small
business network here. One option is to get each machine to
periodically dump its data on a specific machine using NFS.
The option I'm interested in is to get a designated machine
to remotely login to each machine and transfer the files
over a tar-ssh pipe.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The only reason to be using root access is because some
directories (<TT>/root</TT>, some in <TT>/var/lib</TT>) can only be read by
root. Would changing permissions (e.g. <TT>/var/lib/rpm</TT>) affect
anything, if I chgrp the directories to a "backup"
usergroup?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I'm concerned with one machine, a web server, that will be
included in the backup scheme. All machines here use Class
A private network addresses and are behind a NAT firewall,
but the web server can be accessed from the Internet. Will
allowing root login over ssh on that machine pose a huge
security risk, even by allowing ssh traffic from only the
local network?
</STRONG></P>

		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The problem with the above is that you don't have a file called "foo";
as a result, 'stat "foo"' comes out empty, and the rest of the problem
follows from that. The above was never meant to be a complete script,
simply an example of the algorithm for Suramya (I seem to recall that's
who started the original discussion) to use.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I agree that changing "!=" to "ne" would "fix" the problem - but
it would be the wrong problem. 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> Pointing the script at an existing
file - perhaps by changing 'stat "foo"' to 'stat $ARGV[0]' and
specifying the filename on the commandline - would seem to me to be the
"right" solution. Of course, the rest of the script should be rewritten
to meet real-life conditions as well... but that's beyond the scope of
what we were talking about.

Even with the <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> and <A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</A> graphical windowing interfaces, it's

StarOffice, (ok photshop is a fair dig, we have lots of things like it, but

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In a particularly <EM>ahem</EM> lively discussion at the starport last week, it was
agreed that the problem is that menu interface standardization isn't.  Not
even by Mr.Tanenbaum's broad definitions.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For example RH has been using Gnome for awhile, but has changed the menu
layout in every major revision and some of the minor ones.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
K and Gnome fans alike can't decide whether to keep their menus top or
bottom.  If they were hidden you'd have a flip a coin chance of even knowing
where to look.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To most newbs "click the root menu" may as well be hidden entirely, because
they won't really think that's useful if they have mswin experience (it
pulls up display settings) and if they don't have even that they're just
plain lost.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Much as I didn't find linspire groovy, not to my beat, daddy-O, it serves an

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Outlook Express comes as default with Windows, and it's not a particularly
good email client. Thunderbird is taking that market.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Outlook is another kettle of fish: it isn't about using Outlook, it's about
accessing an Exchange server. The big news back when Novell bought Ximian
was that they open sourced Ximian Connector, so Evolution could access Exchange
servers. I had a look through the code, and... it's a hack, basically.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Outlook and Exchange communicate with an extremely complicated protocol. Ximian
Connector just connects to the Exchange web interface, if it's available, and
basically acts as a screen scraper (not exactly: it works using a modified
version of WebDAV, but it also screen scrapes to get enough data to be useful).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
People who run versions of Exchange that don't have a web interface still have
to stick to Windows. People who don't have to pull to get the web interface set
up are also out of luck.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
On the server end, it's not too bad. There are several open source Exchange
alternatives that have equivalent features. The Outlook Connector Project
(<A HREF="http://openconnector.org"
	>http://openconnector.org</A>) aims to provide an open source set of MAPI DLLs to
be used by open source projects (such as Kolab (<A HREF="http://kolab.org"
	>http://kolab.org</A>) or Open-Xchange
(<A HREF="http://www.openexchange.com"
	>http://www.openexchange.com</A>)), so Outlook can connect to them. Once the server
end has been migrated away from Exchange, it's possible to bring in Linux at the
client end with little disruption.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
There's also work being done towards implementing the actual protocols used between
Exchange and Outlook. Luke Leighton, formerly a Samba developer, has reverse
engineered most (if not all) of the protocol
(<A HREF="http://www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-devel/2005/01/1054.html"
	>http://www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-devel/2005/01/1054.html</A>), and has started
work on both client and server software
(<A HREF="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/oser/exchange5.5"
	>http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/oser/exchange5.5</A>).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The OpenChange (<A HREF="http://openchange.org"
	>http://openchange.org</A>) project is also working (slowly) towards
an Exchange replacement. They seem to be focusing more on reverse engineering
the database format used by Exchange, so there isn't too much overlap (so far).

Got the following feedback on my Jabber install guide. It has some

I've just installed Jabberd 2 server following your Guide
(<A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/112/tomar.html"

experiences which could improve this guide.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Suramya] 
Thanks for taking the time to email me with your feedback. Would you
mind if I share this with the Linux Gazette so that they can publish it
in their next issue. That will help other people who are trying to
install a Jabber server.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
No, of course I don't mind 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)"

</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
1) Since Jabberd 2.0s3 or Jabberd 2.0s4 (the newest one is 2.0s9) the
Libidn library isn't installed automatically with Jabberd, so you
should
write it in your guide, that it must be installed BEFORE running
<TT>./configure</TT> in jabberd directory. It'll save time of people trying to
follow your Guide.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Suramya] 
Ok. I didn't know that. Thats a good thing to keep in mind for future
releases.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
2) It would be easier if you wrote some information on installing
MySQL
libraries, because I had to use --disable-mysql option, as I couldn't
find right libraries (according to some mailing list mysql-client and
mysql-devel libraries) and/or write, that it isn't a must - user can
replace mysql by barkeley in c2s.xml configuration file.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Suramya] 
hmm. I didn't put instructions on how to install mysql because
<A HREF="http://mysql.com"
	>http://mysql.com</A>
had instructions on how to install the mysql libraries. But thats
something to keep in mind for the next version I guess.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Yeah, you can replace MySQL by Berkley DB, but I havn't set it up using
that so I don't know how...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
About MySQL - well, I've asked for it, because I had a lot of trouble
with MySQL. At last I've menaged to install Jabberd 2 with MySQL after
writing last letter to you. I've configured it with options
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/include/mysql LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib/mysql --enable-debug
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
It looks like Jabberd 2 can't find MySQL even if it's installed (I've installed
RPM's from my <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> install CD). So I think it would be a good idea to write
something about CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS options for those, who would have same
problems as I had. It would be also useful, if you put some info on how to create
SSL certificate for server (I've followed those instructions:
<A HREF="http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/2/docs/app_sslkey.html"
	>http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/2/docs/app_sslkey.html</A> to create SSL Certificate
and those: <A HREF="http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/2/docs/section05.html#5_2"
	>http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/2/docs/section05.html#5_2</A> to set up
Jabberd2 to use them).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I think that's all I had to write for now. Thanks for your answer.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
3) Also, it would be a useful suggestion to enable debugging (run
<TT>./configure</TT> --enable-debug), so everyone could see what's going
on, when
something goes wrong.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Suramya] 
Good suggestion. I will definitely add that in the next version.

Some of you will be really sharp-eyed and immediately spot something
eye-popping in the above (especially since I've called your attention to
the possibility) -- but put yourself in my shoes, and imagine that all
you saw, at first, is the single MX record, priority=10, pointing to
genetikayos.com .
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Ah, that makes sense:  Mail to our domain other than mail to our mailing
list subhost gets redirected to T.R.'s machine.  So, I absent-mindedly
carry out the standard next step in diagnosing SMTP problems, which is
to attempt a manual SMTP session using <TT>/usr/bin/telnet</TT> -- and I got a
heck of a big surprise:
</STRONG></P>

Er, what?  That's <em>  my  </em> SMTP banner.  Wait, didn't I just telnet into
_T.R.'s_ SMTP port?
</STRONG></P>

At this point, I gazed a bit higher up, re-read the "dig" output, and
boggled:

Um, OK.  That now gets appended to the Big Book of Things Not to Do with DNS.

<P><STRONG>
Just to double-check:

<pre><strong>[rick@linuxmafia]

genetikayos.com has address 127.0.0.1

There are times when the loopback address is just not your friend.
Writing SMTP-related DNS RRs is one of those times.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I'll probably keep trying to reach T.R. by telephone for a while:
He's likely not very reachable by e-mail at the moment.

(This came up elsewhere. I remember grinding my teeth about it at the
time, so I don't know why I didn't put it in the article.)
</P>
<P>
As well as having 10 different versions[1], RSS has two competing time
formats: RSS 0.91/2.0 use RFC 822 (date -R) format, RSS 1.0 uses
dc:date, which needs W3CDTF (a subset of ISO 8601: date --iso-8601, date
--iso-8601='minutes', date --iso-8601='seconds')
</P>
<P>
Mark Pilgrim has a blog entry that explains a bit of the history behind
this here:
<A HREF="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/06/21/history_of_rss_date_formats"
	>http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/06/21/history_of_rss_date_formats</A>
</P>
<P>
[1] I said 9 in the article, but RSS 3.0 came afterwards (and, IIRC, is
nothing like the other 9 RSS formats)

We'll be heading off to the UK this weekend.  Jim reports that we've been
signed up for internet access at his hotel assignment, so I'll probably be
able to send in a blurb, but hopefully I will have enough things to do that
I won't be lurking in a hotel all that much.

My poor mactop decided to have a fit when I tried to make it dual boot.  One
of the LUG locals is a truly guru macintosh fella though, so he's done his
best to fix it up, and I'll have it back at the installfest.  If it's not up
to speed I'll end up taking terra with me instead... er, as soon as I seal
her up.  those lil bitty screws are kinda necessary after all if you don't
want people gettin' weird because your laptop's falling apart.  To its
credit terra's hibernation works perfectly
