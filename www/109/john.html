<p> This article is dedicated to those who wish to be unconventional. Linux 
supports most of the popular sound cards. Even if you don't have a sound card, 
you can still get sound support (perhaps not all that ear soothing!) from the
Parallel port in your PC. In this article, we will discuss one of the many 
ways to obtain sound output without a sound card.
</p>

<h3>Our Setup</h3>

<p> We are using a 1.6GHZ Pentium 4. The Linux distribution on this box is 
PCQLinux 2004, which is based on Fedora. In the hardware part we have used 
some resistors, a Parallel port connector and wires to interconnect all this 
hardware.

<h3>What is a Sound device driver? </h3>

<p> The sound driver is a character device usually denoted as 
"<tt>/dev/dsp</tt>". All sound applications such as mpg123, Mplayer, etc., 
direct their digital output to this device. The DAC (Digital to Analog 
Converter) used here is the Parallel port. This port is the gadget that 
converts the 1s and 0s that make up the binary numbers into real analog 
time-varying voltage which will be connected to the speakers of our 
Computer.

<h3>Understanding device drivers:</h3>

<p> There are two main types of devices under all Linux systems: character 
and block devices. Character devices are those for which no buffering is 
performed, and block devices are those which are accessed through a cache. 
Block devices must be random access, but character devices are not required
to be, though some are. Filesystems can only be mounted if they are on block 
devices.

<p> The sources for character devices are kept in <tt>drivers/char/</tt>, and 
the sources for block devices are kept in <tt>drivers/block/</tt>. They have 
similar interfaces, and are very much alike, except for reading and writing. 
Because of the difference in reading and writing, initialization is different, 
as block devices have to register a strategy routine, which is registered in 
a different way than the parsp_read and parsp_write routines of a character 
device driver.

<p> Now if you have a .wav file which is of a specific format, say 16-bit, 
stereo, raw pcm, to make it play on the system sound device you might open 
the <tt>/dev/dsp</tt> node using the <code>open()</code> system call, and 
open your .wav file, read a block of data from the .wav file, and write it 
to the <tt>/dev/dsp</tt> node using <code>read()</code> and 
<code>write()</code> system calls respectively.

<p> The ability to unload a module is one of the most useful features of
modularization because it helps cut down development time; you can test
successive versions of your new driver without going through the lengthy
shutdown/reboot cycle each time.

<h3>Playing with the module:</h3>

<p> The compilation of a kernel module is performed by the gcc compiler 
using the make file, which contains:
<pre>
gcc -c &amp;1 -O2 -Wall -DMODULE -D__KERNEL__ -I /usr/src/linux(your kernel version)
</pre>

<p> The output of the compilation is a module which is to be 
inserted into the kernel to produce the sound. Our driver, called 
<tt>parsp.o</tt>, can be loaded into the running kernel using:

<pre>	insmod -f parsp.o</pre> 
<p>and removed from the kernel using:

<pre>	rmmod parsp</pre>
<p> The <tt>install.sh</tt> file contains some magic to redirect all the 
sound applications to our driver. Usually the applications use the 
<tt>/dev/dsp</tt> device, which has a major number 14, to produce the sound 
output. What we are going to do first is delete that special file. Then we 
replace the same file with a major number that is specified in our driver.

<pre>	./install.sh 203</pre>

<p> Note that 203 is the major number specified in our driver - so all the
applications that use <tt>/dev/dsp</tt>, such as mpg123, Mplayer, XMMS,
etc. will now use our driver to produce output.

<p> But we know that we cannot forget our past - so, in order to restore 
our previous state, we would simply run <tt>uninstall.sh</tt>. The 
<tt>uninstall.sh</tt> script restores the previous state by deleting the 
<tt>/dev/dsp</tt> created by the <tt>install.sh</tt> script and recreating the 
original <tt>/dev/dsp</tt> which had the major number 14 and minor number 3.

<pre>	mknod /dev/dsp c 14 3</pre>

<p> Don't forget to reconnect the speaker plug to the output jack of the 
sound card of your system. (We had this experience three or four times and 
wondered why there was no sound from the original soundcard of our system!!)

<h3>Ioctls:</h3>
<p> The <code>ioctl()</code> (short for input/output control) system call 
is used on <tt>/dev/dsp</tt> to talk to the device driver. There are 
recognized conventions in Linux, the most popular of which is the OSS or 
Open Sound System. This is the standard interface implemented in Linux and 
followed by thousands of device drivers on the kernel side.

<p>
The <code>ioctl()</code> implementation was the most tedious thing in this 
project. The list of all ioctls for the soundcard can obtain from 
<tt>souncard.h</tt> or by using the command:

<pre>	man ioctl_list</pre>

<p> We tried our level best to include the ioctls required to play the music 
files through various music players. Of these various music players, 
Mplayer was the most demanding one. Although we can play music using 
Mplayer, support for it is not perfect at the moment.

<h3>Creating Sound through the "Magic Port"</h3>

<p> The Standard Parallel Port of your system is a 25 pin port. The signals 
available at the parallel port are 0v, which represents logical 0, and +5v,
which represents logical 1. This port is the simplest port in your system 
by which you can control a large number of devices.

<p> Although the parallel port contains 25 pins, we'll focus our attention
mainly on the 8 data out pins (pin numbers 2-9) and a ground pin (any pin
from 18-25) that we'll use for our purpose.

<p> The usual way of using the parallel port is by using the good old
<code>outb()</code> instruction. In our driver, the bytes are written to
the parallel port using 

<pre>outb(b, 0x378);</pre>

<p>So don't go anywhere, just sit in front of the computer and play
something nice with the parallel port of your computer. But don't blame us
if you end up frying up your computer - just be sensible and things will go
smoothly...

<h3>Dive into Code:</h3>

<p> We have explained earlier, the bit 1 is represented by 5v and bit 0 is
represented by 0v at the parallel port. The magic performed to create these
intermediate voltage levels is done by the resistor circuitry connected to
the parallel port output. These varying voltage levels in turn generate the
audible output when connected to the input of your speaker system. When we
experimented with the circuit using the code given below with the help of a
multimeter, we got the following results: 

<p>(Text Version: <a href="misc/john/test.c.txt">test.c.txt</a>)

<pre> 
#include&lt;asm/io.h&gt;
main()
{ 
	iopl(3);
	int b; 
	printf("Enter the value of b:\n");
	scanf("%d",&amp;b);
	outb(b,0x378);
} 
</pre>

<p>Don't forget to compile it using the optimization option, i.e. 
<pre> cc filename.c -O2</pre> 

<pre>
 For b=0       Output voltage = 0v
 For b=255     Ourput voltage = 3.8v
 For b=240     Output voltage = 2.1v
</pre>

<p> The values are obtained across the ground of the port and output of 
the resistor circuit (1 and 2 connected together). This may vary from 
system to system, so don't worry if you don't get those exact values. Quality 
of the output can be increased by using other complex circuits such as
amplifiers and filters. We are not going to explain that here as it will
increase the cost of the hardware.

<p> The code that performs the core function is present in the 
<code>pcsp_write()</code>.

<pre>
	count= (count &lt; 44100 ? count : 44100);
	if(copy_from_user((void *)data_buffer,buf,count)) 
		return -EFAULT;
	canplay =1;
 	for(v=0;v&lt;count;v++)    //loops till the end of the buffer
 		{		
		b=buf[v];
		outb(b,0x378);     // Writes those bytes to the parallel port
		for(i=0;i&lt;loop;i++);   //loops to adjust the speed of playback
		}
</pre>

<p> At first, a music player such as mpg123 opens the <tt>/dev/dsp</tt>
device via <code>pcsp_open()</code> and gathers information on its
characteristics (i.e., buffer size, mono or stereo, number of channels,
etc.) using <code>parsp_ioctl()</code>. After that, it writes
manageable-sized chunks of information into the buffer of the device
driver. The bytes in the buffer are then transferred to the parallel port:

<pre>	outb(b, 0x378);</pre>

<p> The next loop is significant, since it controls the playback speed. 

<pre>	for(i=0;i&lt;loop;i++);</pre>

<p> This value of this loop must be changed to suit the processor speed of
each system. This process continues until the end of the music file. At that
point the count becomes zero and the music player software closes the
device by calling <code>parsp_close()</code>.

<p> In the <code>init_module()</code> section, we initialize the variables 
used in the code. The module is registered by:
<pre>
	major=register_chrdev(major,name,&amp;parsp_fops); 
</pre>
<p> The memory for the buffer used in the driver is allocated by:

<pre>	data_buffer= (long) kmalloc(44100, GFP_KERNEL);</pre>
<p>In <code>cleanup_module()</code>, the allocated memory for the driver 
is freed by:

<pre>	kfree((void *) data_buffer);</pre>
<p>The module is removed from the kernel by:

<pre>unregister_chrdev(major,name);</pre>

<h3>Circuit Diagrams:</h3> 
<p> The connection to the speaker plug is as shown in the figure. The 
resistors used here are 1k ohm, 1/4 watt resistors. (If these exact values
are not available, try something that's reasonably close; the values are
not critical).

<h3>Have some fun :-)</h3> 

<p> After all this painful and time consuming assembly of our device, 
let's enjoy the fruit that our hard work has brought us. The Linux way 
of testing the device driver is by using the 'cat' command:
<pre>cat ding.wav &gt; /dev/dsp</pre>

<p> Do you hear something? Yeah... You will... Now, let us go to the next 
level. We will try to play a mp3 file by using mpg123

<pre>mpg123 dingdong.mp3</pre>

<p> and enjoy that heavenly music! Try some other players such as Mplayer, 
XMMS, etc.

<h3>More and more...</h3>

<p> Our adventures with the parallel port will not stop here. A brave new 
idea is to create and control a mini-fountain right in the living room 
which will dance with the music played on the computer!

<p> Please let us know your crazy ideas using the parallel port.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p> We have tried to present a few things about using the parallel port of
your PC in an interesting way; this module is software that makes good use
of it. Be warned, though -- you may get addicted to the "digital noise"
produced by this software.

<p> We will be grateful to readers who point out errors/inconsistencies, if 
any. We look forward to hearing from you soon!
