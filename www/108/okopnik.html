<h1>Laptop review: Averatec 5400 series</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/okopnik.html">Ben Okopnik</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3>Peripatetic Contemplations on the State of Mobile Computing
<em>(a.k.a., How I Shop for Hardware)</em></h3>

<p> I've been looking for a laptop lately. Not just any laptop, but a
backup to my main, do-everything desktop-replacement machine (an Acer
2003WLMi, currently being replaced by Acer with a newer model due to being
a lemon) - which is also a laptop. The larger agenda here, however, is to
also find something to replace the Acer:  The machine itself, though
difficult to configure, works fine with Linux, but the company's tech
support/customer service has been consistently horrible and arrogant to
such a degree that I, with more than 20 years of experience in the computer
business, cannot recall anything equally appalling. So, in actuality, I'm
shopping for two laptops - and what makes the process quite pleasant is
that there's very little time pressure involved.

<p> In my shopping and comparison process, I found a number of Linux
laptop-related sites - all of which list a multitude of machines and the
configuration directions for them. What I found lacking on all of them were
<em>qualified opinions</em>, otherwise known as <strong>reviews</strong>.
Honestly, now - I don't expect a rant (<em>"this thing sucks The Rock of
Gibraltar through a mile of garden hose, and I would torture my worst enemy
by buying him one!"</em>) or an encomium to please the ears of the gods
(<em>"Now shall I sing of a Laptop, Great and Powerful, the sort that is
scarce to be found in the Earth but one which Vulcan himself would proudly
claim as his masterpiece..."</em>) - but basic statements like...

<ul type="circle">
<li> "easy, automatic Fedora installation plus Linux drivers on OEM's website - everything just worked!"
<li> "advanced Linuxers should have no problem with this machine, but newbies may have a difficult time." 
<li> "lots of proprietary hardware; Linux drivers do not exist and won't
unless the vendor changes his mind. Not recommended."
</ul>

...would go a long way toward helping people choose.  I plan to rectify this
with both explicit opinions - and <strong>boy</strong>, have I got a lot of
those! - and a 1-to-10 scale at the end of each of these articles, in the
hope of addressing this problem.

<p> As to my qualifications to do this kind of testing - after wearing out
a number of laptops over the years, I consider myself to be somewhat of a
connoisseur of the breed. Add to this the fact that I've been working on
computer hardware and software since the Elder Days, have a strong
preference for Linux, and possess a lifelong passion for finding out Who,
What, Where, When, Why, and How (and know the methods necessary to get
those answers), and you've got somebody who knows enough to ask the
persnickety questions that the manufacturers don't want asked - and has no
problem asking them. Given all of the above, this is definitely something I
can have fun doing.  Also, living aboard a sailboat as I do - particularly
one not attached to a dock with all those conveniences like shore power and
cable connections but swinging free at anchor, where I have to "make my
own" or do without - I ask quite a lot of my computer equipment; therefore,
I consider this to be an excellent test environment.

<p> <strong>Note:</strong> in this testing, I'm restricting myself to
brands that a) can be bought off the shelf in US stores, and b) have a
no-cost return policy. This rules out Dell, Gateway, and others of their
ilk (I may reconsider after checking their return policies a bit more
carefully, but for the moment, they're out - I'm not up for shipping
hassles.) However, this should still leave plenty to work with - and I plan
to keep hunting until I find something that satisfies me, both in terms of
the quality of the unit itself as well as its ease of configuration and (to
some degree) support under Linux.

<p>Dear readers, I invite your comments and recommendations. If you've got
a laptop that you use with Linux and have found to be easily configurable,
or know of one that fits the above restrictions and you think might be a
good one, please feel free to contact me with your experiences and
suggestions at <img src="../gx/authors/email/okopnik.png">.

<p> Now, let's dive into this first review...

</ul>

<h3>First impressions</h3>

When I first looked at this laptop in the store, my immediate take on it
was "simple but solid". This closely matched my idea of a backup laptop,
and given the price - quite good for the included hardware and the visible
quality of fit and finish - this machine seemed to be just what I was
looking for. I inquired about Walmart's return policy (15 days, no
restocking or other charges), had them open the box and hit the "on" button
to make sure I wasn't picking up a dead machine, plunked down my credit
card, and took the box home.

<p> One of the pleasant touches with this machine is that Averatec has
included a nice sturdy laptop carrying bag - not the fanciest thing in the
world, but quite adequate and then some. Conversely, the power supply is
large and heavy - and, as I found out a little later, runs quite hot. Some
laptop buyers may also find themselves at a loss when looking in the box:
laptop, bag, two CDs (Wind0ws XP and Averatec's recovery disc), and the power
supply is <strong>all</strong> they'll find. Oh yeah, there's a "Quickstart
Guide" page - one side of a glossy sheet. No manual (Averatec does provide
a <a href="http://www.averatec.com/customercare/5400dl.htm">PDF</a> of it
on their site along with the Wind0ws drivers), no bubbly "Welcome!" pages
designed by marketing, no cables, no "special offers" - nothing.
Personally, I liked it; some people might be disconcerted.

<h3>Hardware Specifics</h3>

<p> I popped out the HD that came with the machine, slipped in the
Debian-loaded HD that I'd kept when I sent the Acer off to the factory, and
booted up. Here was my first chance to find out what this machine was
<strong>really</strong> made of - the information I needed to make
intelligent buying decisions (which the manufacturers, for some silly
reason, usually hide, with a unanimity that approaches collusion. I've
never understood <em>why</em>.) Well, running "lspci" would expose all.

<pre class="code">
0000:00:10.0 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82xxxxx UHCI USB 1.1 Controller (rev 80)
0000:00:10.1 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82xxxxx UHCI USB 1.1 Controller (rev 80)
0000:00:10.2 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82xxxxx UHCI USB 1.1 Controller (rev 80)
0000:00:10.3 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. USB 2.0 (rev 82)
</pre>

The USB system worked "right out of the box". One of the nicer things about
this machine is that it comes with 4 USB ports; considering that there are
very few other ports, this is an absolute necessity. Given that my usual
Net connection is via a USB cable connected to my cell phone, the
no-twiddling, "just works" hookup here made life quite pleasant.

<pre class="code">

0000:00:00.1 Host bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc.: Unknown device 1204

</pre>

The "internals" - i.e., the resources necessary for the CPU to communicate
with the peripherals - all worked fine, despite the "Unknown device"
messages. In fact, it's been a very long time since I've seen Linux fail to
work well in this area, no matter what strange hardware I've thrown at it.

<pre class="code">
0000:00:09.0 CardBus bridge: ENE Technology Inc CB1410 Cardbus Controller (rev 01)
</pre>

Cardbus and PCMCIA worked out of the box as well; plugging in a CardBus
Ethernet card (a Netgear FA511) worked without a hitch. There's only one
PCMCIA slot, which could be insufficient for some situations - but, again,
given the number of USB slots and the built-in Ethernet port, I could
certainly cope with it.

<pre class="code">
0000:00:0b.0 Network controller: RaLink Ralink RT2500 802.11 Cardbus Reference Card (rev 01)
</pre>

RaLink provides tarballs with compilable source for this 802.11g wireless
LAN card <a href="http://www.ralinktech.com/supp-1.htm">on their website</a>
(well done, people!); however, compiling it required downloading a dozen MB
worth of Qt libraries, which I was not willing to do over a cell-phone
link. "<a href="http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net">ndiswrap</a>" once
again (in my experience) proved to be a great alternative in this
situation: I grabbed the source for it, compiled it, downloaded the Wind0ws
drivers, and ran the installation procedure. In the process of doing this,
I learned about "/etc/iftab" and "ifrename", which allow you to remap
interface names; I created the file, entered

<pre>
wlan* mac 00:04:23:72:F5:DC
</pre>

into it (the above being the MAC address of the interface as shown by
"ifconfig"), and - <em>voila!</em> - instead of "eth1", my wireless
interface was named "wlan0" when I brought it up. Unfortunately, I had no
way to test it: it's 802.11g-only, and there are no "g" access points
around here that I know of. However, every other test short of that showed
it to be up and working.

<pre class="code">
0000:00:11.5 Multimedia audio controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT8233/A/8235/8237 AC97 Audio Controller (rev 50)
</pre>

I compiled "snd_via82xx" as a module - that being what ALSA requires, which
also leaves the system flexible enough to recognize other sound hardware -
and everything came right up. I'll confess that I use "Timidity"
(essentially, a MIDI emulator) for playing MIDI files, so I did not test
that part of the sound system... but it works so well that I stopped caring
a long time ago. MP3s, WAVs, etc., worked fine; dumping AUs into "/dev/dsp"
produced the expected results. The top volume is about 80% of what I'd come
to expect of a laptop, but my "multimedia-enabled" Acer (built-in bass
speaker) has probably spoiled me in this respect.

<pre class="code">
0000:00:11.6 Communication controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. Intel 537 [AC97 Modem] (rev 80)
</pre>

I haven't tested this - I don't have a lot of use for modems these days -
but I'd imagine it works about as well (or as poorly) as any other AC97
(win)modem. There are drivers available for such things; I've used them in
the past. "They work" is about all one can say about them... that's not to
denigrate, in any way, the effort of the Linuxfolk who have put in their
time and effort; rather, it's a simple statement of fact: winmodems
<strong>suck</strong>.

<pre class="code">
0000:00:12.0 Ethernet controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT6102 [Rhine-II] (rev 74)
</pre>

Compiling a "via_rhine" module took care of this; "hotplug" automatically
detected it and loaded in on the next boot.

<pre class="code">
0000:01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: VIA Technologies, Inc.: Unknown device 3108 (rev 01)
</pre>

I didn't have any major problems with this, and only a couple of minor
ones. Obviously, this is a relatively new piece of hardware (the "unknown
device" message says that it doesn't have a description in the PCI
database); however, it worked OK "out of the box", at 1024x768 all the way
up to 32bpp. One odd note here is that instead of going blank whenever it
times out, the screen breaks into a weird medley of twitching color blobs
(X and console both) that makes me feel like it's about to blow up at any
second; somewhat unnerving, to say the least. Also - and some people may
find this much more important than I did - I simply could not get DRI/GLX
to work (resulting in relatively slow but still reasonable video rendering
for, e.g., DVD playing. There are also a number of games which will not run
without it.) I've seen <a
href="http://www.ravencode.com/content/article.php?a=averatec">a report</a>
of a successful DRI/GLX configuration for a similar machine with the same
video hardware, but didn't get that far myself. Perhaps it was the fact
that I was uninterested in investing quite that much effort in this area.

<h3>Other features and considerations</h3>

<p> The DVD-RW seems to work fine. I've burned a few CDs on it, and just
popped in a DVD of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" to check the "video in"
end; seems OK. I've also mounted and read several data CDs without any
problems.

<p> The keys have good, definite action - unlike the mushy ones on my Acer,
which provides nearly zero feel. The touchpad is OK, if a bit odd -
selection by tapping doesn't follow the standard "word-line-none" cycle,
and there are no multi-finger gestures (i.e., pasting), although using the
buttons works fine. This may be resolvable by configuration, though.

<p> I've never had much luck with sleep or suspend under ACPI; however,
suspend-to-disk works just fine - unless you load the cdc_acm module (used
for USB modems - i.e., my cell phone.) Not this machine's fault, but
something to be aware of; trying to suspend, or even simply unload the
module freezes it solid. This has been so for the entire 2.6 kernel series,
unfortunately. Since this kernel is considered to be experimental, I can't
even submit a bug report unless I join the kernel-developers list.


<h3>Problems</h3>

The battery life in this machine is very poor. I timed it while running X
with a light-to-average load (reduced brightness, three xterms and a
Mozilla window, and doing nothing heavier than editing this article and
reading email in Mutt), and the charge, as reported by ACPI, went from a
high of 97% at 10:45a.m. to 50% at 11:17a.m and 2% at 11:48a.m.  Just as
bad is the fact that the battery takes several hours to recharge if you use
the machine while it's charging. This is not a fault in this specific
unit's battery or charger but seems standard for the model; I've actually
used two of these machines due to an odd concatenation of circumstances,
and both behaved identically.

<p> Other black marks: the 5400 has three fans (at least as reported by
ACPI), with one of them running immediately on startup and a second one
kicking in just seconds later. They are theoretically (hah!) controllable
via ACPI; I have not found it to be so in practice. The status is readable
but is not controllable (despite the fact that I can change the "off"
message for fan #3 to "on" - but cannot change any "on" settings to "off" -
it does nothing.) Moreover, on a warm Florida day (80 degrees Fahrenheit;
my boat has fans but no air conditioning), the machine will often pop up a
"going down now due to thermal overload: 88 degrees C!" (or similar)
message and immediately die, with no time to save or close anything.

<p> The physical design of the machine also has a slight but important
oddity: after carrying it in the bag with the power supply, I found a
number of vertical lines marked on the LCD screen. These went away with
careful cleaning, but made me realize that the distance from the screen
face to the keyboard was inadequate: when there was even a slight pressure
on the top of the machine (back of the screen), the display face pressed
against the keys!  In my estimate, this would wear into the plastic of the
LCD screen after a while - a completely unacceptable result. I suppose you
could retain the acrylic sheet that comes taped onto the display as a
screen protector, but this seems ridiculously makeshift for a brand-new
laptop.

<hr width="50%">

<h3>Final result</h3>

Despite the relative ease of system configuration and general Linuxability
of this machine, several of the factors - particularly the unreasonably
sensitive thermal shutdown (or high internal running temperature), the low
battery charge life, and the long recharge times - made it unusable, or
nearly so, for my purposes. For someone willing to mess around with the
internals of ACPI, or perhaps simply research the issues, some of these may
(or may not) be resolvable and worth the time to do so; for me, the overall
decision was "thumbs down".
