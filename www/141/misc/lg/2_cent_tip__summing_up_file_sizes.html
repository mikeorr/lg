I just got an iPod Shuffle, and am about to load it up with my favorite
tunes; however, I didn't want to dink around with multiple reloads of
the song list if it was too big. Since flash devices only have so many
write cycles before they start losing their little brains, minimizing
writes is a Good Thing. So, I needed to figure out the total size of the
files in my M3U playlist - and given the kind of questions that often
come up in my shell scripting classes and on LG's Answer Gang lists, I
thought that our readers would find some of these techniques (as well as
the script itself) useful. Herewith, the "m3u_size" script.  Enjoy!

Oooh, sweet bit of advice - I wasn't aware that mounting it with
'noatime' reduces the number of write ops, but it makes sense. I've
modified my /etc/fstab, and all is well. Thanks, Rick!

<p>
I think du would be better as you need to know how many blocks of your flash 
device it will take up. Do you know what block size it uses?
</p>

<p>
Having said that I think
<pre>
  du -bch `cat $file`
</pre>
will do almost exactly what your script does, with the exception that it won't 
handle spaces in file names. For that maybe
<pre>
  du -bch `sed -e's/^/"/' -e's/$/"/' &lt; $file`
</pre>
might work? 
</p>

<p>
N.B. I haven't tested any of the above.
</p>

<p>
To get number of blocks, some other du options might be more appropriate, e.g. 
du -B 1024 if it's a 1k block if the  (du -b gives you the number of bytes in 
the file, as ls does).

<p>
Almost the same list of errors, I'm afraid.
</p>

<p>
The way that Bash tokenizes a line depends on the IFS variable, which by
default consists of a space, a tab, and a newline. So, no, "sed" isn't
going to do anything useful - since it's not going to be presented
with anything more than the same token as 'du' was previously. However,
changing the value of IFS temporarily (just as I do in the script) will
help:

I do have to say that this solution is much faster than my "for" loop -
so I'll update the script a bit. Incidentally, note the "du -bS" usage:
I've played around with the "du" options, and there doesn't seem to be a
way to tell it to display just the sum, in bytes, of a group of files.
Seems rather silly... but that's OK; an accumulator isn't hard to write
in "awk" or whatever.

predicated on the number of blocks reported by "df".

<p>
You're right; I'm just going for the belt and suspenders approach. The
reason I published the 2-cent tip in the first place was because of the
two useful techniques in it - summing up file sizes from a disparate
list of files and parsing a large number; in the case of a list of MP3s,
the question of directories will, of course, be moot, but not if it's
used on arbitrary lists. In fact, there probably needs to be a definite
and explicit mechanism for ignoring directories; in the case of the
former "for" loop that I was using, saying 
</p>

<pre>
[ -f "$n" ] &amp;&amp; ((total+=$size))
</pre>
would do it, whereas for using "du", you'd just want to make sure that
you don't specify any directories (i.e., instead of saying "du foo/",
you'd want to say "du foo/*".)
</p>

<pre>
ben@Tyr:/tmp$ mkdir foo

Ben can you explain this line a bit more?  Its obvious its
looping 5 times to create the files but how is that head command
working? and should that be /dev/null not /dev/full ? ;)

Sure.

<p>
It grabs the "first" 1000 bytes ('c'haracters) from "/dev/full" and
redirects them into a file in "foo/"; the name of the file is, of
course, the same as the loop iterator - 1 through 5 depending on the
loop.

<p>
Nope. In electrical terms, "/dev/null" is a byte sink, whereas
"/dev/full" is a byte source (although that's not what it's designed
for; you generally want to use "/dev/zero" as an infinite source of null
bytes.) See also "/dev/urandom" if you need lots of line-noise.
</p>

<p>
All of this stuff is documented in "/usr/linux/Documentation/devices.txt" -
it's a good idea to be at least somewhat familiar with its contents.

Thanks Ben - That makes a bit more sense now.
