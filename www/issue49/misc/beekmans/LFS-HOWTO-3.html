<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Preparing a new partition</A> </H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Creating a new partition</A>
 </H2>

<P>Before we can build our new Linux system, we need to have an empty Linux
partition on which we can build our new system. If you already have a Linux
Native partition available, you can skip this subsection.
<P>Start the <CODE>fdisk</CODE> program (or <CODE>cfdisk</CODE> if you prefer that program) with the
appropriate harddisk as the option (like /dev/hda if you want to create a new
partition on the primary master IDE disk). Create a Linux Native partition,
write the partition table and exit the (c)fdisk program. If you get the message
that you need to reboot your system to ensure that that partition table is
updated, then please reboot your system now before continuing.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Creating an ext2 file system on the new partition</A>
 </H2>

<P>Once the partition is created, we have to create a new ext2 filesystem
on that partition. From now on I'll refer to this newly created partition as
$LFS. $LFS should be substituted with the partition you have
created. If you created your partition on /dev/hda4, you mounted it on /mnt/hda4
and this document tells you to copy a file to $LFS/usr/bin then you
need to copy that file to /mnt/hda4/usr/bin.
<P>To create a new ext2 filesystem we use the <CODE>mke2fs</CODE> command. Give $LFS
as the only option and the filesystem will be created.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Adding an entry to LILO</A>
 </H2>

<P>In order to be able to boot from this partition later on, we need to update
our <CODE>/etc/lilo.conf</CODE> file. Add the following lines to lilo.conf:
<P>
<PRE>
image=&lt;image&gt;
   label=&lt;label&gt;
   root=$LFS
   read-only
 
</PRE>
<P>Replace &lt;image&gt; by an already existing kernel image file. For now,
use the kernel image you're using at the moment to boot your Linux system.
&lt;label&gt; can be anything you want it to be. I named the label &quot;lfs&quot;
What you enter as &lt;label&gt; is what you enter at the LILO-prompt when you
choose with system to boot.
<P>Now run the <CODE>lilo</CODE> program to update the boot loader.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Creating directories</A>
 </H2>

<P>Let's create a minimal directory tree on the $LFS partition. issuing
the following commands will create the necessary directories. Make sure you
first mount the $LFS partition before you attempt to create the directories.
<P>
<PRE>
cd $LFS
mkdir boot etc home lib mnt proc root tmp var
mkdir -p bin sbin usr/bin usr/sbin usr/src usr/man
cd usr/man
mkdir man1 man2 man3 man4 man5 man6 man7 man8
cd ..
ln -s . local
ln -s /etc etc
ln -s /var var
 
</PRE>
<P>As you see, on the LFS system the /usr/local directory points to /usr.
I am aware that this is in violation with the FHS (File Hierarchy Standard
- 
<A HREF="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">http://www.pathname.com/fhs/</A>) but my idea is that the usr/local directory doesn't apply on a completely
self-built system, since every software package is installed locally anyway
and there's no part installed by a vendor's CD-ROM or something similar. Therefore
I chose to make /usr/local and /usr one-and-the-same directory.
<P>Also, /usr/etc and /usr/var point to /etc and /var. This is just another
of my preferences.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 Copying the /dev directory</A>
 </H2>

<P>We can create every single file that we need to be in the $LFS/dev
directory using the mknod command, but that just takes up a lot of time. I
choose to just simply copy the current /dev directory to the $LFS partition.
Use this command to copy the entire directory while preserving original rights,
symlinks and owner ships:
<P><CODE>cp -av /dev $LFS</CODE>
<P>Feel free to strip down the $LFS/dev directory, only leaving the
devices you really need.
