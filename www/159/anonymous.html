<h1>rI18N or The Real Internationalization Project</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/anonymous.html">Anonymous</a></b></p>


<p>
My article "Keymap Blues in Ubuntu's Text Console" in <a
href="../157/anonymous.html">LG#157</a> left a poster in <a
href="http://linuxgazette.net/158/lg_talkback.html#talkback_157_anonymous">LG#158</a>
a bit annoyed.
</p>

<p>
He is saying that I didn't do this or didn't do that. And he
is right, I did not.
</p>

<p>
Specifically, I don't feel capable of proposing "[...] a good
consistent solution to all the woes of the Linux console."
Please address <em>that</em> challenge to Linus Torvalds.
</p>

<p>
I am, however, willing to take up a smaller challenge posited by that
poster: namely "[...] a sample keymap which is 'sized down' and [fits]
the author's needs".
</p>

<p>
Fine - let's go for it. As noted before, we are discussing the text console, no X
involved.
</p>


<h3>1   What has to be included?</h3>

<p>
The text console keymap covers, <em>inter alia</em>, the self-insertion
keys that we need to enter text. These keys vary a lot from country to
country, so I'm going to leave them out. I'm not even going to try defining
them for the US default keymap. The real concern, when considering text
mode applications, are the 'functional keys'.
</p>


<h3>2   What are functional keys?</h3>

<p>
This is a term I'm using for lack of anything better.
Alternative suggestions are welcome.
</p>

<p>
Functional keys are defined here by enumeration. The names
for the keys come from the physical keyboard I'm typing this
article on. They are quite common, actually:
</p>

<pre>
    F1  F2  F3  F4  F5  F6  F7  F8  F9  F10  F11  F12

    Tab Backspace PrintScreen/Sys Rq Pause/Break
    Insert  Home  PageUp Delete  End   PageDown

                       Up
                Left        Right
                      Down
</pre>


<h3>3   Is anything missing?</h3>

<p>
You could argue that other keys should also be in the set 'functional
keys'. For instance, Escape or Enter, or the modifier keys Shift, Ctrl,
Alt. The reason they are not in the set is that they are not troublesome. I
have checked the default keymaps offered by the kbd project for US,
Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Russia, and I would say these extra keys
are safe. They are already consistent, and the differences are practically
irrelevant.
</p>


<h3>4   Terminology</h3>

<p>
Again, a note on terminology: <em>keymap</em> normally refers to a
file where the key assignments are defined. The assignments can
refer to plain keys, but they can also refer to modified keys, e.g.
&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;left&gt;. In the keymap (the file!), a table of assignments
for given modifiers is also called a keymap, so we get a keymap for
&lt;ctrl&gt;, a keymap for &lt;alt&gt; and so on.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, you'll need to keep in mind the difference between key names
and assigned keymap variables. Examples:
</p>

<table width="400">
<tr><td>variable 'Delete'</td><td>is distinct from the key Delete</td></tr>
<tr><td>variable 'BackSpace'</td><td>is distinct from the key Backspace</td></tr>
<tr><td>variable 'F14'</td><td>does not need a physical key F14</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>5   The approach via multiple strings</h3>

<p>
What you see, especially in Ubuntu (implying Debian, although
I have not checked), is that the modifier keymaps rely on
multiple strings. Examples:
</p>

<table width="400">
<tr><td><strong>Keys</strong></td><td><strong>Assignments</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;f4&gt;</td><td>F4</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;shift&gt;&lt;f4&gt;</td><td>F14</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;f4&gt;</td><td>F24</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;shift&gt;&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;f4&gt;</td><td>F34</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;altgr&gt;&lt;f4&gt;</td><td>F44</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;shift&gt;&lt;altgr&gt;&lt;f4&gt;</td><td>F54</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;altgr&gt;&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;f4&gt;</td><td>F64</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;shift&gt;&lt;altgr&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;f4&gt;</td><td>F74</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Variables F4 to F74 would deliver strings to the application
expecting keyboard input and the application could then take
action. The funny thing is that Ubuntu only has strings for
F4 and F14, while F24 to F74 are empty, and no action can be
taken on receiving the empty string.
</p>

<p>
This is, however, not the point here. The point is: is it a
good idea to define all those keys via strings?
</p>

<p>
All those variables up to F256 are inherited from Unix. They were meant to
make the keyboard flexible - i.e. customizable - on a case-by-case basis
without assuming consensus. Unix and consensus don't mix. Everybody was
welcome to do with those variables whatever they wanted, and there is old
software that relies on such flexibility: define F74 in the keymap, and
you are going to touch <em>somebody</em>.
</p>


<h3>6   The approach via modifier status</h3>

<p>
There is a way to recognize, for example, &lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;f4&gt; even if it has no
unique string attached to it. It must have a string, of course - otherwise
it would be ignored when the keyboard is in translation mode (either ASCII
or UTF-8), which is the normal case. The approach relies on just reading
the status of the modifiers - pressed down or not. All the modified keys
get the same string as the plain key and then you find out about the
modifier status. Example:
</p>

<table width="400">
<tr><td><strong>Keys</strong></td><td><strong>Assignments</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;f4&gt;</td><td>F4</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;shift&gt;&lt;f4&gt;</td><td>F4</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;f4&gt;</td><td>F4</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;shift&gt;&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;f4&gt;</td><td>F4</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;altgr&gt;&lt;f4&gt;</td><td>F4</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;shift&gt;&lt;altgr&gt;&lt;f4&gt;</td><td>F4</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;altgr&gt;&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;f4&gt;</td><td>F4</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;shift&gt;&lt;altgr&gt;&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;f4&gt;</td><td>F4</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
You want to know if &lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;f4&gt; was received?  Check the input
for the F4 string, then read the status of &lt;ctrl&gt;. If &lt;ctrl&gt; is
pressed you got &lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;f4&gt;; if not, you got &lt;f4&gt;.
</p>

<p>
Nice, isn't it? Not among the Unixsaurs. You see, reading
the modifier status is a Linux specialty. Even the Linux
manpage for ioctl_codes, where the trick is explained, gives
a strong warning against their use and recommends POSIX
functions. The catch is there are no such POSIX functions - so you
either use the Linux IOCTLs or you're out of luck.
</p>

<p>
Ah, I hear, but that's not platform neutral. So what? Go through the source
code of any text console editor and count the pre-processor directives that
are there to accommodate peculiarities of Unix variants 1-999. There are
also pre-processor directives to accommodate Linux, modifier status and
all. If Midnight Commander can do it, why not others?
</p>

<p>
There are text console editors that use the modifiers for
their Windows version but not for their Linux version. Why
not? Because Windows delivers the key and the modifier at
once, while Linux needs distinct commands, one to read the
key, one to read the modifier. Therefore there is a slight
time difference between the results - and theoretically, a risk
of incurring an error. A lame excuse: when the two commands are
next to each other in the source code, that error will never
materialize. We are talking about micro-seconds.
</p>

<p>
My choice is to use plain keys everywhere in the set of functional keys
whatever the modifiers may be, except the &lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;alt&gt; combo
which will be reserved for system operations like switching consoles.
</p>


<h3>7   Which modifiers do we reasonably need?</h3>

<p>
How many keymaps do you need in the keymap? (If you're confused, please
review the terminology warning above.) Ubuntu has 64 keymaps in
the keymap, a mighty overkill. Fedora and OpenSUSE are a lot
more reasonable. I'll stick close to their version:
</p>

<table width="400">
<tr><td>plain</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;shift&gt;</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;altgr&gt;</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;ctrl&gt;</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;shift&gt;&lt;ctrl&gt;</td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;altgr&gt;&lt;ctrl&gt;</td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;alt&gt;</td><td>8</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;alt&gt;</td><td>12</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
This choice gives the entry keymaps 0-2,4-6,8,12 in the keymap (the file)
with a total of 8 keymaps (the assignment tables). As already mentioned,
Ubuntu has keymaps 0-63.
</p>

<p>
Note that defining 8 keymaps does not preclude defining
more. But those 8 keymaps should be defined as we dare
to propose here.
</p>

<p>
Note also to the users of the US keyboard: &lt;altgr&gt; is
nothing more than the Alt key on the right side, which must be
kept distinct since it plays a role on non-US keyboards.
</p>


<h3>8   Control characters 28-31</h3>

<p>
The characters 28-31, which are control codes, are
desperately difficult to find on non-US keyboards. All the
mnemonics implied by their name get lost. Besides, they also
get shifted and are awkward to generate.
</p>

<p>
These are Control_backslash, Control_bracketright,
Control_underscore, Control_asciicircum. A language and
keyboard neutral solution could be as follows:
</p>

<table width="500">
<tr><td><strong>Name</strong></td><td><strong>Code</strong></td><td><strong>Assignment</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>Control_backslash</td><td>char. 28</td><td>&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;8&gt; on numeric keypad</td></tr>
<tr><td>Control_bracketright</td><td>char. 29</td><td>&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;9&gt; on numeric keypad</td></tr>
<tr><td>Control_underscore</td><td>char. 30</td><td>&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;0&gt; on numeric keypad</td></tr>
<tr><td>Control_asciicircum</td><td>char. 31</td><td>&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;1&gt; on numeric keypad</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>9  Immediate and likely effects</h3>

<p>
The immediate effects of the proposed partial keymap for
functional keys concern system operations:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>changing console</strong><br>
	This would work with &lt;ctr&gt;&lt;alt&gt;&lt;f1&gt;, etc. - the same
	way it works under X - instead of &lt;alt&gt;&lt;f1&gt; etc.
</li>

<li>
<strong>previous/next console</strong><br>
    This would become &lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;alt&gt;&lt;left&gt; and &lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;alt&gt;&lt;right&gt;
    instead of &lt;alt&gt;&lt;left&gt; and &lt;alt&gt;&lt;right&gt;.
</li>

<li>
<strong>scrolling text in console</strong><br>
	No more &lt;shift&gt;&lt;pageup&gt; and &lt;shift&gt;&lt;pagedown&gt;;
	this would be &lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;alt&gt;&lt;pageup&gt; and
	&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;alt&gt;&lt;pagedown&gt;.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This would seem to conflict with DOSEMU - but it doesn't, because DOSEMU
uses raw keyboard mode.
</p>

<p>
The non-immediate effects depend on text mode applications
following Midnight Commander's example and using the Linux
ioctls to read the modifiers status.
</p>

<p>
If it spreads then it would be normal to move to the start of a
buffer with &lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;home&gt; while &lt;home&gt; takes you to the
start of the line. To move to the next word &lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;right&gt; would
be available. And you could highlight a selection pushing &lt;shift&gt; and
moving the cursor. Last but not least, a large number of keybindings based
on F1-F12 would become available and they would be language and country
independent!
</p>

<p>
To anybody who only has experience with the US keyboard running the US
default keymap, please try Nano on a Spanish or French keyboard. When you
are done, please come back and agree with me that this little partial
keymap should be called rI18N or the <strong><em>Real</em></strong>
Internationalization Project.
</p>


<h3>10   The goodies</h3>

<p>
