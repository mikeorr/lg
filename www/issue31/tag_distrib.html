What do you know about 
	<a http://www.yggdrasil.com/">Yggdrasil</a> linux distribution?  
They purport
significant advances in OS/SOFTWARE/DOCUMENTATION not achieved by
others.  Is it real or make believe or worthy of mention?  I was
impressed by what I read, however I am not all knowing but just
researching linux to find the best distribution/version to begin
learning yet have an os that is versatile enough to keep using once
abilities exceed beginner/amateur.  Mike

<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)" width="50" height="28"
        align="left" border="0">

	Yggdrasil's ``Plug and Play'' Linux was the first CD-ROM
	distribution ever produced.  They also developed and released
	the first CDR recording software that was available under
	Linux.  Yggdrasil was also one of the earliest companies to
	compile, print and bind "dead tree" versions of the LDP (Linux
	Documentation Project).  Back near the beginning of 1997 they
	released an 8-CD set of Linux archives (not including their
	own distribution).  They are the only company that I know of
	which has produced a video documentary on using Linux.
<br><br>

	Adam Richter, founder of Yggdrasil, is still active in the
	community. He frequently shows up and local user group
	meetings (<A HREF="http://www.svlug.org">http://www.svlug.org</A>) 
	and he occasionally
	participates in discussions on the 'Linux-kernel' mailing
	list.  In fact I saw him at the "midnight rally" that the
	SVLUG and some other bay area Linux enthusiasts hosted in
	front of Fry's and CompUSA on the night that Microsoft
	officially shipped Win '98(*).
<br><br>

	<ul><li>Specifically he and I discussed the fact that the
		  rally had just run out of the 500 S.u.S.E.  CD's that 
		  had been donated to us for promotional purposes.  
		  He joked that he could drive over to his offices 
		 --- a couple of miles from there --- and get a case or 
		 two of old sets of the "archives" --- but also expressed
		 the concern that they were probably a little too old to
		 be of interest to new Linux users.
	</ul>

	Recently (just last February --- a few months ago), he
	announced his experimental "Ground Zero" repository --- which
	is an effort to provide a comprehensive and dynamic repository
	of all of the available Linux packages in tarball (Slackware
	compatible .tar.gz), RPM (Red Hat), and .deb formats.
<br><br>

	Apparently  Adam also has some interesting processes running
	at his site --- based on some custom programming he's done.
	It monitors certain FTP sites (and some other sites?) and
	automatically fetches, builds and tests new kernels (and 
	some other packages?).  I don't know the details --- but it
	sounds very cool.  
<br><br>

	One of the things I really liked about Yggdrasil's distribution
	was that it had an integrated source tree.  You could easily 
	find the sources for anything in the distribution (I think it
	included a '<tt>whence</tt>' command which was similar to the '<tt>which</tt>'
	command except in that it pointed you to the source code for
	a command, rather than just to the binary).
<br><br>

	I mention that in the past tense since I haven't used 
	"Plug and Play" Linux in a number of years --- it hasn't 
	been updated recently.  In response to your note I raced 
	over to the Yggdrasil web site 
	(<A HREF="http://www.yggdrasil.com/">http://www.yggdrasil.com/</A>) 
	in the hopes that they actually have a new release.
<br><br>

	(I keep asking Adam and he just quietly assures me not to
	worry about it!).
<br><br>

	So, I'd like to know what you've read (and if there was a 
	date on it).  
<br><br>

	As for the relative merits of Yggdrasil's "Plug and Play"
	vs. <a href="http://redhat.com/">Red Hat</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.suse.com/">S.u.S.E</a>., 
	<a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.caldera.com/">Caldera</a>, and the most recent
	<a href="http://www.slackware.org/">Slackware</a> 
	--- it's not a fair comparison.  All of these other
	major, general purpose distributions have been updated several
	times since the last "Plug and Play" release.  
<br><br>

	So, I cannot recommend the old Yggdrasil version except for 
	historical (almost archealogical) purposes.  That's why I want
	them to release a new version.
<br><br>

	(Meanwhile the "Ground Zero" effort is very up-to-date and 
	completely independent of your distribution --- so you should
	definitely bookmark their site and check on it regularly).

<p><strong>
Answerguy,
What do you think of this distribution?
					OpenLinux Base
</strong></p>

<font color="navy"><em>
<p><strong>
	OpenLinux®: A complete Linux operating
		system with all the system tools you’ll need.
		Plus valuable add-ons, like Netscape®
		Communicator and backup utilities.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>
	US and Canadian orders can take advantage of a $20.00
	rebate from Caldera, bringing the price of OpenLinux
	Base to $31.95
</strong></p>
</em></font>

<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)" width="50" height="28"
        align="left" border="0">

	I haven't used any of the <a href="http://www.caldera.com/">Caldera</a> distributions 
	recently.  This is a much more recent version the those
	that I've used.  So, I don't have an informed opinion on
	them.
<br><br>

	Since you just asked about Yggdrasil yesterday I'm wondering
	if this is a pattern.  I hope you aren't going to send me
	of these every day.
<br><br>

	My opinion about Caldera <em>Standard</em> is that it is the best
	choice for a site that has existing Netware servers or 
	clients.  It was also the first distribution that was 
	supported by WordPerfect for Linux.  There are a number of
	other commercial software companies that work with Caldera
	for releasing Linux versions of their product. 
<br><br>

	If the Caldera Base includes a copy of 
	<a href="http://www.stardivision.com/">Star</a>Office (as your
	press release says it does) than that is a very good reason
	to try it.  (The installation of StarOffice that I have from
	an early 4.0 CD is very unstable --- it dies quickly and 
	horribly under my 
	<a href="http://www.suse.com/">S.u.S.E.</a> 5.1 system.  
	I've heard that that
	there are new libraries and releases that fix that --- but I
	haven't been particularly motivated to go get them since I 
	still mostly live in text consoles).
<br><br>

	StarOffice is a very promising product --- and the competition
	between it Corel Office, and Applixware should be
	interesting. The most important feature of either is to
	provide me with stable, reliable access to MS Office .DOC and
	.XLS files.  The first one to successfully do that with MS
	Office '97 wins my vote.  (Since that is one of the few
	reasons for me to get out of a text console and into X --- the
	others being Netscape Navigator (when I need something that
	just doesn't look right in Lynx), 'xfig' (to draw diagrams for
	the book that I'm working on), and 'xdvi', and 'gv' (to
	preview the LaTeX and dvips output for same).
<br><br>

	At the same time I recognize the potential of these office
	suites (and some others).  As these get better we see Linux as
	a more serious contender on the desktops of home and corporate
	users.  According to some surveys we're already winning against NT 
	in a number of server categories (including web, mail, DNS, and 
	SMB/<a href="http://samba.anu.edu.au/">Samba</a>).  We've gained a 
	lot of ground in the technical and scientific workstation market 
	(although the push to get EDA and CAD/CAM suites ported is just barely
	started).  But all the "mom's" and "pop's" out there that have
	their college kids buying systems for them need something a
	bit less intimidating than 'emacs' and 'vi' --- and TeX and
	friends.
<br><br>

	<a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> and 
	<a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> 
	will provide the main interface and many of the
	toys and widgets.  StarOffice, 
	<a href="http://www.applix.com/">Applix</a>ware, 
	<a href="http://www.corel.com/">Corel</a> Office, SIAG,
	LyX, Wingz, Xess, and others are all vying to provide the
	main user applications.
<br><br>

	(I personally think we'll also need multi-media GUI "Welcome to 
	Linux/XFree86/KDE" and "Welcome to Linux/XFree86/GNOME" 
	interactive tutorials --- with sound, music, via, and a 
	dancing, talking Tux.  I want a system I can install on a 
	box and send to my Mom!).
<br><br>

<dl><dt>
	Getting back to your implicit question:
	<dd> Which Linux distribution should you try?

<dt> ... the answer is:  
	<dd> I have no idea!
</dl>

	Unlike the marketeering weenies that you encounter in
	every magazine, and newspaper, on every TV and radio 
	show and on billboard and busses every time you drive
	anywhere ... unlike them, I don't want to push a bunch
	of <em>features</em> on you and I have nothing to sell you 
	(except my time --- which is pretty expensive).

<br><br>
	Helping someone select a Linux distribution (or anything
	else) is a matter of requirements analysis.  What do
	you need?  What do you want?  How much are you willing to
	spend?  (Time and money).  It is quite possible that I
	would recommend FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, BSDI/OS, or
	even Win '95, NT, or MS-DOS --- <em>if</em> I understood your
	requirements sufficiently.   

<br><br>
	Before you send me a list or essay on your requirements
	consider that the Answer Guy is time I volunteer to show
	my appreciation for all the work that people like Richard
	Stallman, Linus Torvalds, Alan Cox, Arnold Robbins, and 
	so many others have put into the GNU project, Linux and 
	other freeware.  I try to answer questions that I think
	are of broad interest to many Linux users and potential
	Linux users.  (And possibly of interest to *BSD'ers
	and eventually GNU HURD'ers).  

<br><br>
	The easy answer to selecting a distribution is:  pick one!
	Since many of them are freely distributable you might want
	to start with one of those.  Debian and Red Hat are definitely
	freely accessible.  I think Slackware is still available online
	--- and I suspect that it's perfectly O.K. to borrow a friend's
	copy of the CD.  Walnut Creek might have exclusive rights on
	CD distribution of Slackware --- I don't know. I think S.u.S.E. 
	is free for "personal" use (although it is a bit unclear my
	S.u.S.E. 5.2 manual says:

<blockquote><code>
		Copyright
		This work is copyrighted [sic] by S.u.S.E. GmbH and 
		is placed under conditions of the GNU General Public
		License.

		You may copy it in whole or in part as long as the
		copies retain this copyright statement.

</code></blockquote>
	... (overleaf of the title page).  It's not clear whether
	"this work" is intended to refer to the book or to the 
	distribution that included it.  The box and CD case (4CD's)
	don't list any other copyright or licensing notices that I
	can find.  The only index entry under the term "license"
	points that the Appendix of their manual that contains the
	full text of the FSF GPL.  That would suggest that you can
	borrow my set of S.u.S.E. CD's and install it, and would
	even suggest that someone could start creating derivative
	works (other CD sets) to sell in competition with S.u.S.E.

<br><br>
	However, I've always been under the impression that S.u.S.E. 
	is a commercial distribution.  I purchased both of my copies 
	for it -- 5.1 and 5.2 --- and I've purchased many copies of 
	various Red Hat versions (the boxed set and the lower-priced 
	archives sets).  So, you might want to ask a S.u.S.E. rep
	before you go into production against them.  However, I doubt
	that they'd even want you to waste their time asking if it's
	O.K. to install from a friend's set on an evaluation basis.

<br><br>
	You're clearly willing to buy some distribution once you
	find one you like.  Personally I usually select Red Hat
	for my customers (after I've considered their needs) simply
	because Red Hat has a pretty good balance of the various
	factors they care about.  

<br><br>
	Debian has more packages (slightly) -- but the last copy of 
	dpkg that I used was very convoluted (I'm hoping to get a 2.0 
	CD as soon as it goes out of beta).  Slackware was nice when
	I needed it --- but most of my customers aren't interested
	in fussing with tarballs --- they want something with a 
	decent package manager (one that can be operated easily
	from command lines as well as throught a GUI).  

<br><br>
	Under RH it's pretty simple to write a script to poll an 
	internal FTP site for package updates and automatically apply 
	any of them that appear.  (I think there's a package called 
	'rpmwatch' floating around some 'contrib' directories somewhere 
	that does precisely that).  I haven't looked at RH 5.1 yet.

<br><br>
	S.u.S.E. and Caldera both use the RPM format.  

<br><br>
	S.u.S.E.  includes more packages that the last couple RH CD's
	I used (4.2 and 5.0).  It seems to have a pretty good
	installation interface though I have mixed feelings about
	their interpretation of the SysV init scripts.  They have a
	large shell script named /etc/rc.config (mine is about 770
	lines long --- of which about 500 are comments).  This file
	contains a long list of shell variables and values.  You	
	can edit this file by hand or you can use YaST (Yet another
	Setup Tool) which is their curses based system's administration
	interface.  The idea is that the other scripts all "source"
	this one file and use the variables that apply to their
	operation.

<br><br>
	On the one hand this is very nice.  Concievably I could
	create a particular installation profile (which they support
	via their installation interface), install the system, 
	configure it via YaST and put it into production.  

<br><br>
	Let's assume I use the 'chattr +i +d' (immutable and no-dump)
	flags on all the files that came with the distribution and
	unset them as a pair whenever I change any of them; this would
	allow me to use the 'dump' program and <em>never</em> backup files
	that were from the initial installation off of the CD).  This
	is for a "data+config" backup strategy.

<br><br>
	If I've stored the rescue floppy they created, and the 
	rc.config file --- I should be able to restore the whole
	system to its configuration  with just my installation
	CD's, my rescue diskette, and the rc.config file. (Naturally,
	I'll have to restore all my data as well).

<br><br>
	Another nice thing is that I might be able to create
	a little script to generate new rc.config files from a 
	master form and a couple of other data files.  If I have
	<em>lots</em> of new machine trickling in I might have a few 
	files that contain lists of IP addresses, hostnames, 
	NIS domain names, shared printers, and other local (LAN)
	data.  I might conceivably be able to generate a new custom
	rc.config file for each new box and automate even more
	of the deployment.

<br><br>
	Under other distributions I have to mess with over a dozen
	separate files.  Unfortunately it's not that easy even under
	S.u.S.E.  If you use NFS you really want to use NIS or synchronize 
	the 'passwd' and 'group' files across your systems (since 
	maintaining ugidd maps is not scaleable and NFS relies on
	the uid/gid values to determine access and permissions.

<br><br>
	None of the distributions I've seen prompt me for a 
	passwd/group file set prior to installation.  So, if I use
	Red Hat on one system and S.u.S.E. on another (I do)
	--- there will be some base files that differ between them
	(most of the uid's created by most of the distributions
	<em>do</em> match -- there were only a couple that I had to 
	run through a "masschown" script).  (Distribution Dudes!:
	This is my enhancement plea for the month!  Please let me 
	hand you a passwd/group file set --- from floppy or over
	ftp/nfs/http --- and use that to map the ownership as you
	install).

<br><br>
	These days, for large sites, I recommend creating one
	"template" installation one a typical box, cutting that whole
	installation to tape or CDR after configuration but <em>before</em>
	any <em>use</em> (data).  Now you can do all new system installations
	as "restores" from your backups.  You can also take that 
	opportunity to make sure that your recovery plans, rescue
	diskettes and backup media are all in working order.  One
	reason I recommend that is that it takes me about 
	four hours to fix various permissions and configurations
	(hosts.allow, hosts.deny, etc) after I've completed a new
	installation.  

<br><br>
	One final note about choosing a distribution:  don't just
	ask me.  I'm only one person.  I've only used about a half
	dozen Linux distributions (some of which no longer exist!).
	Don't just go to the newsgroups and mailings lists and ask
	"Which is best?"  

<br><br>
	Ask questions that relate to your situation:  Will you be
	integrating this into a Novell network?  Do you have friends
	or family that will be working on your Linux box?  Do any of
	them have experience with a Linux distribution?  Do any of them
	use some other form of Unix (free or otherwise)?  Do you have
	any particular applications preferences?  Is system security
	a concern?  What are the risk profiles that are acceptable to
	you?  What is your native language (German speakers will probably
	be much happier with the German S.u.S.E. or the DLD (?)
	distributions, Japanese users seem to prefer FreeBSD, the French
	have their own distribution, etc.)?
