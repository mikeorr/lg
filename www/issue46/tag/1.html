<!-- ::
Routing Revisited

<P><STRONG>
I have placed two network cards in my system; one to a firewall
and the other to a hub serving a small two systems network (I'm a
newbie attempting this project.)  While booting the kernel detects
the two card very well; I have no IRQ confilcts or any other
mishaps.  I have configured the first card (eth0) using '<tt>ifconfig
eth0 192.168.0.1</tt>' and card two using '<tt>ifconfig eth1 192.168.0.2</tt>';
now if I shutdown the system I and reboot and run '<tt>ifconfig</tt>' it
only shows me one card (eth0).  How do I get the other card to
remain constant?

First problem: The '<tt>ifconfig</tt>' command is in no way
persistent. When you configure the IP address, netmask and
broadcast address on an interface, that setting only lasts
until the next reboot (or the next '<tt>ifconfig</tt>').
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You need to save the settings for your interfaces in a
configuration file somewhere.  On a 
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> system you should
find a file named <TT>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0</TT>.
Copy that to the name <tt>ifcfg-eth1</tt> (in the same directory) and
edit the copy.  This file is a set of variable assignments
which is "sourced" by one of the <tt>rc*</tt> (start up) scripts.  The
variables are then used in the '<tt>ifconfig</tt>' command.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When you edit that file, it is VERY important that you
remember to change the <tt>DEVICE=</tt> setting to eth1, 
otherwise you'll overwrite the configuration of your eth0 interface.
The name of the <tt>ifcfg-*</tt> file is not correlated to device name!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Here's an example of a <tt>ifcfg-*</tt> file from one of my Red Hat
systems:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BlockQuote><pre>
DEVICE=lo
IPADDR=127.0.0.1
NETMASK=255.0.0.0
NETWORK=127.0.0.0
BROADCAST=127.255.255.255
ONBOOT=yes
</pre></BlockQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In this example I'm using the <tt>lo</tt>, or loopback, interface
since this system uses DHCP for its ethernet interface and
consequently has no <tt>ifcfg-eth0</tt>.  You want to change all of
these settings as appropriate for your other subnet.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This brings us to the second and more drastic problem that
you've described.  The IP addresses you gave are on the same
subnet.  That doesn't make sense!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You could probably force it to work with a few proxyarp
commands (to publish the extra IP address of eth1 on the LAN
to which you've connected eth0, and to also publish the other
two IP addresses on eth1's segment to the other network.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Another way to make this addressing scheme work would be to
publish special host routes or each of these stray IP
addresses on EVERY system on the eth0 network segment.  That
would also constrain you to systems which can properly handle
variable length subnet masking (VLSN).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If this last two paragraphs didn't make sense to you then I
suggest TWO things.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Don't do that!  If you don't understand proxyarp then
definitely don't want to try using it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Read my "Routing and Subnetting 101" article (the
longest I've written for LG TAG to date) at:

</DL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The "Routing and Subnetting 101" article will explain what a
subnet is, why you want to use it and give you a few examples
and tables for determining the valid ways to subnet your
particular network.  It will also explain ARP, proxyarp, and
the use of RFC1918 addresses (which you're already using ---
since <tt>192.168.0.*</tt> is one of the Class C address blocks
reserved in that RFC).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Since you are using one block of RFC1918 addresses on eth0,
you can easily just use another block for eth1.  So you could
use <tt>192.168.1.*</tt>.  You can use any number from 1 to 255 for
that third octet.  You could also use <tt>172.16.*.*</tt> on eth1 (and
on the other computers/devices on that network segment).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, solve those two problems and you're well on your way to
discovering the next one.  (Don't worry, those two are the
only problems I can see from what you've described.  So that
may be enough to get the job at hand done.  It's just that
I've learned that we don't really solve problems so much as
create new ones and, when we're lucky, delay their discovery
through periods of apparent functionality).
