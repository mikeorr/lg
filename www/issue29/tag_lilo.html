<p><strong>From Samuel Posten on 20 May 1998

<br><br>
could you please point me to some references regarding removal of LILO
from a machine that has been set up to run both win 95 and Linux,
preferably without losing any of the Win 95 partitions.

</strong></p>
<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" width="50" height="28" alt="(!)"
align="left" border="0">
	Boot up a copy of DOS (from a floppy).  Any copy of 
	DOS later than 5.0 will do.  Type 
<tt><a href="http://www.nai.com/vinfo/0323.asp">FDISK /MBR</a></tt>.

<br><br>
	That's the short form.  There are some special situations
	which might require special handling --- but they are
	increasingly rare (special boot sectors used to be used
	for large (greater than 32Mb!) drives to replace the INT 13H
	calls that are normally handled by the BIOS for all 
	(real mode) disk handling.

<br><br>
	(You might boot from your original Win '95 setup diskette
	and exit out of the installation program --- I think that
	trick still works).  You should definitely create a bootable
	DOS diskette (that would be MS-DOS 7.0 --- the real OS that's 
	hidden under Win '95's interface/GUI).  

<br><br>
	It used to simply be a matter of running the command:  
	FORMAT A: /S and copying COMMAND.COM unto a floppy --- but 
	MS has probably made it much more complicated these days.  
	I honestly haven't used '95 enough to know.

If this can't be done, I'll just have to stick with running LILO, no big
deal, but its a pain to have to tell it to boot Win 95 each time, as it
defaults to the Linux system that no longer exists (I wiped those
partitions and had to make them Win 95 devices.

	Sorry to lose another Linux user.  However, if MS keeps 
	on their current course --- you may be back before you
	know it.

	This is an alarmingly common question.  I've copied
	Werner Almesberger to ask him to consider adding this
	as a note in the <tt>lilo</tt> 'man page' and to the 
	authors of the 
<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Installation-HOWTO.html"
	>Installation-HOWTO</a> (although,
<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Installation-HOWTO-8.html#ss8.2"
	>Custom LILO Configuration</a> is worth a look -- it's possible to 
	have LILO point at another OS' partition) and the 
"<em><a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/LDP/gs/gs.html"
	>Linux Installation and Getting Started Guide</a></em>" 
	(the key part of the LDP -- the Linux Documentation Project).

<br><br>
	I can't promise anything --- but I think (after the countless times 
	that I've answered this and seen it answered in the newsgroups) that 
	we should include a little section  --- one paragraph in most cases 
	about <strong>uninstalling</strong> LILO (and a whole section in 
	LIGS about uninstalling all of Linux).  We're not trying to trap
	people into being "stuck" with our software and it's merely a bit 
	of documentation.

<br><br>
	The problem is that it's the sort of thing that most of 
	us old DOS hacks take for granted (I spent years doing 
	tech support and repairing MBR's from PC viruses and 
	rebuilding partition tables with Norton's DiskEdit).  

<br><br>
	So, let's hope that Matt, Eric, and Werner will consider adding this 
	little tidbit to their docs --- and let's hope even more fervently 
	that a few of the users out there will <strong>look</strong> at the 
	docs for LILO, and will actually read some HOWTO's and guides as
	they consider installing (or uninstalling) Linux.

<br><br>
	(I supposed we could also contact <a href="http://www.redhat.com/"
	>Red Hat</a>, <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>,
	<a href="http://www.suse.com/">S.u.S.E.</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.caldera.com/">Caldera</a> and the others to 
	suggest that they all add an "Un-install" (Remove) option to their 
	boot/setup tools).

<br><dl><dd><font color="#333366">&gt;&gt; It depends on the nature of 
	the BS virus.  Some of them encrypte the logical boot record or 
	cross-link the FAT's against their code, or play other games.  
	In those cases just blowing away the virus locks you out of your
 	system.</font></dl>  
Hmm, its been a while since I've researched virii.  Having Viruscan 
running full time has made me lazy I guess!

	I used to work for McAfee, and for Norton before them.
	So I have considerable professional experience with
	the critters.  Running a good scanner is a good idea.
	(VirusScan is good, FProt and Thunderbyte used to be
	pretty good, as well.  The latter two were sometimes
	on the leading edge and sometimes just neck-and-neck
	with McAfee).

<br><br>
	Since I've left McAfee (now called <a href="http://www.nai.com"
	>Network Associates</a>) I have no idea how their anti-virus 
	products stack up.  When I left I'd been their Unix sysadmin for 
	over a year so I was a little out of the loop by then.
	Now I use Linux/Unix exclusively and haven't dealt with
	any real virus infections for a few years.

<br><br>
	Actually there was the issue of the "Bliss" virus for
	Linux.  This was apparently a "lab strain" that 
	"got out" into "the wild."  (Yes, these terms are all
	used by computer virus researchers, as rather obvious
	analogues to their biological counterparts).

<br><br>
	In the case of "Bliss" there were a few people who 
	did catch this virus.  Naturally they were running
	this new program as '<tt>root</tt>' (breaking the cardinal 
	rule of systems administration) and the program 
	went and modified some other programs.  

<br><br>
	At the time one of my buddies from McAfee was staying
	with me (he lives down in L.A. and stays up here during 
	part of most weeks).  He's the head of their AV research 
	department.  So he and I chatted about it for a couple of 
	minutes and concluded that McAfee's existing virus scanner 
	for Linux could be updated to detect "Bliss" and he assigned 
	one of his AV researchers (also a former housemate of ours) 
	to the job and they updated their signature file (<tt>.DAT</tt>). I 
	don't recall that any changes were needed for the engine 
	(the <tt>.EXE</tt>).

<br><br>
	This was heralded by McAfee's marketing team as the 
	"first live, wild virus incident under Unix."  There 
	ensued the usual flamefest on USENet 
	(<a href="news:comp.virus">comp.virus</a>) which
	argued that this wasn't "really a virus" and that McAfee's
	Associates were hyping it up and taking advantage of the
	situation, etc.

<br><br>
	"Bliss" did have a command line option to uninstall 
	itself.  It did, however, modify other programs to 
	link its own code into them (which is the definition of
	a computer virus).  McAfee did take advantage of the
	opportunity to tout its own horn.  The people who 
	caught "Bliss" did display gross ignorance of proper
	system administration practice (or, in at least one
	case, foolhardy disregard for it).

<br><br>
	The bottom line is that a <strong>properly administered</strong> 
	Linux system is a very poor host for virus transmission.

<dd><font color="#333366">&gt;&gt; In short, stick with Unix/Linux.  Using 
	these with any modicum of proper system administration practices 
	will very likely be the end of your virus hunting days.
	</font></dl>
 
<p><strong>
Gotta use the best tools for each job, and right now that means I 
gotta do windoze at home, at least part of the time.  Thanks for 
the insight.

	Naturally it does come down to requirements analysis and 
	the availability of packages that meet those requirements.
	<a href="http://www.stardivision.com/">Star</a>Office, 
	<a href="http://www.applix.com/">Applix</a>ware, and 
	<a href="http://www.corel.com/news/1998/may/linux.htm"
	>Corel</a> all seem to be producing
	personal productivity suites for Linux that either rival,
	MS Office, or soon will.

<br><br>
	However, you define the criteria for "best" when it comes
	to your jobs.  It sounds like you're going to keep your
	eyes on the Linux market, and you may find at some point
	in the near future that you do have a choice for your
	applications.

<br><br>
	It's also important for you to supply your software 
	vendor with feedback.  If the primary reason you're running
	Windows is to support QuickBooks, call 
	<a href="http://www.intuit.com/">Intuit</a> and let 
	them know.  If you need access to some reference CD's
	(<a href="http://www.grolier.com/">Grolier</a>'s Encyclopedia, 
	some electronic <a href="http://www.m-w.com/">dictionary</a>, 
	whatever) let the publishers know that you need cross-OS support.

<br><br>
	(Those CD books are one of the first places in the retail, 
	shrinkwrapped software market where I hope to see Java take 
	over).
