<p>
...has anyone noticed anything different about TAG? No? Good. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
The Answer Gang list - in fact, all the LG lists - have now been
rehosted, and everything seems to be working fine (LG itself is still
hosted where it was, due to the kind offices of Thomas Fullhart of
Fullhart Software, <a href='http://fullhartsoftware.com/'>http://fullhartsoftware.com/</a>).  That's a very large
load off my mind, and much thanks to Ren&eacute; Pfeiffer whose help in this
move made the list transition much, much easier.
</p>

<p>
There's something I'd like to mention at this point; something really
important, and something that I'm going to cover in this month's Back
Page in LG. It's a change in policy - one of those things that I do
only on occasion, and not simply when it's warranted but when it's
required. Experience has shown that it is, indeed, required.
</p>

<p>
The addition to our policy is a simple one: Be nice. Be polite. Bastard
Operators from Hell are explicitly unwelcome. No rudeness is allowed in
LG from here forward - and this is the way it'll stay as long as I'm
EiC, and as long as I'm associated with LG in any way.
</p>

<p>
The recent flamewar here in TAG has convinced me that this needs to be
a hard limit, for my own sake as well as that of everyone else. I've
let my temper get away from me here in the past, and that's no more
acceptable than it is for anyone else to do so.
</p>

<p>
Ren&eacute; has agreed to serve as the TAG moderator, and I'm as much subject
to his decisions as anyone else. As for the broader issue of LG itself, 
my interpretation of this policy is "no more ranting (humor excepted)"
in the articles.
</p>

<p>
Whatever went on in the past, I want every aspect of LG to be that of a
pleasant, professional environment - for our staff as well as our
readers. Suggestions for making it more so are always welcome.

<p>
Hello TAG!
</p>

<p>
I have an unusual networking problem to solve here, and I'm needing some help.
</p>

<p>
Basically I got a machine with 2 network interfaces, eth0 and eth1,
and both are connected in the same hub.
</p>

<p>
But eth0 has the ip 192.168.0.97, and doesnt need a proxy to access
the internet.
Eth1's ip is 192.168.0.200, and that IP needs a proxy to access the
internet (and several sites are blocked, etc).
</p>

<p>
Alls configured, but it seems that everything's trying to use the eth1
to access the internet, and I need it to be accessed using eth0.
Everything should use eth0, I just need eth1 to be used for apache and mysql...
</p>

<p>
Any clue on how to configure that?
</p>

<p>
Thanks
</p>

<p>
Deividson

<p>
Hello all:
</p>

<p>
I have a simple requirement- I want to back up all my lab's data (~
1TB and increasing) to a 2TB hard-disk on another machine. How best
should I partition/create volumes on my 2 TB hard-disk so as to enable
my backups? I have no special requirements. Just simple dumping of the
contents from one to another. In the same vein, I would like to hear
how you do something similar.
</p>

<p>
(I plan to use rsync for the same)
</p>

<p>
Best,

Hey Gang!
I don't know how many of you use VirtualBox (OSE or otherwise), but I
was wondering if any of you had any cool tricks-of-the trade that
perhaps readers might be able to use.
To start off with, here's one that makes VBox really easy for my mom
to use, a little something I've called the "XP Start Button":
It's essentially an icon on the desktop/menu entry. I've upgraded her
laptop to find that she's never ever had a need to boot up windows,
but unfortunately the tax guy wants her to run windows specific
software.
Anyways, here's the tip:
Create a .desktop file in a folder/desktop, and fill it with the following:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Version=1.0
Type=Application
Terminal=false
Name[en_US]=Windows XP
Exec=VirtualBox --startvm "Windows XP"
Name=Windows XP
</pre>

<p>
Of course, replacing the name of the virtual machine with the one you
wish to start on opening of the .desktop file.
</p>

<p>
Hope to hear more tips, wonder what tweaks i might learn <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<h2>News in General</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Debian Kernel Vulnerabilities Being Patched</h3>

<p>Several long term kernel security vulnerabilities affecting Debian 
distros, including Ubuntu, are being addressed after receiving several 
CVE citations.  The vulnerabilities are in the more recent Debian 
distros, including Lenny, Etch, and Squeeze.  They also cover the 
following Ubuntu releases:</p>
<ul>
<li> Ubuntu 6.06 LTS;<br />
<li> Ubuntu 8.04 LTS;<br />
<li> Ubuntu 8.10;<br />
<li> Ubuntu 9.04;<br />
<li> Ubuntu 9.10.
</ul>

<p>The vulnerabilities involve Denial of Service attacks and, in at least 
one case, privilege escalation.  One CVE involves an attacker 
accessing a VM guest doing a DOS attack on the host machine.   The CVE 
numbers involved are:   CVE-2010-0307, CVE-2010-0309, CVE-2010-0410, 
CVE-2010-0415, CVE-2010-0622 and CVE-2010-0623.</p>

<p>More details are here: <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/USN-914-1/">http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/USN-914-1/</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/">CVE</a> is a list of information security vulnerabilities and exposures 
that aims to provide common names for publicly known problems. The 
goal of CVE is to make it easier to share data across separate 
vulnerability capabilities (tools, repositories, and services) with 
this "common enumeration".</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Metrics Reveal "Most Powerful Voices in Open Source"</h3>

<p>In March, MindTouch, an open source alternative to Microsoft 
SharePoint, announced the publication of the "Most Powerful Voices in 
Open Source" (MPV) ranking. The list presents the top 50 most vocal, 
followed, and repeated/re-posted open source commentators, representing 
several spheres of influence, including media, vendors, OSS projects, 
standards bodies, community management, and more.</p>

<p>Created by MindTouch, the MPV ranking draws from the wide array of 
metrics available through Web and Enterprise 2.0 channels, including 
Twitter, Google News alerts, unique online visitor counts and analysis 
of the related "buzz" of vendor/project affiliations. This compilation 
was created using the MindTouch platform, federating these data 
sources, applying varied weighting, and processing it for delivery of 
the ranking. The list, which includes members worldwide from 
organizations such as Ars Technica, Canonical, Google, and 
SpringSource, is available in its entirety here: 
<a href="http://www.mindtouch.com/blog">http://www.mindtouch.com/blog</a>.</p>

<p>The top 5 MPVs are:</p> 
<ul>
<li> Tim O'Reilly, founder and CEO of O'Reilly Media;<br />
<li> Linus Torvalds, founder of Linux, open source advocate;<br />
<li> Chris Messina, open Web advocate, Google;<br />
<li> Miguel de Icaza, founder, Mono and Gnome projects;<br />
<li> Jonathan Schwartz, former CEO of Sun Microsystems.
</ul>

<p>"It's about time someone has put together a metrics-based ranking of 
open source influencers," said Larry Augustin, CEO of SugarCRM. 
"Community advocacy is the major thrust of the spirit of open source, 
and communities have leaders. This list does a great job of 
identifying those leading voices."</p>

<p>"You'll see that this ranking is no popularity contest, there are a 
number of surprises outside of the 'usual suspects' often seen on this 
type of list," said Aaron Fulkerson, CEO of MindTouch. "This is 
because we let the numbers do the talking, instead of an 
emotions-based market perception that too frequently comes into play."</p>

<p>MindTouch is a leading provider of enterprise collaboration solutions 
in a market where more companies are operating under "lite" IT 
budgets.  The purpose of MindTouch is to provide wiki-like ease of 
collaboration between humans and machines. For more information,

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Linux Foundation to Host MeeGo Project</h3>
<p>The Linux Foundation will be hosting the MeeGo project, an open source
software platform for mobile computing devices. MeeGo combines Intel's
Moblin and Nokia's Maemo projects into one common Linux-based platform.</p>

<p>MeeGo, announced in February by Intel and Nokia, will be deployed 
across many computing device types - including mobile computers, media 
phones, connected TVs, and in-vehicle infotainment systems. MeeGo is 
designed from the ground up for a new class of interactive computing 
devices.</p>

<p>MeeGo will be hosted by the Linux Foundation as an open source project 
in line with the best practices of the open source development model. 
MeeGo is working with existing upstream projects such as the Linux 
kernel, ofono, connman, X.org, D-BUS, tracker, GStreamer, Pulseaudio, 
and others. The companies and projects associated with MeeGo will 
continue to support those upstream projects.</p>

<p>As an open source software platform, MeeGo will help to reduce market 
fragmentation and complexity. Along with MeeGo, the Linux Foundation 
is working with companies and projects to  optimize best practices for 
Linux-based development and lower costs for companies using 
Linux-based mobile operating systems. More information can be found at 
<a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/embedded/">http://www.linuxfoundation.org/embedded/</a>.</p>

<p>MeeGo and other Linux embedded issues will be discussed at the 
upcoming Linux Foundation Collaboration Summit in San Francisco. More 
information on the meeting can be found at 
<a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/">http://events.linuxfoundation.org/</a>.</p>

<p>The Linux Foundation's MeeGo project welcomes contributors and 
encourages developers and others to get involved at the site or find 
out more about joining the Linux Foundation at 
<a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/meego/">http://www.linuxfoundation.org/meego/</a>. Moblin and Maemo contributors 
are encouraged to participate at <a href="http://www.meego.com/">http://www.meego.com/</a>.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">IBM Launches Development &amp; Test Cloud Utilizing Red Hat Technology</h3>

<p>IBM has selected Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization as a platform in 
its new cloud computing  service for development and test.   This 
means that the  Red Hat Enterprise KVM Hypervisor Technology is a 
major part of the IBM Cloud.</p>

<blockquote>"Our decade-long partnership with Red Hat has always been focused on 
customer value and innovation.  Today, we are extending this 
partnership to include cloud computing..." said Maria Azua, vice 
president of Cloud Computing Enablement at IBM.  "Red Hat Enterprise 
Virtualization is an optimal hypervisor technology for the 
infrastructure offerings on the IBM cloud."</blockquote>

<p>Red Hat first announced plans to deliver Red Hat Enterprise 
Virtualization in February 2009.  In November 2009, Red Hat Enterprise 
Virtualization for Servers was released, providing its customers with 
a cost-effective choice in the virtualization market. Red Hat 
Enterprise Virtualization offers very recent technology for the 
deployment of open cloud computing infrastructures.</p>

<blockquote>Scott Crenshaw, vice president and general manager, Cloud Business 
Unit at Red Hat said, "Together, Red Hat and IBM aim to break down 
barriers to virtualization and cloud adoption by providing customers 
with a stable and robust environment to meet their enterprise 
applications requirements. We believe that combining Red Hat 
Enterprise Virtualization software with IBM's server, storage and 
network hardware, plus IBM's well-known enterprise support and 
services, as the foundational components of IBM's cloud infrastructure 
offers a compelling application environment for customers".</blockquote>

<h2>Software and Product News</h2>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Latest Oracle Lite Synchronizes  with Open Source SQLite</h3>

<p>With the new version of Oracle Database Lite, mobile users gain 
continuous access to enterprise data even in the absence of a network 
connection. New in this release of Oracle Database Lite is the ability 
to bi-directionally synchronize data between the open source SQLite 
database and the Oracle Database.</p>

<p>This release also provides centralized user and device provisioning 
and management of SQLite-based mobile applications, allowing 
disconnected users to have an experience virtually identical to users 
who are connected.</p>

<p>Oracle Database Lite consists of Oracle Database Lite Client, a
small-footprint SQL database that runs on many devices and platforms and
can be bi-directionally synchronized with an Oracle Database server and
Oracle Database Lite Mobile Server, which enables mobile users and devices
to operate in occasionally connected environments, periodically
synchronizing with a back-end database server.</p>

<p>The Oracle Database Lite Mobile Server can also be used to provision 
SQLite-based applications, devices on which these applications run, 
and users of these applications. User authentication on client devices 
can use a Common Access Card.</p>

<blockquote>"Oracle Database Lite's Mobile Server is a great tool for data 
synchronization in large scale enterprises," said Zdravko Mandic, 
manager Research and Development, Infoart d.o.o. "Our implementation, 
which consists of more than 1500 client devices, would have hardly 
been possible without it. Oracle Database Lite works silently, in the 
background, synchronizing huge amounts of data to our central Oracle 
Database and vice versa. This automatic synchronization, combined with 
great device management, is essential to keeping such large 
deployments healthy and helps enable enterprises to stay up and 
running all the time."</blockquote>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Oracle Releases Updated Berkeley DB with Android  Support</h3>

<p>Oracle has released Oracle Berkeley DB, the small-footprint, open 
source embeddable database engine for mission-critical 'edge' 
applications.  This new version introduces a new SQL API, based on 
SQLite, which is familiar to a large developer community and helps 
simplify application development.</p>

<p>New features include support for JDBC and ODBC connections to Oracle
Berkeley DB.  In addition, Oracle Berkeley DB 11g Release 2 introduces
support for the Android platform, allowing developers to develop and deploy
a wide range of applications on mobile devices.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional stand-alone databases, Berkeley DB runs directly in 
the application that uses it, enabling applications to execute faster 
in embedded environments such as handsets and mobile devices.</p>

<p>Key new features and benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li> New SQL API;<br />
<li> SQLite Tools Integration making it easier to develop, deploy, and 
manage Berkeley DB applications;<br />
<li> Flexible configuration including the library, cache size, database 
location and transactions under the control of embedding application;<br />
<li> Improved SQL concurrency using the Berkeley DB fine-grained locking 
mechanism and write-ahead logging;<br />
<li> Simplified Data Synchronization using the Oracle Database Lite 
Mobile Server.
</ul>
 
<p>"Oracle Berkeley DB's new SQLite-compatible SQL API offers powerful 
features for its users and the SQLite community at large.  The 
combination of the two technologies provides developers with 
tremendous flexibility in that a single SQL/API can now be used across 
a broad spectrum of applications.  Oracle has done a fantastic job of 
not only integrating the technologies, but also being an exemplary 
participant in the open source community by contributing time, 
expertise and resources to the SQLite project," said Mike Owens, 
author of "The Definitive Guide to SQLite."</p>

<p>Oracle Berkeley DB 11g Release 2 was available for download on March 
31, 2010.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Red Hat Extends Its SOA Platform For Cloud Adoption</h3>

<p>At EclipseCon in March, Red Hat announced JBoss Enterprise SOA 
Platform 5.0, a major update to its JBoss Enterprise Middleware 
portfolio. JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.0 is an IDE that integrates 
applications, services, transactions, and business process components 
into an architecture for automating business and IT processes.</p>

<p>JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.0 includes an updated enterprise 
services bus with enhanced protocol listeners, Web services 
integration, and a new rules engine that can be managed by JBoss 
Enterprise BRMS (business rules management system). </p>

<p>Also expanding Red Hat's middleware portfolio is JBoss Developer 
Studio 3.0. This platform now includes support for all of the JBoss 
Enterprise Platforms; JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, SOA, 
Portal and Data Services platforms. Additionally, the toolset is built 
on the latest major release of Eclipse 3.5, and includes new 
development capabilities for building SOA services and data 
transformation tools for developing enhanced integration services.</p>

<p>To expand the use of cloud-based applications and services, the JBoss 
Enterprise SOA Platform   integrates applications and services in 
cloud and on-premise deployments. Cloud-based IT has the potential to 
further increase business process automation.</p>

<blockquote>"Application development within the SOA-equipped enterprise has 
evolved significantly over the past two years, demanding a more 
eclectic and flexible arsenal of expertise and matching tools," said 
Brad Shimmin, Principal Analyst Application Infrastructure at Current 
Analysis. "Services and their underlying data must be considered 
together, as do cloud and premise deployments, as do rich internet 
applications and complex integrated services. JBoss Developer Studio 
3.0 melds these disparate concerns using the agility of the Eclipse 
3.5 platform and a broad quiver of supported frameworks that includes 
RichFaces, Seam, Spring, Struts and GWT."</blockquote>

<p>Red Hat featured both JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.0 and JBoss at 
Eclipsecon 2010 in Santa Clara, CA. For additional information on 
JBoss Developer Studio 3.0 and to download an evaluation copy, visit

<h1>Magic and Mayhem</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/anonymous.html">Anonymous</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<p>
It all started with SAK, the Secure Attention Key, that was supposed
to get me out of trouble in Ubuntu. The help I got was a kernel panic.
</p>

<p>
Investigations followed; doubts followed the investigations. I report
starting with a recap on SysRq, mainly from
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/documentation/sysrq.txt">http://www.kernel.org/doc/documentation/sysrq.txt</a>
</p>

<p>
This doc lacks important information, but it is included here.
</p>


<h3>(1) What is the 'magic' SysRq key?</h3>

<p>
It is a key combo the kernel will immediately respond to, whatever it
is doing - assuming it was compiled with the CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ
option. This is the case with the major GNU/Linux distros.
</p>


<h3>(2) Need the SysRq key be enabled?</h3>

<p>
No, when running a kernel with SysRq compiled in, the key is (usually) enabled.
However, distributions like openSUSE have a restricted value in /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq -
meaning that, according to their documentation, sysrq is disabled by default.
But you can disable or restrict it courtesy of <code>/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq</code>.
By default, this file contains 1 and SysRq is fully enabled (with some
exceptions - see above). To disable SysRq, write 0 to the file.
</p>

<p>
To restrict functionality selectively, pick values from this table:
</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3">
<tr>
<th><strong>Value</strong></th><th><strong>Option</strong></th></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Enable control of console logging level</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Enable control of keyboard (e.g. SAK)</tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Enable debugging dumps of processes etc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Enable sync command</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>Enable remount read-only</td></tr>
<tr><td>64</td><td>Enable signalling of processes (term, kill, oom-kill)</td></tr>
<tr><td>128</td><td>Allow reboot/poweroff</td></tr>
<tr><td>256</td><td>Allow rescheduling</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Pick your options, sum their values, write the sum to
<tt>/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq</tt>; after that, only your options will be
allowed.
</p>

<p>
The value in /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq determines the shortcuts available
to all users and is not subject to permissions. However, writing to this
file requires root privileges. And since the file is not really a file
and dies when shutting down or rebooting, the writing has to be
repeated after each boot.
</p>

<p>
The option 'sysrq_always_enabled' in the kernel line of the boot
loader will let the kernel ignore /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq.
</p>


<h3>(3) How do I use the SysRq key on x86 PCs?</h3>

<p>
Press the key combo <code>Alt-SysRq-command_key</code>, where 'SysRq' is
same as 'PrintScreen' and <code>command_key</code> is a case-insensitive
letter or a digit from
</p>

<pre>
    b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,z,0-9
</pre>

<p>
Needless to say, it is awkward or even infeasible to hold down three
keys at once when two of them are a stretched hand apart. Just do:
</p>

<pre>
    hold down Alt (either on the right or on the left)
    press and release SysRq quickly
    press command_key quickly
    release everything
</pre>

<p>
Quickly means: don't dither, or Ubuntu will pop up a Screen Shot dialog.
</p>

<p>
NOTE: the position of keys is as on the US keyboard! Keep this in mind when
using a non-US keyboard. For instance, 'q' is the key just right of
Tab even if that same key carries the label 'a' on a French keyboard.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, you are not sending an 'a' or a 'q': you are sending a well-defined
scancode to the kernel. Keyboards needn't apply if they produce scancodes
different from those of the common PC keyboards.
</p>

<p>
Only details for a couple of the commands are of interest in the
current context:
</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3" summary="This table shows some of the
possible commands to be used with SysRq">
<tr><td>i</td><td>Kill all processes, except init.</td></tr>
<tr><td>k</td><td>Secure Attention Key (SAK) kills all applications on the
current virtual console.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0-9</td><td>Sets the console log level, controlling which kernel messages will show on your console: 0 would let only emergency messages reach the console while 9 is verbose.</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>(4) Kernel Panic</h3>

<p>
So why do I very reliably trigger a kernel panic when I press SAK on
Ubuntu 9.10, both in the text console and on the desktop? The
difference between the two is that the kernel panic is immediate in
the text console. On the desktop it may look like everything is ok,
then you press e.g. Alt-Ctrl-F1 to switch to a text console and it
happens.
</p>

<p>
Well, this is a bug already reported in February 2009 for a previous
version:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/Ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/329576/">https://bugs.launchpad.net/Ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/329576/</a>
</p>

<p>
An addendum to the bug report says the bug manifests on AMD boards, but
not necessarily on Intel boards. I can confirm that I do get my kernel
panic on AMD hardware, but I have also seen it on an Intel motherboard
with a VIA graphic adapter.
</p>

<p>
A related bug was reported for Debian in August 2009:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=543324/">http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=543324/</a>
</p>

<p>
but here the console-kit-daemon was pointed out as the culprit. I
disabled it, the bug is still active on my Ubuntu.
</p>

<p>
Changing the log level with <code>Alt-SysRq-9</code> allows for a flood of
low level details for the initiated. What is clear, reading and watching,
is that an attempt to kill the 'init' process occurs - certainly not the
kernel's intention. Who is trying to kill init? Something specific to
Ubuntu, shall we say, since openSUSE doesn't do it.
</p>

<p>
Now, when I try <code>Alt-SysRq-i</code> to kill all processes except init,
I get a kernel panic exactly as with SAK, exactly with the same message
about init's attempted murder.
</p>

<p>
That Ubuntu bug of February 2009 got no follow-up, not even an assignment
to a developer, not even a priority rank. What does it take for serious
bugs to get fixed in Ubuntu?
</p>


<h3>(5) Security by Good Luck</h3>

<p>
At the end of the day, what we know is disturbing:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Everybody wants the magic of SysRq, otherwise the major distros
    would not compile it in.
<li>The administrator can reduce SysRq's functionality, but not just
    for the unwashed masses. Any reduction in SysRq's functionality
    will equally affect the administrator. Functionality cannot be
    changed on the fly, because when a critical situation arises you
    already need it.
<li>Even disregarding bugs like Ubuntu SAK's bug, SysRq has options to
    bring down and damage the entire system. If you start disabling
    them, SysRq loses its magic in the difficult situations it is
    called for. So if you as an administrator want SysRq, you are
    offering vandals and experimenters a comfortable way to wreak
    havoc.
</ul>

<p>
Is a GNU/Linux system the most insecure system in the history of
computers? Why is the SysRq magic not reserved for root?<a id="anonymous.html_1_back"></a><a href="#anonymous.html_1">[1]</a>
</p>

<hr>

<p>
<a id="anonymous.html_1"></a><a href="#anonymous.html_1_back">[1]</a>
That's an easy question to answer - although, unfortunately, the answer
does nothing to address this concern.  Since most Linux users are
(hopefully) not logged in as root most of the time, restricting SysRq to
root-only would make it essentially useless at precisely the times when
it's needed. Perhaps a reasonable approach to a SysRq policy is to disable
the "dangerous" features by default, and enable them on specific machines
that need more specific troubleshooting?

<h1>Linux's problem with Simplified Chinese</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/brownss.html">Silas Brown</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<p>Chinese characters are used not only in Mainland China but
also in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, and sometimes in Korea and
other places.  There are differences in the way these
countries write certain characters, and ideally this should
just be a matter of selecting a different font.  However, for
various reasons some (but not all) of the "Simplified
Chinese" characters used on the mainland have been given
their own Unicode numbers that are different from the Unicode
numbers of their nearest equivalent characters in Japan, etc. 
This leads to a problem.</p>

<p>Imagine a typical text in Simplified Chinese. Some of the
characters have their own special code numbers that occur
only in Simplified texts, whereas other characters have code
numbers that can also occur in Japanese and other texts.  Now
imagine that a rendering system such as Pango is going to
render this text.  Pango takes the text character by
character, and tries to find each character in the available
fonts.  Suppose it first of all finds a character that occurs
in a Japanese font.  There is a Japanese font on the system,
so it takes that character from the Japanese font and renders
it.  But then the next character is not in the Japanese font
because it is a special Simplified character that occurs only
in a Simplified Chinese font.  There is a Simplified
Chinese font on the system too, so off it goes and renders
that second character from the Simplified Chinese font.</p>

<p>The problem is that some of the characters (the ones that
have special Simplified-only codepoints) will be rendered
from the Simplified Chinese font, but others (the ones that
share codepoints with Japanese etc) will be rendered from
another font. If the fonts happen to have the exact same
style and weight, etc., then nobody will notice, but usually
there are noticeable differences in style between the fonts,
so this mixing of fonts, with some characters taken from one
font and others taken from another, can make the display of
Simplified Chinese on Linux look very unprofessional.</p>

<p>Many users can tolerate this situation on the screen, but
printing is a different matter.  For example, the music
typesetting system GNU Lilypond uses Pango to render the text
of lyrics, etc., and if you want to produce beautiful-looking
copy with Simplified Chinese text, this
character-by-character mixing of fonts could be a
showstopper.</p>

<p>The Pango renderer does have facilities for application
programmers to specify the language and therefore influence
the choice of fonts, such as by calling
pango_context_set_language() or by using Pango markup. 
However, this is small consolation for those using
applications that do not expose this functionality to the
user.</p>

<p>One thing you can do is edit your <tt>~/.fonts.conf</tt>
file to tell the system which fonts you prefer.  This will
affect all applications, so you may need to change it back
when you want to see Traditional Chinese or Japanese, etc. 
Below is a <tt>~/.fonts.conf</tt> file which specifies the
Arphic Simplified Chinese font as a preference (Debian/Ubuntu
package <tt>ttf-arphic-gbsn00lp</tt>). It also specifies
DejaVu for the Latin fonts, along with Gandhari, a font which
is good for Pinyin markup.</p>

<pre>
&lt;fontconfig&gt;
	&lt;alias&gt;
		&lt;family&gt;serif&lt;/family&gt;
		&lt;prefer&gt;
            &lt;family&gt;gandhari unicode&lt;/family&gt;
			&lt;family&gt;dejavu serif&lt;/family&gt;
			&lt;family&gt;ar pl sungtil gb&lt;/family&gt;
		&lt;/prefer&gt;
	&lt;/alias&gt;
	&lt;alias&gt;
		&lt;family&gt;sans-serif&lt;/family&gt;
		&lt;prefer&gt;
            &lt;family&gt;gandhari unicode&lt;/family&gt;
			&lt;family&gt;dejavu sans&lt;/family&gt;
			&lt;family&gt;ar pl sungtil gb&lt;/family&gt;
		&lt;/prefer&gt;
	&lt;/alias&gt;
	&lt;alias&gt;
		&lt;family&gt;monospace&lt;/family&gt;
		&lt;prefer&gt;
			&lt;family&gt;dejavu sans mono&lt;/family&gt;
			&lt;family&gt;ar pl sungtil gb&lt;/family&gt;
		&lt;/prefer&gt;
	&lt;/alias&gt;
&lt;/fontconfig&gt;
</pre>

<p>On a Debian or Ubuntu system, most of the families can be
seen by looking at
<tt>/var/lib/defoma/x-ttcidfont-conf.d/dirs/TrueType/fonts.dir</tt>.
To install Gandhari, download it from <a
href="http://andrewglass.org/fonts.php">Andrew Glass's
site</a>, visit <tt>fonts:/</tt> in Konqueror (package
<tt>konqueror</tt> if you don't already have KDE) and drag
<tt>gur.ttf</tt> into that folder.</p>

<p>This approach does not solve everything; for example, the
on-screen display of Chinese in Tk applications might still
be inconsistent (it does not seem possible to set a preferred
<em>order</em> of fonts in Tk/X11; you can set <em>one</em>
preferred font but there's no obvious way to control what it
falls back on when displaying characters that are not
available in that font).  However, the use of <tt>~/.fonts.conf</tt>
should at least help with applications that you are likely to
use for printing.</p>

<p>
<p>
Spring has sprung and the venerable MySQL User Conference is coming up. That
conference is still independent of the Oracle OpenWorld behemoth, partly
due to the promises Oracle made to the EU about keeping MySQL alive and
independent. But don't blink: the separate focus on the respected Open Source
database may not last.  So do drop in to see the event and its expo if you
have a chance.  Expo passes may still be free in early April.
</p>

<p style="width: 400px; padding: 5px 1em; border: 1px solid #666; background-color: #aaa;">
<strong>MySQL Conference &amp; Expo 2010<br></strong>
April 12-15, Convention Center, Santa Clara, CA<br>
<a href="http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2010/">http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2010/</a>
</p>


<p>
I would also recommend the Linux Foundation's 4th Annual Collaboration
Summit - if you can wangle an invite.  It is a gathering place for kernel
developers and Open Source rock stars, but the sessions are detailed and
real collaboration occurs.
</p> 

<p>
The Summit does overlap the MySQL event by 2 days, but it should be
possible to catch the opening MySQL keynotes and then attend the Summit for
the rest of the week.  I would have to rate the food and snacks a bit
better at the O'Reilly-run MySQL Conference, and in both cases the company
is stellar.  At the Summit this would include core kernel developers,
distribution maintainers, ISVs, end users, system vendors, and other
community organizations.  It's geared to collaboration and solutions by
bringing together a cross-section of leaders to tackle and solve the most
pressing issues facing Linux today.
</p>

<p>
Attendees of the CELF Embedded Linux Conference and the LSF '09 Workshop
will be automatically approved. Or, just enroll in the LF324 Linux Performance
Tuning Linux Training Course and get a free invitation to the Linux
Foundation Collaboration Summit.
</p>

<p>
Here's the location for the slides from last year's Collaboration Summit:<br>

<p>
Finally, I also have to recommend the excellent Emerging Communications
Conference, which returns the the San Francisco Airport Marriott again. It
has been a cross between a Maker event, an Open Source network event, and
something entirely its own.

<h1>Pixie Chronicles: Part 1 Lessons from Mistakes</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/grebler.html">Henry Grebler</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<h3>Adam</h3>

<p>
I had a friend, Adam, who passed away far too young. Adam seemed to be
competent at an amazing number of activities, mostly self-taught. He
built himself a house almost single-handedly.
</p>

<p>
He once shared with me the secret of building. Adam would say that it
was not possible to build a house without making mistakes. The secret,
he said, was hiding your mistakes. For example, builders can never get
the floor and walls to fit together exactly. So they invented skirting
boards; for walls and ceiling: mouldings and cornices.
</p>

<p>
Subsequently, somebody must have decided to extend the concept and
they became decorative. Now that's <em>really</em> hiding your mistakes -
pretend that they are a feature!
</p>

<p>
Perhaps because I know (or think I know) more than the average bear
about Linux, I get "adventurous", particularly on my projects at home.
When I extend my activities beyond my areas of competence I frequently
make mistakes. That's not intrinsically a bad thing: you have to break
eggs to make an omelette. But it's important to be able to recover
from mistakes.
</p>

<p>
As a result, I've adapted Adam's advice to fields which interest me.
</p>

<h3>Project</h3>

<p>
My project for last week was to build a server. Sounds simple. What
could possibly go wrong? Watch and learn.
</p>

<p>
I run (the fairly old) Fedora Core 5 on my desktop, so I thought I'd
install the latest Fedora on my server. I say "server" but it's
actually a Pentium II, one of a pair a friend was throwing out. The
other one replaced my aging (12-year-old Pentium 1 100) firewall.
</p>

<p>
But my project is more about concept than commercial-strength mail and
web-serving, so grunt<a id="grebler.html_1_back"></a><a href="#grebler.html_1">[1]</a> is not important to me.
</p>

<p>
Installing from CDs holds no fascination for me: I've done it so many
times, the novelty has worn off. I decided I'd do a "Look, Ma! No
hands!" install.
</p>

<p>
The Pentium II was a Compaq which must have been quite leading edge
when it was purchased. Of particular interest was the fact that it had
on-board hardware PXE capability. I conceived a plan which would see
the machine perform a network boot, then perform a network
install driven by a kickstart file. Everything would be
automatic: partitioning, timezone, system language, configuration of 2
NICs, root password - the lot.
</p>

<p>
As an exercise in building a single server, this approach is not very
efficient. However, as an exercise in building multiple servers, it is
excellent. One of the dangers of having a human (me) perform the same
task repeatedly is that boredom sets in and the human (me) loses
concentration, leading to mistakes. It is worth investing effort into
automating the process. Although I currently have neither the hardware
nor the need to build a farm of servers, I would like to learn the
technique for the future. So for me, this is a learning exercise.
</p>

<p>
The following sections are written from the perspective of the machine
to be built, which I'll call the target machine.
</p>

<h3>Typical Install</h3>

<p>
To provide some context, here is an overview of a typical
install. Bear in mind that my old Compaq only has a CD drive (not
DVD).
</p>

<ol>
<li> Turn on the target machine.
<li> Insert the first install CD.
<ul>
	<li> Machine boots from the removable disk, loading the install environment.
</ul>
<li> Proceed through many screens answering questions about partitioning, timezone, system language, etc.
<ul>
	<li>The machine begins to install from the first CD. 
	<li>After a while, the machine asks for the second CD.
</ul>
<li> Change CDs.
<li> Repeat until all 6 install CDs have been processed.
</ol>

<p>
Note that the numbered steps involve human intervention. The indented
sentences describe the target machine's behaviour.
</p>

<h3>Intended Install</h3>

<p>
Here is my rough plan for how things were supposed to go. 
</p>

<ol>
<li> Turn on the target machine.
<ul>
	<li> Machine starts the boot process, asks the network for an IP
	address, then downloads the install environment.

	<li> The install environment uses the kickstart file to guide
	the rest of the install. It obtains the install
	files from the network. No further intervention is required.
</ul>
</ol>
</pre>

<h3>Actual First Attempt</h3>

<p>
And here's what happened the first time.
</p>

<ol>
<li> I turned on the target machine.
<ul>
	<li> The machine booted, asked the network for an IP address, then
	downloaded the install environment.

	<li> The install environment used the kickstart file to guide
	the rest of the install. 
</ul>
</ol>

<p>
However, it was here that I discovered the first of several mistakes.
</p>

<p>
I had not defined the partitioning information completely, so the
machine stopped to ask for clarification. 
</p>

<p>
I guess I could have gone back and fixed the problem and restarted,
but it occurred to me that I might have made other mistakes. I decided
to answer the partitioning questions and proceed.
</p>

<p>
Remarkably, that was the only problem. Or so it seemed. The
install proceeded. It seemed to take a very long time, but I was
not too surprised by this: the target machine is, after all, a Pentium II.
</p>

<p>
It is at this stage that a kickstart install starts to pay back. The
install may take a long time, but I don't have to stay around to
change CDs. There are always other tasks to be done, and in this case
I left the room for several hours.
</p>

<p>
On my return, the machine was again asking for clarification about
partitioning!
</p>

<p>
What had happened?!
</p>

<h3>Things Go Wrong</h3>

<p>
There is a temptation when things go wrong to start <em>doing</em>. This
is almost invariably bad. It often leads to <em>regretting</em>!
It takes some discipline and experience to stop and <em>think</em>.
</p>

<p>
"Doing" quite often leads to activities which modify the "crime scene".
One then gets to a point where one wants to know what something looked
like before the "doing" began. Too late.
</p>

<p>
"Thinking" doesn't prevent all mistakes, only some.
</p>

<p>

What had gone wrong?
</p>

<p>
How does one even begin to think in such a case? Well, every activity
typically has a beginning, a middle, and an end.
</p>

<p>
The install had started ok. I'd then had the partitioning
problem. After that, the install seemed to proceed as expected.
So beginning and middle seemed to be off the hook. I concluded that I
should look at the end. 
</p>

<p>
What should have happened after the install completed?
</p>

<p>
I remembered that one of the kickstart parameters related to this.
I had requested that the machine reboot after install.
</p>

<p>
In an install from CD, once the install environment has processed
the last CD, it asks the user to remove any install media from
the drive. By default, when the machine subsequently reboots, it takes
its data from the recently installed hard drive.
</p>

<p>
However, in my case, on reboot, the machine performed its PXE boot -
which restarted the install process. Thank heavens for my
partitioning mistake. Without it, the install would have
proceeded as before, come to the end - and started all over again. It
might still be at it now, repeatedly booting and installing!
</p>

<p>
I guess after a few days I might have grown suspicious.
</p>

<p>
It's an ill wind that blows no good; and sometimes, as in this case, a
mistake can be your friend.
</p>

<h3>Analysis</h3>

<p>
My first mistake was unexceptional. To install FC10 I needed to get a
number of steps right. As we shall soon see, I've glossed over some of
the steps to tell this part of the story simply. It is unsurprising
that I did not get everything right the first time. (I would have been
very surprised had everything just worked!)
</p>

<p>
The second mistake was much more interesting. It relates to the case
where an action is repeated but the conditions change between the
first and a later occurrence of that action. It's the sort of problem
that is common in loops.
</p>

<p>
In this case, the first time I booted the machine, I wanted it to use
PXE; the second time, I didn't. I hadn't realised that I had wanted
different behaviours.
</p>

<p>
Even stated like this, it was not clear to me what to do next. At
first sight, the simple solution is to request that the install
environment <em>not</em> reboot at the end of the install. But, as we
shall see in the next part, that solution is somewhat short-sighted.
</p>

<h3>Lessons</h3>

<p>
When something goes wrong, don't rush to act. Stop, think, and plan
before acting.

<p>
I'm not in the habit of bagging Microsoft. No, really. Oh, all right,
I am.

Have a look at this picture. I swear that it's for real. It popped up
on more than one occasion on my company laptop. I don't know
whether it came from XP, some other piece of Microsoft software, or
some other software altogether. But it just beggars belief!
</p>

<p>
I just looked on my Linux desktop: uptime - 126 days. I don't even
think that's a particularly impressive number.
</p>

<p>
All right, my desktop is not a laptop. So?!
</p>

<p>
And what is it with turning it off for at least 15 minutes? Nap time?!
Imagine if they used this technology in, oh, fridges! Ships! Rockets
to the moon! Military equipment! <em>I'm sorry. Your war is important to
us. To maintain your military lethality and extend its life, please
shut down your war for at least 15 minutes.</em>
</p>


<h3>Monday</h3>

<p>
OK, I've arrived at the office. 7:45 am. Nice and early. Good. I'm a
morning person. It's great to come in before most of the others get
in. Gives me time to do some work that requires concentration before
the distraction level ramps up.
</p>

<p>
Wonder why they put us into these open-plan areas. Do they really
think they are saving money? Or is it to do with pecking order?
They're paying me a shirt-load of money, and yet I can hear the guy way
over there on the phone to one of his customers. Try to concentrate.
Crumbs, he's loud! They used to call me loud, but now I'm in the
presence of a real master.
</p>

<p>
Get out the laptop. Turn it on. Get some real work done. Come on, boot
up already! First password. Second password. Come on, XP! Finally:
login password. What's it doing?
</p>

<p>
What's this? Virus scanner. Updating signatures. No response for me.
Come <em>on</em>!
</p>

<p>
Why did I turn on this #@$#&amp;^ing computer? Who's the human? WTF is
going on here?
</p>

<p>
What now? Some of my software is out of date. I don't even use that
software. Why would I care if it is out of date? I just wanna do some
work, for crissake! Who's in charge here?
</p>

<p>
Start up Adobe. Wait for it to update something. This is crazy!
</p>

<p>
There seems to be this view that I'm the laptop's lackey. I'm here to
service its requirements. It gives the orders; I follow. Its needs are
more important; mine are secondary.
</p>

<p>
Are we for real? The lunatics are in charge of the asylum!
</p>

<h3>A better way</h3>

<p>
Are we saying that we have reached the pinnacle of technical
engineering? That this is the best we can do?
</p>

<p>
Well, we know that there are various forms of improvement. On my Linux
systems, I run no regular antivirus software. Or antispyware. Or any
other sort of anti-malware software. (The only reason I have
<i>any</i> antivirus software at all is so that I can scan my teenage
son's Microsoft computer.)
</p>

<p>
The argument is that if Linux were as ubiquitous as Microsoft, then
the malware generators would attack Linux. As it is, they're just after
the low-hanging fruit.
</p>

<p>
All right. Let's accept that. For the sake of argument, let's
assume that it <i>is</i> necessary to update things on a Microsoft PC.
Fine. Can't we do that in a less obnoxious way?
</p>

<p>
Let's start with some low-hanging fruit of our own.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, I reboot my computer repeatedly in a short space of time.
(Never mind why; it can happen.) Is it really asking too much of the
cretinous antivirus software to keep track of when it was last invoked
(or when I last rebooted), and to not even run if less than X hours
have elapsed?! And, OK, if some user actually wants every one of the
three reboots in the last hour to be followed by a scan, let him/her
configure the software to do that. Hell, I don't even mind if it's the
default. Just give me the option to do what I want.
</p>

<p>
That's what's really missing from a lot of software which runs on
Microsoft platforms: user choice. The technology which should be the
most liberating has been engineered to be antidemocratic. And
down-right irritating.
</p>

<p>
OK. There are times during the day when I get up from my seat and walk
away from my desk. Corporation rules say that I'm supposed to
screenlock the laptop when I leave. Even if I don't, after a few
minutes, the laptop does it anyway. Hey, you now <i>know</i> that I'm
not at the computer. You <i>know</i> I'm not pressing keys. Wouldn't
you think that <i>now</i> would be a good time to use up CPU cycles? I
don't need them. I've gone off to make myself a coffee and discuss the
weekend's footy with Alex.
</p>

<p>
I come back to the computer, enter my password. Don't abort what you
were doing; <i>pause</i> it. You are a machine of infinite patience. (Or
software of infinite patience.) Make a little note somewhere of where
you were up to - and take a break. When I wander off next time,
continue from where you left off.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, I head off for lunch. Hey, knock yourself out. Scan all the
hard drives. As far as I care, make the whole machine walk across the
desk from the vibrations. Do whatever you need to do. Just make sure
you pause when I come back.
</p>

<p>
I'm at work for about 8 hours. Despite the little <A
HREF="#ohno">pop-up</A> I showed before, I often turn on the laptop on
Monday morning and don't turn it off again until Friday evening. In 24
hours, I only use 8-10 hours. You can have a minimum of 14 hours to do
whatever you want. Just not on my watch.
</p>

<p>
What am I missing?
</p>

<p>
Is this so hard?
</p>

<p>
Is it beyond the capabilities of the mind of Homo Sapiens?
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it would not be possible 100% of the time. Sometimes, perhaps,
something might need to be updated urgently. Personally, I think this
most unlikely - but I entertain the possibility. But even if we can
only arrange things so that I am undisturbed 90% of the time, that's
still a huge improvement over what I see currently.
</p>

<h3>You can <font color="blue">not</font> be serious!</h3>

[<em>Pace</em>, John McEnroe.]

<p>
What is it with Microsoft and reboots?! Look at this:
</p>

<a name="mouse"></a>
<div  style="margin-left: 20%">
<img src="misc/grebler/your-mouse-has-moved.png" alt="Your mouse has
moved" width="400" height="103"/>
</div>

<p>
OK, it's a joke, a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of the state of play at
Microsoft. Compare that to BeOS which was designed to never need
rebooting. Perhaps it's asking a bit too much of Microsoft to
<i>never</i> need rebooting.
</p>

<p>
But why does it need to reboot if I change my  IP address? Or a host
of other fairly innocuous changes I make to the system?
</p>

<p>
All day long, I am bombarded with stupid questions: <em>Are you sure? Did
you really mean that? Is it OK to reboot now? Do you want fries with
that?</em> No, wait, that last one was from some other company.
</p>

<p>
Now here's an idea: how about, when I ask to shutdown or reboot, I get a
prompt? Wouldn't that be a perfect time to say something like this?

<pre style="margin-left: 20%;padding-top: 3px;background-color: #bbb; border: 2px outset black; width: 37.3em; font-family: Arial, sans serif; font-size: 11px;">
<span style="background-color:navy;padding:3px 2px 4px 389px;"><span style="background-color: #bbb; padding: 0px 4px 0px 3px;border:2px outset black;">X</span></span>

        Hey! All day long I've been nagging you to upgrade your software, all the
        while discouraging you with threats that such upgrades will almost
        certainly necessitate a reboot (which I call a "restart" because God forbid
        we should spook the bunnies who use our, um, software with technical
        terms).  Well, I notice that you're about to shutdown or restart. Is now a
        good time to do those upgrades? I mean, do you have the time? (If you're
        heading home, you could take a pit-stop.)
        
        If now is not convenient, that's OK. I'll remind you next time.

<span style="padding:0px 160px"><span style="padding: 2px 5px;border:2px outset black">OK</span> <span style="padding: 2px 5px; border:2px outset black">Cancel</span></span>

</pre>
</p>

<p>
First of all, isn't that a good idea? And second, just maybe, isn't
that a more appropriate <i>tone</i> for a pile of silicon to adopt
when addressing a superior life-form?
</p>

<p>
Perhaps I shouldn't be surprised. I've always thought that Microsoft
treats its users with contempt. Surely the tone it adopts in its
dialogues and messages supports that view. The smug little utterances
like "Windows must shutdown your computer now". The higher power has
spoken!
</p>

<p>
Of course, once it has completed the upgrade, when it's time for the,
ahem, restart, it will take cognizance of my original selection. In
particular, if I chose to shutdown, it will, at this time, shutdown.
</p>

<p>
When next I fire up my machine, it will proceed with any subsequent
actions needed to complete the install. The idea is to maximise
utility and convenience for me. Because I'm the human.
</p>

<p>
It's not about you; it's about me.
</p>

<h3>Scanning for Pleasure</h3>

<p>
Turn on wife's machine. Windows 98. What's this? Disk scan? Scan disk?
What is it doing? Just another way to slow me down.
</p>

<p>
In fairness, I should say that I haven't seen this on XP. But on my
wife's Windows 98, it is very frequent.
</p>

<p>
I speculate that one day, quite some time ago, Bill was walking past a
machine when it was booting into Linux. It was just at the point where
it was doing an <tt>fsck</tt>.
</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2.5em">

<p>
"What's happening?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
The Linux user explained it to him.
</p>

<p>
Later, Bill summoned his Council of Technical Acolytes.
</p>

<p>
"Linux does something called <tt>fsck</tt> when it starts up. I want
something like that for our next release of Windows."
</p>

<p>
"But, Sire," offered one of his Council. "We don't need to do that.
Our software works differently."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!" snapped Bill. "If Linux has it, we need a competitive
story. We can't be open to criticism that we lack technical rigour.

<p>
"Further, we need it for another reason. It's important that our users
get into the habit of obeying, preferably without thinking. If they
ever get to thinking about our offering, well, ..." He trailed off,
shaking his head to discard the unthinkable.
</p>

<p>
"OK, gentlemen. Take notes. Here's how it's going to work. We will
insist that they shutdown their machines in a certain way. It's
important that they learn to follow orders. We'll detect if they
obeyed. If they did, fine. The plan is working.
</p>

<p>
"If not, we'll use this - what did he call it? <tt>fsck</tt>? Stupid
name - we'll use our version of <tt>fsck</tt> to punish the user."
</p>

<p>
Sensing resistance, he glared at the members of his Council. One or
two, whose hands had been up, lowered them.
</p>

<p>
"Excellent! Now let's get down to the most important part of this
exercise. <tt>fsck</tt> is such a stupid name. And anyway it's used by
the competition. So what will we call it?"
</p>

<p>
Bill looked up encouragingly. It looked like he was really asking for
suggestions. Several names were bandied around. Bill's countenance darkened.
</p>

<p>
"You don't seem to be getting it. None of your suggestions reach out
to me. I guess I have to do everything myself. Now let me think ..."
</p>

<p>
The buzz of conversation died down as the The Great One cogitated, the
silence broken only by an almost imperceptible sound, like gears
grinding.
</p>

<p>
"I've got it!" he cried out in satisfaction. "SCANDISK."
</p>

<p>
He looked triumphantly around the Council Chamber.
</p>

<p>
"But, Sire, don't we already have something called DISKSCAN?"
</p>

<p>
"That's not the same thing at all!" snapped Bill. "Hands up anyone who
thinks SCANDISK is like, um, DISKSCAN."
</p>
</div>

<p>
It doesn't actually do anything - unless you call moving the progress
bar doing something. It's just there to punish recalcitrance.
</p>

<p>
And the ultimate irony? Soon afterwards, Linux adopted a journaled
file system, eliminating the need to check the file system even after
an unclean shutdown.
</p>

<p>
You're probably thinking to yourself that my wife and I get what we
deserve. I'd agree with you about me; but my wife is what is so coyly
referred to as collateral damage.
</p>

<p>
Do you  want to know why we have to run SCANDISK all the time? Because
Windows lies to us.
</p>

<p>
My wife finishes her work. She shuts down as prescribed - by clicking
on Start (!) and then following the bouncing ball. Eventually a splash
screen appears. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
	<strong>Windows is shutting down</strong>	
</pre>

<p>
She waits. She does other things. It's time for bed, so she performs
her nightly ablutions. She likes to read before going to sleep. You're
not really interested in my wife's nightly routine.
</p>

<p>
Hours later, the stupid machine still hasn't turned off. She calls me
to investigate. I look at her screen.
</p>

<pre class="code">
	<strong>Windows is shutting down</strong>	
</pre>

<p>
Bill's message looks back at me mockingly. How much can a koala bear?
Enraged, I turn off the power at the wall.
</p>

<p>
Next time her machine is powered up, Bill gets his revenge. D'oh!
</p>

<h1>Codeweavers vs. Cedega, Commercial Wine Product Comparison</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/hoogland.html">Jeff Hoogland</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<p>
Most people who use Linux for desktop use are well aware of the one of
the largest issues facing the platform: Lack of commercial software. Now in
most cases this is not an issue, no MS Office - use OpenOffice, no Internet
Explorer - use FireFox. However one thing which there is currently no
replacement for is gaming. Try as they might there are just not enough
Open-Source game developers (or even closed-sourced ones) that bring the
level of gaming quality, as of yet, to Linux that Windows enjoys.
</p>

<p>
Enter the world of Win-on-Lin. The Wine Project, was started in 1993 and
has slowly come into maturity over the course of the last sixteen years.
Wine is a compatibility layer, or more precisely a reimplementation of the
Windows API, that allows Windows applications to run under Linux. While the
Wine project does a wonderful job of what it is designed to do (run Windows
applications on Linux) how ever it sorely lacks in the means of a GUI front
end for easy configuration/calibration.
</p>

<p>
Which brings me to my topic at hand - Cedega &amp; Codeweavers. What are
Cedega and Codeweavers? They two (closed source) programs both based off of
the Wine Project to create what it lacks - a user friendly interface.
Designed to help you get your Windows games working with ease on Linux.
They both have their ups and downs and today I am going to look at each
program and see how they compare.  I currently have both Cedega and
Codeweavers licenses so all the information given is from first hand
experience working with both products. I'm going to be judging based on
following criteria:


<ol>
<li><strong>Functionality</strong> - How well do they do what they are
suppose to do?</li>
<li><strong>GUI Front End</strong> - How do the front-ends between the two
compare?</li>
<li><strong>Website</strong> - Being able to find information is
everything, how do the websites compare?</li>
<li><strong>Customer Service/Support</strong> - If you are paying for a
product you want to know you can get help with it if it doesn't work
properly.</li>
<li><strong>Fees &amp; Licensing</strong> - How much do they cost and what
are you paying for?
</li>
</ol>
</p>


<h4>Functionality</h4>
<p>
Cedega does a fairly good job of helping the user get their programs up
and running. Upon selecting install it auto-detects any disc drives on the
system for known game discs it can install. If it does not find any (or
finds the wrong one) it is easy enough to direct it to the proper file/disc
via the GUI. One of the things I really like about Cedega is the large
number of pre-defined profiles it contains for different game titles (and
just because you game isn't listed doesn't mean it will not work).
Basically what this means is when you install a game that has a profile it
automatically uses what are known to be the "best Wine settings" to get the
optimum performance out of your game.
</p>

<p>
While Cedega does a great job at actually running the important parts of
your games it is obvious that certain aspects of some programs have been
neglected, Steam for instance works fine for loading and playing games but
the friends network does not work in the slightest and installing flash for
it is difficult at best.
</p>

<p>
Also worth noting here is that while Cedega started off as a fork of the
Wine project (version 4.0 and earlier of Cedega was known as WineX or Wine
Extreme) initially, it is no longer associated with it. Because of this of
this fact the Windows API behind Cedega is also now different from that
which powers Wine and as such there are a few applications that will not
function under Wine (or things powered by Wine) that perform with out a
hick-up under Cedega.
</p>

<p>
All in all I'm giving Cedega a 9 out of 10 points for functionality - it
is a good software.
</p>

<p>
<em>    Functionality</em> 9/10 - <strong>Cedega Total</strong> 9/10
</p>

<p>
Upon opening the Codeweavers program installer you are presented with a
small list of applications that it will auto install and configure for you.
I say small list because by comparison to the amount of game profiles
listed under Cedega it feels somewhat incomplete. How ever as with Cedega
just because the game you want to run is not on the list does not mean that
it will not work. Also like Cedega, Codeweavers will auto detect any disc
drives you have when you go to install a piece of software, one thing I
also really like is that when detecting disc drives it also detects mounted
iso files you may want to install from.
</p>

<p>
While the given list of games that are pre-configured in Codeweavers is
small compared to the games list present in Cedega, it is very obvious that
most of the games on the list have been worked on extensively to get them
working to a optimum level with a careful attention to detail. Using Steam
as my example again upon installation Codeweavers downloads and configures
flash, in addition to other things, to help it work almost as good as it
does natively on Windows (the only issue currently with the Steam UI is a
small scroll bar issue).
</p>

<p>
Codeweavers is based directly off the Wine project, as such if a program
works poorly under Wine odds are it is going to work just as poorly under
Codeweavers. As such this also means that any performance you see with an
application under Codeweavers can be replicated under just a standard Wine
install (how ever it may take you several hours to get everything just
right).
</p>

<p>
I'm giving Codeweavers an 8 out of 10 on functionality. It is good
software but it needs to expand its games list some.
</p>

<p>
<em>    Functionality</em> 8/10 - <strong>Codeweavers Total</strong> 8/10
</p>

<h4>GUI Front End</h4>
<p>
One of the most important things about both these pieces of software is
their GUI. One of the wonderful things about Linux is how alot of things
"just work" and having a front end to install Windows applications through
is a nice addition to have.
</p>

<p>
The Cedega GUI does a nice job of giving you a centralized location to
house all of your Games/Windows applications. (You can add launchers for
your favorite native Linux apps/games to it as well) Also present in Cedega
that Codeweavers does not have is a "diagnostic test". Basically it checks
over your hardware and configuration for anything that may cause issues
when running your games. In addition to being able to check your
configuration the diagnostic tool also allows for an easy copy and paste of
your system specifications which is useful if you are unsure of your setup
(or too lazy to type it out) when trying to debug an issue.
</p>

<p>
Lacking in the Cedega GUI how ever are native menu entries. Applications
installed under Cedega often times feel foreign as you have to open a
separate program to launch them or create your own custom menu entry (and
hunting down the correct icon for you game can be a headache). Also worth
noting with netbooks becoming more and more popular is that the Cedega GUI
is obviously designed for a resolution of at least 768 pixel height, parts
of it get cut off on most netbook screens. The Cedega GUI as a whole is
good but it could stand a few changes - 8 out of 10
</p>

<p>
<em>    GUI Front End</em> 8/10 - <strong>Cedega Total</strong> 8.5/10
</p>

<p>
While Codeweavers does not give you a centralized location for all your
install applications like Cedega does, however it is still well done.
Codeweavers does a beautiful job of integrating with your local menus
(Gnome, KDE, ect) when installing applications. In fact if Codeweavers
would simply add the games you install to the games section of your menu
instead of its own section I do not think most users would be able to tell
the difference between a natively installed game and one installed via
Codeweavers. Same as Cedega here 8 of 10, fully functional but could still
be slightly better.
</p>

<p>
<em>    GUI Front End</em> 8/10 - <strong>Codeweavers Total</strong> 8/10
</p>

<h4>Website</h4>
<p>
Knowledge is power as they say, one of the most important things about
any piece of software you may have is that you fully understand how to use
it. Often times these days ones of the best resources for learning such
information is an application's homepage.
</p>

<p>
Cedega's home page is relatively horrid to say the least. It does
provide the basic information on the product and pricing but that is about
it. Many parts of the website have been 100% non-functional for the last
months I have had my subscription and it really takes from the product as a
whole. Voting for which applications you wish to be supported is one key
feature that is lacking for example. On top of this another "feature" of
the page is that you cannot view certain data if you do not have a current
subscription - meaning if you are someone looking into Cedega to see if it
will run a certain game you will have to pony up the cash to give it a try.
Also horrid is the Cedega rating system for applications which has three
options: "Certified, Works, and Known not to Work". Certified means you are
able to contact customer service in order to get help with said application
should an issue arise and well the other two kind of explain them self.
Also, and this is not Cedega's fault per-say but odds are is due to a small
user base, but the information about many application in their listing is
rather lacking by comparison to others.
</p>

<p>
Cedega's website needs some HUGE improvements, as of now it is
functional. So I'll give it a 4 out of 10.
</p>

<p>
<em>    Website</em> 4/10 - <strong>Cedega Total</strong> 6.7/10
</p>

<p>
Codeweaver's website is a refreshing change from that of Cedega. It is
obviously that of a professional company, the layout is nice and everything
is clearly labeled. Everything is accessible with or with out a user login.
If you are a member they have a nice system for allowing you to "vote" for
which applications you would like to see better support for (So they know
what they should be spending time working on). The user forums are slightly
non-standard but not necessarily in a bad way, they just take some getting
used to. Also a feature worth noting is Codeweavers ticketing system, you
can browse past support tickets that yourself or other people have posted
for solutions to past issues.
</p>

<p>
I really do not have anything bad to say about the Codeweavers website,
it is well done and fully functional - 10 out of 10
</p>

<p>
<em>    Website</em> 10/10 - <strong>Codeweavers Total</strong> 8.5/10
</p>

<h4>Customer Service/Support</h4>
<p>
So one of the most important things to know when you are buying
something is that you are going to be able to get support for the product
if it does not work as it is suppose to.
</p>

<p>
Cedega's customer support is decent. They give you a good response and
help you solve any issues you may be having to a satisfactory amount. How
ever also worth noting is that the only way to get customer support is via
Email. And they only provide official support for their list of forty or so
"certified" games and if you are running certain hardware configuration
(they only support nVidia gfx cards and certain distros). And I feel I
should also mention that their customer service is rather slow to return
emails.
</p>

<p>
They also how ever have community powered message boards (which they
link from their website) where there are a few very dedicated people who
work hard to help people solve their problems, I found these boards to be a
much faster response than the official email support.
</p>

<p>
Cedega customer support isn't bad per-say but it also is not anything
exceptional - 7 out of 10
</p>

<p>
<em>Customer Service/Support</em> 7/10 - <strong>Cedega Total</strong> 7/10
</p>

<p>
Codeweaver's provides two different channels of customer support, one
through their wonderful ticket/email system and on their official message
boards. The response time for a ticket I have filed has never been less
than a day, often times if I filed the ticket during normal business hours
I would see a response within a few hours. Their forums also have a few
helpful individuals as well as good number of staff that watch over and do
their best to help out with any issues that may arise while using the
software.
</p>

<p>
No customer support is perfect but Codeweaver's is darn good to say the
least 9 out of 10
</p>

<p>
<em>Customer Service/Support</em> 9/10 - <strong>Codeweavers Total</strong> 8.75/10
</p>

<h4>Fees and Licensing</h4>
<p>
I've spent time talking about the ups and downs of these two pieces of
software now - how do you get it? And more importantly how much does it
cost?
</p>

<p>
Cedega starts at $15 for a three month subscription with varying prices
if you buy for an extended length of time ($45 for a year for instance).
Cedega is yours to install so long as you keep paying for it (after the
subscription runs out you will no longer be able to download Cedega anymore
- meaning if you format you are SOL). Also worth mentioning here is that
the only "demo" Cedega provides is for a single game - Spore. And as I said
above you cannot see the full games data base unless you also pay for it.
So unless you know someone else with a subscription you may very well pay
for it to try a game only to find out doesn't work well. Too be fair though
it's only $15 for the three months, not truly expensive. I personally do
not care for how Cedega licensing works - 6 out of 10.
</p>

<p>
<em>Fees and Licensing</em> 6/10 - <strong>Cedega Total</strong> 6.8/10
</p>

<p>
Codeweaver's CXGames costs $40 for the product and a year's worth of
support and updates. After that it is $35 for a following year of
support/updates and even if you do not renew you still get to continue
using the Codeweavers software you had paid for initially. Now $40 is a
fair bit of cash if you are unsure if something is going to work for you -
however Codeweavers offers a 7 day demo of the full software so you can use
it and see if it works for your needs. Also worth noting is that while
Codeweavers is closed source software they are powered directly by the Wine
project - and as such they give back to it (with code and money). I don't
mind paying a reasonable cost for good software and the fact that they give
some of it back to the Wine project also makes me feel good - 9/10
</p>

<p>
<em>Fees and Licensing</em> 9/10 - <strong>Codeweavers Total</strong> 8.8/10
</p>

<p>
<strong>Final Scores - </strong>Cedega 6.8 &amp; Codeweavers 8.8
</p>

<h4>Follow Up</h4>
<p>
Obviously no piece of software is perfect - these two included - and
while Wine technology has come a long way in the last decade (or so) it
still has a long way to go. As you can see from the numbers and the above
information I prefer Codeweavers to Cedega, come the end of the year I do
not think I will be renewing my Cedega license Which of the two is right
for you is your choice, I just hope my little comparison here may have
presented you with some information on each of them you had not known
before.

<h1>Quick and Dirty Web Filtering on Linux</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/silva.html">Anderson Silva</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>Have you ever mistyped a web address and ended up somewhere you
definitely did not want to go? You miss one letter in the URL, and instead
of getting to your favorite site, you end up in the virtual red light
district! So what if instead of you making this mistake, it's your child
accidentally going to these questionable sites? I have two kids, an eight
and a ten year old, and both of them have been actively playing Flash-based
kids' games online since they were two years old. So lately I've been
thinking of solutions to this problem.</p>

<p>There are plenty of non-open-source solutions to help parents filter the
material that their little ones are being exposed to on the web. But I
didn't find that many open source and simple solutions available online.
That's why I decided to explore a couple of different options to solve my
web filtering problem: Squid and Dansguardian.</p>

<p><i>Using only Squid</i> will get you the very basic functionality to
allow your younger child to access a pretty limited number of sites. If
your kids are a little older, and require a bit more 'freedom' on the World
Wide Web, then skip the next section in this article and jump to <a
href="#Using_Dansguardian_with_Squid">Using Dansguardian with
Squid</a>.</p>

<h3>
  Using only Squid:
</h3>

<p>I've used Squid to set up my system so that my kids' browsers only
access the web addresses that I want them to. Everything else out there is
out of reach for them. In the instructions below, I assume that the Squid
proxy service will be running on the same computer that the children will
be using, but that is not a requirement.</p>

<p>First, let's install Squid on our Fedora system:</p>

<pre class="code">
su -
yum install -y squid
chkconfig squid on
</pre>


<p>Next, we edit the file /etc/squid/squid.conf.</p>

<p>1. Find the line on the configuration file with: <em>#Recommendend minimum configuration:</em></p>

Under that line there will be a few rules starting with the word acl. At
the end of the acl block, add the following line:
<pre class="code">
acl safekids dstdomain .kidsite.com .kidsite2.com
</pre>

<p>Replace .kidsite.com and .kidsite2.com with a list of the sites you want
your children to be able to visit. You can list a full address like:
www.kids.com, but then if your child tried to go to a subdomain like
games.kids.com, Squid would block it. Add a dot (.) in front of the domain
to make a wildcard that will allow any subdomain to go through.</p>

<p>2. Find the line: <i># INSERT YOUR OWN RULE(S) HERE TO ALLOW ACCESS FROM YOUR CLIENTS</i></p>

<p>Below that line, find the line that says "http_access allow localhost", and comment it out by adding a '#' in front of it:</p>
<pre class="code"># http_access allow localhost</pre>

<p>3. Above the line http_access deny all, add:</p>
<pre class="code">http_access allow safekids</pre>

<p>4. Start Squid service:</p>
<pre class="code">service squid start</pre>

<p>[Optional] 5. If you are going to use Squid on a separate server, open
up port 3128 on your firewall to allow the browser to talk to Squid.</p>

<pre class="code">iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 3128 -j ACCEPT</pre>

<p>[Optional] 6. Save your iptables settings so it will persist through reboots</p>
<pre class="code">
service iptables save
</pre>

<p>Done. This should have your squid proxy server all set up and running.
The major downside of this set up is that it is a lot of manual work to
keep a 'whitelist' of allowable sites for your kids to visit, especially as
they grow older and start needing to use the Internet for school work.</p>

<a id="Using_Dansguardian_with_Squid">
<h3>
  Using Dansguardian with Squid:
</h3>

<p>So, what's Dansguardian exactly? It is "software designed to control
which websites users can access. It also includes virus filtering and usage
monitoring features." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DansGuardian/">[1]</a> In this section of the article, I will show you
how to get up and running and interacting with Squid, allowing you to add
sites to its banned or exception lists. Dansguardian will use Squid as its
way to communicate with the World Wide Web to filter content.</p>

<p>Installing Dansguardian and Squid on Fedora:
<pre class="code">
yum -y install dansguardian squid
chkconfig dansguardian on
chkconfig squid on
service squid start
</pre>

<p>Unlike the previous section Using Squid, we can use the default
installation of Squid. To get dansguardian working in Fedora, there isn't
much work to do either.</p>

<p>First, verify /etc/dansguardian/dansguardian.conf, and make sure you have the following parameters set like this:</p>

<pre class="code">
# the port that DansGuardian listens to.
filterport = 8080

# the ip of the proxy (default is the loopback - i.e. this server)
proxyip = 127.0.0.1

# the port DansGuardian connects to proxy on
proxyport = 3128
</pre>

<p>Next start the service:</p>
<pre class="code">
service dansguardian start
</pre>

<p>Finally, if you do have firewall rules, open up port 8080 for connection:</p>
<pre class="code">
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT 
</pre>

<p>And to make it persist across reboots:</p>
<pre class="code">
service iptables save
</pre>

<p>You should now be able to configure your web browser to connect to port
8080 and use dansguardian as the proxy on your kids accounts. Be aware that
dansguardian although less restrictive than just using Squid to do web
filtering can still be quite restrictive. If you would like to bypass some
of its rules, and open up some sites for your kids, it's quite simple.
</p>

<p>Take a look at the <i>/etc/dansguardian/lists</i> directory and get to
know all the rules that are set out of the box for dansguardian. If you
would like to whitelist a site, edit the file <i>exceptionsitelist</i> and
add the site you'd like whitelisted. Once you are done editing the file,
bounce dansguardian to load the changes.</p>

<pre class="code">
service dansguardian restart
</pre>

<h3>
  Configuring the Client:
</h3>

<p>Now that we have our server set up, we need to set up the childâs
browser to use our dansguardian [or squid] filter:</p>

<p>I will note that this method can be easily be circumvented. I don't
recommend it for computer-savvy older kids, but it should work fine for
your kindergarten to elementary school aged kids. One could always get
fancier and remap ports on the kids machine to directly go to the proxy
making it a bit harder for whiz kids to by pass it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Start Firefox (in this case I am using Firefox 2).</li>
<li>Go to Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Advanced.</li>
<li>Select the Network Tab.</li>
<li>Click "Settings..." under "Connection."</li>

<div id=j:7y style=TEXT-ALIGN:center>
  <img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_58f3hd73f6_b.jpg" style=HEIGHT:573px;WIDTH:622px>
</div>


<li>Under the new "Connection Settings" window, select "Manual proxy configuration."</li>


<div id=ngz7 style=TEXT-ALIGN:center>
  <img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_599t6x5ccs_b.jpg" style=HEIGHT:551px;WIDTH:510px>
</div>


<li>For HTTP Proxy, enter the IP of your dansguardian server and port 8080 [or 3216 if only using squid]. If your dansguardian (or even squid) service is running locally on the same machine as the browser, use "localhost."</li>
<li>Click "OK."</li>
<li>Close Firefox Preferences.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now only the sites that meet dansguardian rules will be allowed in, otherwise your kids will get an out of the box message like the image below.</p>


<div id=x0lq style=TEXT-ALIGN:center>
  <img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_60gmvsj5g9_b.jpg" style=HEIGHT:554.907px;WIDTH:648px>
</div>


<p>If you have more than one computer set up to connect to a proxy port
other than 8080, like squid's 3128, you can add the following rule to your
proxy server to redirect traffic:</p>
<pre class="code">
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 3128 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
</pre>

<p>And then run:</p>

<pre class="code">service iptables save</pre>

<p>to persist change through reboots.</p>

<p>Overall, this is not a foolproof filter. All you have to do to
circumvent it is turn off the manual proxy on the browser, but I hope that
with my eight&nbsp; and ten year olds, I still have a few years to come up
with a more robust solution.</p>

<h1>Picking Fruit</h1>

</p>

<p>
<img hspace="15" src="misc/starks/fruit_1.jpg" align="left">
<p>
Having spent a considerable amount of time as a bachelor, I've learned
survival and coping techniques necessary for the lifestyle.  I've learned
to buy my own clothes without guilt ("you're not wearing THAT, are you?")
I've conquered the laundromat, microwave, and DVR... I've even mustered the
courage to buy my own food in a supermarket. Exposing testosterone in a
female domain can be tricky, but learn I have...
</p>

<p>
Look helpless long enough and some woman will show you pity and the cereal
aisle.
</p>

<p>
But there is one mystery I have yet to unravel.
</p>

<p>
<em>Melons.</em>
</p>

<p>
There they sit in the produce section... piles of them, one on top of
another.  I have thumped, smelled, hefted, and even squeezed the damned
things.  Regardless of my efforts, the one I ultimately bring home will
have the heart of a concrete slab and taste like cardboard.
</p>

<p>
Precut and packaged melon has been my most often used option.
</p>

<p>
If only the rest of my life were so simple.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Since 2004, I have been a Linux Advocate.  As the founder of <A
HREF="http://www.heliosinitiative.org/" NAME="The HeliOS Project">The
HeliOS Project</A>, I have organized an effort that, to date, has built
three learning centers and given away approximately 1,071 computers to kids
that cannot afford them.  I mention this not to self-promote but to
indicate that I have a bit of experience with New Linux Users.
</p>

<p>
I've come to realize that picking a candidate for Linux conversion is much
like picking melons from the supermarket... you can thump and inspect to
your heart's content but in reality, not every person is ready for the Free
Software harvest.
</p>

<p>
Let's look at a couple of the most common factors as to why.  The first one
is the most obvious.
</p>

<h3>Window Glazed</h3>

<img hspace="15" src="misc/starks/glazed_2.jpg" align="left">
<p>
It's a Microsoft Windows world and I don't think anyone wants to argue that
point.  Since the advent of Microsoft's last real innovation, Windows 95,
most every computer coming off the production line has come pre-installed
with Microsoft operating systems. People have learned to use their
computers in line with the Redmond Dictate.  Let's be honest here:
philosophical arguments aside, when Windows is running well, it is a fairly
decent way to operate a computer.  I mean, sure it allows an unsuspecting
user to delete svchost.exe... it even allows a moron to do it multiple times
through multiple reinstalls... but aside from full default user control, it
works mostly well.  Mostly.
</p>

<p>
People get used to doing things one way. Facing another fact, many in the
tech teaching world might agree that about half the people operating a
computer today are not computer operators at all... they are task-set mouse
clickers. Move one icon from its place or slide a toolbar from bottom to
top and many of them will scream <blink>&quot;VIRUS&quot;</blink>! They have become
comfortable with their chosen applications and environments and are loath
to step outside of them. Even when you physically show someone another
application for the same task, they are often either hesitant or they
openly balk at change. To use another application would mean leaving their
comfort zone.  
</p>

<p>
God forbid. 
</p>

<p>
There is one factor that can change
this... occasionally.
</p>

<h3>The Pain Threshold</h3>

<img hspace="15" src="misc/starks/pain_3.jpg" align="left">
<p>
Sometimes, enough is enough.  Semi-annual reinstalls and constant losing
battles against viruses and spyware can take its toll.  However, I've sat
down at Windows computers that had 5 or 6 spyware toolbars nestled within
Internet Explorer and the owner was clueless as to why his computer was
running slow.  Many of these people insist &quot;it's the computer&quot;.
Opening the process dialog and showing them the actual software-based
reason for it most often produces glazed-over eyes or blank stares.  Seems
that seeing anything ending with a file extension can cause
discomfort... often it's best not to show them the man behind the curtain.
</p>

<p>
I know that sounds condescending but we
see it more than we'd like to.
</p>

<p>
Here's the rub...
</p>

<p>
Many of these people, even if they were willing to try something different,
do not know that they have a choice.  Even when they do, I've had first-hand
experience in guiding people to Linux only to have them tell me that a
family member or their &quot;computer friend&quot; said not to
bother... that &quot;Linux Sucks&quot;.
</p>

<p>
Door closed.
</p>

<p>
Like the rinse-lather-repeat behavior of Microsoft Windows doesn't suck?  
</p>

<p>
I don't apologize for the fact that I believe people who refuse to solve
their own problems <a
href="http://linuxlock.blogspot.com/2009/05/thin-line-between-victim-and-idiot.html"
name="Victims or idiots?">are idiots</a>.  I've been criticized often for
my lack of bedside manner.  Then again, when you have the source of most
Internet and computer security problems suggesting that the computing
public be taxed to clean up infected machines, it's no wonder they are
confused. To many computer users, 
</p>

<p>
Microsoft IS the definitive expert on their computers. <a
href="http://yro.slashdot.org/story/10/03/02/2025237/Microsoft-VP-Suggests-Net-Tax-To-Clean-Computers"
name="Microsoft suggests internet tax">This is sad.</a>  
</p>

<p>
In my experience, approximately three out of ten Windows Users in distress
will seriously consider making the switch... and I don't necessarily think
of those as dismal numbers.  In the baseball world, that's equal to batting
.300 which can command multi-million dollar annual contracts.  I'll take
three out of ten.
</p>

<h3>Peer Pressure</h3>

<img hspace="15" src="misc/starks/kids_4.jpg" align="left">
<p>
While we've had most success with this in younger people, the fact that one
harried Windows User recommends Linux to another harried Windows User has
had surprising results.  Recently, we installed a Linux computer in a
housing project in East Austin.  It was a single-parent household with two
children who needed a computer.  It wasn't two weeks until people from the
project were coming over to use that computer to check their email or look
something up on the Internet because their Windows computer was hosed.
</p>

<p>
Go figure.
</p>

<p>
We've done nine Linux installs in that project to date and they all stemmed
from that one initial install.  Once people have something to physically
compare their current Windows computer to, the job becomes easier.
</p>

<p>
Pain Threshold indeed.
</p>

<p>
Kids at school are a big factor in getting us candidates for installs.
While the computer gaming crowd isn't going to pay much attention, having a
kid brag about his &quot;new system&quot; will.  The 3D cube has a lot to
do with it, and truth be known, I rarely turn on my extra effects anymore,
but with the younger users, it most certainly is a selling point.  Add in
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_C8WJYh7IE" name="Beauty and
Function">the Atlantis or Cube Gear plugin</A> and you have an environment
that draws them in quickly.
</p>

<h3>Understanding the Difference</h3>

<img hspace="15" src="misc/starks/magnets_5.jpg" align="left">

<p>
As mentioned above, many New Linux Users are put off or confused by a
different environment. They are so used to the blue XP visuals that when
presented with a differing screen or menu, they become uncomfortable.  I've
often mentioned that the absolute worst thing we can do as advocates is to
give a new user a Live CD and walk away.  Case in point...
</p>

<p>
A stay-at-home mom was given a CD by one of our directors a couple
months back.  It was carefully explained to her how to use the CD and what
to do in order to get it to boot.  When he called her back the next day to
check up on her, she complained loudly that Linux wouldn't work for her.
</p>

<p>
&quot;I put the CD in, I opened the folder and clicked on every icon in the
box. Nothing happened.&quot;
</p>

<p>
Sigh.
</p>

<p>
The Director told her to reboot the computer with the CD in the drawer and
it would become apparent what she should do. Nope... the computer BIOS was
set to boot to hard drive first. The boot process took her straight into
Windows again. When it was further explained that she should hit F12 to
change the boot device, she refused.
</p>

<p>
&quot;If it's that much trouble to use, I don't want to use it.&quot;
</p>

<p>
This is coming from a woman who bitterly complained about the 20 minute
update and patch time she had to endure every time she booted her computer
into Windows.  
</p>

<p>
This from a woman who had 11 individual viruses or instances of spyware on
her machine.
</p>

<p>
She reported her boot time into a desktop at 6 minutes.
</p>

<p>
And yeah... sure, most people who sit down at a computer will be able to
negotiate the Live CD just fine, but I am consistently amazed at the number
of people who cannot.  I've found that once you personally sit next to them
and show them how it works, their confidence level increases greatly and
the chances of them using Linux on a consistent basis is much better.
</p>

<p>
I fully realize that many people just do not have the time, patience or
social skills to sit down and walk a new user through this process but many
of us do and that is why I am writing this. Make them comfortable in a new
environment and half the battle is won.
</p>

<p>
Forewarned is forearmed...
</p>

<p>
Next?  Destroying the mental myths of
Linux use.  Stay tooned... this will be fun.

<p>
Born September 22, 1969, in Gardena, California, "Penguin" Pete Trbovich
 today resides in Iowa with his wife and children. Having worked various
 jobs in engineering-related fields, he has since "retired" from
 corporate life to start his second career. Currently he works as a
 freelance writer, graphics artist, and coder over the Internet. He
 describes this work as, "I sit at home and type, and checks mysteriously
 arrive in the mail."
</p>

<p>
He discovered Linux in 1998 - his first distro was Red Hat 5.0 - and has
 had very little time for other operating systems since. Starting out
 with his freelance business, he toyed with other blogs and websites
 until finally getting his own domain penguinpetes.com started in March
 of 2006, with a blog whose first post stated his motto: "If it isn't fun
 for me to write, it won't be fun to read."
</p>

<p>
The webcomic <em>Doomed to Obscurity</em> was launched New Year's Day,
 2009, as a "New Year's surprise". He has since rigorously stuck to a
 posting schedule of "every odd-numbered calendar day", which allows him
 to keep a steady pace without tiring. The tagline for the webcomic
 states that it "gives the geek culture just what it deserves." But is it
 skewering everybody but the geek culture, or lampooning geek culture
 itself, or doing both by turns?

Wow, got to give these spammers props for relevance <em>and</em> scope; too bad
they're wasting it on such small potatoes. Even their URL is so cute
that I'm going to leave it unmangled. The English is quite amusingly
mutilated ("has received the prevention", "about the occurred shift",
"Earth's figure axis", etc.), but it all makes enough sense that
somebody is sure to fall for it. Amazing.

Yesterday the Department of Homeland Security has received the
prevention from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory about the occurred
shift of Earthâs figure axis:
<em>      </em>
</p>

<p>
The recent Chilean earthquake shifted the axis by approximately three
inches and shortened the length of a day by 1.26 microseconds. According
to NASAâs Jet Propulsion Laboratory the displacement of Earthâs axis
will cause natural disasters on the Eastern coast of the USA including
Florida, Georgia, South and North Carolina.
<em>      </em>
</p>

<p>
In this connection the DHS has made a decision to prepare for general
evacuation from the specified area. The population of the region should
be ready for evacuation. It is necessary collect valuable possessions,
documents, things of first necessity, and wait for the announcement.
</p>

<p>
In order to prevent panic among the population DHS asks to stay calm and
follow the official instructions listed below:
