<P>
How small can a useful Linux system get? Linuxita fits on 4.7M of disk
space, works well in 3MB of RAM on a 386sx, and the compressed tar file
fits on a single 1.44M floppy.  Is there any reason to be running DOS on
legacy systems?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>

<P>
When my carefully manicured Linux system had to be sent away for a
long-postponed service call, I turned to an abandoned 386 for rescue.
<I>Baby</I> allows me to keep my office hours as irregular as I like them to
be, with email and the pcmcia modem, and I had been desperate to find a
stopgap. I had prised a replacement for the 386's failed power supply
from a backyard factory via long-distance, and lo! -- the hard disk
turned, dusty or no.

<P>
After much fuss in the dead month of August, I had taken delivery of a
new external modem from the states and picked up a mains voltage
converter to run it off -- non-trivial shopping in those weeks. A few
days before zero hour, I booted DOS on the old machine and it upped and
went as though it had not been down for a year and a half. I called up
Windows 3.1, played a little, and saw that it would not do. I had
forgotten all about Windows on a 16MHz 386sx! Linux had to be installed
on the 386 or I would go crazy while <I>baby</I> was gone. The following
is the story of how to fit a Linux system into the minimum of disk space
and RAM, and be happy.

<H3>Gosh, Darn, Preparations</H3>

<P> 
I thought it might be a problem to fit Linux into the 20M disk of
the 386, but knew it was room enough; a pared-down system plus a minimal
X goes 15M at most. The problem would lie in separating out just the
right pieces and getting the installation order so that nothing
overflowed the available space at any stage. I would have to install
piecemeal from the running system on <I>baby</I> over the countdown
period.

<P> I was too optimistic. I had problems backing up <I>baby</I>. The RAM
on my office machine is faulty and I cannot copy over large files
without errors. To cut the story short, I ran the office machine in DOS
and made the transfers at 115K baud through the parallel port with
<B>FastWire</B> both it and <I>baby</I>, the latter under <B>dosemu</B>.
In the end, I never got time to install Linux on the 386 before
<I>baby</I> left. I was lucky to finish the backup.

<P>
Then more problems. I had trouble setting up communications with the
386. There was no space for <B>FastWire</B> in the cramped 20M and no
time to relearn my old setup in order to see how I could make room.
Worse, everything under Windows on the old machine seemed to freeze the
system, for the unknown reasons that normally apply. Its only serial
port applications -- apart from an ancient copy of kermit -- were
Windows applications!

<P>
In the end I found a small but modern serial package for DOS on the
Garbo ftp archive site (<KBD> garbo.uwasa.fi</KBD>) I tried three or
four packages before finding one (<B>QVT</B>) both worked and fitted in
the disk! To download it, I used DOS kermit to set up a 9600 baud direct
login to the office machine through the serial port, then uuencoded and
cat'ed the files past the screen while logging the session (I had a
working DOS uudecode). That gave me an application that could set up a
serial port connection at 38.4K under DOS, and I had an external 14.4K
modem on standby. So when the courier arrived an hour early with the
customs forms for <I>baby</I> not yet typed I felt the situation was
livable.

<P>
But was 386sx hardware really compatible with a modern kernel? That was
an old system. Was 3M of RAM enough? The HOWTO's said yes, but when did
they date from? And because I could not afford to be without a system at
home, I would have to keep DOS working on the 386 while I tried putting
Linux either on top of it or in whatever space I could scrounge on the
disk. I had not foreseen that.

<P>
More, I needed to keep some DOS installations like the C compiler and
LaTeX alive in case Linux installation failed. I did not have any more
room (or time!) to back those up to the office machine too. And most of
the 20M disk was occupied by a Stacker compressed file system so I only
had about 2M accessible via the bare FAT. I would have to fit 
the initial installation into something like 2M of disk space!

<H3>Revised Estimates</H3>
 
<P>
I took a close look at the office system. I keep that at a fairly
standard Slackware 2.1 a.out installation, plus newer kernels and
anything else I find I need, but I have not kept disk space down. How
little could I really cut it down to? I needed <B>/bin</B>,
<B>/sbin</B>, a kernel, the configuration files in <B>/etc/</B>, the
dynamic libraries in <B>/lib</B>, and not much else, as far as I could
guess. To my astonishment, <B>du</B> said that was not very much at all!
Six or seven megabytes. And I could probably trim it some.

<P>
Over the next few days I familiarized myself with the old 386 and DOS.
I stripped out utilities I felt I could lose.  I removed the permament
Windows swap file and shrank the Stacker file system down.  I collected
<B>fips</B> and <B>presizer</B> for DOS and checked out the partition
table.  I found a disk defragmenter on one of my old archive diskettes.
I no longer had <B>fdisk</B> on the 386 but I copied it from the office
system and set up <B>setver</B> to cover up the difference in DOS
versions (and languages!).  I relearned my elaborate multi-boot setup on
the 386 -- which dynamic driver loader worked with which driver and
which memory manager, which I needed right then and which I might need
later.  In the end I found myself with precisely 4.7M of free disk
space.  After a couple of fumbles, I had <B>fips</B> set up a new 4.7M
partition at the end of the 20M disk.  The method -- if not the
dimension!  -- is familiar to anyone who has installed Linux while
preserving an existing DOS partition.

<P>
I had been experimenting on the office system too.  In Linux mode, her
name is <I> monica</I> and she runs as part of a campus-wide net.  <I>
Monica</I> has one small 16M partition that I do not use for much of
anything and which I have been meaning to set up as a spare root file
system.  What with the RAM fault, I can never be sure when <I> monica</I>
will throw a fit that eats the file system instead of crashing
more-or-less gently (she has since done the inevitable, and I am proud
to say that I managed to put most of the 100M of nameless <TT>
lost+found</TT> files back in the right places in an afternoon), and I would
feel much safer with a separate root.  I cleared out the partition and
filled it with the files I thought I would need on root in the 386, and
nothing else.

<P>
I will say that the documentation did not help me learn how to boot from
a different partition with Lilo.  It is easy when you know the trick --
you really do have to just change the root partition name in
<B>lilo.conf</B> and run Lilo -- but it took me a day's experimenting.
Along the way, I discovered that one can set up Lilo to boot from a
kernel on a different partition too, even a DOS partition.  Just change
the location for the image in <B>/etc/lilo.conf</B>.  The trick is to
give the image location relative to the current root, not relative to
the intended root.  That is not as obvious as it sounds.

<P>
I found that almost nothing in the Slackware 2.1 <B>/bin</B> directory
can be done without if the <B>init</B> boot sequence is to work.  The
<B>/etc/rc.d/</B> files are a flexible, well-designed and
integrated system, but they exercise, or can exercise, quite a few
unexpected utilities.  I noticed that the Slackware root (and boot)
diskette contains a much simplified <B>rc.d</B> system and thought about
borrowing it.  But I like and understand the <B>rc.d</B> system as it
is, so I decided to hang on to it and live with the overhead.  I could
always change my mind later.  But <B>/bin</B> came in at just under
1.2M, including both <B>bash</B> and <B>tcsh</B> shells (obviously, I
only needed the first of these for the <B>init</B> sequence, and could
even have got away with a lighter shell if I were only thinking about
the <B>rd.d</B> sequence, but I could not live with a system on which I
could not run decent shell scripts) so I would just have to be prepared
to rethink later.  One surprise was that I needed <B>test</B> from
<B>/usr/bin</B>.  It is needed in <B>rc.[SM0]</B>, at least.  I had
thought that a Unix system was meant to be able to boot up without using
anything from <B>/usr</B>!  (<TT> sleep</TT> is also in the wrong place in
the current ELF slackware distribution).

<P>
Pretty soon, I had a bootable partition on <I> monica</I> with about 8M of
files in it. I had not been cutting files out so much as throwing files
in wholesale when I detected a need, so, encouraged, I went back to my
386, used <B>fdisk</B> again to split out a 1M partition from the 4.7M
for use as swap and started to think about the important things ahead.
What would I call the new system! Thanks to some unjustifiable extra
spending some years ago, it has 3M of RAM to complement the 16MHz
processor. One day I will be able to afford a coprocessor. <I>
Bambam</I> was clearly an appropriate name for it and a choice that I look
back on with satisfaction. 3.7M of disk space, 1M of swap and 3M of RAM
would make for a mighty machine.

<H3>Installation</H3>

<P>
<I> Bambam</I> and I went back home and I used DOS and the modem to start
transfering pieces that I reckoned I needed out of <I> monica</I>'s trial
setup.  I used a floppy as an intermediate storage area.  I had no room
to do anything else.  Catch number one turned out to be that I could not
use the ramdisk on the Slackware bootdisk kernel (I do not have enough
memory on <I> bambam</I>)  I had to use the Slackware rootdisk as my root
device.  With only one floppy slot, that left me stuck.  I needed the
floppy both as a root filesystem and as an i/o device.  So I sighed,
scrapped some more favourite utilities from my DOS partition, then
squeezed the tar files onto it and tried again.  Now I know that I
should have made my own bootdisk using the minimally configured kernel
on <I> monica</I>.  I have had many communications since with people
seeking to set up Linux systems in 3M of RAM or less, and in most cases
the mistake they have been making has been using the slackware boot
kernels.  Those will take up at least 1.5M of RAM with all the
compiled-in drivers, often leaving too little to boot <B>init</B> and
the standard <B>getty</B>'s and daemons, plus a shell.  <I> Monica</I>'s
kernel takes up 1068K (and loads extra kernel modules when needed).
Looking back, it is amusing that I made this mistake too.

<H3>System binaries</H3>

<P>
<I> Monica</I>'s little trial partition had given me a guide as to what I
really needed and what would be nice, but could be done without. So
this time round I was careful to include the minimum. I have already
mentioned that I needed about all of slackware 2.1 <B>/bin</B>. The list is
in Figures 1, 2, 3, &amp; 4.

As remarked, I voted to retain <B>bash</B>, despite its size, or I  could

all the file system <B>mk</B>\dots utilities. But I kept <B>fdisk</B>
because I like to check that my partitions are still there occasionally!
I eliminated <B>hdparm</B> because it does not work on my old drive )or
at least, the version that I had did not seem to).  I threw out various
Slackware setup utilities (notably <B>setup</B>).

<P>
On the other hand, I had to keep, or perhaps include as extras, if one
wishes to look at it that way, utilities to insert and remove dynamic
kernel modules (<B>insmod</B>, <B>rmmod</B>, <B>modprobe</B>,
<B>depmod</B>). These come in the <B>modules-1.2.8</B> package
on most archive sites. I use the kernel daemon (same package) to take
some of the strain away. It unloads modules from RAM when they are
not used for 30 seconds (by default), which is valuable.

<P>
I run both the <B>msdos</B> and <B>umsdos</B> modules in order to
access the DOS partition on the disk. The <B>umsdos</B> file system
means that I also have to keep around the <B>umssync</B> (a.k.a.
<B>umssetup</B>) utilities to keep Linux up to date with the
state of the DOS partition. Every so often  I tend to makes some
changes from DOS and then Linux will not see the new files (or lose the
old ones) until <B>umssync</B> is run. It is worth having on the disk.

<P>
As can be seen in Figure 11, the only modules I chose to have available
on <I> bambam</I> cost just under 80K of disk space. There was no need
to keep <B>binfmt_elf.o</B> around -- I was not running ELF, nor any
need for <B>dummy.o</B> -- I was not running the net, but I thought I
might possible play a little.

<P>
Note that I  use the <B>bflushd</B> and <B>updated</B> daemons, instead
of the larger daemon (which splits into two when run) that is on the
standard distributions. As I recall, I got these from the <B>apm-0.5</B>
package. They are specially tuned for laptops and other small machines
(the kernel I was using on <I> bambam</I> had APM compiled into it, although
I doubt if <I> bambam</I> knew anything about it). I have not been able
to compile the assembler with newer compiler versions, so I have been
passing these on to myself as a binary inheritance for some time now.

<H3>System libraries</H3>

<P>
My extravagance so far had left me with 2.25M free from the 4.7M
partition minus 1M swap. I went back and remade the standard
<B>/lost+found</B> directory in order to save myself 8K.  The
<B>mk2efs</B> sets the directory size to 12K to start with, which has
always seemed pessimistic to me. On <B>/lib</B> itself, however, I saved
a little more.

The <TT>/lib</TT> directory.

<P>
To my surprise, I did not need anything more than the basic <B>libc</B>
and <B>libm</B>. I had been worried that I might need  <B>libvga</B> or
other exotica for some of the standard utilities, but no. The
<B>linuxaout-uncompress.o</B> contains the to-be-preloaded library
functions for the ZLIB library modification. I prefer using the
preloaded module rather than altering <B>libc</B>, which is the other
method of getting ZLIB up and running. But it obviously uses more space.
I need the <B>ld.so</B> version 1.7.3 or better to make dynamic
preloading work. With LD\_PRELOAD set to point to it, on each call to
the dynamic libraries the preload module is scanned first. The module
intercepts reads from compressed files and uncompresses them through a
pipe. It can save considerable space.

<P>
I believe that I am supposed to hard-link <B>ld.so</B>, but a soft link
seems to work fine.

<P>
The libraries consumed 780K. At this point I had 1.45M of partition
space available and the configuration files in <B>/etc</B> were still to
come.

<H3>System configuration</H3>

<P>
I edited down the number of <B>agetty</B>'s started in
<B>/etc/inittab</B> to two. Any more was an extravagance from my point
of view. Even if they did share code. Two virtual consoles is enough.
Note that I preferred <B>agetty</B> to <B>getty_ps</B> or other
alternatives for reasons of space. It is the simplest.

<P>
In the end, I had <B>/etc</B> down to just over 100K. The biggest
files are <B>magic</B> (for the <B>file</B> command) and
<B>termcap</B>. The latter can be edited down and the former I
compressed. Using ZLIB means that it is read alright.

<P>
I left the <B>init</B> sequence files in <B>/etc/rc.d</B> as
standard -- for a cost of 27K.  And out of nostalgia (or hope?) I
let one or two network configuration files stand -- <B>resolv.conf</B>,
for example.  I did optimize some things in <B>/etc</B>, however.  I
emptied the <B>skel</B> subdirectory (I was not going to make new
users).  I made sure that the <B>locale</B> subdirectory was empty, and
checked that <B>fs</B> only contained soft links and no executables.
The real executables should go in <B>/sbin</B>.

<H3>Communications</H3>

<P>
Since I wanted to work a modem, I needed <B>minicom</B> as a
communications package.  It is small and neat (about 80K) and I like
it.  Perhaps there is something more suitable out there, but I do not
know about it.  It needs one or two configuration files in
<B>/var/lib/minicom</B>, and nothing else.  Each user also gets a local
configuration file <B>~/.minirc</B> and a phone number list, but there
would only be one user -- apart from root.  A few extra kilobytes.
By this stage I was definitely counting kilobytes. A separate utility,
<B>runscript</B>, is also required in order to parse the login scripts.
15K more. And I needed to upload and download, so I needed the zmodem
protoocols. That requires <B>lrz</B> and <B>lsz</B> and some soft
links. 60K more.

<H3>Editor</H3>

<P>
For each individual, there is only one choice of editor. For me, it is
<B>vi</B> -- rather <B>vim</B>, the multi-window version. Perhaps
an <B>emacs</B> person would have to settle for <B>joe</B> as a poor
substitute in the disk space available, but I did not have to compromise.
That cost 185K, plus my configuration file. 

<H3>Sundries</H3>

<P> Certain applications are neither necessities nor luxuries. One can
do without them, but life would be sadder. In that category I count the
compression utilities <B>gzip</B> and <B>gzexe</B>, as well as the
ever-entertaining <B>top</B>. At least it is useful for tuning.
<B>tset</B> (and <B>reset</B>, only a shell script) are also too much
bother to miss out. <B>loadkeys</B> I needed for my UK keyboard layout,
but I trimmed <B>/usr/lib/kbd/keytables</B> down to just the map that I
needed. See Figure~\ref{9} for the complete list that I left in
<B>/usr/bin</B>. It occupied just under 600K in total, which left me
with 750K.

<H3>Luxuries</H3>

<P>
Although my institute's modems are all even-parity, I had had success in
getting <B>term</B> to work across the link (the 1.9 version, not the
later series, for some reason), so I bundled it too. Multiplexed unix
logins to a big system are a blessing not to be missed. I would have
used <B>slirp</B>, but then I would have had to install some network
utilities, and I did not have the space. What is more, I have never
discovered how to get slirp to cope with an even-parity modem line.
<B>term</B> goes in <B>/usr/local/bin</B> with the remote shell
(<B>trsh</B>) and shutdown utility (<B>tshutdown</B>). For fun I added
the termified uploader too. All these utilities are the same size and I
suspect that they may be the same inside. Perhaps soft links might work
instead of renamed copies? I did not experiment. They came to just under
100K, with the configuration file. 650K to go.

The <TT>/usr/local/bin</TT> directory.

<P>
And although I can read my dos floppies by mounting <B>/dev/fd0</B>
as an <TT>msdos</TT> type file system, I prefer to use the <B>mtools</B>
suite. It only requires a single 42K executable, and all the variants
(<B>mwrite</B>, <B>mread</B>, <B>mcopy</B>, etc.) are soft links to it.
I put those in <B>/usr/local/bin</B> too. 600K left.

<H3>Application libraries</H3>

<P>
Fortunately, my choice of applications did not require any extra dynamic
libraries.

<H3>Overheads</H3>

<P>
What about all the uncountable bits and pieces, like directories (which
take up room) and a few scripts such as <B>MAKEDEV</B> that one should
never risk being without? Those take up a bit of extra space.  Then
there is the compressed kernel image itself, and some log files and
other administrivia. All in all, about another 3500K of disk space.

<P>
Of course I chose not to run <B>syslog</B> and friends (the messages
just scroll pass the console instead) and pointed the log files at
<B>/dev/null</B>. I did not need the Slackware <B>/var/log/packages</B>
directory either, or <B>scripts</B>. I did not need most of the
<B>/var/spool</B> subdirectories since I was not running <B>cron</B> or
<B>at</B>, or a printer or mail. So I saved a little there.

<P>
There is a small penalty for using a system -- instead of looking at it
admiredly. I had to install a home directory for myself. Since I had so
much space, I gave root its own home too, just as one is supposed to. In
the end I had about 250K of usable space left free on the disk.  Enough
to edit files on, and pass files to and from over the modem -- just as I
had required.

<H3>Conclusion</H3>

<P>
It is indeed possible to run Linux on a 386sx machine with just a few
megabytes of disk space available, and very limited RAM. With less RAM
than the 3M I had I might have needed to use a non-production kernel,
but the standard 1.2.13 kernel worked well for me, when cut down and
mounting modules dynamically by need. I was able to shoehorn the file
system into a little over 3.6M, and used a 1M swap partition. The
performance is at least as good as with DOS, and I am a lot happier.
