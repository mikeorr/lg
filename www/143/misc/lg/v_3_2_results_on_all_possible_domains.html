&gt; OK, I've finished testing all 270 TLDs.

<p>
271.  As an extreme oddity, it turns out that .arpa is both a valid TLD
and serves up meaningful port-43 WHOIS data.  See:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.arpa">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.arpa</a>   (DNS admins know .arpa from their
reverse-DNS zonefiles, but there are other portions of the namespace.)
</p>

<p>
However, .arpa's WHOIS data lacks expiration dates, FWIW.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Generic_top-level_domains">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Generic_top-level_domains</a> points 
out a variety of other wacky valid TLDs and proposed TLDs, but none
other than .arpa is both valid and serves WHOIS data.
</p>

<p>
My favourite of the wacky TLDs is .root, described here:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vrsn-end-of-zone-marker-dummy-record.root">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vrsn-end-of-zone-marker-dummy-record.root</a>
</p>


<pre>
&gt; As noted, .my, .tk, and .tw aren't yet handled, but can be.
</pre>

<p>
Ben, no hurry, but any time you can tweak the regexes for those three
final additions, it would be good.
</p>

<p>
Other readers:
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/pub/linux/network/domain-check-testdata">http://linuxmafia.com/pub/linux/network/domain-check-testdata</a> has notes,
and the latest release of domain-check is in that directory.

Heh. I don't think we have to worry about them expiring without
noticing; that would be like a gasoline truck running out of fuel.

<p>
And now have been. I've done the test with both 'whois' and 'jwhois',
and it seems that the output in both cases, for <em>all</em> the domains on
your list, is now parseable with my regexes. Well, except for
"ficora.fi" which seems to be down today ('connection refused', quoth
the Raven; in fact, <em>all</em> of .fi seems to be "whois"less for the moment)
- but I suspect that it'll work just fine when it comes back up.
</p>

<p>
The only remaining question in my mind is "do we know for sure that
'domain-check' is actually parsing the <em>right</em> dates in all cases?" I've
done an actual comparison against 20 or so domains; however, I don't
have the time or the patience to run it against all 271 of them.
Hopefully, if someone ever runs into a problem, they'll contact me.

<p>
There actually are "only" 48 ccTLDs + 14 gTLDs = <em>62</em> total that would
need checking.  Those are the ones with asterisks next to them, in my 
domain-check-testdata file:  those are the ones empirically verified to 
serve up meaningful data including expiration dates from their
respective port-43 WHOIS servers.
</p>

<p>
That 271 figure is the total number of valid, consensus-DNS TLDs,
period, regardless of whether they serve WHOIS data in any form.
However, even that total includes six ccTLDs that aren't in use, plus
one that's effectively offline for lack of a working DNS zonefile.

Darn it, I appear to have mislaid that file. I've checked all the emails
I got from you during this project, and I think I may have lost that
one - if you send me that list, I'll give it a shot.

It was /usr/local/share/domains-test, which essentally what you get from 
this algorithm:
</p>

<p>
Start with <a href="http://linuxmafia.com/pub/linux/network/domain-check-testdata">http://linuxmafia.com/pub/linux/network/domain-check-testdata</a> .
Grab the second and third columns (whois server and test case) of all
lines below the header lines, that have an asterisk in column one.
Invert their order.  Save.  Use with domain-check's -F option.
</p>

<p>
I've saved /usr/local/share/domains-test as
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/pub/linux/network/domains-test">http://linuxmafia.com/pub/linux/network/domains-test</a>, and will maintain
it there.
</p>

<p>
(I hope domain-check's -F-switch parsing ignores comment lines.)

Yep. And blank lines as well.
