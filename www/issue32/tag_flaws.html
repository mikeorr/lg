<p><strong>JIM,
HI I WAS WONDERING IF YOU CAN SEND ME SOME INFO.ALL I NEED IS THE
NAMES OF THE 5 FLAWS IN THE UNIX SYSTEM,JUST THE NAMES.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>IF YOU CAN SEND THEM TO ME I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE IT&gt;
</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>This is not the "We do your homework for you" service.

<li>I volunteer many hours per month answering 
    questions about Linux.  There are others out
    there who can answer your questions about 
    other forms of Unix.  I frequently answer 
    questions about how to interoperate between
    Linux and other OS' including many forms of
    Unix.  Most of what I say about Linux applies
    to most other forms of Unix.  However the 
    distinction is important.

<li>You need to learn where your <tt>[Caps Lock]</tt> key is
    and keep it turned off if you plan to get
    any co-operation or respect from anybody
    on the 'net (in Usenet netnews or on any
    technical mailing lists).

<li>There is no such thing as "the Unix System"
    there are many different versions of Unix ---
    and there have been for almost thirty years.

<li>If someone told you that there were "five"
    specific "flaws" in Unix they were suffering
    from horrible misconceptions.

<li>As likely it may be the case that you've  
    critically misundertood someone.
</ol>

<blockquote>Now to answer your question:
</blockquote>
<blockquote>There is no list of generally held "flaws" in Unix or
Linux that I know of.  There are a number of problems
with even postulating such a list.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>First there isn't any one Unix system.  C-Kermit claims
to support about 700 versions and implementations of Unix 
(and Unix-like operating systems).  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>There is considerable ongoing academic debate about what 
precisely is Unix.  I won't bother trying to provide
my own definition --- it would just get me flame mail
and perpetuate the debate.  There are many people who 
will even deny that there's any doubt.  They will say:
Unix is any system that has been "branded" by The
Open Group as conformant to the X/Open portability 
guidelines (XPG4 or XPG3).  Others will pipe in and
say that any thing that meets Spec1170 is Unix, while
others will claim that POSIX is the one true standard.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>At that point we'll go through the whole debate as to
whether Unix is limited to just those systems which are
dubbed to be "Unix" by this or that standards body,
or whether it applies to Unix like systems --- such as
Linux.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Indeed we could argue for days about what precisely is
Linux.  In the strict sense it is considered to be a
set of kernel sources and the ancillary device drivers,
and makefiles.  In common usage Linux refers to any of
a number of collections of software that run under a 
compilation of those (kernel) sources.  Others, notably
Richard Stallman, argue that the term Linux should be
applied only to the kernel sources and that a different
term should be applied to larger aggregations of 
software built around it.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>His argument is valid -- since most Linux distibutions
are about 5% to 10% Linux kernel sources, and drivers
and about 25% GNU software.  Since RMS is the principle
of the Free Software Foundation (the organization that
owns the copyright over the GNU sources) he has a 
reasonable interest in seeing that people know where
some of the major components of their Linux based
GNU systems come from.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Eventually the FSF will have a full operating system of 
it's own: the HURD.  The GNU project was started to
build such a system and the fact that they released
a large number of vital components for public use
is what made Linux possible.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>At the same time there are other bodies that have 
produced major software subsystems that are 
conventionally included in a Linux distribution.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The computer science research group (CSRG) at 
University of California, Berkeley released a large
number of packages and a large body of source code
for public use (BSD).  Many of the common utilities
under Linux (most of the NetKit, I think) are from these
sources.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The X Window system comes from MIT's Athena project and
the free implementation of that which we use under Linux
is principally from the XFree86 Project.  XFree86 is the
X Window system that's used by a number of Unix 
implementations including FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>So, if we were to try to fairly represent these parties
in our nomenclature we'd have to refer to our systems
as:
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Linux/GNU/BSD/XFree86/"MIT X Window System" Systems
</blockquote>

<blockquote>... which is why a respectfully decline to comply
with rms' desire for me to use the phrase Linux/GNU when
I mean "Linux" (in the common broader sense).  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The other reason I choose not do to this most of the time is 
that I find it more difficult to read in that form.  This is 
undoubtedly a horrible character flaw on my part but I find
that I sometimes subvocalize (mentally "sound out") passages
of technical text in my efforts to understand and proofread
it.  So, if rms likes he can simply say that my refusal to
refer to this is symptom of my stupidity.  I'll cop to that.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>So, I suppose we could say that the "first flaw" of Unix
is that no one seems to know what Unix is.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>While it is tempting to try to follow this line of logic
and devise four more for you --- I think it will be much
quicker and more amusing for you to read <em>The Unix-Haters 
 Handbook</em> by Simson Garfinkel, et al (IDG Books, (c) 1996).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Conveniently this book is in four "Parts":
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Part 1: User Friendly?
<br>Part 2: Programmer's System?
<br>Part 3: Sysadmin's Nightmare
<br>Part 4: Et Cetera
</blockquote>

<blockquote>... and I think that every serious student of Unix and Linux
should read this book.  For one thing it requires an advanced
understanding of Unix to understand the complaints --- and
a really advanced knowledge to see how many of these 
complaints don't apply to many "modern" Unix variants (Linux
in particular).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>For the rest of it I found it amusing, frustrating and 
significant that the many contributors to Unix_Haters did not 
list modern available alternatives that exhibited the features 
they preferred in an OS and environment (or at least that lack
the features that they hate).  There were references to 
the ancient "Lisp Machines" but there was no clear endorsement
nor were there any suggestions about how things "should be."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>So, as the title suggests this is a curmudgeonly book without
constructive merit.  However, the Unix and Linux enthusiast 
should be thoroughly familiar with the material for the same 
reason that a self-respecting agnostic should be thoroughly
familiar with the major religious works of whatever society
surrounds him or her.
