<p>"Foolish Things" is a now-and-again compilation we run based
on our readers' input; once we have several of these stories
assembled in one place, we get to share them with all of you. If
you enjoy reading these cautionary tales of woe, proud stories of
triumph, and just plain weird and fun things that happen between
humans and silicon, that's great; if you have some to share so
that others may enjoy them, even better. Please send them to

<h3>A Black Mark on Their Reputation</h3>

<p id="by"><b>Karl-Heinz Herrmann</b><br></p>

<p>We have a nice SCSI HP ScanJet that's been sitting around for
years; once in a while, we use it to scan X-ray films with a full
A4 backlight. After some PC rearranging, it got moved and stopped
working. The PC to which it was attached had SCSI cables that
were too long (which worked fine before), but, after being
shifted, the PC's SCSI disk would only run at lowest async speed.
We changed about everything on the chain including the SCSI
adapter in the stripped-down PC, but nothing helped. After giving
up on connecting the scanner, I put in the network card again:
the AGP graphics card stopped working, no screen output
whatsoever. Pull the network card out: screen acts OK. Hm.</p>

<p>Dismissing the PC as too flaky and ancient to care about (PII
400), I decided to plug the HP scanner into my Linux laptop just
to check it &mdash; and it worked perfectly. I then plugged it
into a mini-tower similar to the discarded one, and it worked
fine. So all is fine, right? Not so. After moving it around on
the table and arranging the cables nicely, it wouldn't work. Then
I realised that the scanner wasn't making the "normal noises" on
power up: it would move the sledge inside a short way &mdash; and
then nothing. When it was working, it would move the scan head
back and forth for a few seconds, and then switch off the light.
That was when we decided the scanner had a real problem after
all, and sent it to a repair shop &mdash; but they sent it back
saying the board was defective and they couldn't get a
replacement, since it's too ancient.</p>

<p>There it was, sitting on the desk &mdash; a huge thing, sturdy
beyond anything, and the board is "gone" just like that? By
moving it a bit? I decided to open it up and look for a bad
contact somewhere, maybe close to the SCSI connector. After I got
the case open (tricky to find the last two screws), I saw a bit
of the circuit board and the flat cables. Looks flawless to me
&mdash; fine mechanics, cable guides everywhere. So, I switch it
on, the head moves a little and stops with the light on &mdash;
so it's still not OK. But the light is blinding me, so I put a
sheet of paper on it &mdash; at which point, the head moves back
and forth, goes to the 'park' position and switches off the
light. (??!) It was reproducible, too. I turn around the top
cover, and there is the white strip used for calibrating the scan
sensors before each scan. I rub my finger over it, and it comes
up black; I clean the glass plate from the inside, put it on, and
&mdash; the scanner works perfectly. Damaged board indeed....
These fellows didn't even open it up.</p>

<h3>Letting Out the Magic Smoke</h3>

<p id="by"><b>Ben Okopnik</b><br></p>

<p>This is a story that I'm telling on myself rather than exposing someone
else's foolishness; as they say, "it was in a far country, and besides, the
wench is dead" &mdash; and I'm smarter (I hope!) than I was then. Many,
many years ago &mdash; those of you who were working with computers then
will have a good idea of when, once you read this &mdash; when I was just a
<a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/P/PFY.html">PFY</a> and still
learning the computer repair trade, I was working on a relatively new
machine that I had brought home from a client's place. The problem was that
the motherboard manufacturer (long since out of business &mdash; and with
good reason) used tiny <em>rivets</em> to connect the layers on the
opposite sides of the board instead of properly plating everything all the
way through. Well, as time went on, and thermal expansion flexed the board
microscopically, these rivets came loose &mdash; and so did the
connections. Randomly. Sometimes yes and sometimes no &mdash; and sometimes
maybe; depending on the weather, the humidity, how recently the computer
had been pounded with a fist, etc.</p>

<p>Expensive as it was back then &mdash; and it was very expensive indeed
&mdash; I had convinced this client to replace all these boards. He agreed,
through gritted teeth, but got me to promise that I would try my best to
keep his old boards working as long as possible..., so I spent a lot of
time soldering these rivets, using a contact-cleaning file around their
edges to get at least some kind of connection, or trying to solder
hair-fine wires to the traces. (This worked very rarely, since the traces
were so thin that they'd burn up as soon as you touched them with a
soldering iron.)</p>

<p>Back then, the standard bit of advice was to leave the computer plugged
in but turned off while you worked on it; this provided a local ground that
you were always touching and decreased the chance of blowing the chips
&mdash; which were <strong>very</strong> sensitive to static back then. The
board that I was working on was fairly new, and had just started showing
that random behavior. As usual, I plugged it in, made sure it was turned
off, and was twiddling my tiny file while quietly cursing to myself &mdash;
when suddenly, the chip next to the rivet, which I just happened to touch
with the file, EXPLODED. I mean, literally &mdash; blew out a chunk of its
ceramic packaging so I could see the silicon underneath.</p>

<p>I was completely flabbergasted. I had made absolutely sure that I
switched it off; I knew that the capacitors in the PC power supply were
designed to discharge in a fraction of a second after shutdown... What
happened? I grabbed my voltmeter and started poking around in the machine,
and figured it out after about two hours of measurements:</p>

<center>
  <strong>The computer I was working on had been designed with a
  brand-new feature: a power switch that "put it to sleep"
  instead of turning it off.</strong>
</center>

<p>(Yep... it was <em>that</em> long ago.)</p>

<p>I felt really awful, but... I did indeed follow the agreement
I had with that client: that board couldn't be repaired anymore,
and needed to be replaced. I forgot to mention that I was the one
that contributed to its slightly earlier demise.</p>

<p>P.S. I never signed up for <strike>that kind of serfdom</strike>
anything like that again - and I always used a grounding strap instead of a
plugged-in chassis since that day. :)</p>

<h3>Orientation Week</h3>

<p id="by"><b>Rick Moen</b><br></p>

<p>The time having come to concoct a replacement for my
server-grade 486DX2 EISA/VLB-bus Linux host, I decided one day
to build a new machine from best-of-breed parts (well, within
limits set by my being a cheapskate).</p>

<p>I happened to have an excellent tower case and PC Power &amp;
Cooling power supply handy, a pair of Adaptec PCI SCSI host
adapters, a SoundBlaster Pro, Matrox G200 video, a couple of
large, fast IBM SCSI hard drives, a Plextor SCSI CDR, and a pair
of 3Com 3C509B 10 megabit ethernet cards. (Hey, all it had to do
was potentially max out a 1.54 megabit T-1 line, OK?) That left
the matter of motherboard and parts attendant thereto.</p>

<p>After some checking, I bought a nice little FIC PA-2007
Socket-7-type motherboard. Then, from my favourite
vendors (SA Technology), I acquired 128 MB of Crucial Technology
SDRAM capable of running at CAS2 operation at 100MHz, an AMD
K6/233 CPU, and a big-kahuna heat sink with a fan on top that
uses ball bearings instead of the standard, noisy, failure-prone
sleeve bearings. The ensemble was designed to be highly reliable,
and at the same time hackable if I ever decided to join the
then-pervasive overclocking madness.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I banged everything together. It <em>seemed</em> to
work fine. The big tower case, low-heat-output CPU, and major
cooling capacity meant that the thing ran very cool and
reasonably quiet, even with the two very fast IBM 10,000 RPM SCSI
hard drives.</p>

<p>As was my custom, I started compiling a kernel after a bit.
That compile errored out with a SIG11. Hmm. Tried again. Errored
out even faster, and at a different point in the compile. Odd. Do
I have bad RAM?</p>

<p>Shut down and re-seated the RAM. Went downstairs to the
CoffeeNet (a <a href=
"http://www.linuxcabal.org/Historia.en.shtml">recently
reborn</a> 1990s Linux-based Internet cafe I'd helped build) for
a caffeine infusion. Came back, powered up, ran the compile. No
problems. Ran the compile again: SIG11. Ran it again: SIG11 at a
different place. Ran it with only half the RAM: Same symptoms.
Ran it with the other half: Same. Didn't seem to be a RAM
problem(?).</p>

<p>Slept on the problem. Woke up, fired up the machine, ran a
compile: No problem. Ran it again: No problem. Ran it a third
time: SIG11. Ran it again: Same error, different spot.</p>

<p>Pondered the problem for a bit: It seemed as if the error was
kicking in only after the system reached heat equilibrium, but
not during the initial 30 minutes of operation when the system
was still stone-cold. But that didn't make much sense: I opened
up the case and re-verified that the system really <em>was</em>
an engineer's dream of conservative design, and that even the
10,000 RPM drives were running cool.</p>

<p>I drove down from San Francisco to the Palo Alto Fry's and
bought both the heat-conductive pads you can sandwich between
CPUs and their heat sinks <em>and</em> the thermal paste you can
use instead. I was going to make double-sure that I had good
contact, there, before taking the CPU back to SA Technology and
looking like an idiot if it turned out to be perfectly OK.</p>

<p>I took the heat sink off the CPU, cleaned both off, put paste
on them and pressed them together. For some reason, perhaps on
account of some bell ringing in my unconscious mind, a few
minutes later I pulled them apart again to look at the two pieces
more closely.</p>

<p>And swore.</p>

<p>The Socket-7 motherboard socket for the K6 has a square
outline, and the pins have a square pattern, with one corner of
the CPU's pin-layout being different so you won't destroy it by
putting it in the wrong way. When you put the CPU into the
socket, <em>if you aren't looking too closely</em> (cue ominous
music), you think: square socket, square CPU with a keyed feature
to keep you from screwing up, square heatsink/fan assembly. 1, 2,
3 &mdash; done. Foolproof. (Well, no.)</p>

<p>The <em>top</em> surface of the CPU turned out to have a
heatsink-contact surface that extended only across maybe 70% of
the lateral distance, and the other 30% was sunk down lower.</p>
<pre>
---------------------
|            |      |
|            |      |
|            |      |
|            |      |
|  contact   |      |
|  surface   |      | 
|            |      | 
|            |      |
---------------------
</pre>

<p>I'd accidentally rotated the heatsink 180 degrees, so that
<em>its</em> contact surface was staggered over to the
right-hand-side:</p>
<pre>
---------------------
|      |            |
|      |            |
|      |            |
|      |            |
|      |   contact  |
|      |   surface  |
|      |            |
|      |            |
---------------------
</pre>

<p>Only a little strip in the middle was actually touching, so
all the other thermal paste was still protruding up into the air,
un-squashed. Most of the CPU top surface was getting
<em>zero</em> help with cooling, and instead was radiating out
into a nice warm, <em>insulating air pocket</em> under the
heatsink.</p>

<p>If this had been an Athlon or P4 Coppermine, the CPU probably would have
committed <em>seppuku</em>, but the K6 was completely undamaged and has
been happily cranking away ever since.</p>

<p>But that experience confirmed me in my prejudice that a cool
CPU (like a cool system generally) is much, much, much to be
preferred over one that runs hot and needs heroic measures like
huge amounts of forced air flow to stave off disaster. Those
other ones may be faster &mdash; but usually (for most machine
roles) don't even manifest that speed in ways you especially care
about.</p>
