This is just a follow-up to clarify workflow process, equally for my own
benefit and for <em>[person]</em>'s.  (I'm saying I could be talking out /dev/ass,
in which case anyone should please feel welcome to correct me.)</p>

<!-- I won't be commenting on most things except to say right here that -->
<!-- you got the workflow exactly right. -->
<p><strong>[Rick]</strong>
Nicely done, sir.  I especially like your respect for the Divine
Bandwidth.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
[laugh] I figured you'd spot that.</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
Laundrette material, laundrette material!</p>
<p><strong>[Kat]</strong>
this actually raises a point I'd been pondering of late.</p>
<p>The default is for lgang material to be excluded from LG Mailbag.</p>
<p>Should things like this current discussion on process be added perhaps
as &quot;Gazette Matters&quot; ?</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
Jokes and traditional LG banter (i.e., Ben and I sniping at each
other) have always been fair game for publishing.  It's usually
obvious that the bit of content won't reveal anybody's secrets and
that the &quot;insults&quot; are factetious, and the item was meant for
publishing.  (You have noticed that Ben has a tendancy to write in
elaborate imagery and metaphor when he gets going, right?  Like
Pasternak and Ayn Rand.  It would be a pity not to publish those
literary gems.  Though I'm sure you get tired of hearing them every
day.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Kat]</strong>
<strong>[grin]</strong> Tired of hearing them every day?</p>
<p>BWAHAHAHA!  Silly Mike, that's one of the bestest things in my days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're unsure whether something is safe to publish, you can
certainly ask for confirmation from the author.</p>
<blockquote>
I think even if I <em>am</em> dead certain, I'll be asking; given the nature of
lgang as a closed forum, the expectation is that one will not be
published.</blockquote>
<p>The only time I've
been offended is when Jimmy deliberately published an embarrassing
mistake I made (typing LG.com instead of LG.net), but that's precisely
why he did publish it, the little SOB.  :)</p>
<blockquote>
;)</blockquote>
<blockquote><em>
It's only fair to note that Mike <a href="what-zine.html">isn't
the only one</a> to do this - Jimmy
</em></blockquote>
<p>As for switching to tag when something is publishable, that's not
really practical in the middle of a discussion, and it would make it
hell for message-threading programs.  We can move a topic for &quot;this
topic belongs on the other list&quot;, but that's not practical for one or
two messages which are peripherally related to the topic: it would
take longer to explain the context than the messages themselves are.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[nod]</strong></blockquote>
<p>There are also threads that are obviously off-topic on either list:
language trivia, interesting spams, etc.  These are meant to be
Laundrette items (if the Laundrette editor accepts them).  But these
have been decreasing as of late.  The tag list is obviously more
appropriate for them.</p>
<blockquote>
The usual suspects have been busy offlist, and others have been
pressganged into all sorts of gazette-ly tasks...</blockquote>
<p>Also, there are times when one or the other list is down so we have to
shift all traffic to the other list.</p>
<p>Originally the tag list was just for TAG/Mailbag/2c Tips.  Margie and
I wrote the Back Page ourselves.  Gradually I started sending amusing
items to tag for discussion, and publishing the results.  The Back
Page/Laundrette has always had a different editor than the TAG
columns, but the source material has predominently  become
mailing-list messages.</p>
