<H2>What's This?</H2>

<P> This article is the the current installment in an ongoing series of site
reviews for the Linux community.  Each month, I will highlight a Linux-related
site and tell you all about it.  The intent of these articles is to let you
know about sites that you might not have been to before, but they will all have
to do with some aspect of Linux. Now, on with the story... 

<H2>SourceXchange (<a
href="http://www.sourcexchange.com/"><tt>http://www.sourcexchange.com/</tt></a>)</H2>  

<P>In past columns we looked at places to find information about
troubleshooting your Linux installation.  We looked at some language and
development sites.  We looked at some of the tools that you can use to put
together GUI-based apps quickly and efficiently.  So, now that you're an
accomplished developer-hacker...  Wouldn't it be nice to get paid for
developing open source applications?

<P>You bet yer sweet petootie it would be nice.  After all, that new dual
Athlon system was a little more than chump change for the month's allowance. 
This month, we look at SourceXchange.

<P>SourceXchange is a member of the 
<A HREF="http://Collab.net">Collab.net</A> network that has been getting a
bunch of press this month, especially with Sun's announcement that they'll be
opening the source to Star Office (yes, I'm already on that mailing list, and
I hope to be able to help out with some documentation or code), and hosting
the project on Collab.net servers.  SourceXchange offers quite a bit to the
budding and established open source developer, including peer reviews, project
hosting, spec writing and the chance to get paid for your work.

<P>We'll get to the money in a little bit, but let's take a look at what else
is there first.  SourceXchange's goal is to unite open source developers with
projects that fit a need.  If you've taken a look at some of the development
boards recently, there's a growing list of developers who are looking for
projects to work on.  The "what should I do now?" question seems to be popping
up more often.

<P>With this site, the developer doesn't have to spend the time and energy to
work up a challenging project, hop over to the RFP (Request For Proposal)
section and see if any of the unbid projects are of interest.  As this article
was being written there were RFPs for accessing image manipulation utilities,
developing a message board in PHP, and a few different RFPs for BXXP support
in various utilities.  Each RFP includes what the contractor is looking for in
terms of skills and deliverables and how much the contractor is willing to
pay, both in cash and materials.  If one of the RFPs strikes your fancy, you
can comment on it and express interest in offering your services to the
project.

<P>If you want to help out but don't want to work on the code itself,
SourceXchange also offers Peer Reviewer positions.  The Peer Reviewer is just
that, a peer reviewer; this is someone who will help the developer and guide
and review the progress toward the goal, acting as a third-party mediator to
ensure that the project is both completed and done well.

<P>Once all the players are selected, and the teams are finalized, the work
can begin.  SourceXchange provides a convenient place to post the status of
the deliverables as well as the developer and reviewer information, project
location and mailing list information and other pertinent details about the
project.  Developers are free to use whatever tools and hosting methods they
need, according to the terms that have been decided between them and the
project sponsors.

<P>When the projects are complete, SourceXchange ensures that the developers
recieve the peer review that is necessary to provide complete, accurate and
robust code, as well as the compensation that they were promised from the
project sponsors.

<P>You can view the RFPs and project invormation without registering, but to
really get the most out of this site, you do have to sign up and  work.  If
you want to be a part of a growing interest in open source development by big
business, you owe it to yourself to register as a developer and get on one of
these projects.  These projects may be substantially more than the Hello World
applets that we all know and love, but the compensation offered is nothing to
sneeze at either.
