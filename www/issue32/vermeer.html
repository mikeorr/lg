<P><FONT COLOR="#663300"><B>The origin of the current mess </B>can be traced
back to a short spell of ultra-liberalism, when the government caved in
to the pressure to cut taxes and eliminate the national debt by selling
off the road network. Politicaly, it has been a success; taxes are consistently
lower than they have been for long, and the man in the street seems to
be satisfied.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#663300"></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#663300">Of course in the beginning, the situation was
quite messy; highway segments were auctioned off, and the result was toll
booths everywhere, so you had to stop many times and have a lot of petty
cash handy if you wanted to get anywhere.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#663300"></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#663300">But then, gradually, a market leader appeared.
Federal Transport Corp. bought strategically placed road segments, connected
them into a countrywide network, made it impossible for anyone else to
do the same, and slowly took over the rest.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#663300"></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#663300">By the motorists, it was felt to be a blessing.
Sure, prices went up; but you could get by with getting a yearly license
and putting the barcode sticker on the roof of your car; you didn't even
have to brake anymore when passing the toll station. And the more roads
FT acquired, the better the offer they could make their customers; such
are the ways of "network externalities".</FONT><FONT COLOR="#663300"></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#663300">Obviously as many of us now realise, the net effect
was no tax drop at all. The yearly fee to FT is just another tax, if you
want to use your car to go anywhere at all; and what's worse, it is paid
to an authority we didn't elect ourselves. There has been a groundswell
of resistance, such as the freetown (or "open roads") movement, and I sympathise
fully with this.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#663300"></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#663300">I live in a freetown now; a small one, at the
foot of the mountains. Others are on the coast, or around airports. Few
are inland. We have our own road network that we own ourselves collectively,
just like in the old days. If you want to go to another freetown, you have
the options of air, rail and water transport, which are not (yet) under
FT's control. If you want to visit people outside freetown land, you have
to pay the toll, of course :-(&nbsp; This&nbsp; -- referred to as "gating
out" --&nbsp; is minimized by careful planning.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#663300"></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#663300">You may ask, why did I choose to live in a place,
and under a regime, that limits my freedom of movement so much? Well first
of all, it is my own choice. I don't want to owe my "freedom" to an authority
that does not represent me. And then, there are compensations. The people.
Freetowners are active, involved citizens; everything is debated, and decisions
are taken by informed people. Compare that to the way outside. It's a different
culture really, and I like it. They are my kind of people.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#663300"></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#663300">And, except in the matter of transport, life in
a freetown is just as good or better than outside. There is a lot of employment
in hi-tech; as I said, we are a sophisticated lot. And there are no advertisements
of FT, like there are everywhere outside, enquiring politely but insistently
where you would feel like going today... that really gets my blood pressure
up.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#663300"></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#663300">These are interesting times we live in; recently
the freetown movement has gained a lot of interest and newcomers are flowing
in. Resentment at the Federal Transport monopoly is tangible, now that
fees are going up and road maintenance is being neglected. Earlier, just
after the sell-off, roads were maintained well; you had the option of choosing
alternative routes, and the toll revenue was channeled to maintenance and
improvement. Now, many road segments seem to be in free fall down towards
their natural state. You still have alternative routes to choose from;
but they are all under FT's control and in uniformly poor shape.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#663300"></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#663300">And then there is this crazy project called the
RoadPlane. It is a gigantic vehicle, carrying hundreds of people at 200
mph along the highways, rolling along smoothly on smart-strutted wheels,
navigated by satellite, electronic map and road radar. I have heard of
people riding one of those things; quite an impressive experience, it appears.
FT's slogan is "A Better Plane Than The Plane", but some bad accidents
have happened already. It is a very complex system; OK as long as everything
works, but winter weather, the poor state of the roads, and errors in the
maps -- or an animal straying on to the road -- are hard to foresee and
take into account. These problems have generally been glossed over in the
media; FT represents a major advertising budget for them.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#663300"></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#663300">RoadPlane is FT hybris at its best. It is a white
elephant and that fills me with glee. This could be the undoing of FT,
who knows. But it will only happen if people take the trouble to inform
themselves, understand how they are being ripped off, and become active!</FONT><FONT COLOR="#663300"></FONT>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#663300">Similarity to real events and circumstances
is, again, purely and wholly intentional.</FONT></I>
