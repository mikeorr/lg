Hello again!

I posted the question below a week ago.

I remind you (or inform you, if you've never read the top of our web pages)
that The Answer Gang does not quarantee that we will or can answer you.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<em>IF</em> any amongst the Gang do, though, we also can't guarantee that it will
be in a timely manner.  The longest anyone who HAS gotten an answer waited
was <EM>months</EM> ... I think it might have been over a year ... because back in
issue 36 Jim went through his entire backlog.  We weren't the "Gang" yet,
and a full backlog check isn't likely to ever happen again.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Somehow lucky for you, you got me in a good mood even though you make
this annoying assumption that we'd give you instant feedback.  Often that
wouldn't be enough - in fact it would encourage me to shuffle your mail
away, since as an editor here I see ALL the TAG mail, and have to go through
it in much detail later - but I see an opportunity to get some useful data
to everyone else out there too.  So you win the "Answer Gang" lotto and I'll
give it a shot.  You get a slight roasting for free.

Sadly for you, I still use Bind8, and so any tech I know to sync dhcp with
bind (very little;  DHCP's not my specialty anyway and my own network
presently does use static IPs) might not be as useful.  Not that this sort
of lack of knowledge has ever stopped me before

A.  If you need a timely reply from someone who specifically knows a topic,
I recommend hiring a paid consultant on that topic.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Generically, you may be able to find them by visiting the Consultants HOWTO
in the LinuxDoc project:
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/LDP/lcg/html"
	>http://www.linuxdoc.org/LDP/lcg/html</A>
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
That howto is maintained by the folks at LinuxPorts; they also have searches
into it at:
<A HREF="http://www.linuxports.com"
	>http://www.linuxports.com</A>
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
That's pretty decent for finding individuals as well as companies of varying
size, just in case you have any prejudice against mega-consultant houses.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Specifically, any companies who commercially maintain code related to the
programs you are using, may offer "professional services".  It is worth
checking their sites for further documentation first though.

I have a "Mixed" network of linux and microcrap
so this would be a big help.  I would rather not use fixed IPs.

I can certainly sympathize with that;  another possibility is to use
network address translation (sometimes called NAT) and the private, reserved
address ranges.  Under RFC 1918 (I used
<A HREF="http://asg.web.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc1918.html"
	>http://asg.web.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc1918.html</A> but there are mirrors everywhere)
these ranges are:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>     192.168.0.0     -   192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)
</font></code></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
readable by the rest of us less netmask-aligned sorts as:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>     192.168.*.*
</font></code></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
although a lot of people wimp out and only use 192.168.0.* or 192.168.1.*,
you can do some pretty cool stuff by using more of them, or avoid possible
collisions with other nets coming in by using s third octet value other than
1 or 0.
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>     172.16.0.0      -   172.31.255.255  (172.16/12 prefix)
</font></code></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
aka
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>     172.[16-31].*.*
</font></code></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
For some reason a lot of people forget about this one entirely.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
and the possibly infamous "10 net":
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>     10.0.0.0        -   10.255.255.255  (10/8 prefix)
</font></code></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
aka
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>     10.*.*.*
</font></code></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
where again, a wide tendency to use 0 or 1 sometimes leads people to
unnecessary collisions.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
That is, you could use static IPs for machines which are not going to move
around a lot, without having to request more from your provider.  This does
not negate some good uses for DHCP though:
</blockQuote>

<blockQuote><ol>
<LI>it's much easier to renumber a zillion MSwin boxes if they all just use
   dhcp.  Note renumbering is far less needed with private addresses.  Note
   if they all come on at the same time there will be a broadcast storm
   while the busy server hands out everybody's addresses.


<LI>You may want laptops to only use a limited range of IP addresses.  Your
   laptop users may not be up to setting their static IP settings to match
   your office, and then away to something else for other sites they'll be
   visiting.
</ol></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
However, you do not really need to tie bind to dhcp unless the machines
need to be able to be addressed in the DNS by name.  In other words, if
they are providing services of some sort.  Most companies of any notable
size think it's a bad idea to let their individual desktops be addressed
by the outside world anyway.  But the <EM>inside</EM> world... well, you could
be using split DNS I suppose.  That is, the DNS your inside folk see for
your domain is a more complete version, which is not shown to the outside
world.  Outsiders only see the usual obvious things like your web server
a few mail servers, and of course, an outside-world nameserver or three.

How do you get the dhcpd to update BIND9.  I am running <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A>7.3 with the
servers on the same machine.  In dhcpd.conf I've made the ddns-hostname(tried
both name and IP) , domain, update-style(ad-hoc) entries.  In Bind I've
allowed update from localnet, and localhost.  Nothing happens. both start
with no errors that I can see.  What am I missing?

Bind (aka named) and DHCP are maintained by the Internet Software Consortium.

</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
They have consulting.  They point at a book, "DHCP" by Ted Lemon and Ralph
E. Droms.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Although I will mention that the <A HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</A> folk also heartily recommend
"DNS and Bind" by Paul Albitz and Cricket Liu, as being an excellent intro
to the topic.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
In my personal involvements in the community, I also know that Nominum did
a bunch of coding in the Bind9 project.  They're a big commercial creature,
and it so happens they are one of the entities offered at ISC as your
possible consultant:

The other one -- if you're in Europe somewhere it's probably closer to you --
is Mind:

</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If you go "the enterprise route" then purchasing your support contract through
ISC supports their efforts, bandwidth use, etc. towards these really rather
cool projects.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
For just general DNS questions I find that the very best web based resource
is "Ask Mr.DNS" - although Acme Byte and Wire was bought up, the new owners
have graciously allowed his to continue doing that, and the archives stay
online:
<A HREF="http://www.acmebw.com/askmrdns"

</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Cool, he's got a category just for dynamic updates such as you're asking
after...
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Best of luck, happy holidays.  If things work for you, please feel free to
let us know, or even to write up an article for us.  If you did that, then
the next time someone asks this sort of thing, we can point them at your
successful efforts
