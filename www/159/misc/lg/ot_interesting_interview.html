Oh, damn. I sent this to TAG yesterday, and I guess mine got kicked off
for the same reason.
</p>

<p>
My favorite quote there described adware wars between competitors:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
M: [...] I used tinyScheme, which is a BSD licensed, very small, very
fast implementation of Scheme that can be compiled down into about a 20K
executable if you know what you're doing.
 
Eventually, instead of writing individual executables every time a worm
came out, I would just write some Scheme code, put that up on the
server, and then immediately all sorts of things would go dark. It
amounted to a distributed code war on a 4-10 million-node network.
 
S: In your professional opinion, how can people avoid adware?
 
M: Um, run UNIX.

<p>
Sorry about that.  The setup does some initial interception in Exim4
(the MTA) based on certain text matches deemed far more likely than not
to be junkmail, and there are some false positives.  I started out with
a prepackaged set of such filter specs, provided with J.P. Boggis's
EximConfig, and once in a long while end up disabling one because there
have been too many false positives on it.  However, in general, J.P.
struck the right balance, in my opinion.
</p>

<p>
That is, as annoying as having your legitimate mail fail because of
trivial resemblance to autogenerated mail from malware, you should see
the volume of crud that the filter blocks.

(Although I try not to rely on secrecy for effectiveness of antispam
measures, it's probably best not to publish this subthread about
postings being blocked by my antispam filters or not.  Because I'd
rather not publish the regexes, you see.)

<p>
No, yours didn't trigger the subject-header filter in question, because
your subject header was "Life under Windows these days" or something
like that.

No problem; we have just the excision and cauterization tools required
for the job (Kat's previous bio pic, in which she was holding a giant
pair of scissors, would be highly apropos here.)
</p>

<p>
For future reference, there's actually a couple of tags that can be used
here (TAG tags?) to either keep the content from being published or to
keep it from being processed by our mailbag script.
 
 [[[Elided content]]] 
<em>This</em> paragraph won't be converted by the script but will be
used <strong>raw</strong>, thus preserving the formatting instead of
displaying the HTML tags as text. All this formatting stuff is, of
course, documented in the <a
href="http://linuxgazette.net/faq/members-faq.html">TAG FAQ</a>. 
(As I'm sure everyone is aware, this kind of thing is hard to remember
and easy to forget - so all I can do is keep bringing it up when the
occasion offers.)

Nice. Anyone using Mutt, or any other MUA
that lets you hook program execution to actions within the MUA, could
construct a "subject checker" that will either warn you (I'm not sure
how you'd implement that one, though) or modify the subject
automatically so that it no longer matches these. 
</p>

<p>
However, to quote the oh-so-quotable Dubbya (from the Gibson interview
about his upcoming retirement):
</p>

<pre>
[...] wouldn't it be interesting for baby boomers not to retire in nice
places, but to retire -- during their retirement, go help people deal
with malaria or AIDS?
 
[...] I'm not suggesting that's what I'm going to do, but it is the kind
of thing that intrigues me.
</pre>

<p>
Good luck to all you regex-wranglers out there. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
