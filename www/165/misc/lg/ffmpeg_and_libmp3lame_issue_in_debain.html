Hello list,
</p>

<p>
I have upgraded my box to debian squeeze. And discover ffmpeg stops
converting to .mp3 . I have libmp3lame installed ; more over it was
running well before up-gradation. After doing some google serach I have
found that libmp3lame support has been disabled in official debian
package. Then I have found multimedia.debia.org repo where the ffmpeg is
distributed with less strict license policy. but again vlc now broken
after adding that repo in my sources.lst and updating due to library
collision. 
</p>

<p>
Is there any repo which provides the ffmpeg with mp3 support and still
maintain the official debian naming scheme ?  then I can use both vlc as
well as ffmpeg.
</p>

<p>
Thanks
</p>

<p>
Kindly cc to me
</p>

<p>
Please read about "apt pinning" so as to avoid using the vlc from
the alternate repository.

<p>
Secondly, you need not "google" to find out that libmp3lame support
has been disabled. That information is in the NEWS.Debian file that
is distributed with the new package (and is automatically displayed
if you install apt-list-changes).
