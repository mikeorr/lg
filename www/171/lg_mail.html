<p>
This is a pre-release of apertium-en-ca (because there are some bugs
you can't find until after you've released...)
</p>

<p>
New things:
<pre>
Vocabulary sync with apertium-en-es 0.7.0
English dialect support (British and American)
Initial support for Valentian forms
Start of Termcat import - Thanks to Termcat for allowing this, and to
Prompsit Language Engineering for facilitating it.
At the moment, only a few items have been important. They have mostly
been limited to terms which include ambiguous nouns (temps, estació,
etc.)
</pre>
Caveats:
</p>

<p>
The vocabulary sync is not complete: specifically, I skipped some
proverbs, and had to omit the verb 'blog'.
The Valentian support is not as complete as apertium-es-ca (on the
other hand, the English dialect support is better than en-es)
</p>

<p>
This release also includes several multiwords harvested from Francis
Tyers' initial investigations into lexical selection (and others
suggested by it).

<p>
Announcing apertium-ht-en 0.1.0
</p>

<p>
In response to a request from volunteers at Crisis Commons
(<a href='http://crisiscommons.org'>http://crisiscommons.org</a>), we have put some effort into creating
a Haitian Creole to English module for Apertium. We do not usually
make releases at such an early stage of development, but because of
the circumstances, we think it's better to make available something
that at least partly works, despite its numerous flaws, than to
hold off until we can meet our usual standards.
</p>

<p>
The present release is for Haitian Creole to English only; much of
the vocabulary was derived from a spell checking dictionary using
cognate induction methods, and is most likely incorrect -- CMU
have graciously provided Open Source bilingual data, but have
deliberately used a GPL-incompatible licence, which we cannot use.
We hope that they will see fit to change this.
</p>

<p>
Many thanks to Kevin Scannell for providing us with spell checking
data; to Francis Tyers and Kevin Unhammer for their contributions;
and to the Apertium community for their support and indirect help.
</p>

<p>
I would like to dedicate this releas to the memory of my grandmother,
Anne O'Regan, who passed away on Monday the 18th, just after I began
working on this.

<h3>Creating appealing schemas and charts</h3>

Dear TAG,
</p>

<p>
unfortunately I have to create a whole bunch of schematas, charts, diagrams, 
flow charts, state machines (fsm) and so on for my diploma thesis - and I was 
wondering if you happen to know some good tools to create such graphics.
</p>

<p>
Of course I know about dia, xfig, (open office draw), gimp, inkscape - but 
either the diagrams look really really old-fashioned (dia, xfig) or are rather 
cumbersome to create (gimp, inkscape, draw) - especially if you have to modify 
them afterwards.
</p>

<p>
So I'm looking for a handful of neat tools to create some appealing schematas.
Unfortunately I can't provide a good example - but thinks, like colors, 
borders,round edges are definitely a good start <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
I have to admit that it is arguable whether some eye-candy is really necessary 
in a scientific paper - however adding a bit of it, really helps the reader to 
get the gist of the topic faster.
</p>


<p>
Thanks,
Peter
</p>

<h3>Find what is created a given directory?</h3>

Hey,
</p>

<p>
I know it sounds kind of weird but I want to know if it is possible to 
identify what process/program is creating this particular directory on 
my system.
</p>

<p>
Basically, in my home folder a directory called "Downloads" keeps 
getting created at random times. The directory doesn't have any content 
inside it and is just an empty folder.
</p>

<p>
I thought that it was probably being created by one of the applications 
I run at the time but when I tried to narrow down the application by 
using each one separately and waiting for the directory to be created I 
wasn't able to replicate the issue.
</p>

<p>
I also tried searching on Google for this but seems like no one else is 
having this issue or maybe my searches are too generic.
</p>

<p>
I am running Debian Testing (Squeeze)  and the applications I normally 
have running are:
</p>

<pre>
* Firefox (3.6)
* Thunderbird (3.0.1)
* Dolphin (Default KDE 4.3.4 version)
* Konsole (3-4 instances)
* EditPlus using wine
* Amarok (1.4.10)
* ksensors
* Tomboy Notes
* xchat
* gnome-system-monitor
</pre>

<p>
BTW, I noticed the same behavior when I was using Ubuntu last year (9.10).
</p>

<p>
Any idea's on how to figure this out? Have any of you noticed something 
similar on your system?
</p>
