Awesome! I'm always looking for a place to dump my kids' diapers... now,
I'll just store them at Google until I can find a convenient trashcan.
It's also nice to know that Google will automatically index them for me:
in case the available trashcan isn't big enough to hold the entire set,
I can implement a FIFO algorithm (perhaps with special-case handling for
the stinkiest ones.)

This, unfort, is one of the trade-offs we've had to make due to living
on a boat. We really, <strong>really</strong> wanted to go with cloth diapers - I had
no problem with investing the $250 or so to get set up with one of the
available systems - but the lack of an easily-available washing machine
defeated us in the end. We have a little manual washing machine on board
(<a href='http://www.laundry-alternative.com/wonderwash.htm'>http://www.laundry-alternative.com/wonderwash.htm</a>), and it's a
wonderful gadget... but there's just no way for my wife to keep up with
the laundry needs for a family of four <em>and</em> ~10 diapers a day on top of
that.
</p>

<p>
We're very aware of our environmental impact overall, especially the
edges that most people don't consider; e.g., washing cloth diapers means
N extra loads per week|month|year and dumping detergent, etc. back into
the water system. All of our water comes from our tanks - meaning that
we either have to refill it by taking the boat to a dock, or (more
commonly) by filling our 5-gallon jugs and humping them to, and onto,
the boat. As it stands right now, we average about 3 gallons a day for
all our needs (although it can temporarily spike somewhat higher); the
average American family of four uses <strong>400</strong> gallons per day
(<a href='http://www.wrb.state.ri.us/education/wtroutdoor_factsheet.pdf'>http://www.wrb.state.ri.us/education/wtroutdoor_factsheet.pdf</a>). 
</p>

<p>
You <em>can't</em> live aboard a cruising boat, full-time, and not be
environmentally conscious. There are lots of people to whom the
environment is emotionally important, and there's nothing wrong with
that; to us, it's everything from our daily bread to the power that we
use to run our computers. It's an intimate friend, and we treat it that
way, every day.
