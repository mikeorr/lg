<h1>From Assembler to COBOL with the Aid of Open Source</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/howell.html">Edgar Howell</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Recently I had occasion to help convert an Assembler program into COBOL.
The Assembler part of it was familiar to me from the old days of IBM
Assembler 360/370/390, which was source-compatible with that used by
Siemens, Amdahl, and others at one time or another on so-called "big-iron".
For other than systems work, Assembler is gradually falling out of favor,
not without justification, based on some of what I have seen over the last
decade or so. Within this environment, COBOL is still a reasonable and
viable alternative.</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>The program in question was well over 6000 lines of code -- 8000
with macro expansions -- and easily would have taken several weeks
to convert completely by hand. Only then could compilation and
testing start. A nightmare.</p>

<p>Fortunately, for many years one of the participants in the
project has been working on tools to improve the quality of
Assembler code as well as to convert it to PL/1 or COBOL. But it is
in the nature of Assembler that such a tool can never be finished.
Many of the Assembler programs I've seen in the past remind me of a
demolition derby: getting there is all that counts, it doesn't matter how
you do it!</p>

<p>I was given a copy of the Assembler program in which each
line had a unique line number, as well as a copy of the COBOL
program produced by software which had references to the line
number of Assembler code that caused generation of that particular
line of COBOL code. And "all" I had to do was review the generated
code and adapt it as needed. Hmmmm...</p>

<h3>Manual Work</h3>

<p>Had it only been necessary to make minor changes here and there,
likely the task would have been quickly finished. But there were
numerous places where something needed to be adjusted, often the
same problem, just a variation on a theme, and another place where
another change meant another chance of making a mistake.</p>

<p>To be sure, the vast majority of the software-generated code was
in excellent condition - but this isn't horseshoes. Even though the
customer will have to make final adjustments based on his operating
environment, it just wouldn't do to turn the final product over
with too many problems.</p>

<p>As it turned out, the biggest problem was that the software
faithfully produced COBOL code that replicated the Assembler code
very closely. Where the original code was clean, so was the
COBOL.</p>

<h3>Assembler vs COBOL</h3>

<p>Here is a small example of the problem. The following Assembler
code, which defines storage to manipulate the date (century, year, month
day) -</p>

<pre class="code">
    H1CYMD   DS    0CL8
    H1CYM    DS    0CL6
    H1CYY    DS    0CL4
    H1C      DS    CL2
    H1YY     DS    CL2
    H1MM     DS    CL2
    H1DD     DS    CL2
</pre>

<p>resulted in the following COBOL:</p>

<pre class="code">
    01  H1CYMD PIC X(8). 
    01  filler6607 REDEFINES H1CYMD. 
            10 H1CYM PIC X(6). 
            10 filler6608 REDEFINES H1CYM. 
                    20 H1CYY PIC X(4). 
                20 filler6609 REDEFINES H1CYY. 
                            30 H1C PIC X(2). 
                            30 H1YY PIC X(2). 
                            30 filler6611-0 REDEFINES H1YY. 
                                35 H1YY-char PIC X(6). 
                            30 filler6611 REDEFINES H1YY. 
                                35 H1YY-2-char PIC X(4). 
                20 H1MM PIC X(2). 
            10 H1DD PIC X(2). 
</pre>

<p>Aside from the fact that this COBOL is pig-ugly, it isn't even
syntactically correct!</p>

<p>However, this is not due to the software but the Assembler code
itself: in the symbol table H1YY has a length of 2 because of its
explicit declaration with that length, but the REDEFINES H1YY-char
has a syntactically invalid length of 6 because that is the
explicit length used with it at one point in the Assembler program.
That's not syntactically incorrect in Assembler, but it is up to the
programmer to know whether that length is reasonable to use. Originally,
it was - but not in COBOL.</p>

<p>But there is no way I could have a chance of finding every
situation like that by hand. Now what?!</p>


<h3>Open Source to the Rescue</h3>

<p>The Norns have been very kind to me of late. A while back I had
discovered a COBOL complier for Linux but hadn't had the time to
investigate it. The problem with it was that since it wasn't part
of any distribution I had, I couldn't just grab an RPM and plop it
onto one of the machines and expect it to function.</p>

<p>It was now time to make time.</p>

<h3>Installing Open COBOL under SuSE 10.0</h3>

<p>As usual, nothing ever goes smoothly the first time - and
installing this package was no exception. In the following, I have
omitted the false starts, other than to demonstrate what to do if
that should happen to you. Basically, by not doing my homework up
front, I gained a certain level of experience at that. Do pay
attention to prerequisites when a package you are interested in is
kind enough to let you know in advance.</p>

<p>The documentation that came with Open COBOL listed the following
packages as required:</p>

<pre class="code">
   libgmp      decimal arithmetic
   libtool     dynamic CALL statements
</pre>

<p>The following were optional:</p>

<pre class="code">
   libdb       indexed file I/O and SORT/MERGE
   libncurses  SCREEN SECTION
</pre>

<p>Using YaST, I installed four of the following packages (listed as
required for development) that were available but not yet installed:</p>

<pre class="code">
   autoconf
   automake
   libtool     present
   gettext     present
   bison
   flex
</pre>

<p>Installation then went as follows (indentation indicates a
different GUI window and CTRL-D exits root status):</p>

<pre class="code">
mkdir /tmp/COBOL
cp /media/usb01/COB/open-cobol-0.32.tar.gz /tmp/COBOL/
cd /tmp/COBOL
tar xzf open-cobol-0.32.tar.gz
cd open-cobol-0.32
./configure
</pre>

<p>This failed because one of the required packages had not yet
been installed. No biggie, I just opened another window and
installed GMP.</p>

<pre class="code">
      mkdir /tmp/GMP
      cp /media/usb01/COB/gmp-4.1.4.tar.gz /tmp/GMP/
      cd /tmp/GMP
      tar xzf gmp-4.1.4.tar.gz
      cd gmp-4.1.4
      ./configure
</pre>

<p>This also failed since I hadn't anticipated doing any
"development" in this partition. So I fired up YaST and installed
gcc as well as glib2-devel and glib2-doc (instead of glib-* since
glib2 was already installed).</p>

<pre class="code">
      ./configure
      make  
</pre>

<p>This took a tremendous amount of time to write endless messages
to the screen. Well, that is what you will think if you have never
run 'make' before.</p>

<pre class="code">
      su
      make install
</pre>

<p>At this point you will need to note for later (export) the
messages regarding /usr/local/lib or whatever.</p>

<pre class="code">
      make clean
      CTRL-D  &lt;end root status&gt;
./configure
</pre>

<p>The following messages at the end are merely informative ("no"
due to absence of optional packages):</p>

<pre class="code">
            Use gettext for international messages: yes
            Use Berkeley DB for file I/O:           no
            Use fcntl for file locking:             yes
            Use ncurses for screen I/O:             no
</pre>

<pre class="code">
make
su
make install
make clean
CTRL-D  &lt;end root status&gt;
</pre>

<h3>Initial Tests</h3>

<p>The only thing left to do was to see if it had been worth all
the effort.</p>

<pre class="code">
cd &lt;directory_with_test_programs&gt;
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
cobc hello.cob
./hello
Hello World!
</pre>

<p>After that I spent a bit of time playing around with what the
compiler can handle. <a href="misc/howell/cobol.cob">Here</a> you
can see a bit of code using decimal arithmetic -- which blew me
away! But, then, that is what the GMP package is all about.</p>

<p>That worked so well that I decided to dig out an almost
20-year-old test program from a COBOL package that worked under
MS-DOS. Minimal compiler error messages. And after I made comments
of a couple of lines of code, the program compiled. And executed!
Like access to the date and time in the machine, output to the
screen, input from the keyboard. And I didn't have to change
anything!</p>

<h3>The Acid Test</h3>

<p>OK, so it's time to see if this thing can help me with my
real-world problem. I fed it the program I had been working on and
among the error messages were:</p>

<pre>
/tmp/temp.cob:2081: size of 'filler6611-0' larger than size of 'H1YY'
/tmp/temp.cob:2083: size of 'filler6611' larger than size of 'H1YY'
</pre>

<p>I'm a believer!</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>While I may never have need to do any program development with this
COBOL compiler, in a very brief period of time it has made a big impression
on me. It seems to produce good code, although divide by zero didn't give
the response <strong>I</strong> expected. Still, the ability to deal with
decimal arithmetic is very impressive.</p>

<p>It seems to be very good at discovering syntactic errors in source code.
I spent considerable time finding and fixing minor syntax problems that I
never ever would have found just by reading the code. Exactly what I had
hoped for.</p>

<p>And it ought to be perfect for anyone wanting to learn COBOL at home
without the time pressure or expense of a formal class somewhere.</p>

<p>Due to dependencies, installing Open Source programs can turn into a bit
of a pain, particularly if the discrepancies between your system and the
requirements of the package are too great. But within reason this can be
overcome, as you saw above. And in all likelihood, the accompanying
documentation will let you know what is needed.</p>

<p>It can certainly be worth your taking the time to try out that
package of interest.</p>
