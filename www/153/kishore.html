<h1>Recent Developments in the Phoenix Project</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/kishore.html">Kishore A</a></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
 When you conduct experiments in modern Physics, the equipment involved is
often complicated, and difficult to control manually. Also, precise
measurement of time, and fast and continuous measurement of physical
quantities are often required. Consequently, such experiments are
automated and computer-interfaced. This means that the scientist carries
out the experiment by controlling the equipment using a computer.</p>

<p>
 Carrying out an experiment consists of different steps. The first step is
to activate the equipment, that is, to start the physical phenomenon which
is to be studied. For example, in a simple pendulum experiment, this step
would be to set the pendulum in motion. Once the physical system is active,
we record the observations. This is the second step - data acquisition. 
The final step is the analysis of the data obtained. Computers are unique
in that they can be used for all these three steps, with the appropriate
peripheral equipment.</p>

<h3>What is Phoenix?</h3>

<p>
 When a student who has completed her post-graduate studies in Physics
starts doing research, she inevitably has to carry out computer-interfaced
experiments. But we do not get such exposure in our education system, even
at the post-graduate level. As a result, it is likely that the student
would find herself in highly unfamiliar territory. Of course, the research
facility would provide a friendly interface and adequate help to the
student to complete her experiment successfully, but chances are that the
student might not have developed a feel for the whole procedure. This
affects the quality of research.</p>

<p>
So what is the way out? The obvious solution is to introduce computer-
interfaced experiments right at the undergraduate or even high school
level. One of the main obstacles is the cost involved. Though computers
have become inexpensive, commercially available data acquisition hardware
is too expensive to be affordable for college labs, where teaching/learning
and not research is the main objective. Thus the idea of building a
low-cost data acquisition hardware, and subsequently <a
href="http://iuac.res.in/~elab/phoenix">"Physics with Home-made Equipment
and Innovative Experiments" (Phoenix)</a>, evolved. Phoenix is a big step
in the right direction. It is easily affordable for colleges and can be
interfaced with personal computers via 100% free and open source
software.</p>

<p>
Read the article <a
href=http://linuxgazette.net/111/pramode.html>Experimental Physics with
Phoenix and Python by Pramode.C.E</a>, published in 2005, to get an idea
about the project. Here I will talk about some of the recent
developments.</p>

<h3>The Interface</h3>

<p>
The <a
href="http://iuac.res.in/~elab/phoenix/parport_phoenix/index.html">first
version of Phoenix</a> was completed around September 2004. It communicated
with the computer through the parallel port interface, and depended
entirely on the computer CPU for control. Time measurements were done using
the CPU clock itself, using real time operating system features. The device
driver took care of all the control and measurements. It was first
implemented using DOS, and later using real time Linux. As it later became
completely based on free and open source software (FOSS), it attracted
interest from the FOSS community, most notably from <a
href=http://pramode.net>Pramode C E</a> , who continues to be an active
developer/promoter of Phoenix. As a result, demonstrations of Phoenix have
since been held at some of the prominent FOSS events like FOSS.IN,
FOSSMeet@NITC, etc.</p>

<p>
 But the parallel port version was never going to be viable in the long
run. For one thing, it was bulky. More importantly, for using it on a
computer, you had to compile the device driver with the kernel. This would
have been too difficult a task for the end user. As a result, it was not
very portable, in the sense that you could not just plug Phoenix in and
start using it. Some amount of expertise in programing was required for
installing the Phoenix driver. It is still a valuable tool for students for
learning how to write device drivers, though.</p>

<img src="misc/kishore/newbox.jpg" alt="Phoenix-M"/>

<p>
This led to a complete redesign of Phoenix in early 2006. The new design
was based on the <a
href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/Product_card.asp?part_id=2010">Atmel
ATMega16 microcontroller</a> , which shifted the control tasks from the
real time kernel, to the firmware (written in C and compiled using the
AVR-GCC cross compiler) running on the microcontroller. This made things a
lot simpler. Now once you burned the firmware into the microcontroller flash
memory, all you needed was a code library to communicate with it from the
PC (through the RS232 serial port interface). No more complicated device
drivers! Also, this made the hardware schematic simpler and easier to
debug. The new version of Phoenix was named the Phoenix-Mini, or Phoenix-M
for short. It was also much more compact (13cm x 10.5cm x 2.5 cm) and
cheaper (it costs only around Rs.1500 [Editorial note: about US$35 at time
of publication - pretty darn amazing for a project of this scope! -- Ben])
than its predecessor. </p>

<h3>Using Phoenix</h3>

<p>
 One of the objectives of Phoenix is to carry out computer-interfaced
scientific experiments "without getting into the details of electronics or
computer programing". For this purpose, Phoenix has a comprehensive
software library in C and Python. The simplest way to communicate with
Phoenix would be to use Python. The following code segment can be used to
read the Digital Inputs of Phoenix.</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt;import phm 		#Phoenix library
&gt;&gt;&gt;p = phm.phm()	#Initialize a Phoenix "object"
&gt;&gt;&gt;p.read_inputs()	#Read the digital inputs (all internally pulled up to HIGH when open)
15
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre> 

<p>
 Consider an experiment for calculating the value of acceleration due to
gravity by measuring the time of freefall of an object. A small metal ball
is held by a solenoid, which is energized by one of the Digital Outputs
(say D0), at a known height. A speaker is kept on the base, to pick the
vibrations when the ball hits the surface. Since these signals would be
weak, they are fed to one of the Digital Inputs (say D3), through an
amplifier. You need to measure the time taken by the ball to hit the ground
after it is detached from the coil. This can be done as follows:</p>

<img src="misc/kishore/gravity_setup.jpg" alt="Apparatus"/>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt;import phm
&gt;&gt;&gt;p = phm.phm()
&gt;&gt;&gt;p.write_outputs(1) 	#Set D0 HIGH to Energize the coil
&gt;&gt;&gt;p.clr2rtime(0,3)	#Release the ball and measure time of fall (returns time in microseconds)
317345
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The class Phoenix contains a variety of functions (methods) for experiment
control and data acquisition. They can be broadly classified into simple
input/output, block read, time measurement, and other functions - details of
which are given on <a
href=http://iuac.res.in/~elab/phoenix/software/doc/phlib.html>http://iuac.res.in/~elab/phoenix/software/doc/phlib.html</a>.
You can also refer to the <a
href="http://iuac.res.in/~elab/phoenix/docs/phm_book.pdf">Phoenix
manual</a> for detailed documentation. </p>

<h3>Graphical User Interface</h3>

<p>
Phoenix has a crisp Graphical User Interface. The GUI programs are very
useful for beginners to get started, though of course they can never be a
substitute for actual programing. There are mainly two GUI programs -
<i>Experiments</i> and <i>CROPlus</i>. <i>Experiments</i> is a collection
of all the experiments under one roof. It has a friendly interface - with a
photograph of the equipment, a short description of the experiment, and
buttons for necessary control and data analysis. <i>CROPlus</i> is a
software implementation of a low-frequency storage oscilloscope. It also
provides the user with a visual front end to many I/O and time measurement
functions. Both these programs have been developed using the TkInter
toolkit.</p>

<img src="misc/kishore/croplus.png" alt="'CROPlus'"/></p>

<h3>Workshops</h3>

<p>
Many workshops have been conducted to acquaint physics teachers with
computer-interfaced experiments using Phoenix. The first Phoenix workshop
was held on 11 November 2004 at the University of Calicut, Kerala. The
first workshop hosted by IUAC was conducted from the 3rd to the 14th of
October 2005.  Many such workshops have been held since. Teachers from all
parts of the country have taken part in these programs, and more such
workshops will be conducted in the future. You can find a complete list of
the Phoenix workshops conducted so far, as well as announcements regarding
future workshops at <a
href=http://iuac.res.in/~elab/phoenix/workshops/index.html>http://iuac.res.in/~elab/phoenix/workshops/index.html</a>
.</p>

<h3>Ready for the Market!</h3>

<p>
Phoenix-M was ready by the end of May 2006, and started being produced
commercially by three different vendors in different parts of India. You
can find information about these vendors at <a
href=http://iuac.res.in/~elab/phoenix/vendor.html>http://iuac.res.in/~elab/phoenix/vendor.html</a>
. Since the cost of research and development is funded by the IUAC and the
schematics are made freely available, the vendors are able to provide the
hardware at a low price, based on the cost of raw material and the labour
involved.</p>

<h3>Phoenix Live CD</h3>

<p>
By this time, workshops were being held in different parts of the country,
and the need for a portable suite of the Phoenix software libraries arose.
This resulted in the development of the Phoenix Live CD, which is a
complete customized GNU/Linux operating system (based on the Slax live CD)
which you can boot from the CD without needing to install anything to the
hard disk. It contains, apart from all the software needed to use Phoenix,
a collection of free and open source scientific/educational software tools.
You can download the Phoenix live CD from <a
href=http://iuac.res.in/~elab/livecd_images/index.html>http://iuac.res.in/~elab/livecd_images/index.html</a>
. A new version based on Debian GNU/Linux is also being developed.
</p>

<h3>Recent Developments</h3>

<p>
Laptop computers have become popular, and many of them do not provide the
RS232 interface. So, a new USB version of Phoenix-M was developed in late
2007. It communicates with the computer using a USB to RS232 converter
implemented by firmware running on a dedicated on-board controller. Apart
from this, the <a
href=http://iuac.res.in/~elab/phoenix/PMDK/index.html>Phoenix
Microcontroller Development Kit (PMDK)</a> has also been developed to
provide a low cost, easy to use microcontroller development system, mainly
for engineering students and electronics enthusiasts. Several <a
href=http://iuac.res.in/~elab/phoenix/PMDK/hardware/plugins/index.html>add-on
boards</a> have also been designed for use with PMDK. This modular
structure is useful for application in the projects of engineering
students.
</p>

<h3>Future Direction and Challenges</h3>

<p>
The Phoenix project has matured since its beginning in 2004. We now have a
reliable, cost-effective product which is ready for mass deployment. Its
basic design is well documented and a set of experiments have been
developed. Some academic institutions have already started using Phoenix.
For example, the West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT) has included it
in their refresher course for physics teachers. The Department of
Education, Kerala, has initiated a project to use Phoenix as a tool for
IT-enabled education at the high school level.
</p>

<p>
Many challenges still lie ahead before Phoenix can become a regular part of
the curriculum. First of all, many more experiments need to be designed and
developed in such a form that they can fit into a 2-hour lab slot. With an
objective to involve the academic community in developing new experiments,
the <a href=http://iuac.res.in>Inter University Accelerator Centre</a> has
announced an "Experiment Design Contest", with an attractive prize of
Rs.10,000 for the best experiment. The last day for submission of ideas is
31 August 2008. The details regarding the contest can be found at <a
href=http://iuac.res.in/~elab/phoenix/prize.html>http://iuac.res.in/~elab/phoenix/prize.html</a>
.</p>

<p>
Computer interfacing of scientific experiments is an entirely new concept
to most of the physics teachers and students in India. This hurdle can be
overcome only through a series of Phoenix workshops. For its effect to be
far-reaching, we need to build a community of enthusiasts from different
parts of the country who can help in conducting workshops. Only with a
strong community and user base, can we be assured that Phoenix will succeed
in realizing its potential to revolutionize science education in India.</p>
