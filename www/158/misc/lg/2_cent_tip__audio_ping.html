If you occasionally can't ping a host on your network, and suspect that
a wonky connection is to blame, troubleshooting can be a pain: watching
the output of "ping hostname" while crawling around in the dust under a
desk is, to put it mildly, a challenge. Enter the "-a" option to 'ping',
added by one of the people on the "iputils" team, Patrik Schilt: when
there's no connection, "ping -a hostname" simply sits and waits, but as
soon as one appears, it starts emitting audio beeps. That's a wonderful
"wishlist" feature, and should significantly improve the life of any
sysadmin who has ever groveled amongst the dropped corn chips and the
roach poop.

The late Mike Muus (the "inventor" of the ping program) has an amusing
story on his webpage (<a href='http://ftp.arl.mil/~mike/ping.html'>http://ftp.arl.mil/~mike/ping.html</a>)
</p>

<p>
"The best ping story I've ever heard was told to me at a USENIX
conference, where a network administrator with an intermittent Ethernet
had linked the ping program to his vocoder program, in essence writing:
</p>

<pre>
    ping goodhost | sed -e 's/.*/ping/' | vocoder
</pre>

<p>
He wired the vocoder's output into his office stereo and turned up the
volume as loud as he could stand. The computer sat there shouting "Ping,
ping, ping..." once a second, and he wandered through the building
wiggling Ethernet connectors until the sound stopped. And that's how he
found the intermittent failure. "

To be fair, the project page has other, rather better, voices you can
download - but they're a pain to test. You actually have to know at
least a little bit of Lisp to make it all go. I managed, but it's way
too complex of a thing for a new user.

Grab the asterisk-sounds-extra tarball (in your favorite format)

I was thinking of using it in the case where you need to *actually find*
the cause of the non-response to a ping. I guess the days of a signal
generator and a "headset"[1] to find faulty connections are a thing of
the past(?)

[1] A telephone earpiece in a plastic headset with two prongs on wires
which you connect/hold across the signal path.

<p>
Long, <strong>long</strong> past. I've been using a "fox-and-hound" (a signal generator
and an amplifier with an inductive pickup) to find wire breaks for, oh,
20 years at least - I learned about them when I was an alarm technician.
A headset won't let you find a break behind a cinder-block wall (true
story; first time I ever had to use a jackhammer to repair an alarm
system.)

<p>
That's the exact probe and toner that I was using back then, and they
haven't changed at all. This is one of those bits of technology that I
think has reached an acme; certain things just can't be improved any
further without a major breakthrough in the underlying science.

<p>
[blink] "siggen" is a signal generator. A very useful thing (I've
downloaded it and saved it, and <strong>will</strong> be playing with it in the future
- thanks!), but it's not going to generate a human voice saying "ping".

&gt; &gt; &gt; and maybe it has "the machine that goes PING!", I've been informed it
&gt; &gt; &gt; has at least "Your mother is a hamster and your father smells of
&gt; &gt; &gt; elderberries."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sadly, it does not have either one. :\
&gt; 
&gt; Try tt-monty-knights.wav

<p>
Shows how much attention I was paying: I'd missed the '-extra' part. Got
it now, and some of the recordings are pretty funny.

Your best bet is to use some TextToSpeech engine, several have demo

there. Maybe some hax0r presentation from any of the *cons?  HAL never

[laugh] That's English, actually - from "The Hunt for Red October". I
was the fire crew chief on that boat, although by the time that scene
happens, all the crew is off ("rescued".)
</p>

<p>
There's only about 4 seconds of my face showing in that movie - not that
I mind; they certainly paid well and on time. There was supposed to be
more - Sean Connery did an impromptu scene where he grabs me by my
lapels (as we're all running around in a "nuclear reactor is leaking"
panic) and says, in a fine Scottish accent, "Calm down, man!" They
didn't use that one, though. There was a lot of good stuff they didn't
use, and it still came out to something like 4 hours long!
</p>

<p>
I also had my moment in the sun - not shown in the movie, but saved
somewhere in the vaults at Paramount with the rest of that footage. We
were filming the scene where the boat is entering Red Route One, a
complicated underwater massif in which we can get away from the pursuing
aircraft which is dropping torpedoes and trying to kill us. Mostly, the
scene consists of the captain delaying the turn as we're heading for a
rock wall so the torpedo can lock on that wall rather than us, then
making a sharp turn (i.e., the whole set tilts, and we all have to hold
on.) After a good dozen tries where something always went wrong,
everyone finally had everything ironed out and we're all ready for the
damn thing to be done.
</p>

<p>
So - yet AGAIN - the sonar officer says "Torrrrpedo in the waterrrr!",
the navigator says "she's out of the box[1], captain!", there's a
tension-filled silence, the captain says "Full right rudder!" (or
something like that), and...
</p>

<p>
At this point, we get hit by a minor earthquake (we're in L.A.; nothing
really unusual in that). Shakes the set and ruins the shot... and before
anyone can react, the fire crew chief looks over at Captain Marko Ramius
and says:
</p>

<p>
"I think we've been hit, Cap'n."
</p>

<p>
Connery laughed like hell. He knew the shot was trashed, so he didn't
have to stay in character.
</p>


<p>
[1] Sub navigation officers have to plot a three-dimensional course;
that course, plus allowable errors, forms a plotted "box" - a
square-sided tube that extends from one position fix to another.
Basically, he was saying "you've gone past my margin of error, so I
don't know if you're going to hit something!"
