<h1>The Back Page</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/tanaka-okopnik.html">Kat Tanaka Okopnik</a></b></p>

<p>
Once upon a time, when the Internet was young, most everything that
happened was all about text. We interacted with words on a screen. No one
really knew whether those words and thoughts came from the proverbial dog,
axe-murderer, 13-year old girl, or the occasional net-savvy granny. Some
of us are old enough to remember the shock and thrill of pictures attached
to e-mail for the first time, or the giddyness of the nascent World Wide
Web - "Hey, guess what company showed up on the Web?"
</p>

<p>
Sometimes it's hard to believe that we all lived without technology we take
for granted in the present. It's an unusual company that has no
Web-presence now. I find it amazing how ubiquitous and indispensable
cellphones have become. I used to wonder why anyone needed text-messaging
on their phone plan, and now I use it constantly, between querying Google
for directory information and sending pictures of our kids off to Grandma,
on the other side of the continent.
</p>

<p>
Linux Gazette has always been an evolving concept, from the very first
issues written by John Fisk, to all the changes written up by Rick Moen in
<a
href="../issue96/moen.html">http://linuxgazette.net/issue96/moen.html</a>.
It's been available as a PalmDoc for quite a while now, as well as an RSS
feed.
</p> 

<p>
Recently, we've been talking about changing directions for LG; in today's
world, those who don't change, and change fast enough, get left behind -
and at Internet speeds, too. We held some discussions where some pretty
radical ideas were floated, including some wild technical proposals. What
made more sense, though, were the social approaches - going through our
various contact lists to find more of the willing volunteers that have
always made LG work, whether by finding entirely new faces or welcoming
back veterans. Now that we're getting that ball rolling, it's clear that
we've rejoined the front lines of net.culture, by jumping into the whirl of
social networking.
</p>

<p>
Given all that, it's hardly surprising - although much appreciated - that
one of the people who rejoined LG recently, <a
href="../authors/silva.html">Anderson Silva</a>, started a Facebook group
for Linux Gazette, with Ben's blessing. We're still working out all the
initial details, but it's very likely to lead to as-yet unexpected and
unenvisioned connections. Come join us at
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=110960368283&amp;ref=nf">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=110960368283&amp;ref=nf</a>!
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, special thanks are due to Suramya Tomar, who brought <a
href="../authors/trbovich.html">Pete Trbovich's</a> "Doomed to Obscurity"
trenchantly funny cartoons to our attention, and Steve Brown, who's been
doing amazing work getting current and former LG staff and authors
re-energized. Joey Prestia has been inspiring his talented friends to
contribute, and we're slowly getting more and more volunteers pitching in
to edit at publication time, as well.
</p>

<p>
As always, LG needs more people - so if you can spare some time to help the
community, we'd love to have you! You can start by taking a look at our <a
href="../jobs.html">jobs page</a>; if you notice something clever that can
be done that we've forgotten to ask for, do let us know.
</p>

<p>
Maybe you don't have time to give to LG yourself, but you might know
someone else who would make a great addition to LG. Or maybe someone you
know knows someone else who...? Spread the word!

<p>
Kat likes to tell people she's one of the youngest people to have learned
to program using punchcards on a mainframe (back in '83); but the truth is
that since then, despite many hours in front of various computer screens,
she's a computer user rather than a computer programmer.
</p>
<p>
Her transition away from other OSes started with the design of a
massively multilingual wedding invitation.
<p>
When away from the keyboard, her hands have been found wielding of knitting
needles, various pens, henna, red-hot welding tools, upholsterer's shears,
and a pneumatic scaler. More often these days, she's occupied with managing
her <a href="okopnik1.html">latest project</a>.
