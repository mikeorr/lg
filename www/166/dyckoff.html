<h1>Away Mission: VMware World, Digital ID World and Intel Developer Forum</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>


<h3>VMware World</h3>

<p>
VMware World is up first this year, and it actually starts on August 31.
The venue is San Francisco again after a brief hiatus to San Diego. Two
years back, this was a very solid conference, and I expect more of the same
this year. To some extent, they have to do well, considering the increasing
competition in virtualization space.
</p>

<p>
The opening keynote is on September 1, so this is technically a September
conference.
</p>

<p>
The conference "Party!" is on Wednesday evening, September 2, and takes
place at both Moscone Center and Yerba Buena Gardens, outside. Options will
include riding a mechanical bull, rock climbing, and laser tagging your
colleagues. They say there will be a food court, with food from around the
world, but I think this will be potstickers and pasta. But there's got to
be beer.
</p>

<p>
The party headline act is Foreigner, performing classic hits like "Cold
As Ice", "Feels Like The First Time", and "Double Vision" .
</p>

<p>
TAM Day is a one-day event on August 31, designed exclusively for VMware
Technical Account Manager (TAM) customers, which showcases new VMware
virtualization technologies plus road-map sessions. TAM Day also includes a
Birds of a Feather luncheon, where you can sit with subject matter experts
in small groups. The event is free for any current TAM customer who attends
VMworld; if you don't qualify, you can still pay for one of many tutorials.
</p>

<p>
At VMworld 2007 in SF, the ESX hypervisor was the big news.  VMware
Infrastructure was also a hot topic, and was covered in several technical
sessions. Its next rev - vSphere - should be a hot topic this year. 
</p>

<p>
The 2007 VMware World featured classes, labs, panels, and tutorials, plus
interesting keynotes.  Inside the conference backpack, which was
substantial, was a USB drive loaded with VMware ESX 3, their high-end
hypervisor, which was not free at the time. Couple that with great meals
and snacks, and you have something to look forward to.
</p>

<p>
Most of the content from VMworld finds its way to VMworld.com.  You have to
register there first, but it's free. Here's a link with agenda information
from VMworld 2007: <a
href="http://www.vmworld.com/community/conferences/2007/agenda/">http://www.vmworld.com/community/conferences/2007/agenda/</a>.
And here's a link to highlights from recent VMworld conferences in the US
and in Europe, which includes "Virtualized Oracle Server Performance": <a
href="http://www.vmworld.com/community/sessions/">http://www.vmworld.com/community/sessions/</a>.
</p>


<h2>Digital ID World</h2>

<p>
On a counter swing, Digital ID World moves from SF to Las Vegas this
year. It will be held at the Rio, September 14-16.  The long-running
forum on identity in the digital world is sponsored by <em>Digital
ID</em> magazine.  This is the place to discuss federated identity,
OpenID vs CardSpace, identity governance frameworks, WS-Trust, and SAML.
</p>

<p>
In 2008, speakers included Doc Searls, Senior Editor, Linux Journal;
Kim Cameron, Architect of Identity, Microsoft Corporation (who is very
friendly to open source); and Jamie Lewis, CEO and Research Chair, Burton
Group.
</p>

<p>
Besides good speakers and great discussions on identity issues, this
conference has historically had great desserts!
</p>

<h3>IDF 09</h3>

<p>
All of IDF 08 fit nicely into the new Moscone West building, which is
across the street from the main North and South halls.  Just go up and
down the escalators to get to sessions on the second and third floor. 
Actually, most sessions were on two long corridors on Moscone Convention
Center's second floor.
</p>

<p>
The tech tracks are well managed and keep closely to the set time.
That's important with 50-minute session times. Audience Q/A is also very
limited, due to the short session format. Sit near the microphone if you
have questions, and be first or second up to the mic.
</p>

<p>
I think there were fewer concurrent sessions in 2008 than there were in
2007.  Several labs were run only once or twice (in a single day), rather
than repeatedly over the week as in earlier years. That did lead to a lot
of standing-room-only sessions. Anticipating the most popular sessions
and arriving early is a helpful art. On the other hand, several of those
were supposed to be be posted on-line.
</p>

<p>
The food is a carnivore's delight and certainly a bit light on plant
food. Your veggie friends may go a bit hungry at lunch. However, Intel and
other co-sponsors did provide a variety of veggie items at the evening
Expo receptions.
</p>

<p>
Here's where to find a long list of technical tracks for IDF 09:
<a href="http://www.intel.com/idf/technology-tracks/">http://www.intel.com/idf/technology-tracks/</a>
</p>

<p>
These include, among other topics, Mobile Tech, Moblin, Intel
Virtualization, Extending Battery Life, Eco-tech, 32 nanometer
microarchitecture, Super Speed USB, Public Clouds, Next Gen PCI, etc. 
</p>


<p>
IDF will continue with Intel's focus on mobility in computing.  Last
year, Intel gave its Moblin project over to the Linux Foundation, but
Intel engineers continue to be the bedrock of Moblin.
