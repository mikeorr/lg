Hi list!
Which distro has best performance on an AMD 2800++ ?I would like to
have the sound system working. Currently i have got FC5 and the sound
system doesnt seem to work though the card is detected!
</p>

<p>
Thoughts/ suggestions are required!

&gt;
&gt; Any of them will do -- changing distributions to alleviate a potential
&gt; problem which as your soundcard not working is not an excuse to think
&gt; there's some sort of priority for distributions -- it's likely your
&gt; problem will only persist.
&gt;
&gt; So the question then becomes what is it about your soundcard which isn't
&gt; working -- and more to the point how is it being detected?  You said
&gt; you're using FC5 -- are they still using Kudzu as their hardware
&gt; detection mechanism?  What steps have you undertaken to realise it is
&gt; detected?  What kernel version are you using?  If it's a 2.6.X kernel,
&gt; I'm assuming ALSA, in which case what does the following command
&gt; produce?
&gt;
&gt; ``
&gt; cat /proc/asound/cards
</pre>


<p>
i get this
<pre>
0 [VT82xx         ]: HDA-Intel - HDA VIA VT82xx
                      HDA VIA VT82xx at 0xfbffc000 irq 19
</pre>

<pre>
&gt; If this is a stock kernel (hint:  "uname -r" is useful here), what does:
&gt;
&gt; ``
&gt; grep -i sound /boot/config-$(uname -r)
&gt; ''
&gt;
&gt; produce as output?
</pre>

<pre>
# Sound
CONFIG_SOUND=m
# Advanced Linux Sound Architecture
# Open Sound System
# CONFIG_SOUND_PRIME is not set
</pre>

<pre>
&gt; These are all basic questions you should have asked yourself -- and
&gt; jumping ship just at the first sign of trouble is not the answer.

I'm running Ubuntu Dapper on a box with an AMD 2400 and VIA chipset,
with no problems at all.
</p>

<p>
I did have to  ake sure that the onboard sound was enabled in the Bios though.

Then this just becomes a question of loading your sound modules, I
suppose.  If you run "lsmod", what do you see?  You ought to see things
like:
</p>

<pre>
[n6tadam@workstation ~]% lsmod | egrep '(sound|snd)'
snd_via82xx            28248  1 
gameport               14408  1 snd_via82xx
snd_ac97_codec         94880  1 snd_via82xx
snd_ac97_bus            2240  1 snd_ac97_codec
snd_pcm                84104  2 snd_via82xx,snd_ac97_codec
snd_timer              22404  1 snd_pcm
snd_page_alloc         10120  2 snd_via82xx,snd_pcm
snd_mpu401_uart         7680  1 snd_via82xx
snd_rawmidi            24672  1 snd_mpu401_uart
snd_seq_device          8268  1 snd_rawmidi
snd                    51684  9 snd_via82xx,snd_ac97_codec,snd_pcm,snd_timer,snd_mpu401_uart,snd_rawmidi,snd_seq_device
soundcore               9440  1 snd
</pre>
Hence in your case, you can most likely try doing (as root):
</p>

<pre>
modprobe sndcore &amp;&amp; modprobe snd &amp;&amp; modprove snd_via82xx
</pre>
Then you can run "alsamixer", unmute your sound devices, and try playing
some sound files, or whatever.

&gt;    hi!

<p>
Amit, you of all people, given your history with LG, should know better
than to post html e-mail to TAG. 
</p>

<p>
As it is, *JUST YESTERDAY* I sent you an off-list note to stop sending
html mail.  Evidently you didn't see fit to take any action on it.
</p>

<p>
STOP SENDING HTML MAIL.
</p>

<p>
It is <strong>very</strong> easy to do this in gmail - just pick the "plain text"
option when you are composing a message. It's right there in the middle
of the line of option buttons, above the box where you enter message
text. Gmail will then be able to send plain text (not html) e-mail, and
will also do proper quoting style.
</p>

<p>
YOU HAVE NO EXCUSE FOR SENDING HTML MAIL.
</p>

Rick, can you run faster than I can ride my 1986 Honda Rebel 250? And
maybe you haven't read my bio recently.

O Tempura! O Morels! (Why yes, I am a bit hungry. Why d'you ask?) Have
the 'blink' and the 'bold' tags lost their vigor in Vim? Or is the
thought of a bold blinking marquee too much of a punishment for any
crime?
</p>

<p>
Tune in next time for the amazing conclusion of "As the Belly Churns",
when one of the participants says "hey, what about that 'flying letters'
effect done with Javascript?", and everyone retches from the effects of
excessive and unnecessary HTML.
