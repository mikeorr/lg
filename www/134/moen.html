<h1>OSI, GAP, and "Exhibit B" licences</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/moen.html">Rick Moen</A></b></p>

<p>
Years ago, at the very beginning of the dot-com era, I attended a series
of workshops, hosted by OpenSales, Inc., on open-source licensing issues.  
Discussions were wide-ranging, but covered all of the major
software-licensing issues that have hit Linux and open source over the
past decade:  licence combinatorics, the threat of software patents, 
trademark encumbrances, court challenges on various copyright grounds, 
the implications of future Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) measures 
in the hands of Hollywood and the recorded music cartels, and the
much-discussed "ASP loophole".  
</p>

<p>
The last of these was a new way firms can (from one point of view)
subvert the intent of "copyleft" licences -- those that require people
distributing modified versions and offshoots ("derivative works") to 
make their source code available:  Application Service Providers (ASPs) 
run their applications behind closed doors, i.e., never
<em>distribute</em> them, instead letting remote customers reach those 
applications remotely across the Internet.  In that usage model, the ASP
can fully exploit other people's copylefted code without needing to make
their changes available to others.  (Essentially, copylefted code's 
authors assumed that anyone would have to distribute their derivative
works, to make use of the borrowed code, but this turns out not to be
true.)
</p>

<p>
Years passed, and for a long time the ASP model had only very limited
success.  The "network computer", which has no independent local
computing power of its own and just images remotely running apps, came
and went, victim of performance and network-bandwidth problems and the
relative low price of conventional PCs.  (Sun Microsystems is still
trying to sell the idea, as the SunRay product line.)  Hosted Web
applications were always said to be just around the corner, but never
got anywhere until recently, with the rise of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29">AJAX</a> Web
apps, a Javascript-based form of dynamic HTML that has made possible a
large number of hosted "Web 2.0" services, and (mostly) aspiring young
companies backing them.
</p>

<p>
You'll note that almost all of those -- Google Maps, GMail, Yahoo Mail, 
Google Calendar, YouTube, and so on -- all keep their program code
entirely proprietary, although it's highly likely that they're building
it on other people's open source (and probably, in many cases, copyleft)
code.  
</p>

<p> A number of Web 2.0 firms, however, don't wish to cut loose from
their open source roots, and (commendably) wish to have their offerings
qualify as open source, but at the same time want to give themselves a
business advantage over any commercial competitors reusing their
published source code on competing sites.  A couple of years ago, they
found their chosen tool:  An "Exhibit B"-clause modification to the
Mozilla Public License v. 1.1 (penned originally by the SugarCRM
company, then copied by an increasing number of others) -- dubbed by
critic Bruce Perens a "badgeware" clause and by its proponents an
"attribution" provision, requires any reuse or derivative work to sport
the original sponsoring company's advertising logo on every single user
interface screen.  That was a couple of years ago.  
</p>

<p>
One problem:  SugarCRM and its imitators have been going around in
public claiming to be open source, and in most cases strongly implying
(or in some cases directly claiming) to be using a licence approved as
open source by the Open Source Initiative (OSI), even though their
licences fail a couple of the criteria that make a licence open source.
Morever, they've been carefully avoiding submitting their modified-MPL
licence to OSI's licence-approval process.
</p>

Aware of the potential for disastrous PR (from claiming to be open
source when a firm really isn't), Web 2.0 company Socialtext employee
Mitch Radcliffe wrote a somewhat more modest "Exhibit B" clause called the 
<a href="http://www.socialtext.net/stoss/index.cgi?attribution_memo">
Generic Attribution Provision</a> ("GAP"), and 
submitted it as a memo to the Open Source Initiative on
November 13, 2006, asking that the OSI Board approve it as an addendum
to "any [OSI-approved] 'modifiable' licence" as being compliant with the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php">Open Source
Definition</a>.  In doing so, Socialtext represents the interests of its
own Web 2.0 hosted application under its own <a
href="http://www.socialtext.net/stoss/index.cgi/spl100.pdf">badgeware
licence</a>, and also by extension those of several
other Web 2.0 businesses, all with "Exhibit B" licences:
<a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/open-source/public-license-faq.html">SugarCRM</a>, 
<a href="http://www.zimbra.com/license/zimbra_public_license_1.2.html">Zimbra</a>, 
<a href="http://dev.alfresco.com/legal/licensing/apl/">Alfresco</a>, 
<a href="http://www.openqrm.org/licensing-3.html">Qlusters / OpenQRM</a>, and
<a href="http://www.jitterbit.com/Product/license.php">Jitterbit</a>. 
</p>

<p>
So have (leaving aside newcomer Intalio) about a baker's dozen of other 
"Web 2.0" businesses seemingly not associated with the GAP initiative:
<a href="http://www.scalix.com/community/licensing/Scalix_Public_License_1.1.txt">Scalix</a>,
<a href="http://terracotta.org/confluence/display/orgsite/Licensing">Terracotta</a>,
<a href="http://www.catsone.com/cpl/CPL.txt">Cognizo Technologies / CATS</a>, 
<a href="http://www.mulesource.com/download/">MuleSource</a>,
<a href="http://dimdim.com/license/Dimdim-MPL.txt">Communiva / Dimdim</a>,
<a href="http://www.openemm.org/openemm.html">Agnitas / OpenEMM</a>,
<a href="http://www.openbravo.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=72&Itemid=265">Openbravo</a>,
<a href="http://www.emusoftware.com/content/view/161/220/">Emu Software / NetDirector</a>,
<a href="http://www.tendersystem.com/modules/articles/article.php?id=2">ValueCard / TenderSystem</a>,
<a href="http://www.opencountry.com/products/ocmwebminplus_home.html">Open Country / OCM Webmin Plus</a>,
<a href="http://www.1bizcom.com/license.html">1BizCom</a>,
<a href="http://www.knowledgetree.com/KPL/FAQ">KnowledgeTree</a>, and
<a href="http://www.jbilling.com/?q=node/7&pl=pr">Sapienter Billing Software / Jbilling</a>.  The last of these, eyebrow-raisingly, is currently using 
the OSI Certified licence-certification program logo alongside its
modified-MPL licence, a fact I've 
<a href="http://www.nabble.com/Jbilling%3A--Possible-unauthorised-use-of-OSI-Certified-service-mark-tf2897549.html">brought
to the OSI Board's attention</a>, on strong suspicion that corrective
action is needed.  [Late addendum:  Just before press time, after 
receiving a complaint, Sapienter removed its unauthorised use of OSI's 
logo, but not its distortive claim to be using MPL 1.1, and to be open
source.]
</p>

<p> 
All of those firms are aware of having a potential perception problem, 
and have had private talks with OSI but have notably not submitted their
licences for certification -- creating a situation where other firms
have started to copy their arrangements <em>without</em> apparently
being aware of the controversy.
</p>

<p>
That brings us to the present, with newcomer Intalio's press release 
(quoted by <em>Linux Gazette</em> author Howard Dyckoff in this issue's
News Bytes column, claiming to be "open source" because they're in the
middle of converting their Web 2.0 hosted Web application to MPL + GAP
licensing. I began researching this article, which began as a footnote
to Howard's news item, because the press release didn't seem right, and 
the further I looked, the more problems I saw.
</p>

<p>
By the way, I mean no disrespect towards Web 2.0 companies generally.  In fact, 
Andrew C. Oliver of Buni.org has, to the great credit of himself and his
firm, 
<a href="http://blog.buni.org/blog/acoliver/opensource/2006/12/12/The-Buni-Special-Attribution-License-Proposal">spoken
eloquently against</a> Socialtext et alii's GAP initiative, as <em>clearly
contrary</em> to core notions of open source. (Oliver predicts that OSI
will approve GAP or some similar mandatory-advertising proposal.  I
sincerely hope he is mistaken.)  

(As an aside, ZDnet columnist David Berlind has also <a
href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=3430">written eloquently</a> about 
the ethical questions surrounding "Exhibit B" firms, and the need to
curb or at least resolve their misleading claims that their offerings are 
open source, when they are very much not.)

<p>
Socialtext's GAP clause is as follows:

<blockquote>
<strong>
<p>
Redistributions of the original code in binary form or source code form,
must ensure that each time the resulting executable program, a display
of the same size as found in the original code released by the original
licensor (e.g., splash screen or banner text) of the original licensor's
attribution information, which includes:
</p>

<p>
(a) Company Name<br>
(b) Logo (if any) and<br>
(c) URL
</p>
</strong>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yr. humble servant and others on the OSI's license-discuss mailing list
found a couple of obstacles, one large and one small, with that proposal:
</p>

<p>
OSD #10 ("License Must Be Technology-Neutral") is the larger obstacle:
"No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology
or style of interface."  GAP appears from its wording to permit creation
only of derivative works having user interfaces, i.e., it prohibits
reuse of covered code for daemons. Some online comments from some of the
affected firms (though not necessarily Socialtext) indicate that this 
<em>is</em> the purport of that clause, and is a deliberate effect.
</p>

<p>
The lesser obstacle is that the <a
href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/certification_mark.php">OSI Certified
approval process</a> vets <em>licences</em> as OSD-compliant -- and
Socialtext didn't actually submit one:  As worded, Radcliffe's memo
seems to say "Please examine all 58 OSI-approved licences to see which
of them permit textual modifications, and then consider us to have asked
approval for each of those that do, each one with our clause appended."
</p>

<p>
That procedural gaffe is not necessarily fatal to the merits of
Socialtext's proposal per se, but does make it severely out of order as
a licence proposal.
</p>


<p>
I should hasten to add that, as serious as GAP's problems are, all
of the firms' in-use other badgeware clauses -- all but one listed on
the same page as GAP -- have worse ones:  Zimbra, Qlusters, SugarCRM,
Socialtext itself, Alfresco, 
Jitterbit, Scalix, Terracotta, Coznito Technologies, MuleSource, Communiva,
Agnitas, Openbravo, Emu Software, ValueCard, Open Country, 1BizCom,
KnowledgeTree, and Sapienter Billing Software all
require their company logos to appear on "each user interface screen" of
derivative works, not just on some "splash screen or banner text".
Further, each of those licences dictates an exact location and size
where that logo much appear on "each user interface screen". Some of
those requirements, rather comically for a would-be open source licence,
make it physically impossible to comply if you have combined two
codebases under the same licence: e.g., SugarCRM, Terracotta, MuleSource,
1BizCom, Sapienter Billing Software, and Socialtext specify
"the very bottom center of each user interface screen", which obviously
cannot be true of two logos at once.  Moreover, through code reuse, 
derivative works risk starting to look like Nicholas Goodman's 
<a href="http://www.nicholasgoodman.com/bt/blog/2006/11/15/open-source-has-a-little-secret-exhibit-b/">nightmare
vision</a> of "Exhibit B" logo requirements run amok.
</p>

<p>
In no way do I speak for Open Source Initiative, but I'd be extremely
surprised if any of those licences as presently constituted, or the
Generic Attribution Provision (as patched onto some subset of 58 extant
licences) were ever approved by the OSI Board. Meanwhile, all 20 of the
firms cited continue to claim in public to publish open source software 
despite having never submitted their licences to OSI for certification 
and the doubtfulness of their claim on its face.
</p>

<p> 
(SugarCRM CEO John Roberts ignored my question of why, if his firm's
licence is open source, the <a
href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/open-source/public-license-faq.html">
SPL FAQ</a> claims its unlawful to sell works derived from it. Matt
Asay, VP of Business Development for Alfresco -- and an OSI Board
Member! -- similarly ignored my question of whether Alfresco would
kindly suspend claims of being "open source" until its licence is
evaluated, or at least commit to remove that claim if its application is
declined.)
</p>

<p>
Socialtext even <a href="http://www.socialtext.com/node/88">claimed</a> last
July that its wiki software, "Socialtext Open", was available under MPL
v. 1.1, when in fact that is simply
<a href="http://superb-west.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/socialtext/Socialtext-Open-2.5.0.2.tar.gz">not the case</a>.  [Late addendum:  Socialtext
retroactively corrected that published claim just before press time, 
the second time I mentioned it on the OSI license-discuss mailing list.]
</p>

<p>
There may be a good-faith effort at dealing reasonably with the open
source community somewhere in there, but it's late in coming and there's
been recently not quite as much candour as one might hope.  I would
caution firms like Intalio from assuming they've truly gone open source,
solely on account of Radcliffe's "submission" of GAP to OSI's Board, and
never, ever trust that a licence is genuinely open source just because
some Web 2.0 firm claims it is.

Rick has run freely-redistributable Unixen since 1992, having been roped
in by first 386BSD, then Linux.  Having found that either one 
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/cabal/os-suck.html">sucked less</a>, he blew
away his last non-Unix box (OS/2 Warp) in 1996.  He specialises in clue
acquisition and delivery (documentation &amp; training), system
administration, security, WAN/LAN design and administration, and
support.  He helped plan the LINC Expo (which evolved into the first
LinuxWorld Conference and Expo, in San Jose), Windows Refund Day, and
several other rabble-rousing Linux community events in the San Francisco
Bay Area.  He's written and edited for IDG/LinuxWorld, SSC, and the
USENIX Association; and spoken at LinuxWorld Conference and Expo and
numerous user groups.

<P> His first computer was his dad's slide rule, followed by visitor access
to a card-walloping IBM mainframe at Stanford (1969).  A glutton for
punishment, he then moved on (during high school, 1970s) to early HP
timeshared systems, People's Computer Company's PDP8s, and various
of those they'll-never-fly-Orville microcomputers at the storied
Homebrew Computer Club -- then more Big Blue computing horrors at
college alleviated by bits of primeval BSD during UC Berkeley summer
sessions, and so on.  He's thus better qualified than most, to know just
how much better off we are now.

<P> When not playing Silicon Valley dot-com roulette, he enjoys
long-distance bicycling, helping run science fiction conventions, and
concentrating on becoming an uncarved block.
