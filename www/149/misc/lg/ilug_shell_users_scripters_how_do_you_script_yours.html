I have a procedure for dealing with when my users put spaces in their filenames.

<p>
find / -name '* *' -exec ls -l {} \;

<p>
Taking the third column in the output, you get the username, which you
can then pipe to ps -u -o pid | xargs -i kill -9 {}
</p>

<p>
This gives you the list of users with spaces. Some manipulation with
Awk, or Perl, can turn this into a list of usernames prefixed with
userdel -r, which can then be piped to /bin/sh.
</p>

<p>
After you've finished deleting your accounts, you can then hire a
hitman to ensure that they never receive accounts on any of your
systems again.

I'd say that he fell short of the holy title of BOfH - specifically on
the 'O' qualifier - as well as instantly qualifying for the Darwin
Award.
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
ben@Tyr:~$ find /usr/share -name '* *' -exec stat -c %U {} \;
root
root
root
root
root

root
root
root
</pre>

<p>
The above means that he just killed himself. Perhaps he meant to say
"find /home/ -name '* *' -exec ls -l {} \;" instead of
"find / -name '* *' -exec ls -l {} \;" ... but Unix isn't very forgiving
of anyone who runs untested scripts on a live system - especially when
they use the "--send-the-assassins" option of "userdel". [sigh] Sad but true.

You don't need any of that; see below.

# "sort -u" will produce a unique list
find / -name '* *' -exec stat -c %U {} \; | sort -u | xargs userdel -r

...a.k.a. "autoDarwination".

Poor Rory. Such a fine man - so generous with his advice... only made
the one tiny, innocent mistake in his life... [sob] Break out the
whiskey, lads, and we'll remember him properly. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
