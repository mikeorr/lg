<h2>1. How do I become an author for LG?</h2>

<p>
 New authors are always welcome; the <em>Linux Gazette</em> is dependent on
<em><strong>R</strong>eaders <strong>L</strong>ike
<strong>Y</strong>ou</em> for its articles. Although we cannot offer
financial compensation (the LG is purely a volunteer effort), you will earn
the gratitude of Linuxers all over the world, and possibly an enhanced
reputation for yourself and your company as well. The Linux Gazette is a
refereed journal (ISSN: 1934-371X, listed in the <a
href="http://www.ulrichsweb.com/">Ulrichs</a> database), and articles
published here can be used for academic credit (please notify the <a
href="mailto:editor@linuxgazette.net">editor</a> if you need the acceptance
reply to have some specific format.)
</p>

<p>
 If you haven't written for LG before, the first thing you need to do is
<a href="mailto:editor@linuxgazette.net">submit a short bio</a> (for
examples, see our <a href="../authors/">authors list</a>) and a 200x200
picture of yourself. This bio will be reused for all future articles until
you submit an updated one.
</p>

<p>
 Read the rest of this FAQ for topic suggestions and formatting
requirements, and <a href="mailto:editor@linuxgazette.net">submit your
completed article</a> after formatting it accordingly
(<strong>Exception:</strong> "2-cent Tips", i.e., short bits of technical
advice, should be sent to <a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net">The
Answer Gang</a>). If you're unsure about the suitability of the topic to
LG, <a href="mailto:editor@linuxgazette.net">send us an abstract</a> of
your proposed article, and we'll happily give you feedback. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="content questionbox">

<a NAME="policy"></a>
<h2>2. Acceptance policy</h2>

<p>
After you submit your article, you should get a response fairly quickly -
usually within a couple of days to a week. The style of the current editor
is "acceptance with a smile, or rejection with a list of suggestions"; that
is, if your article is rejected, you'll get an explanation for the reason
and a list of suggestions for improvement (if applicable.) Your article
will usually be published in the upcoming issue, but may be delayed due to
publication requirements.
</p>

<h3>Article topics</h3>

<p>
 The main question to ask yourself is "Does the article provide new,
interesting, Linux-relevant information?" An article may overlap a previous
article in content, but is it a 100% overlap or is there any new
information or a different perspective?  We do ask that authors use the LG
search engine to look for previous articles about the same topic and link
to them if appropriate.  This makes it easier for readers to find all the
useful information LG has on a certain topic.
</p>

<p>
 The following types of articles are always welcome:
<ul>
	<li> Technical articles of a HOWTO nature; how to set up a program,
how to maintain it, "my experience running a program even if I'm not an expert",
etc. An article discussing how you arrived at a solution by trial and
error, and what problems you encountered along the way, will be of interest
to many readers. These real-life experiences are the unique and exciting
content that we like to publish in the Linux Gazette, because that's
exactly what's missing from most standard documentation.
	<li> Articles discussing the use of Linux in your company or industry,
especially in an environment where commercial software was traditionally
used.
	<li> General Open Source issues - philosophical, political, etc. (no rants!)
	<li> Software reviews, as long as it is a balanced review and
not simply an advertisement. Comparing the pros and cons of a program with
similar programs is a plus.
	<li> Conference Reports.
	<li> Lighthearted and funny stories related to computers, etc.
	<li> New, creative, Linux-relevant topics - including those not
mentioned above - may fit the bill, or may create a category of their own.
As we move forward in parallel with the development of Linux itself, our
ideas on presentation and content change as well - and your article may
well be the agent of that change. Go wild... you never know till you try!
		<li> For even more ideas regarding possible articles, look in the
Mailbag for recurring questions.
</ul>

<h3>Keeping your content readable</h3>
<p>
To quote Joseph Kimble, "Plain English is the style of Abraham Lincoln, and
Mark Twain, and Justice Holmes, and George Orwell, and Winston Churchill,
and E.B. White. Plain words are eternally fresh and fit. More than that,
they are capable of great power and dignity [...]". Here at LG, clear
communication with the Linux community is the goal - and clear, concise,
plain language is the means.
</p>

<p>
LG is an English-language publication - but it is also read by people from
almost every country in the world. In order to make our content as
accessible as possible, we ask that you avoid jargon, colloquial
expressions, and complicated grammatic constructs in your writing. LG is
also translated into a number of other languages, and an article that is
difficult to read is likely to be ignored by a translator whose job is
difficult enough in the first place.
</p>

<p>
Here are some resources if you need specific guidance: 

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.blm.gov/nhp/NPR/tutorial/regwr_02.html">The US
Government's "Rules for Regulation Writers"</a> - a short guide to <a
href="http://encycl.opentopia.com/term/Plain_English">Plain English</a> writing
<li> <a href="http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/style.html"><em>The Elements of
Style</em></a> by Professor William Strunk, Jr. - "the little book" is possibly
the most influential style guide ever written (American English)
<li> George Orwell's excellent 1946 essay, <a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Politics_and_the_English_Language/0.html">"Politics and the English Language"</a>, includes a list of 6 basic rules of writing clear, understandable English
<li><a href="http://www.plainlanguage.gov">http://www.plainlanguage.gov</a> - Links to more Plain English resources from the US Federal Aviation Administration
</ul>
</p>


<h3>General Considerations</h3>

<p>
 Submissions should be written in simple HTML (see the <a
href="#html_crash_course">LG author's crash course in HTML</a> and the <a
href="#html_style_guide">LG author's style guide</a>), or even plain text;
most other formats, including HTML created in FrontPage, MSWord, or
OpenOffice, will be rejected unless they are easily convertable to the two
acceptable formats.
</p>

<p>
There is no specific word limit on article length. Most articles are
5-20 screenfulls of text; occasionally, if the article is very long, we'll
ask you to split it into two or more articles in a series.
</p>

<p>
We have all levels of readers, from neophytes to gurus. In order to
appeal to both, the "howto"-type articles should be centered around an
interesting topic or task - even a complex one is fine - but should also
contain clear, explicit instructions sufficient to replicate your
results. If you see an article that is too technical or not detailed enough
for your taste, feel free to submit another article that fills the gaps.
</p>


<h3>Copyright Issues</h3>
<p>
We're happy to accept articles previously published elsewhere, as long
as the original copyright does not prevent that article from being
re-released under the Open Publication License (OPL), LG's default
publication license. Our official copyright statement (in short, the OPL
without the optional clauses) is at <a
href="../copying.html">http://linuxgazette.net/copying.html</a>.
</p>

<p>
While we're on the subject of copyright: if you use a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use">substantial</a> part of
someone else's work - a long quote from it, etc. - be sure to <em>attribute the
source</em>.  When in doubt about whether to credit someone's work that you
quoted or paraphrased "just a little", wrote "in the spirit of", "used
ideas from", etc., <em><strong>do it</strong></em> (feel free to run
any borderline cases by <a href="mailto:editor@linuxgazette.net">the
Editor</a> - or just cite'em anyway.) In a very small number of cases,
we've had to delete an article after publication and replace it with an
"excessive uncited copying" note because in our view it crossed the line;
humiliating to an author and unpleasant for us. You don't want this
happening to your piece. We don't, either.
</p>

</div>

<div class="content questionbox">

<a NAME="deadline"></a>
<h2>3. Deadlines</h2>

<p>
The article submission deadline is ten days before the end of the month,
modified by the US holidays that occur during the publication period. For
reference, here are the actual dates:
</p>

<table summary="deadlines" width="40%" border="1">
<tr><td>January</td><td>21st</td></tr>
<tr><td>February</td><td>18th (19th on leap years)</td></tr>
<tr><td>March</td><td>21st</td></tr>
<tr><td>April</td><td>20th</td></tr>
<tr><td>May</td><td>20th</td></tr>
<tr><td>June</td><td>20th</td></tr>
<tr><td>July</td><td>21st</td></tr>
<tr><td>August</td><td>21st</td></tr>
<tr><td>September</td><td>21st</td></tr>
<tr><td>October</td><td>21st</td></tr>
<tr><td>November</td><td>19th</td></tr>
<tr><td>December</td><td>19th</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
 Since we're not a paper magazine, we don't have a certain amount of
space to fill. If you miss a deadline, don't fret; just send your article
in anyway and it will go into the following issue.
</p>

</div>


<div class="content questionbox">
<a NAME="html_style_guide"></a>
<h2>4. Style Guide</h2>

<p>
Create the file using any plaintext editor.  Put a blank line between
paragraphs and wrap each paragraph in <code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code> tags.
Name the article <strong>author.html</strong> (where "author" is your
last name in lowercase).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Delete</strong> (or don't create in the first place) the standard
HTML headers
(<em>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;</em>) or footers
(<em>&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</em>) - they would just create problems in your
article's layout. Instead, the first two lines of the file should be
</p>

<pre>
author: author's_tag
title: Article Title
</pre>

<p>(You can also add an optional 'summary: ' line. This is used to show a
short description of your article on our main page.)
</p>

<p>
The author's "tag" is used by our scripts to identify/credit an author and
usually consists of your last name in lower case; if we already have a
"niratpattanasai" (or a "smith"), we'll tweak it by adding your first
initial, etc. In any case, we'll let you know what it is after you send in
your bio.
<p>

<p>
Note that there's no markup used around these header lines: they are simply
text, just as you see above. They will be used to generate the article and
page title, as well as a link to your bio.
</p>

<p>
Keep the in-article formatting as simple as possible. The Linux Gazette is
read on a wide variety of browsers and hardware, and we try to accomodate
as many readers as possible.
</p>

<p>
Please bear in mind that our content is distributed as part of several
CDROM/DVD collections, and that many people read it off-line; as a result,
any off-site links become useless, and pointing to, e.g., sample code on
your web site damages the article's readability and usefulness.  There is,
however, a limiting factor from the other perspective as well: many of our
readers pay for their connections by the kilobyte, and large article
attachments, particularly those that are not of broad interest, represent
an unfair load on them. Therefore, the LG policy is an attempt at a
compromise between the two: if the total of your referenced content does
not exceed 1MB, please include it as part of your article submission;
otherwise, please post it somewhere accessible and provide a link.
</p>

<p>
All supplementary article content (e.g., program listings, images,
reference material) is stored under that issue's 'misc/' directory, in a
subdirectory "tagged" for that author. E.g., an image link in an article by
N. Machiavelli would look like this:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;img src="misc/machiavelli/Il_Principe.jpg" alt="The Prince" width="100" height="200"&gt;
</pre>

<p>
If any of your images are &gt;&nbsp;600 pixels in width, shrink them.
Use PNGs or JPGs ( GIFs are <a
href="http://www.burnallgifs.org/">questionable</a>, and thus best
avoided), and make the file size <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_keep_image_file_sizes_as_small_as_possible">as
small as possible</a>.
</p>

<p>
Short program listings or scripts can be included right in the article
itself; however, if the program is longer than 20 lines or so, save it as a
text file and link it as above.
</p>

</div>

<div class="content questionbox">
<a NAME="html_crash_course"></a>
<h2>5. LG's "minimal HTML" guide</h2>

<strong>Good:</strong>
<ul>
<li> Enclose paragraphs in <code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code> tags.
<li> Wrap <code>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;</code> around the section headings.
<li> When including images, be sure to use the <code>alt=</code>, <code>width=</code> and
		<code>height=</code> attributes in the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, i.e.
<pre>
&lt;img src="misc/author/file1.jpg" alt="TCP/IP four-layer diagram" width="140" height="80"&gt;
</pre>

<li> Place <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> around program output,
command lines, etc.; to highlight program listings, use &lt;pre class="code"&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;.
<li> Use standard markup tags (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>,
		<code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>,
		<code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>,
		<code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code>, etc.) at will.
</ul>

<strong>Questionable:</strong>
<ul>
<li> Local style declarations (e.g., <code>&lt;p style="width: 200"&gt;</code>);
these may conflict with the LG stylesheet.
<li> Tables. Reserve tables for tabular data; avoid using them for layout
unless it's absolutely necessary. Often, <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code> and 
<code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> are actually what you need.
<li> Fonts and colors.
<li> JavaScript.
</ul>

<strong>Don't use:</strong>
<ul> 
<li> External stylesheets.
<li> Underlining (&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;) makes the text look
	like a link. Replace with &lt;em&gt;, and all will be fine
	with the world.
<li> Decorations and doodads on section headers. Sometimes these
	are tolerated for variety; other times, they go "poof".
<li> <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> and <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> tags
	to achieve precise indentation or vertical space. Much of
	that stuff will be lost anyway when people use a browser
	that is different from yours; use &lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; instead.
<li> Platform-specific fonts. Unless you're <strong>sure</strong> that
99% of the computers in the world have it, don't bother: it'll just fall
back to Fixed, Helvetica, or Times New Roman anyway.
</ul> 

</div>

<div class="content questionbox">
<a NAME="after_submission"></a>
<h2>6. After Submission</h2>
<p>
So, you've submitted your article. At the time that you wrote it, it was
the most wonderful bit of prose ever released into the wild, flights of
fact and fancy unparallelled in history - but now that the end of the
month (and actual publication) approaches, you can see... umm, certain
<em>improvements</em> that could be made. Not that there's anything wrong
with the original, of course, but - a bit of clarification never hurts,
right? So, you set out to revise your brilliant treatise and resubmit it...
</p>

<p>
If this is what you were about to do, <span style="font-weight: bold;
color: red">STOP!</span> What you'd be doing is creating a <em>fork</em>: a
second, divergent version of the material. You see, at this point, the
article has probably been proof-read, possibly heavily corrected with
regard to the HTML, maybe even had some of the material moved around a bit
- and all of this work would have to be re-done if you were to resubmit
your original version with corrections. As a result, your "new" submission
may well be rejected.
</p>

<h4>So, what, is correction after submission not possible?</h4>
<p>
It is - in fact, it's very easy if you follow procedure. That is, simply
contact the <a href="mailto:editor@linuxgazette.net">Editor</a> and say that you
want to add/change/correct something. If it's a minor change, just submit
a diff (i.e., show what you want changed) and we'll apply it. If the
changes are more comprehensive than that, and it's not too close to the
publication date ("too close" being a constantly-changing variable; you'll
just have to ask and find out), we'll 'freeze' your article and send you
the working copy, which you can then correct and send back to us. And don't
forget, lest you get into a stew about getting it all done by the deadline:
there's <em>always</em> next month.
</p>

<h4>A good idea whose time has come</h4>
<p>
<em>(thanks to Barry O'Donovan for setting a good example)</em><br />
If you've written an article that mostly concerns or describes a specific
piece of software, you may find it of benefit to notify the author of that
software. Not only is it a pleasant and courteous thing to do, but they may
have a salient comment - and you will have the security of having had your
article vetted by <strong>the</strong> number-one expert. We will usually
be happy to post the resulting exchange in the Mailbag section (assuming
that you've asked your correspondent for permission to do so and had it
granted.)
</p>
</div>

<div class="content questionbox">
<a NAME="after_publication"></a>
<h2>7. After Publication</h2>
<h4>What happens if I spot a mistake in my article sometime after publication?</h4>

<p>
Click on the "Talkback" link for that article, and email us your
corrections, citing as much detail and context as possible (i.e.,
location of the error within the article, additional relevant
information, etc.) We will do our best to bring it to our readers'
attention by publishing it with the rest of that month's Mailbag.
</p>

<h4>But can't you correct it at your site?</h4>

<p>
Yes - but generally, there wouldn't be any point to doing so. Our mirror
sites (<a
href="../mirrors.html">http://linuxgazette.net/mirrors.html</a>)
pull down our <em>new</em> content (and only our new content) once a month,
when we publish an issue. This means that the old content - including your
article with the error in it - is now part of web history, essentially
unchangeable. Note that this is not an effect of LG policy but simply an
artifact of life on the Net: whatever you say publicly is usually archived
- <em>somewhere</em> - forever. The best policy is to accept that as a fact
of life and act accordingly.
</p>

<p>
There is one exception to the above - but it is mostly a goodwill
gesture that we are only occasionally willing to make. If your error is
going to result in ongoing repercussions - e.g., you have unwittingly
insulted the Grand Poobah of Ungah-Bungah, and now every Ungah-Bunghese
man, woman, child, and spectral tarsier wants to eat your toes for
breakfast - we may change the content at our site just to "show
willing", as the expression goes. If this is the case, feel free to
write to our notoriously-cynical <a
href="editor@linuxgazette.net">Editor-in-Chief</a> - although a letter of
apology to the Grand Poobah would probably be a more efficient use of your
time.
