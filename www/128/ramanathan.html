<h1>Subversion: Installation, Configuration &mdash; Tips and Tricks</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/ramanathan.html">Muthaiah Ramanathan</A></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This article is about installing and configuring Subversion v. 1.3.x;
the installation was performed under Fedora Core 4, but should not be very
different under other distributions. This article will not touch upon the
usual subjects &mdash; i.e., where to download Subversion and what
distro-specific commands should be used to install and configure this open
source version control system.</p>

<p>To the novice/beginner, Subversion is a version control tool
from the free/open-source world, designed to replace (and
completely take over) the old horse, CVS. We will not be delving
in-depth into how and why Subversion works the way it is working
currently, and that is not the objective of this article.</p>

<h3>Multiple Subversion(s)</h3>

<p>Using system commands, check whether you already have
Subversion installed. If so, verify the version before proceeding
to install the latest. It is quite possible to have multiple
versions installed in the same system.</p>

<p>Multiple Subversions &mdash; v. 1.2.3 and v. 1.3.0 &mdash; are
installed in this system, for example:

<pre class="code">
[ram@lemuria ~]$ whereis svnversion
svnversion: /usr/bin/svnversion /usr/local/bin/svnversion /usr/share/man/man1/svnversion.1.gz
[ram@lemuria ~]$ /usr/bin/svnversion --version
svnversion, version 1.2.3 (r15833)
   compiled Aug 26 2005, 03:42:45

[ram@lemuria ~]$ /usr/local/bin/svnversion --version
svnversion, version 1.3.0 (r17949)
   compiled May 20 2006, 23:55:41

</pre>


<h3>Pre-Installation Checks</h3>

<p>Subversion repository storage can be based on any one of the
following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>FSFS-based repository storage</li>
  <li>Berkeley DB-based storage</li>
</ul>

<p>At the time of creating the repository, the user has the choice of
using either one of the storage types to hold the repository. By
default, the storage type is FSFS enabled. <a name="1_back"></a><a href="#1">[1]</a></p>

<p>With Subversion, access to the repository also has multiple
choices, which can be any one among the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>local file-system access,</li>
  <li>HTTP-based access, and,</li>
  <li>secure shell-based access.</li>
</ol>

<p>How does one know for which mode of "repository access"
Subversion has been configured/installed? To see the answer,
run the following command:</p>

<p><code>svn --version</code></p>

<p>On my system, the output from the above command looks like this:

<pre class="code">
[ram@localhost ~]$ svn --version
svn, version 1.3.1 (r19032)
   compiled Apr  4 2006, 06:38:16

Copyright (C) 2000-2006 CollabNet.

The following repository access (RA) modules are available:

* ra_dav : Module for accessing a repository via WebDAV (DeltaV) protocol.
  - handles 'http' scheme
  - handles 'https' scheme
* ra_svn : Module for accessing a repository using the svn network protocol.
  - handles 'svn' scheme
* ra_local : Module for accessing a repository on local disk.
  - handles 'file' scheme
</pre>


<h3>Q&amp;A: Before Installing Subversion</h3>

<p>Take time and try to find the answers to the following questions
before proceeding to install and configure Subversion.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Type of repository access required: file-system, SSH,
  HTTP.</li>

  <li>Restrictions on repositories: open-to-all, restrictive
  access with special groups for each repository, etc.</li>

  <li>Version of Subversion to be used, along with version of
  one's "httpd" server.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whatever your answers, always create one special/common
Subversion group ("svnusers") to which users can be assigned; to
these users, Subversion repositories can be opened-up for access.
(For example, with the common group, the repository could be a
play area/scratch pad sort of setup, where "everyone" can
practise Subversion and familiarise themselves with the
tool.)</p>

<p>The next task is to create a special user ("apache") for
running the "httpd" server. This user can be added to that
special/common group created for the needs of Subversion.</p>

<p>On my system, the results look like this:</p>

<pre>
[ram@localhost ~]$ grep apache /etc/passwd
apache:x:48:48:Apache:/var/www:/sbin/nologin
[ram@localhost ~]$ grep svn /etc/group
svnusers:x:501:ram,apache,root
</pre>

<p>NOTE: The "apache" user is part of the "svnusers" group, but
can be configured in such a way as to have two special groups for
Subversion &mdash; one group for those that access the repositories
via "http" and another for access via "file-system".</p>

<p>One final word on Web server "httpd". Always install the
"httpd" server first, before Subversion. Subversion
is built on APR (Apache Portable Runtime) libraries, which provide
all the interfaces that Subversion requires for its basic
functionalities on different OSes, like disk access, network
access, memory management, etc.</p>

<h3>Subversion with Apache</h3>

<h4>Pre-Installation Tips</h4>

<p>It is always good to install Subversion from its sources. <a name="2_back"></a><a href="#2">[2]</a>
In such a case, the "configure" script from the Subversion source
should be run like this (assuming that the "httpd" server is
already installed):</p>

<p><code>./configure --with-apr=/full/path/to/apr-config
--with-apr-util=/full/path/to/apr-util-config</code></p>

<h4>Post-installation Tips</h4>

<p>After installing Subversion, I proceeded to play around with it using
"http" access, but things did not happen as I expected: A quick look at the
Web server logs revealed that "http" requests were failing. Thanks to
people on the 'svnforum' mailing list, the problem was quickly revealed: it
concerned the APR libraries used in Subversion source compilation.</p>

<p>Using the "ldd" command, I verified the APR libraries used in
'mod_dav_svn.so' and 'httpd', but they did not match &mdash; meaning that
"httpd" and mod_dav_svn were not referring to the same APR libraries they
should be.</p>

<pre class="code">
[ram@lemuria ~]$ ldd /lnx_data/apache2.0.54/modules/mod_dav_svn.so | grep apr
        libaprutil-1.so.0 =&gt; /lnx_data/apache2.0.54/lib/libaprutil-1.so.0 (0xb7def000)
        libapr-1.so.0 =&gt; /lnx_data/apache2.0.54/lib/libapr-1.so.0 (0xb7d59000)
[ram@lemuria ~]$ ldd /lnx_data/apache2.0.54/bin/httpd | grep apr
        libaprutil-1.so.0 =&gt; /lnx_data/apache2.0.54/lib/libaprutil-1.so.0 (0xb7f8f000)
        libapr-1.so.0 =&gt; /lnx_data/apache2.0.54/lib/libapr-1.so.0 (0xb7f6d000)
</pre>

<p>"mod_dav_svn.so" should be linked to the same APR libraries as
used by "httpd", and fixing that took care of the problem.</p>

<h4>Repository Access using HTTP</h4>

<p>Following successful installation of Apache and Subversion, next,
repository access via http:// schema must be configured in
"<code>&lt;/path/to/apache/conf&gt;/httpd.conf</code>". Some of the
parameters that can be configured are related to hosting the repository;
other parameters are related to the special/common user and group for
Apache and Subversion:

<pre class="code">
# If you wish httpd to run as a different user or group, you must run
# httpd as root initially and it will switch.
#
# User/Group: The name (or #number) of the user/group to run httpd as.
# It is usually good practice to create a dedicated user and group for
# running httpd, as with most system services.
#
User apache
Group apache_svn
</pre>

<p>After creating the repository and configuration, it's time to
bring-up the Web server and start accessing the repository
via http:// schema. As you can see below, the
"<code>httpd</code>" server is started and running as that
special/common user, "<code>apache</code>":

<pre class="code">
[ram@lemuria ~]$ ps auxw | grep apache
root      2984  0.7  0.6   7616  2848 ?   Ss   19:46   0:00 /lnx_data/apache2.0.54/bin/httpd -k start
apache    2985  0.0  0.4   7616  1900 ?   S    19:46   0:00 /lnx_data/apache2.0.54/bin/httpd -k start
apache    2986  0.0  0.4   7616  1900 ?   S    19:46   0:00 /lnx_data/apache2.0.54/bin/httpd -k start
apache    2987  0.0  0.4   7616  1900 ?   S    19:46   0:00 /lnx_data/apache2.0.54/bin/httpd -k start
apache    2988  0.0  0.4   7616  1900 ?   S    19:46   0:00 /lnx_data/apache2.0.54/bin/httpd -k start
apache    2989  0.0  0.4   7616  1900 ?   S    19:46   0:00 /lnx_data/apache2.0.54/bin/httpd -k start
</pre>

<h3>Configuring svnserve</h3>

<p>As stated in the Subversion manual, the <code>svnserve</code>
program is a lightweight server capable of communicating to
clients over TCP/IP using a custom, stateful protocol. Clients
can use svnserve services using either svn:// or svn+ssh://
access schema. However, before that, svnserve must be configured.
Here, again, there are multiple options: svnserve can be
configured to run by "<code>inetd</code>" or as a standalone
daemon process.</p>

<h4>Authentication Options</h4>

<p>In the following examples I have configured two separate
"<code>svnserve</code>" daemons, again on the same system, both
serving different repositories and listening to different ports.
For one of the repositories, authentication options are turned on
using Subversion's built-in authentication and authorization
mechanisms.</p>

<p>The result of configuring multiple repositories under
"<code>svnserve</code>" <a href= "misc/ramanathan/svnserve_config.txt">is
shown here</a>.</p>

<p>Subversion's built-in authentication configured using
"<code>/path/to/repository/conf/svnserve.conf</code>" is shown
<a href="misc/ramanathan/svnserve_auth.txt">here</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>svnserve.conf</code> shown in the previous example has
many entries and one among them is <code>password-db =
passwd</code>. This <code>passwd</code> file can be located in
the same directory as "<code>svnserve.conf</code>" and sample
entries of this file are shown <a href=
"misc/ramanathan/svnserve_passwd_config.txt">here</a>.</p>

<p>If "<code>passwd-db = passwd</code>" is turned on but there
are no real entries in the "<code>passwd</code>" file, you'll see
errors like this one:

<pre>
[ram@lemuria svntest_project]$ svn commit -m "added the first test C file"
svn: Commit failed (details follow):
svn: /lnx_data/report_holder/svntest_project/conf/svnserve.conf:18: Section header expected
</pre>


<p>As can be seen <a
href="misc/ramanathan/svnserve_commit_success.txt">here</a>, commit
operations will run successfully once the appropriate entries are defined
in <code>svnserve.conf</code> and <code>passwd</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: The <code>passwd</code> file referred to above is not the
same as the system file, <code>/etc/passwd</code>. The system
file cannot be used in svnserve's configuration.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>In this brief article, I have tried to highlight basic
parameters and options usable for configuring Subversion
with or without Apache. It's also a good idea to go through Subversion
documentation to clarify your doubts on this tool's usage. Many
a time, it is worthwhile to consult people (e.g., the Subversion
users mailing list) and seek guidance towards resolving
Subversion problems.</p>

<p><a name="1"></a><a href="#1_back">[1]</a> Rick Moen comments: Since all <em>Linux Gazette</em>
editorial production is managed via svn (Subversion), we've
tallied up considerable experience with both of these repository
options over the years, and can heartily recommend the stability
advantages of the newer FSFS option, which uses
platform-independent flatfiles rather than database storage: Our
experience with the older BerkeleyDB ("BDB") option was that
improperly terminating svn processes would often wedge the
repository if they died during commits, requiring an irksome
"recovery" operation before work could resume. FSFS repositories
are also less trouble to backup.</p>

<p><a name="2"></a><a href="#2_back">[2]</a> Rick Moen comments: The usual cranky-sysadmin advice
applies: In my view, as a matter of administrative best
practices, compiling source code from an upstream maintainer's
source tarball should be your last resort, if good official
packages from your Linux distribution or trustworthy, quality
unofficial packages constructed for your Linux distribution don't
exist, only then should you use upstream tarballs as a fallback.
Even then, check to see if the the tarball provides build
instructions, e.g., an rpm SPEC file, for your distribution.</p>

<p>Why? Any time you skip the work done by distribution package
maintainers and work directly with upstream source code, you're
implicitly agreeing to either perform all of that work yourself
or suffer the consequences of its absence. Most people have
little conception of how much work that is, or its value. Package
maintainers monitor upstream releases to select which have the
best mix of new features and debugging (newer not necessarily
being better), usually apply patches to adapt them to
distribution-specific needs, and sometimes code and apply
security patches the upstream programmer never even thought of.
Moreover, they do this on an ongoing basis, making improvements
available to a myriad of systems, keeping those systems updated
without their admins needing to worry, let alone duplicate that
work.</p>
