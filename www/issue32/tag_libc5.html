<br>H.J.  
<br>I hate to bother you with a more discussion on this
topic.  However, I'd like to have a definitive posting
for the Linux Gazette (I do the Answer Guy column there)
to allay people's concerns about this migration.

<blockquote>Is there a definitive archive or document on the web that
you feel accurately answers most questions about the 
glibc vs. libc 5 controversy?

>No. I have posted a few articles from time to time. As far as I
know, glibc 2 is very good now. The only problem it has is some
Linux specific programs use the kernel header files directly. It
won't work with glibc 2. We have to change those programs and
we have to add those missing pieces to glibc 2 if necessary. So far,
everything looks good. RedHat and <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> 
have built their entire Linux on glibc 2.

But I don't know if there is a case where you cannot recompile it.

have to do with: support for NIS, thread-safe library 
calls, transparent support for the shadow password suite
in the <tt>getpwent()</tt> and related functions, and much easier
compatibility with other GNU sources (without requiring
as much porting effort on the one side nor as much library
maintenance by you, personally, on the other).  Is that
all true?  Are there other compelling advantages to 
glibc over libc.5?

The harddrive is cheap. I'd like to keep those debug info in library.
In anycase, you can run strip on them. But I won't recommend it unless
you are building a very small Linux installation. As for memory, glibc
2 has more stuff than libc 5. It has to bigger libc 5. I don't call it
libc 6 if it is smaller than libc 5. But Unix has demand paging. Those
unused portions won't be loaded into memory anyway.

But there are so many new optimizations in glibc 2. I would say glibc
2 is faster than libc 5. As for disk space, it depends on if you want
to run strip or it. By default, glibc 2 provides much more debug info
than libc 5. With libc 5, when something goes wrong with the C library,
I have to use a speciial C library just to debug it. With glibc 2, I
just run <tt>gdb</tt> on the binary compiled with <tt>-g</tt>. As for 
memory requirement, I believe it is the similar to libc 5.

>I have been working on <tt>egcs</tt>/<tt>gcc</tt>, <tt>binutils</tt> and

interetsed in projects using
C++, thread and distributed technology, something like CORBA. I have
been thinking a new paradigm for Unix. Instead of a C or C++ library,
we use something on the line of CORBA or DCOM.
</p></strong>
<strong><p>Another thing, every program is compiled with <tt>-fPIC</tt> as a shared
library, i.e.:
</p></strong>
<pre># gcc -shared -o ls.so -fPIC ls.c ......
# gcc -o ls ls.so
</pre>
<strong><p>Now, we have both <tt>ls</tt> and <tt>ls.so</tt>. Another program can do
</p></strong>
<pre>int (*ls_main) (int, char **);
void *handle;

handle = dlopen ("ls.so", ...);
ls_main = dlsym (handle, "main");
ls_main (argc, argv);
</pre>

<strong><p>We can also use it instead of expensive
</p></strong>

<strong><p>i<code>system ("ls");</code></p></strong>

<strong><p>It can go with the CORBA/COM idea. That is we define an object oriented
interface for a service, which can be a local shared library or a
different process which can be local or remote.
