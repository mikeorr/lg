</P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
hi james
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
i came across your website while looking for some help on file
compression/conversion
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
i downloaded an archive in winrar format - which then decrompressed to bin/cue
files
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
i'm not sure what to do with that now - i've converted it to an iso file, but
i need to basically open it up to gain access to the application that was
downloaded.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
i'm a little lost on how to do that - can you help?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
thanks,
mgm.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Hi MGM,
</P>
<P>
Have you tried to mount the iso image and copy the files out? There maybe
another way but this worked for me.
</P>
<P><CODE>
mount -o loop -t is09660 file.iso /mnt
<br>ls /mnt
</CODE></P>
<P>
should then give a list of the files in the iso image.
</P>
<P>
Hope this helps.
</P>

Kind regards
Andrew Higgs

Question From: "Jon Coulter" &lt;jon from alverno.org&gt;
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I've recently upgraded the ram on my linux box in an attempt to wean some of
the memory problems that have been occurring
</STRONG></P>
<P>
What were the previous problems.  Just running out of memory?  Or other
things.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
, and now get "Segmentation
Fault"'s on almost every program about 80% of the time (if I keep trying and
keep trying to run the program, it eventually doesn't Segmentation Fault for
one time... sometimes then segmentation faulting later in its execution). My
question is: Is there anything I can do about this?!? But seriously, is
there any chance that a kernel upgrade would help fix this (my current
kernel is 2.4.2)? I just don't understand why a memory <EM>upgrade</EM> would cause
problems like this. I've run memtest86 test on the ram to ensure that it
wasn't corrupted at all.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Frequent segfaults at random times usually indicate a hardware problem,
as you suspected.  A buggy kernel or libraries can throw segfaults left and
right too, but if you didn't install any software at the time the faults
started occurring, that rules that out.
</P>
<P>
Does <TT>/etc/lilo.conf</TT> have a "MEM=128M" number or something like that in it?
Some BIOSes require this attribute to be included, other's don't.  But if
it's specified, it must be correct.  Especially, it must not be larger
than the amount of RAM you have: otherwise it <EM>will</EM> segfault all over the
place and you'll be lucky to even get a login prompt.  Remember to run
lilo after changing lilo.conf.
</P>
<P>
Try taking out the memory and reseating it.  Also check the disks: are the
cables all tight and the partitions in order?  Since memory gets swapped to
disk if swap is enabled, it's possible for disk problems to masquerade as
memory problems.
</P>
<P>
If you put back your old memory, does the problem go away?  Or if you're
mixing old and new memory, what happens if you remove the old memory?
Are the two types of memory the same speed?  Hopefully the faster memory
will cycle down to the slower memory, but maybe the slower memory isn't
catching up.  What happens if you move each memory block to a different
socket?
</P>
<P>
I'm running 2.4.0.  There are always certain evil kernels that must be
avoided, but I don't remember any such warnings for the 2.4 kernels.
Whenever I upgrade, I ask around about the latest two stable kernels, and
use whichever one people say they've had better experiences with.
</P>
<P>
Good luck.  Random segfaults can be a very irritating thing.

For shell scripts it's a common error to accidentally include a space
after the line-continuation character. This is interpreted as a
literal space with no continuation; probably not what you want. Since
spaces are invisible, it can also be a hard error to spot. If you use
emacs, you can flag such shell script errors using fontification. Add
this code to your ~/.emacs file:
</P>
<pre>
;;; This is a neat trick that makes bad shell script continuation
;;; marks, e.g. \ with trailing spaces, glow bright red:
(if (eq window-system 'x)
  (progn
    (set-face-background 'font-lock-warning-face "red")
    (set-face-foreground 'font-lock-warning-face "white")
    (font-lock-add-keywords 'sh-mode
      '(("\\\\[ \t]+$" . font-lock-warning-face)))
  )

Good tip, Matt! I'll add a bit to that: if you're using "vi", enter
</P>
<Pre>:set nu list</Pre>
<P>
in command mode to number all lines (useful when errors are reported),
show all tabs as "^I", and end-of-lines as "$". Extra spaces become
obvious.
</P>
<P>
In editors such as "mcedit", where selected lines are highlighted,
start at the top of the document, begin the selection, and arrow (or

The two places to look for "the rest of it" if you really want a bleeding
edge kernel are:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><dl>
<dt>For Linus' tree -

<P>
Nope; just 2.4.x stuff.
</P>
<P><STRONG><dl>
<dt>For Alan's tree -
<dd> <A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/alan"
	>http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/alan</A>
</dl></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Alan keeps subdirectories in there which should help you figure things
out.  In the moment I type this, his 2.4.6 patch is at ac5 and his
2.2.20pre is at 7.
</STRONG></P>
<blockquote><em>
As of press time, 2.4.7 patch is at ac3 and 2.2.20pre is at 8. -- Heather
</em></blockquote>
<P><STRONG>
These are of course patches that you apply to the standard source
after you unpack the tarball.
</STRONG></P>
<blockquote>
<em>
For a last tidbit, the web page at <A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/"

and the latest file in the <TT>/testing</TT> area.

<P>
Question From: Danie Robberts  &lt;DanieR from PQAfrica.co.za&gt;
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Is there a way to install this. I can see the Sparc64 architecture under
/usr/src/linux/arch
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Booting from the slackware 8 cd does not work, and it seems as if
<A HREF="http://www.slackware.org/">Slackware</A>'s Web site is "unavailable"
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Please, any pointers!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Cheers
Danie
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Sure.
</P>
<P>
The  <A HREF="http://www.lwn.net/">Linux Weekly News</A>  just wrote that Slackware is no longer supporting
their Sparc distro.  There's a sourceforge project to take over the code:
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/splack"
	>http://sourceforge.net/projects/splack</A>
</P>
<P>
Entirely possible that some decent community interest would boost it nicely,
but if so, why'd Slackware have to let go of it... dunno...
</P>
<P>
Maybe you want to try another distro that builds for Sparc - RH's sparc build
isn't well regarded amongst a few non-Intel types I know locally... I think
in part because they get to Sparcs last.  But you've lots of choices anyway.
The search engines (keywords: sparc distribution) reveal that Mandrake and
<A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> both have Sparc distros, Rock Linux (a distro that builds from sources
- <A HREF="http://www.rocklinux.org"
	>http://www.rocklinux.org</A>) builds successfully on it, and of course there's
my personal favorite, <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>.
</P>
<P>
The Sparc-HOWTO adds <A HREF="http://www.caldera.com/">Caldera</A> OpenLinux and <A HREF="http://www.turbolinux.com/">TurboLinux</A> to the mix.  I know
that Caldera is really pushing to support the enterprise  but that points
to openlinux.org and appears to be an unhappy weblink - I only did a spot
check, but didn't see "Sparc" on Caldera's own pages.  One may safely
presume that someone who wants Caldera's style of enterprise level support
for Linux will be getting Sun maintenance contracts for their high end Sparcs,
right?
</P>
<P>
Anyways the reasons that Debian is my personal favorite in this regard are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>It's the only distro that I've tried on a Sparc
<li>It worked just as smoothly as on a PC
<li><tt>apt-get install</tt> &lt;package name here&gt;
</ol>
<P>
But you don't have to take my word for it 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> There's a bunch of folks at
<A HREF="http://www.ultralinux.org"
	>http://www.ultralinux.org</A>
</P>
<P>
who pay attention to how well things work on ultrasparcs, and they've
helpfully gathered a bunch of pointers into the arcvhives and subscribe
methods for the lists maintained by the major vendors in this regard.  So
check out what people who really use Sparcs have been saying about 'em!
Using your model number as a search key may narrow things down, too.

Question From: Danie Robberts (DanieR from PQAfrica.co.za)
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Hi,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I am trying to set my environment up so that I can use Star Office on my
<A HREF="http://www.slackware.org/">Slackware</A> 8 Laptop, and send mail via our Exchange Servers.
The problem is that the IIS Department has only allowed my Suna Workstation
to Send mail to their List server. I think it is limited by IP @.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Is there a way to configure a type of mail routing agent, so that my sending
adress in S/O will be the IP@ of my Sun Workstation, and the receiving will
be the exchange server (At the moment I can only receive e-mail)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Here is the IP Setup:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong> List Server:	196.10.24.112
 Exchange 	196.10.24.33
 Laptop:		192.168.102.241
 Sun:		192.168.102.44
</strong></pre>

<P><STRONG>
Thanx
<br>
Danie
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Not directly, while your Sun workstation is online.  You'd have to give
your Linux workstation the Sun's IP number.  Two hosts with the same IP
on the same network is a recipe for trouble!
</P>
<P>
If you've full control of your Sun, you could arrange to use
it as your email relay host, for an indirect solution.
</P>
<P>
It looks like StarOffice can be configured to use two different
mail servers, one for outgoing, one for incoming.  Set the outgoing
server to the Sun, and the incoming to the exchange server.
Configure the MTA on the Sun (sendmail, I expect) to relay for
you, and you're all set.
</P>
<P>
To test the Sun,
</P>

<blockquote><pre>telnet sun 25
helo linux.hostname
mail from: &lt;you@your.domain&gt;
rcpt to: &lt;somebody@reasonable.domain&gt;
data
some data
.
quit
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
"linux.hostname" is the hostname of your linux system
"<A HREF="mailto:you@your.domain"
	>you@your.domain</A>" is your return email address
"<A HREF="mailto:somebody@reasonable.domain"
	>somebody@reasonable.domain</A>" is some reasonable recipient
</P>
<P>
If you don't get a refusal, and the email goes through, the
Sun is set up to relay.
</P>

Hello,

First off, I shall begin by saying, please in future send your e-mail in
plain-text format and NOT in HTML. Poor Heather will have a hell of a time
trying to extract the important information from the e-mail 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":-)"

<blockquote><em>
It's easier than quoted printable, but, yeah, it's a pain. -- Heather
</em>
</blockquote>
<P>
So, to your problem. There are a number of things that you can check.
Firstly, when using FTP, do you make use of the hidden files ".netrc", in
each of your users home directory? In that file, you can store the ftp
machine, and the username and password of the user. Typically, it would look
like the following:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>machine ftp.server.sch.uk   login   usernametom  password xxxxxxx
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
The reason why your users can log in via telnet, is that telnet uses
different protocols. I would also suggest using a program such as "ssh",
which is more secure than telnet, but I digress.

The reason I haven't been particularly hyped about this thing is that,
the more time passes, the less I think of it as a good idea. Given that
one of the classes I teach for a living is Unix (Solaris) security, it's
actually my job to believe that it's a bad idea.

Sure, in the Wind*ws world, people blithely exchange "Setup.exe" files;
they also suffer from innumerable viruses, etc.

Think well before you use this tool. Obviously - and if it isn't
obvious, even downloading it might be a bad idea - never-ever-*ever* run
a self-extracting archive, or any executable that is not 100%
trustworthy, as root.

<P><STRONG>
I'm not quite sure if you can help me out with this situation.
Okay here's the lay down
I have 1 IDE Hardrive 35 gigs
About a month ago I added the program System Comander so I could put Windows
98, Windows 2000, and Linux on my system.
I did it successfully!
So now about a week ago I wanted everything off, cause I bought a serperate
PC for Linux.
This is how I wipe everything off of my drive.
I used a Debug to wipe everything off and used fdisk to try to get rid off
all of the partititions... but it still didn't get all of the partitions off
(looking in fdisk). How I got rid of all of them was doing the commands
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>lock c:
fdisk /mbr
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
Than going back to fdisk and deleted the remaining partitions.
This did work... no longer is there any drives stated in fdisk.
So than I created 2 drive c: and d: both about 15 gigs or more
But now this is were I run into my problem....
After rebooting I tried to format those drives a it's giving the error
message CANNOT FORMAT A NETWORK DRIVE????
I know this is a lot more information than you prbably needed, but I thought
I'd better say everything so that you know the whole story...
Can you help me?
Do you know of anything I could try?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Well, since you've removed Linux, your options are pretty thin.
It sounds like your 'fdisk' screwed up somewhere, or you have a
virus (I remember, a looong time ago, of some that did that.) One of
the easiest ways to handle it would be to download <A HREF="http://www.toms.net/rb/">Tom's rootboot</A>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.toms.net/rb/&gt"
	>http://www.toms.net/rb/&gt</A>;, run it, and use the Linux fdisk that comes
with it (you should read the 'fdisk' man page unless you're very
familiar with it.) It can rewrite your partitions and assign the correct
types to them; after that, you should be able to boot to DOS and do
whatever you need.

<P>
Question From: seboulva (seboulva from gmx.de)
</P>
<P><strong>
Sorry about this Simple Question, but I am a Linux Newbie and I want, no  I
must Update our Wu- FTP Server.It Comes with <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> 6.3
</strong></P>
<P><STRONG>
I Downloaded the 3 *.patch Files . And want to Apply it with the Patch
Command.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Do you have the source code for wu-ftp and did you compile it yourself last
time? patch files are usually for source code, and they will change a
specific version to a specific other version. Are you sure that the patch
files math your source code version?
If it's RedHats patch files for their 6.3 distribution that should match.
But most probably it matches only the source code from their 6.3 CD's.
</P>
<P>
If all this matches, you should be able to compile the basic wu-tfp as it
comes with 6.3. Then you can try to patch the source and recompile.
</P>
<P>
Depending on the patch files (especially with which path they are generated)
you would do something like:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>cd wu-ftp-source
patch -p 1 &lt; ./path/to/patchfile
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
the -p x optioon strips off x directory levels from the path in the patch
file. If you look in the  ascii patch-files you will see file names with
path -- they have to match where your source is.
</P>
<P>
'patch --help' says among other very usful thing:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>  --dry-run  Do not actually change any files; just print what would happen.
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
so this is the option for testing until it looks as if it will apply
cleanly. Then remove the dry-run and do it for real.
</P>
<P>
recompile wu-ftp and then install it in the system. You will have to restart
it of course.
</P>

Question From: Adam Wilhite (a.m.wilhite from larc.nasa.gov)
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Somehow the root password was lost or doesn't work anymore for one of
the computers I administer.  I went through your steps to reboot with
init=/bin/sh...  My problem is when I try to mount <TT>/usr</TT>. It says it
can't find <TT>/usr.</TT>  I would really appreciate your help.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
thanks,
<br>adam wilhite
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Hi,
</P>
<P>
Your error message about not being able to find <TT>/usr</TT>, suggests to me that
"<TT>/usr</TT>" is not your mount point. Take a look in the file "<TT>/etc/fstab</TT>", which
is the filesystem table.
</P>
<P>
Locate the entry which points to "<TT>/usr</TT>". Your mount points are usually in
the second field, i.e. after all the "<TT>/dev/hda1</TT>" entries.
</P>
<P>
When you have found it, type in the correct value, using:
</P>
<P><CODE>
mount /path/to/mountpoint
</CODE></P>
<P>
Failing that, try issuing the command:
</P>
<P><CODE>
mount -a
</CODE></P>
<P>
that will tell your computer, to (try and) mount all the entries within the
file "<TT>/etc/fstab</TT>". You can then check what has been mounted, by typing in
the following:
</P>
<P><CODE>
mount
</CODE></P>
<P>
HTH,
</P>

Questions From: Larry Sanders (lsanders from hsa-env.com) and Jim (<em>anonymous</em>)
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Having completed the installation of <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> 7.1 with both
<A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</A> and <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A>, the default graphical login is GNOME.
How is this changed to the KDE default login for the system?
-- Larry
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000066"><EM>
I love and use both the KDE and Gnome desktops. I have a strong
aesthetic preference, though, for the KDE login manager.
</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000066"><EM>
My RedHat 7.1 install has resisted all efforts to switch it from its
default Gnome login manager to the KDE one. This isn't a big deal but
where is this managed and how do I make the change?
-- Best Regards, Jim
</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>
Try running the program "switchdesk".  It might be on the GNOME menu,
but you can run it from a command-line quicker.  It will let you switch
default desktops and even different desktops for different displays
(although that tends to be a bit problematic).

Hello!
</P>
<P>
This week I found some interesting programs that can help (a little bit) to
Philippe CABAL.
</P>
<dl>
<dt>K-3D
<dd><A HREF="http://freshmeat.net/redir/k-3d/4976/url_tgz/k3d-0.1.29.0-src.tar.gz"
	>http://freshmeat.net/redir/k-3d/4976/url_tgz/k3d-0.1.29.0-src.tar.gz</A>
</dl>
<p>It is frontend(Opensource, GPL) to render engines that are available to
linux and win:</p>
<dl>
<dt>BMRT, 
<dt>RDC 
<dd>(<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dotcsw.com/rdc32lnx.tar.gz"
	>ftp://ftp.dotcsw.com/rdc32lnx.tar.gz</A> -&gt;demo)
<dt>and 3Delight 
<dd>(<A HREF="http://www.3delight.com"
	>http://www.3delight.com</A> - I didn't try it)
</dl>
<P>
BTW: K-3D is one of the best applications I have seen on linux. Also no
other application need so much time and memory resources for
compiling like K-3D
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.dotcsw.com"
	>http://www.dotcsw.com</A> have perfect page with links. There is lof of
rendering staff (also many that are just expected)
</P>
<P>
I hope this help.
