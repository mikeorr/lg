<BR>Question by A group of Python users in Seattle (seattle-python from lists.seapig.org)

<P><STRONG>
Dan Sugalski (Parrot) gets a pie in the face by Guido van Rossum (Python).
Dan lost a bet that Python would run faster on Parrot (Perl 6's virtual
machine) than the standard C version.

<P><STRONG>
--
-Mike Orr (aka. Sluggo)
</STRONG></P>
<P>
FYI, The reason Dan lost was because he failed to complete 3 of the 7 tests.
On the 4 he did complete, Parrot beat Python on 3 of them. Of those 3, Dan
said Parrot was 2-3 times faster.

<P>
What is the computer language that makes you say please?  I used to know
this.  I might recognize it if I saw the name.  A fellow LUG member
suggested I look at <A HREF="http://sk.nvg.org/lang"
	>http://sk.nvg.org/lang</A>  but nothing seemed obvious.
</P>
<P>
Someone out there knows, I hope.

Thank you!

In my article "A guide to Windows technologies for Linux users" in issue
104 (<A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/104/oregan2.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/104/oregan2.html</A>) I mentioned gtk-qt, which
allows Gtk apps to use Qt themes. MetaTheme (<A HREF="http://metatheme.advel.cz"
	>http://metatheme.advel.cz</A>)
is a project to create a theme engine which is independant of the
various toolkits. It currently supports Gtk and Qt, and work is under
way to support Firefox.  (<A HREF="http://metatheme.advel.cz"

Ben,

I didn't catch from your earlier email where your anchorage was, did the
~ Charley course change spare your boat?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
-- Brian Bilbrey
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It made it worse, actually - Charlie's eye passed right through St.
Augustine, from what I'm told - but my anchors held (I had a friend put
out a third one; I normally ride to two anchors, but have <EM>eight</EM> on
board.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The winds were supposedly in the 70+ knot range (Category 1 hurricane)
with 6' seas in the Matanzas river, where I'm actually anchored.  The
docks at the nearby city marina took a real pasting, but everything and
everybody seems to be OK.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<EM>WHEW</EM>, big-time. When Charlie got up to 145mph, and shifted course to
pass dead over St. Augustine, I was <EM>not</EM> a happy camper.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
[Breen Mullins] 
Whew! indeed. Glad to hear all's okay -- I've been worried about you.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
[John Karns] 
We're glad to hear that the boat is still in one piece.  Our thoughts are
with those who weren't quite so fortunate.  At least it sounds like it
went a little better than Andrew in 1992.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Yeah. Nineteen dead so far (no final count yet), lots of people hurt, at
least $11B worth of property damage (again, not final figure); 300,000
people still without electricity; it was a rough one.

<p align="center">...............</p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Despite the damage, Florida Lt. Gov. Toni Jennings said that her state
was better prepared for Charley's onslaught than it had been in 1992,
when Hurricane Andrew, a Category 5 storm with winds topping 155 mph,
crushed the southern tip of the state from east to west.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Where we are today is about where we were two weeks after Andrew,"
Jennings said.

<blockquote><font color="#000066">At this point you can hit up Google for all the gory details and then
some; in addition to early storms it's been a heavy season so far too.
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
My boat took some damage... from do-gooders without a clue - none from
the hurricane. Nothing major; I spent last night on a tilt (50 degrees
or so at 4 a.m. - low tide) and had to get her off the shoal this
morning, then spent most of today grappling for my anchors (one line
chafed through, and the idiots^Whelpful folks who moved her managed to
lose a 45-lb. anchor and 300' of chain over the side.) Haven't found
them yet - but hooked onto a big Fisherman-type anchor that somebody
else lost here during the last few years, so that's what I'll be using
temporarily.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
All in all, normal life in the hurricane zone.
