<h2>News in General</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Linux Foundation User Survey Shows Enterprise Gains</h3>

<p>At its recent End User Summit, the Linux Foundation published "Linux 
Adoption Trends: A Survey of Enterprise End Users," which shares new 
data that shows Linux is poised to take significant market share from 
Unix and especially Windows while becoming more mission critical and 
more strategic in the enterprise.</p>

<p>The data in the report reflects the results of an invitation-only 
survey of The Linux Foundation's Enterprise End User Council as well 
as other companies and government organizations. The survey was 
conducted by The Linux Foundation in partnership with Yeoman 
Technology Group during August and September 2010 with responses from 
more than 1900 individuals.  </p>

<p>This report filters data on the world's largest enterprise companies 
and government organizations - identified by 387 respondents at 
organizations with $500 million or more a year in revenues or greater 
than 500 employees.</p>

<p>The data shows that Linux vendors are poised for growth in the years 
to come as large Linux users plan to both deploy more Linux relative 
to other operating systems and to use the OS for more mission critical 
workloads than ever before. Linux is also becoming the preferred 
platform for new or "greenfield" deployments, representing a major 
shift in user patterns as IT managers break away from legacy systems.</p>

<p>Key findings from the Linux adoption report:</p>

<p>* 79.4 percent of companies are adding more Linux relative to 
other operating systems in the next five years.</p>

<p>* More people are reporting that their Linux deployments are 
migrations from Windows than any other platform, including Unix 
migrations. 66 percent of users surveyed say that their Linux 
deployments are brand new ("Greenfield") deployments.</p>

<p>* Among the early adopters who are operating in cloud 
environments, 70.3 percent use Linux as their primary platform, while 
only 18.3 percent use Windows.</p>

<p>* 60.2 percent of respondents say they will use Linux for more 
mission-critical workloads over the next 12 months.</p>

<p>* 86.5 percent of respondents report that Linux is improving and 
58.4 percent say their CIOs see Linux as more strategic to the 
organization as compared to three years ago.</p>

<p>* Drivers for Linux adoption extend beyond cost - technical 
superiority is the primary driver, followed by cost and then security.</p>

<p>The growth in Linux, as demonstrated by this report, is leading 
companies to increasingly seek Linux IT professionals, with 38.3 
percent of respondents citing a lack of Linux talent as one of their 
main concerns related to the platform.</p>

<p>Users participate in Linux development in three primary ways: testing 
and submitting bugs (37.5%), working with vendors (30.7%) and 
participating in The Linux Foundation activities (26.0%).</p>

<p>"The IT professionals we surveyed for the Linux Adoption Trends report 
are among the world's most advanced Linux users working at the largest 
enterprise companies and illustrate what we can expect from the market 
in the months and years ahead," said Amanda McPherson, vice president 
of marketing and developer programs at The Linux Foundation.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Puppy Linux 5.1 released</h3>

<p>The new Puppy Linux 5.1, code-name "Lucid" as it is binary-compatible 
with Ubuntu Lucid Lynx packages, has been released. Lucid Puppy 5.1 is 
a "full-featured compact distro."  </p>

<p>As a Puppy distro, it is fast, friendly, and it can serve as a main

<p>Download Puppy 5.1 from <a href="http://www.puppylinux.com/download/">http://www.puppylinux.com/download/</a>.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Ubuntu Rescue Remix 10.10 Released</h3>

<p>Version 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat) of the data recovery software toolkit 
based on Ubuntu is out.  This is an Ubuntu-based live medium which 
provides the data recovery specialist with a command-line interface to 
current versions of the most powerful open-source data recovery 
software including GNU ddrescue, Photorec, The Sleuth Kit and 
Gnu-fdisk. A more complete list is available here: 
<a href="http://ubuntu-rescue-remix.org/Software">http://ubuntu-rescue-remix.org/Software</a>.</p>

<p>The live Remix provides a full shell environment and can be downloaded 
here: <a href="http://ubuntu-rescue-remix.org/files/URR/iso/ubuntu-rescue-remix-10-10.iso">http://ubuntu-rescue-remix.org/files/URR/iso/ubuntu-rescue-remix-10-10.iso</a>.</p>

<p>This iso image is also compatible with the USB Startup Disk Creator 
that has included with Ubuntu since 9.04. PendriveLinux also provides 
an excellent way for Windows users to put Ubuntu-Rescue-Remix on a 
stick.</p>

<p>The live environment has a very low memory requirement due to not 
having a graphical interface (command-line only). If you prefer to 
work in a graphical environment, a metapackage is available which will 
install the data recovery and forensics toolkit onto your current 
Ubuntu Desktop system.</p>

<p>The toolkit can also be installed on a live USB Ubuntu Desktop with 
persistent data. To do so, add the following archive to your software 
channels: <br />
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/arzajac/ppa/ubuntu lucid main</p>

<p>Then authenticate this software source by running the following 
command:<br />
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys BDFD6D77</p>

<p>Then, install the "ubuntu-rescue-remix-tools" package.</p>

<h1>Away Mission - ApacheCon, QCon, ZendCon and LISA</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<h2>Away Mission - ApacheCon, QCon, ZendCon and LISA</h2>

<p>
This November has a surfeit of superior conferences, most actually running
in the first week.  The conferences listed in the title all start on Nov
1st which might force you to make some hard choices.
</p>

<p>
I'll be putting notes on ApacheCon after ZendCon and QCon, but not out
of a preference; instead, it's simply in order of shortest commentary to
longest.  These are all great events and we could even include the Linux
Kernel Summit, which is also the first week of November, but we haven't
attended one before.
</p>

<h3>LISA</h3>

<p>
Unlike the conferences reviewed below, LISA - the Large Installation System
Administrator conference organized by USENIX - is during the second week of
November and has few conflicts with other events.  This is an event with a
long history, dating back to the '80s and predating the Internet boom.
Indeed, this is the 24th LISA conference. The focus nowadays is on the
backends for companies like Google, Yahoo, and Facebook.
</p>

<p>
I haven't attended a LISA conference since I was a sysadmin, before the
beginning of the millennium, but I fondly remember having an opportunity to
talk with other sysadmins who were working on the bleeding edge of data
center operations.  This is the first LISA actually in the San Francisco
area, even though USENIX is headquartered in Berkeley.  Most West Coast
LISA events have been held in San Diego.
</p>

Presentations at LISA cover a variety of topics, e.g. IPv6 and ZFS, and
training includes Linux Security, Virtualization, and cfEngine among
others.  Topics covered by the invited presenters include:

<h3>ZendCon 2010</h3>

<p>
The 6th Annual Zend/PHP Conference will bring together PHP developers and
IT staff from around the world to discuss PHP best practices. This year it
will be held at the Santa Clara Convention Center which has lots of free
parking and is convenient to Silicon Valley and the San Jose airport.  It
starts on November 1st and - unfortunately - conflicts with QCon in San
Francisco and ApacheCon in Atlanta.
</p>

<p>
This used to be a vest-pocket conference at the Hyatt near the San
Francisco airport and was much more accessible from that city. There was a
charm in its smallness and its tight focus and it brought the PHP faithful
together with the Zend user community.
</p>

<p>
This year, ZendCon will host technical sessions in 9 tracks plus have
in-depth tutorials and an enlarged Exhibit Hall (with IBM, Oracle and
Microsoft as major sponsors). A variety of tracks - SQL, NoSQL,
architecture, lifecycle, and server operations - are available. This is an
opportunity to learn PHP best practices in many areas.
</p>

<p>
There will also be an unconference running the 2nd and 3rd days of
ZendCon, featuring both 50 minute sessions and 20 minute lightning talks.
There is also a CloudCamp unconference on the evening of the tutorial day
where early adopters of Cloud Computing technologies exchange ideas. And
the 3 days of regular conferencing, without tutorials, is only a modest
$1100 before it starts.  Not a bad deal either way.
</p>

<p>
If you want to look for the slides from ZendCon 2009, they can be found <a

recordings being released as a podcast, take a look <a

<h3>QCon 2010</h3>

<p>
QCon is a personal favorite of mine because of its breadth and its
European roots. The mix of advanced Agile discussions with Java and Ruby
programming and new database technology is intoxicating.  Its also a place
to see and hear something not repeated at other US conferences.
</p>

<p>
This year, tracks include Parallel Programming, the Cloud, Architectures
You Never Heard Of, Java,  REST, Agile process, and NoSQL. Check out the
tracks and descriptions <a
href="http://qconsf.com/sf2010/tracks/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Last year, the Agile track (and the tutorials) included several sessions on
Kanban as form of 'Lean' and 'Agile' development methodology.  Kanban is
derived from the signaling used to control railroad traffic and uses
token-passing to optimize queues and flows. The idea is to do the right
amount of work to feed the next step in the process. An example of a Kanban
work flow can be seen in the anime feature "Spirited Away" by Hayao
Miyazaki, where a ghostly bath house regulates the use of hot water by
passing out use tokens. That way the capacity of the system is never
exceeded.

</p>

<h3>ApacheCon 2010</h3>

<p>
I was pleasantly surprised to find this 'Con so close to home since it is
held in Boston half the time. The Oakland Convention Center is an
underutilized gem in the redeveloped Oakland downtown, very close to the
regional Bay Area Rapid Transit station and many fine eateries in Oakland's
burgeoning new cuisine district. And the weather is warmer than in San
Francisco.
</p>

<p>
ApacheCon spanned an entire week in 2009. The training period started the
week with 2 days of half day classes. This was paralleled by 2 days of Bar
Camp - the Unconference that is `included in ApacheCon' - as well as a
Hackathon, which in this case was a kind of code camp for project
submitters.
</p>

<p>
This was the first year that the Bar Camp and Hackathon paralleled
the training days. Since these two programs were 'free' as in beer, it
afforded a chance for many local developers to get involved; it also drew
several folk who had never been to ApacheCon. It was also the 10th
anniversary of the Apache Software Foundation and there was a celebration
during the conference.
</p>

<p>
Sessions were 50 min long and spanned 4 consecutive tracks. The track
content varied over the 3 days of ApacheCon and included many prominent
Apache projects. Some presentations were a bit dry and concerned with the
details and philosophy of ongoing projects. Some were report cards on the
progress of joint efforts with industry and academia.
</p>

<p>
I attended sessions on Tomcat and Geronimo as well as Axis and other
Apache projects. These were very detailed and informative.
</p> 

<p>
The Lightning Talks are short sessions held the last night of the
conference. This ApacheCon variant is up to 5 minutes, on anything you
want. The limited rules state "No Slides and No Bullets" (as there would be
in presentations.) They provide the beer and wine. And they encourage
recitals - its supposed to be fun... And they were.
</p>

<p>
The closing keynote was by Brian Behlendorf, titled "How Open Source
Developers Can (Still!) Save The World". Behlendorf was the primary
developer of the Apache Web server and a founding member of the Apache
Group and is currently a Director of CollabNet, the major sponsor of
Subversion and a company he co-founded with O'Reilly &amp; Associates.
</p>

<p>
He spoke about the important contribution developers can make to
non-profits and noted that he is on the board of Bentech, which provides
the Martus encryption tools to the human rights and social justice sector
to assist in the collection, safeguarding, organization, and dissemination
of information about human rights violations. Martus Server Software
accepts encrypted bulletins, securely backs them up and replicates them to
multiple locations, safeguarding the information from loss. The software
was used in the Bosnia war crimes trials.
</p>

<p>
Among other non-profit development projects, Behlendorf mentioned <a
href="http://plonegov.org">PloneGov.org</a> which produces modules for
Plone to implement common services (like a city meeting template). The aim
is to make government more transparent and more efficient.
</p>

<p>
Behlendorf also mentioned Sahana, a part of Sri Lankan Apache Community
that was started after 2004 Tsunami to help relocated survivors. This
effort has now resulted in a disaster relief management package used in 20
cities. The UN is starting to use it as this was a space neglected by
commercial software corporations.
</p>

<p>
His summary points: we geeks have skills that are worth more than just
dollars and hours to non-profit organizations. So find a project and help
out, even non-code contributions can matter.
</p>

<p>
This year's ApacheCon will be held in Atlanta starting on November 1st.
Sessions will feature tracks on Cassandra/NoSQL, Content Technologies,
(Java) Enterprise Development, Geronimo, Felix/OSGi, Hadoop + Cloud
Computing, Tomcat, Tuscany, Commons, Lucene, Mahout + Search, Business
&amp; Community.  Free events include a 2-day BarCamp and the evening
MeetUps.  For more info, visit <a
href="http://na.apachecon.com/c/acna2010/">http://na.apachecon.com/c/acna2010/</a>.
</p>

<p>
Lunches were boxed on most conference days, but the last day had hot
pizza and pasta with great desserts so it was worth lasting out the
conference. Also, all the vendor swag was piled on a table for the taking
on the last afternoon - so with ApacheCon, patience is a virtue.
</p>

<p>
The wiki for ApacheCon has some links for presentation slides, but not
after the European ApacheCon that preceded the North America ApacheCon in
2009. See <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/apachecon/">here</a>.
</p>


<h3>SalesForce, DreamForce</h3>

<p>
If you are interested in Cloud Computing, consider the user conference for
<a href="http://salesforce.com">SalesForce.com</a>, the annual DreamForce
event in San Francisco. It was a November event in 2009 but will happen on
December 6-9 this year. There are usually a few open source vendors at the
DreamForce expo.

<h1>Enemy Action</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/grebler.html">Henry Grebler</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<pre>
	"Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. Three times is
	enemy action." 
			- Ian Fleming (spoken by Auric Goldfinger)
</pre>

<h3>Once</h3>

<p>
Sometimes I buy tickets on the Internet. About a month ago, I bought
tickets to the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_rules_football">footy</a>.
There are several options, but I choose to get the tickets emailed to
me as a PDF. I have no idea what research the ticketing agencies do,
but they obviously do not include me in the profile of their typical
user.
</p>

<p>
I planned to go with a friend, Jeremy, who supports the opposition
team. Jeremy is in paid employment, whereas I am currently "between
engagements". He intended to ride his bicycle to the stadium; I would
take the train. I agreed to meet Jeremy inside the stadium.
</p>

<p>
But I've still got to get him his ticket.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the tickets come as separate PDF files, but this time they
were both in a single PDF. I struggled mindlessly for some time and
eventually sent Jeremy a 6.5 MB .ppm! Fortunately, it gzipped very
nicely and the email was less than 350 KB. 
</p>


<h3>Twice</h3>

<p>
Recently, I bought more tickets for some future footy game. Again,
they came as a single PDF. This time it was Mark and Matt to whom I
wanted to send tickets.
</p>

<p>
I went to my help directory to see what I had done the previous time.
Nothing. As disciplined as I try to be, I remain disappointingly
human.
</p>

<p>
Never mind. I've had lots of time living with myself. I now know there
are two of me. I've learnt to put up with the hopeless deficiencies of
the Bad Henry. After all, what can you do?
</p>

<p>
So, I worked out (again!) how to split out pages from a PDF. Between
the first and second time, I'd been on a ten-day trip to Adelaide.
Before I leave home on long trips I shut down my computer. And my
brain.
</p>

<p>
My solution this time involved PostScript files. I wrote it up (Good
Henry was in charge). Then, for completeness (Good Henry can be quite
anal), I reconstructed what I probably did the first time and wrote that up
also.
</p>


<h3>Three times</h3>

<p>
Today it happened again. Last night I booked tickets for the theatre.
(You see? There's more to me than just football.) When I looked at
the tickets, I found a single PDF containing 4 tickets: two for me and
my wife, two for Peter and his wife, Barbara.
</p>

<p>
And finally I hit the roof. I'd tried <tt>Adobe Acrobat</tt>,
<tt>xpdf</tt>, and <tt>evince</tt>. They all have the same problem:
they insist on honouring the stupid restrictions included in the PDF,
things like "no copying".
</p>

<pre class="code">
	Encrypted:      yes (print:yes copy:no change:no addNotes:no)
</pre>

<p>
Think about it. How stupid is this? If I have <strong>x.pdf</strong>,
no matter what some cretin includes in the file, nothing can stop me
from going:
</p>

<pre class="code">
	cp x.pdf x2.pdf
</pre>

<p>
So what has been achieved by the restriction? The words of the song
about the benefits of war come to mind: absolutely nothing! And I
<strong>am</strong> tempted to say it again: absolutely nothing.
</p>

<p class="editorial">
[ These days, there are so many ways to remove/bypass/eliminate/ignore that
so-called "protection" - e.g., <a
href="http://ensode.net/pdf-crack.jsf">ensode.net</a>'s online "unlocker" -
that it is indeed meaningless. -- Ben ]
</p>

<p>
So let's say I send Jeremy or Mark or Matt a copy of the entire PDF.
What I'm concerned about is that they may inadvertently print the
wrong ticket. Sure, in the email, I tell each person which ticket is
his. But... since each ticket has a barcode, perhaps the stadium
checks and complains about a second attempt to present the same
ticket. Embarrassment all round.
</p>

<p>
Notice that I'm not trying to do anything illegal or underhanded. I'm
not trying to violate some cretin's digital rights. I'm not trying to
harm anyone. I'm trying to get a ticket to my friend; a ticket that I
bought legitimately; one that I'm not only entitled, but required, to
print out. I guess they want me to fax it to him. But isn't that also
making a copy? Do they expect me to drive across town to get him his
ticket?
</p>

<p>
It seems to me amazing that I'm the only one who wants this
capability. Every time I've looked on my computer (<tt>apropos</tt>)
or anywhere else (Internet), I've never found a convenient mechanism.
I now have a mechanism (see next section), but this is really a plea
for help. Can anyone suggest something a little more elegant than what
I've come up with?
</p>


<h3>2-Cent Tip</h3>

<p>
Here is the best method I could come up with for extracting one page,
or several contiguous pages, from a PDF into a separate PDF:
</p>

<pre class="code">
	gs -dSAFER -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH \
		-dFirstPage=3 -dLastPage=4 \
		-sOutputFile=PeterAndBarbara.pdf Tickets.pdf
</pre>

<p>
Basically this command says to extract pages 3 and 4 from Tickets.pdf
and put them into PeterAndBarbara.pdf. The first line consists mainly
of window dressing.
</p>

<p>
If you want to extract each page as a separate PDF file (not a bad
idea), here's a script:
</p>

<pre class="code">

#! /bin/sh
#       pdfsplit.sh - extract each page of a PDF into a separate file

        myname=`basename $0`

#----------------------------------------------------------------------#
Usage () {
        cat &lt;&lt;EOF
Usage: $myname file

where   file    is the PDF to split

Output goes to /tmp/page_n.pdf
EOF
        exit
}

#----------------------------------------------------------------------#
Die () {
        echo $myname: $*
        exit
}

#----------------------------------------------------------------------#
        [ $# -eq 1 ] || Usage

        pages=`pdfinfo $1 | grep Pages | awk '{print $2}'`
        [ "$pages" = '' ] &amp;&amp; Die "No pages found. Perhaps $1 is not a pdf."
        [ "$pages" -eq 1 ] &amp;&amp; Die "Only 1 page in $1. Nothing to do."

        jj=1
        while [ $jj -le $pages ]
        do
                gs -dSAFER -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH \
                        -dFirstPage=$jj -dLastPage=$jj \
                        -sOutputFile=/tmp/page_$jj.pdf $1
                jj=`expr $jj + 1`
        done


</pre>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>
You can look at <tt>gs(1)</tt> for a limited amount of help. For more
useful help, do this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
	gs -h
</pre>

<p>
and look at the second last line. Mine says:
</p>

<pre class="code">
	For more information, see /usr/share/ghostscript/8.15/doc/Use.htm.
</pre>

<p>
I've probably broken my system, because it is actually in
<strong>/usr/share/doc/ghostscript-8.15/Use.htm</strong>. Another
system refers correctly to
<strong>/usr/local/share/ghostscript/8.64/doc/Use.htm</strong>.
</p>

<p>
You can use your usual browser or you can use:
</p>

<pre class="code">
	lynx /usr/share/doc/ghostscript-8.15/Use.htm
</pre>

<p>
See also <tt>pdfinfo(1)</tt>. Here's an example of its output:

<h1>House, Lies and Sysadmin</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/grebler.html">Henry Grebler</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<p>
In the TV show House, the eponymous protagonist often repeats the idea
that patients lie.
</p>

<p>
	"I don't ask why patients lie, I just assume they all do."
</p>

<p>
If you're in support, you could do worse than transpose that dictum to
your users. Of course, I'm using "lie" very loosely. Often the user
does not set out to deceive; and yet, sometimes, I can't escape the
feeling that they could not have done a better job of deception had
they tried.
</p>

<p>
Take a case that occurred recently. A user wrote to me. I'll call him
Gordon.
</p>

<pre>
	Hi Henry,

	I'm embarrassed to say that I seem to have lost (presumably
	deleted) my record of email for the AQERA association while
	re-organizing email folders earlier this year.

	The folder was called Assoc/AQERA, and I deleted it around May
	18 of this year. Would it be possible to recover the folder
	from a time point shortly before that date?

	Thanks a lot
	Gordon
</pre>

<p>
This was written in early September. That's Gordon's first bit of bad
luck. We keep online indexes for 3 months. Do the math. A couple of
weeks earlier, and I might have got back his emails with little
trouble - and this article would never have been born.
</p>

<pre>
	Hi Gordon,

	The difficult we do today. The impossible takes a little
	longer.

	Your request falls into the second category.


	Cheers,
	Henry
</pre>

<p>
Some customers have unrealistic expectations. Gordon is remarkably
understanding:
</p>

<pre>
	Err, does that mean not possible, or that it will take a
	while?

	I understand it might not be not recoverable, and it's my own
	fault anyway, but I need to know.
</pre>

<p>
Who knows what might have happened under normal circumstances? In this
case, there were some unusual elements. I'd started work at this
organisation May 10. Less than 2 weeks later, our mail server had
crashed. When we rebooted, one of the disk drives showed
inconsistencies which an fsck was not able to resolve (long story). We
had to go back to tapes and recover to a different disk on a different
machine and then serve the mail back to the first machine over NFS.
</p>

<p>
The disk drive which had experienced the inconsistencies was still
attached to the mail server. I would often mount it read-only to check
something or other. In this case, I checked to see if the emails he
wanted were on that drive. They weren't. The folder wasn't there.
</p>

<p>
There were other folders in the Assoc/AQERA family (Assoc/AQERA-2010,
Assoc/AQERA-20009, etc). But no Assoc/AQERA.
</p>

<p>
There was something else that was fishy. I can't remember the exact
date of the mail server crash. Let's say it was May 24. When we
recovered from backup, we would have taken the last full backup from
the first week in May. In other words, we would have restored his
account back to how it was before May 18. Without meaning to, we would
have "undeleted" the deleted folder his email claimed.
</p>

<p>
For many reasons, after the email system was restored, users did not
get access to their historical emails until early June.
</p>

<p>
So something he's telling me is misleading. Either he deleted the
folder before the beginning of May or after the middle of June. Or,
perhaps, it never existed. If I had online indexes going back far
enough, I could answer all questions in a few minutes. Without them,
I'm up for really long tape reads. My job is not about determining
where the truth lies, it's about recovering the emails.
</p>

<p>
I wrote to Gordon, explaining all this and added:
</p>

<pre>
	So, before I embark on a huge waste of time for both of us, I
	suggest we have a little chat about exactly when you think you
	deleted the folder, and exactly what its name is.
</pre>

<p>
I suppose we had the discussion. A day or two later he wrote again:
</p>

<pre>
	Here's another thought, that I hope will save work rather than making 
	more.

	I didn't notice that I was missing any mail until about 1
	September. At that time I went to my mailbox
	Assoc/AQERA-admin, which should have in principle contained
	hundreds of emails, but actually contained only one.

	If there any recent backup in which Assoc/AQERA-admin contains
	more than one or two emails, then those are the emails I'm
	after.
</pre>

<p>
And that was all I needed!
</p>

<p>
Stupidly, I followed the suggestion in his last paragraph - and drew a
blank. But then I went back to the failed disk and searched for
Assoc/AQERA-admin (rather than the elusive Assoc/AQERA).
</p>

<pre>
	I have found a place with the above directory which contains
	843 emails dating back to 2003. I have restored it to your
	mailbox as Assoc/AQERA-admin-May21 (in your notation).

	I hope this helps.
</pre>

<p>
And this is how I know my customers love me:
</p>

<pre>
	Fantastic!!

	That's everything I was after. Recovering this mail will make
	my job as AQERA president much easier over the next year.

	Many thanks
	Gordon

It's why I put up with the "lies" and inadvertent misdirections. I
have an overwhelming need to be appreciated. At heart, I'm still at
school craving any sign of the teacher's approval. It may have made me
a superb student. But what does it say for my self-esteem? Who's the
more together human being? Me? Or my son, whom I tried to shame into
doing better? He didn't care tuppence for his teacher's approval. Or
mine. And yet, here he is, doing third-year Mechatronics Engineering
at uni.

<h1>Installing/Configuring/Caching Django on your Linux server</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/silva.html">Anderson Silva</a> and <a href="../authors/milner.html">Steve 'Ashcrow' Milner</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
In today's world, web development is all about turnaround. Businesses want to
 maximize production outcome while minimizing development and production time. 
Small, lean development teams are increasingly becoming the norm in large 
development departments. Enter <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" id="u1jv" title="Django">Django</a>: 
a popular <a href="http://www.python.org/" title="Python">Python</a> web framework 
that invokes the RWAD (rapid web application development) and DRY (don't repeat 
yourself) principles with clean, pragmatic design.
</p>
<p>
This article is not about teaching you how to program in Python, nor how to use 
the Django framework. It's about showing how to promote your Django applications
 onto an existing Apache or Lighttpd environment.
</p>
<p>
We will conclude with a simple way that you can improve the performance of your 
Django application by using caching to speed up access time. This article also 
assumes that you are running Fedora as your web application server, but all the 
packages mentioned in this article are also available in many OS's including under the 
<a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL">Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux
 repository</a>, which means these instructions should also be valid under 
Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS servers.
</p>
<h3>
What you need
</h3>
<p>
You must have Django installed:
</p>
<pre class="code">$ yum install Django
</pre>
<p>
If you want to serve Django apps under Apache you will need 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/">mod_wsgi</a>:
</p>
<pre class="code">$ yum install httpd mod_wsgi
</pre>

<p>
If you want to serve Django apps under Lighttpd:
</p>
<pre class="code">$ yum install lighttpd lighttpd-fastcgi python-flup
</pre>
<p>
Installing memcached to 'speed up' Django apps:
</p>
<pre class="code">$ yum install memcached python-memcached
</pre>
<h3>
Starting a new Django project
</h3>
<p>
1. Create a development workspace.
</p>
<pre class="code">$ mkdir -p $LOCATION_TO_YOUR_DEV_AREA 
$ cd $LOCATION_TO_YOUR_DEV_AREA
</pre>
<p>
2. Start a new base Django project. This creates the boiler plate project 
structure.
</p>
<pre class="code">$ django-admin startproject my_app
</pre>
<p>
3. Start the Django development web server on port 8080 (or whatever other port 
you'd like).
</p>
<p>
Note: The development web server is just for testing and verification. Do not 
use it as a production application server!
</p>
<pre class="code">$ python manage.py runserver 8080
</pre>
<p>
4. Run your Django project under Apache with mod_wsgi by enabling mod_wsgi.
<i>Note</i> that to do this you will need to have your project in an SELinux
friendly location (don't use home directories!) as well as readable by apache.
On Fedora mod_wsgi is auto added upon install via /etc/httpd/conf.d/wsgi.conf.
Upon restarting of apache, the module will be loaded.
</p>
<p>
5. Create virtual hosts by creating a new file at 
/etc/httpd/conf.d/myapp.conf.
</p>
<pre class="code">WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/myapp/apache/django.wsgi

DocumentRoot /var/www/html/
ServerName your_domain_name
ErrorLog logs/my_app-error.log
CustomLog logs/my_app-access_log common
</pre>
6. In step 5 we defined a script alias and now we need to create the wsgi file
it references.
<pre class="code">import os
import sys

import django.core.handlers.wsgi

# Append our project path to the system library path
sys.path.append('/path/to/')

# Sets the settins module so Django will work properly
os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'myapp.settings'

# sets application (the default wsgi app) to the Django handler
application = django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler()
</pre>

<h3>
Running your Django project under Lighthttpd with fastcgi
</h3>
<p>
The first thing you must do is start up your FastCGI server.
</p>
<pre class="code">./manage.py runfcgi method=prefork socket=/var/www/myapp.sock pidfile=django_myapp.pid</pre>
<p>
Then modify your lighttpd.conf file to use the FastCGI server.
</p>
<pre class="code">server.document-root = "/var/www/django/"
fastcgi.server = (
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "/my_app.fcgi" =&gt; (
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "main" =&gt; (
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # Use host / port instead of socket for TCP fastcgi
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # "host" =&gt; "127.0.0.1",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # "port" =&gt; 3033,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "socket" =&gt; "/var/www/my_app.sock",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "check-local" =&gt; "disable",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; )
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ),
)
alias.url = (
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "/media/" =&gt; "/var/www/django/media/",
)
url.rewrite-once = (
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "^(/media.*)$" =&gt; "$1",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "^/favicon\.ico$" =&gt; "/media/favicon.ico",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "^(/.*)$" =&gt; "/my_app.fcgi$1",
)
</pre>
<h3>
  Setting up caching in Django
</h3>
<p>
  Django has many different caching backends, including database, memory, 
filesystem, and the ever popular memcached. According to 
<a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/">http://www.danga.com/memcached/</a>, 
memcached is "a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, 
generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications 
by alleviating database load." It's used by high traffic sites such as 
<a href="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> and 
<a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/">Wikipedia</a>. This makes it a prime candidate
 for caching in your cool new web app.
</p>
<p>
First, install memcached.
</p><pre class="code">$ yum install memcached
</pre>
<p>
Next, install the python bindings for memcached.
</p><pre class="code">$ yum install python-memcached
</pre>
<p>
  Next, verify that memcached is running using the memcached's init script.
</p>
<pre class="code">$ /etc/init.d/memcached status 
memcached (pid 6771) is running...</pre>
<p>
  If it's not running, you can manually start it.
</p>
<pre class="code">$ /sbin/service memcached start</pre>
<p>
  If you want to make sure it will automatically start every time after a reboot:
</p>
<pre class="code">$ /sbin/chkconfig --level 35 memcached on</pre>
<p>
  Now that you have verified that memcached is running, you will want to tell 
your Django application to use memcached as it's caching backend. You can do 
this by adding a CACHE_BACKEND entry to your settings.py file.
</p>
<pre class="code">CACHE_BACKEND = 'memcached://127.0.0.1:11211/'
</pre>
<p>
  The format is "backend://host:port/" or "backend:///path" depending on the 
backend chosen. Since we are using memcached, we have the option to run multiple
 daemons on different servers and share the cache across multiple machines. If 
you want to do this all you must do is add in the servers:port combinations in 
the CACHE_BACKEND and separate them by semicolons. In this example we share the 
cache across three different memcached servers:
</p>
<pre class="code">CACHE_BACKEND = 'memcached://127.0.0.1:11211;192.168.0.10:11211;192.168.0.11/'
</pre>
<p>
  For more information on the different types of caching that can be performed 
in the Django framework, please refer to their 
<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/cache/">official documentation</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, whenever you are ready to get your applications into production, 
you can always write your own Django 
<a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/InitdScriptForLinux" title="service script">service script</a>, 
so your application can start up at boot time.

<h1>Ten Tips to Harden Your Website</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/temme.html">Sander Temme</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p class="editorial">
Sander will be presenting &#8220;Hardening Enterprise Apache Installations
Against Attacks&#8221; and is Apache HTTP Server Track Chair at <a
href="http://na.apachecon.com/">ApacheCon</a>, the ASF&#8217;s official
conference, training, and expo, taking place 1-5 November 2010 in Atlanta,
Georgia.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
Websites are under continuous attack. Defacement, malware insertion and
data theft are but a few of motivators for the attackers, and anyone who
runs an Internet-facing website should be prepared to defend themselves.
</p>

<p>
Website owners have many tools at their disposal with which to thwart
online attackers; entire books have been written about this
field. Here are ten tips that will quickly improve the security of your
website.
</p>

<h3> 1. Harden your Operating System</h3>

<p>
The default installation of your server operating system likely comes
with a number of features you would not use. Turn off operating system
services that are not used by your web application. Be especially wary of
running anything that exposes a network listener (a network listener is a
system task that listens on a given network port for incoming client
connections). Uninstall software
packages you do not use, or opt not to install them in the first
place: the smaller your software installation, the smaller the attack
surface. Use the extra security features offered by your operating system
like SELinux or BSD securelevel. For instance, default SELinux
configuration on Red Hat Enterprise Linux strikes a good balance where
server programs that listen on the network are locked down tightly (which
makes sense), but regular system maintenance utilities have the run of the
system (because locking them down would be very complex to configure and
maintain).
</p>

<h3>2. Use Software and Operating System that You can Maintain</h3>

<p>
The idea that one vendor&#8217;s operating system is inherently more secure
than any others is largely a myth. You do not achieve increased security
just by picking an operating system and then forgetting about it. Every
operating system environment is subject to vulnerabilities, which get fixed
and patched over time. Run your website on an operating system that you and
your organization are comfortable maintaining and patching: a well
maintained, up-to-date Windows server may well be more secure than a stale,
unmaintained Linux installation. Your task is to maintain and defend your
website, not to engage in a religious war of one operating system versus
another.
</p>

<h3>3. Slim Down your Server Software</h3>

<p>
When first installed, the default configuration of server software is
often intended to be a feature showcase, rather than an Internet facing
deployment. Turn off unused Apache modules. Slim down your server
configuration file: only include configuration directives for functionality
that you actually use. Remove sample code, default accounts and manual
pages: install those on your development system. Turn off all error
reporting to the browser. A lean server configuration is easier to manage,
and presents attackers with less opportunity.
</p>

<h3>4. Access your Management Interface over SSL</h3>

<p>
Many website environments and Content Management Systems are managed
through an interface that is part of the website itself. Consider running
this part of your site over SSL to protect login credentials and other
sensitive data. An SSL-enabled website is protected by a cryptographic key
and certificate that identify the server. You do not need to buy an
expensive certificate to do this: generate your own certificate and add it to the
trusted certificate store of your browser: as website manager, you are the
only one who needs to trust your own certificate. Content Management
Systems like Wordpress allow you to enable SSL on the management interface
with a few configuration settings. Encrypting management connections with
SSL is an effective way to protect your all-important login credentials.

</p>

<h3>5. White-list Allowed Actions, Blacklist Attacks</h3>

<p>
As site manager, you should know which legitimate HTTP
operations users can perform on your site. Ideally, you should treat any
other action as hostile, and deny it. Unfortunately, this is not always
feasible or politically achievable: you may have inherited an environment
in which all the valid URL and operation combinations are simply unknown,
and aggressive restrictions may interfere with business operations. On the
Apache web server, you can use a Web Application Firewall like ModSecurity
by Ivan Ristic to allow and disallow access to particular URLs and actions.
Other web server software packages provide similar features. If you are
unable to white-list allowed actions, you should be able to blacklist
attacks as you see them happen.
</p>

<h3>6. Use a Firewall</h3>

<p>
After a web application is compromised, the attackers will often attempt
to have the application download additional malware. Or, installed malware
may connect to a command-and-control server hosted elsewhere. Generally, a
web application should only respond to incoming requests, and not be
allowed to make outgoing TCP connections. This makes server maintenance a
little more cumbersome, but it is a small price to pay for stopping
attackers&#8217; operations.
</p>

<h3>7. Keep your Software Up-to-date</h3>

<p>
Vulnerabilities are discovered on a regular basis in
every operating system and on all application platforms. Fortunately, once
discovered, they are usually fixed reasonably swiftly. Be sure to keep your
system and software up-to-date and install all vendor patches.
</p>

<h3>8. Peruse your Logs</h3>

<p>
Your web server will log every request it handles, and will note any
errors that occur. An attempt to attack your web server will likely leave a
rash of error messages in your server logs, and you should monitor those
logs on a regular basis to see how you are being attacked. Log monitoring
can also reveal URLs and operations that initiate attacks and should be
blacklisted.
</p>

<h3>9. Prevent Writing to Document Root</h3>

<p>
Your website might serve two types of content: content that you put
there, and content that someone else puts there unbeknownst to you. The
Internet-facing network listener that provides access to your application
is its lifeline: without it your application would not be usable. However,
it is also an attack vector. Through specially crafted HTTP requests,
attackers will probe vulnerabilities in your application and configuration.
They will try to upload content or scripts to your website: if they can get
a PHP script uploaded and call it through the web server, it runs with the
same privileges as the web server program and can likely be used to wreak
havoc.
</p>

<p>
Content Management Systems like Joomla! and Wordpress allow site
managers to upload and update plug-ins, and in some cases, to configure the
server-side software through a web browser. This makes these packages
really easy to use, but the drawback is that the web server program must be
able to write to the server directories that contain the software. This
capability is easily abused by intruders. Never allow the web server
program to write to directories within the URL space of the site, where
uploaded content can be served and possibly called as interpreted scripts.
Instead, upload your software and plug-ins through an out-of-band mechanism
like SSH or SFTP.
</p>

<h3>10. Use One Time Passwords</h3>

<p>
Abuse of login credentials is often a more successful attack method than
exploitation of software vulnerabilities. Active Internet users often have
dozens of User IDs and passwords on dozens of different websites. Expecting
users to follow the recommendations concerning password strength and change
frequency is unrealistic.
</p>

<p>
However, if there is one site for which you use strong passwords that
you change on a regular basis, make it your own website management
interface.
</p>

<p>
An even better way to protect login credentials is through use of One
Time Passwords. This method lets you calculate a new password for every
time you log into your site management interface, based on a challenge sent
by the site and a PIN that only you know. Programs to calculate One Time
Passwords are available for all operating systems, including smart phones,
so you can carry your OTP generator with you and separate it from the
network interaction with your website. Since an OTP can never be used
twice, this technique makes your website management interface immune to
keystroke loggers and network sniffers: even if your login information is
sniffed or captured, the attackers cannot re-use it.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion: Use &#8220;The CLUB&trade;&#8221;</h3>

<p>
The CLUB&trade; is a lock that you put on the steering wheel of your car as you
park it. It is inexpensive and clearly visible to anyone who might consider
breaking into your car and stealing it. In addition, it will encourage
miscreants to skip your car and move on to a car that does not have a
visible security device. Making your own car a less attractive target is a
highly effective security control technique.
</p>

<p>
There is a clear analogy to the CLUB&trade; for defending your website: with
a few relatively simple measures like the ones described above, you can
thwart the scripts that automatically scan the web for vulnerable sites,
and have their owners focus their attention on the many, many websites that
lack basic protection.
</p>

<p>
Of course basic protective measures do not absolve you entirely: your
website is likely up 24/7 and unlike car thieves, who operate in a public
place, web attackers have all the time in the world to quietly pick away at
the locks on your website until they find a weakness they can exploit. As a
webmaster, you need to plug all the holes, but the villains need to find
only one leak. Therefore, your continued vigilance is required and the tips discussed
above should give you a good start.

I'm just this guy, you know? I'm a CNU graduate with a degree in
 physics. Before starting xkcd, I worked on robots at NASA's Langley
 Research Center in Virginia. As of June 2007 I live in Massachusetts. In
 my spare time I climb things, open strange doors, and go to goth clubs
 dressed as a frat guy so I can stand around and look terribly
 uncomfortable. At frat parties I do the same thing, but the other way
 around.

<em>
<p>
Born September 22, 1969, in Gardena, California, "Penguin" Pete Trbovich
 today resides in Iowa with his wife and children. Having worked various
 jobs in engineering-related fields, he has since "retired" from
 corporate life to start his second career. Currently he works as a
 freelance writer, graphics artist, and coder over the Internet. He
 describes this work as, "I sit at home and type, and checks mysteriously
 arrive in the mail."
</p>

<p>
He discovered Linux in 1998 - his first distro was Red Hat 5.0 - and has
 had very little time for other operating systems since. Starting out
 with his freelance business, he toyed with other blogs and websites
 until finally getting his own domain penguinpetes.com started in March
 of 2006, with a blog whose first post stated his motto: "If it isn't fun
 for me to write, it won't be fun to read."
</p>

<p>
The webcomic <em>Doomed to Obscurity</em> was launched New Year's Day,
 2009, as a "New Year's surprise". He has since rigorously stuck to a
 posting schedule of "every odd-numbered calendar day", which allows him
 to keep a steady pace without tiring. The tagline for the webcomic
 states that it "gives the geek culture just what it deserves." But is it
 skewering everybody but the geek culture, or lampooning geek culture
 itself, or doing both by turns?
</p>
