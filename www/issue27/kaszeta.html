<h2> A New Use for Old and Outdated PCs</h2>

<h2>Summary:</h2>

<p>This page describes how to convert low-end 386/486 PC's into standalone
X Window Systems terminals which can serve as graphical terminals to
your existing Linux/Unix workstations.

<h2>Background:</h2>

<p>Here at the <a href="http://www.me.umn.edu/">Mechanical Engineering
Dept.</a> at the University of Minnesota, we inherited a number of old
IBM PS/Valuepoint 486 machines (16 Meg memory, 200 Meg HD) with
keyboards and monitors, and were trying to find a way to get some good
use out of them.

<p>Originally, we discussed placing Linux on them (our department
already has dozens of Pentium-class Linux machines which are quite
popular), but decided that with their low disk space and memory they
wouldn't run fast enough to suit our current users' needs, and that it
wasn't economical to upgrade them.

<p>Our solution was to install a minimal Debian Linux system on them
(base install plus basic networking, X, and a few utilities), and
configure them to act as X terminals, allowing us to provide
extremely cheap fully-graphical terminals, which are used in graduate
student offices and as X interfaces to our headless Unix servers.

<h2>XDM: The basic concept:</h2>

<p><tt>xdm</tt> is a "display manager", providing X login windows to
users.  The traditional use of xdm is to provide a graphical login on
the local display on an X11 workstation, so that the user does not
need to start up X "by hand".

<p>However, <tt>xdm</tt> can also provide graphical X11 logins to
remote machines, such as NCD Xterminals.  The only requirement is that
the remote machine speak X.  

<p>What we are describing here is configuring a cheap PC to act just
like one of these Xterminals.

<h2>Setting up the X Terminals</h2>

<p>Setting up the 486 PCs as graphical X terminals fairly
straightforward, consisting of just a few steps:
<OL>
<LI>Installing a minimal Debian Linux system on each PC
<LI>Configuring each PC to start up X and query an XDM server to get a
    list of hosts to connect to.
<LI>Configuring one or more XDM servers to provide "chooser" services
    to the X terminals.
<LI>Configuring XDM and the chooser to be more aesthetically pleasing
    and useful.
</OL>

<P>I'll discuss each of these steps in turn.

<h3>Installing a minimal Linux system:</h3>

<p>Since our existing Linux systems run <a
href="http://www.debian.org">Debian Linux</a> we chose to use it for
these PCs as well. 

<p>On each system, we installed just the basic Debian system from
floppy, which provides a very bare-bones Linux system with networking
support.  No user accounts were created, since none are needed (since
no users actually log into the machine itself).

<p>Next, Debian packages of XFree86 3.3 were loaded on each system.
We loaded the base X11 libraries, the X extensions, the S3 X server
(since the PS/Valuepoints have 2-meg S3-based video card), and all the
X11R6 fonts.

<p>Finally, we installed a few additional packages for convenience,
including basic networking utilities (<t>netbase</t>), <tt>ssh</tt>
(to allow use to remotely log in through a secure channel), and
<tt>nvi</tt> since the systems staff here doesn't like the default
Debian text editor.

<h3>Configuring each PC to start up X:</h3>

<p>The first step was configuring X to run locally on each PC.  An
<a href="XF86Config"><tt>XF86Config</tt></a> file was created for the machines using the standard
'<tt>xf86config</tt>' utility, with a couple of considerations:
<UL>
<LI>The "Emulate3Buttons" option was enabled, since the mice that came
with the machines are only 2-button mice.
<LI>While the 2-meg S3 card in the Valuepoints is capable of up to
1152x900x16bit resolution, we chose to run 1024x768x8bit, since it
runs at a more comfortable refresh rate, better viewability on the
15-inch IBM monitors, and provides better compatibility with local
applications than 16-bit color.
<LI>For added security, "DontZap" is specified so that users cannot
inadvertently kill the X server.
<LI>We added additional SGI-defined colors to
<tt>/usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt</tt> so that the X-stations could talk to our
SGIs without errors.
<LI>You may wish to set up a font server somewhere.
</UL>

<P>Once we were satisfied with the configuration of the X server, we
then tested if it could connect to a workstation running xdm ("rayleigh" in
this example):

<pre>
X -quiet -query weber
</pre>

which gives us the standard xdm login window for "weber":<p>
<div align="center">
<img border=1 width=629 height=402 alt="standard xdm login window"
src="./gx/kaszeta/xdm1.gif">
</div>

<P>So, we now know everything is basically working.  If we just want the PC to
talk to a single workstation, then we are basically done.  The only
remaining step is to make sure that X is started upon bootup.  We can
do this with a script in <a href="xterm1"><tt>/etc/init.d/xterm</tt></a>.

<P>On a Debian system, we install it with '<tt>update-rc.d xterm defaults
99</tt>'. (The procedure for Redhat, Slackware, etc., is similar).
We then reboot the machine to make sure it starts X upon boot.

<h3>Configuring an XDM server to provide a "chooser":</h3>

<P>We've already set up a basic X Terminal.  However, it can only talk to
a single machine.  If we would like it to be able to connect to a
number of other machines, we'll have to have at least one machine in
our network configured to provide a host "chooser" to our X terminals.
In this discussion, the machine providing "chooser" xdm services is
called "weber" (note that in this example "weber" is a Linux box, but
it could be any xdm-enabled workstation).

<P>The first step is to configure weber to provide the chooser to
hosts that connect through an "indirect" XDM connection.  This is
controlled by the <tt>Xaccess</tt> file (located in
<tt>/etc/X11/xdm</tt> on Debian machines, it may be located under
<tt>/usr/lib/X11</tt> or another location on other machines).
Typically, the default <tt>Xaccess</tt> file on most systems is fairly
well commented and includes a number of simple examples, so it's
pretty easy to figure out.

<P>Basically, you have to add a line to the file of the form

<pre>
hostname CHOOSER host-a host-b
</pre>

where <tt>hostname</tt> is the name of the host to provide the chooser
to (it can be a wildcard such as "<tt>*</tt>" or
"<tt>*.domain.name</tt>", the <tt>CHOOSER</tt> tells <tt>xdm</tt> to
provide a chooser to these hosts, and the remainder of the line is a
list of machine names to list in the chooser.  If you use the special
hostname <tt>BROADCAST</tt>, it will list all xdm-enabled machines on
the local network.

<p>So, if we want all machines to be given a chooser that allows them
to select any machine on the local network, we'd make sure
<tt>Xaccess</tt> has the line
<pre>
* CHOOSER BROADCAST
</pre>

<p>However, in our system we have a number of machines in different
subnets, so we can't rely on a broadcast to find them all.  So we use
<pre>
* CHOOSER machine list ...
</pre>
instead.

<p>Additionally, we can specify different lists for different
machines.  As mentioned previously we wanted to use one of the PCs as
a graphical terminal for our headless SGI workstation (which runs
xdm).  So we have this machine, "console", be given a list of only the
server machines:
<pre>
console.me.umn.edu CHOOSER server1 server2 ...
</pre>

<p>The next step is to modify the X terminal to connect to the XDM
server using an 'indirect' query.  We first test it by logging into
the X terminal PC, and starting X with
<pre>
X -indirect weber
</pre>
and we should then see the chooser come up:<p>
<div align="center">
<img border=1 width=799 height=589 alt="standard chooser"
src="./gx/kaszeta/chooser.gif">
</div>
Functional, but a little ugly.

<p>So now that we know it works, we change our
<a href="xterm"><tt>/etc/init.d/xterm</tt></a> script, replacing the
"-query rayleigh" with "-indirect weber".

<h3>Configuring the chooser through X resources and scripts:</h3>

<p>Well, now that we've got everything basically working, all that we
have left is to clean up the configuration of the chooser so it is a
little more useable and visually pleasing.

<p>The chooser can be configured using X resources.  By changing these
resources we can do things such as change the chooser fonts, the
layout of the list, and the colors.  These resources are set in
<tt>/etc/X11/xdm/Xresources</tt> (or a similar location on non-Debian
machines). 

<p>On our systems, we wanted to do the following:
<ul>
<li> Change the header to say "Available MEnet Systems"
<li> Change the fonts to be more legible
<li> Make the list two column, with a gap between the columns, and
sorted vertically.
<li> Move the scrollbar to the right.
<li> Enlarge the window slightly.
</ul>

To accomplish this, we edited <tt>/etc/X11/xdm/Xresources</tt> to
insert the following:
<pre>
Chooser*geometry:               810x500+300+225
Chooser*allowShellResize:       false
Chooser*ShapeStyle:             Oval
Chooser*viewport.forceBars:     true
Chooser*label.font:             *-new century schoolbook-bold-i-normal-*-240-*
Chooser*label.label:            Available MEnet Hosts
!Chooser*list.font:             -*-*-medium-r-normal-*-*-230-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1
!Chooser*Command.font:          *-new century schoolbook-bold-r-normal-*-180-*
#ifdef COLOR
Chooser*label.foreground:               white
Chooser*label.background:               midnightblue
Chooser*Command.background:            gray80
Chooser*list.columnSpacing:         25
Chooser*list.defaultColumns:         2
Chooser*list.forceColumns:         true
Chooser*list.verticalList:              true
Chooser*internalBorderColor:            black
Chooser*Command.font:           -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-12-*
Chooser*viewport.useRight:      true
#endif
</pre>

<p>Finally, we wanted to get rid of the default X11 "thatch" pattern
on the root window, since it gives a horrid moire effect on small
monitors.  To do this, we tell xdm to use a shell script, called
"chooser.script" instead of the normal "chooser".  This script simply
sets the background to "skyblue4" and runs the normal chooser.  We set
this in <tt>/etc/X11/xdm/xdm-config</tt>, adding the line
<pre>
DisplayManager*chooser:         /usr/lib/X11/xdm/chooser.script
</pre>
where "chooser.script" is
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
xsetroot -solid skyblue4
/usr/lib/X11/xdm/chooser $*
</pre>

The final result looks like:<p>
<div align="center">
<img width=876 height=563 border=1 alt="customized chooser"
src="./gx/kaszeta/chooser2.gif">
</div>
Much nicer, no?

<p>A <strong>lot</strong> more customization is possible, through both
X resources and the XDM configuration scripts.  Consult the
<tt>xdm</tt> man page for more details.

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

<p>With relatively little work, and very little subsequent
administration (the X terminals seldom crash, and don't need software
updates), we converted a bunch of "junker" PCs into rather useful X
terminals (I've even done a 386 this way and it runs fine).

<p>As a final note, it's important to point out the while the
particular systems I've described here are PCs running Debian Linux,
the same technique applies equally well to resuscitation of any older
X11-capable machines, such as older Suns (Sparc ELCs), HPs, and
SGIs...
