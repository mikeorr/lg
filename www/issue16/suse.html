SSC is expanding Matt Welsh's <i>Linux Installation & Getting Started</i> by 
adding chapters about each of the major distributions. Each chapter is
being written by a different author in the Linux community. Here's a
sneak preview -- the SuSE chapter by our own Larry Ayers. --Editor

<H3>Introduction</H3>

The SuSE distribution began a few years ago as an adaptation of
Slackware. Patrick Volkerding of Slackware helped the SuSE
developers at first, but before too long, the distribution began to
assume an identity of its own. Several new features intended to aid
the first-time user increase the probability an installation
won't need to be immediately redone. Given the cross-pollination
endemic in the free software world, I wouldn't be surprised to
learn some of these features have shown up in newer Slackware
releases.
<a name="beginning"></a>
<H3>Beginning the Installation</H3>

When booting your machine from the single installation disk, you are
really booting a miniature Linux system designed for this purpose. 
A colored screen appears, ready to ask a series of questions which
with any luck will guide you through the process.
<P> 
YAST (which stands for Yet Another Set-up Tool) shows its Slackware
ancestry inasmuch as it uses the Dialog program; this tool enables
shell scripts to present dialog boxes, radio buttons, and check lists
which allow a user to make choices and direct the course of an
installation.
<p>
While no distribution can guarantee a painless installation, the
developers at GmbH have managed to anticipate several problems new
Linux users are liable to have. One of the more frustrating
problems is finding your CD-ROM drive isn't recognized. Copying
the packages needed to get started to a hard drive and installing
them from there is a solution, but it's awkward and time-consuming.
<p>
Rather than provide a selection of several disk images, one of which
probably has the CD-ROM drive support you need, the single SuSE boot
disk contains a small, basic kernel with all drivers available--if
needed--in the form of modules. The kernel daemon is a background
process which ensures the relevant module will be loaded if a modular
function is needed. This helps to eliminate one stumbling block.
<p>
Another common trap is underestimating the disk space you need which
forces the installation to abort itself due to lack of room. When
this happens, the crucial final steps (such as installing LILO)
haven't yet been reached and starting over is usually necessary. 
Script-based installations are necessarily sequential in nature; you
may know skipping one step won't hurt anything, but it's hard
to anticipate every eventuality in a shell script, and if things go
awry the script usually aborts.
<p>
During the SuSE installation, a running tally of partition space
remaining is displayed on the YAST screen; while selecting packages,
you can try various combinations while keeping in mind how much
free disk space you would prefer to remain free.
<p>
Partitioning and formatting disks, as well as creation and
activation of a swap partition, are processes which aren't much
different than in other distributions. They all use the same
underlying tools to do these tasks; the procedure has become
more or less standardised.
<p>
The use of "dependencies", which consist of information included in
a software package concerning what other packages are necessary for
it to run, has spread rapidly among Linux distributions. 
Unfortunately no universal format for dependencies has arisen, with
each distribution now using a different format. Redhat's RPM
format, used in several distributions, is powerful and effective,
but has a few drawbacks. It works best on an all-RPM system, as the
dependency checking done by the RPM program only knows about RPM
packages. SuSE uses an adaptation of Slackware's *.tar.gz format,
which has the advantage of flexibility. The dependencies are only
checked if a package is installed from within the YAST program,
allowing the option (for a skilled user) of unarchiving a package in
another location, then checking out the files and configuration
before final installation. Dependencies are most useful during the
initial setup and while becoming familiar with a new installation. 
Once you've used the system for a while, you'll have an idea of what
libraries and programs are available. Most software packages for
Linux also contain information as to what needs to be present on a
system in order for the package to function. It is wise to read
through the entire rc.config file before running SuSEconfig and
committing any changes you may have made. Some of the default
actions the script will take you may prefer to handle yourself, but
they are easily disabled by editing the file.
<p>
Users familiar with the Slackware layout of initialization files
will need to make some adjustments; the files usually found in
/etc/rc.d are instead in /sbin/init.d.

<H3>Post-Installation</H3>

YAST is also intended to be used after installation for routine
system maintenance. The multiplicity of resource files necessary
for Linux to boot and run can be bewildering to the beginner. YAST
offers a menu-driven interface to these files, including the
sendmail configuration file, the cron (scheduling) files, initiation
scripts, and various networking files. The changes made within the
YAST session are written to a single file in the /etc directory,
rc.config, which can also be edited directly. These changes are
then written to the various "real" configuration files by a script
called SuSEconfig. This script is automatically run by YAST at the
end of a YAST session; if /etc/rc.config is edited directly
SuSEConfig must be started manually. This sounds like a complicated
procedure, but it's much easier than tracking down the individual
files, learning the correct syntax needed for editing them, and
actually making them do what you want.
<p>
Once you have SuSE Linux up and running, it's a good idea to install
the kernel source (available on the CD-ROM, it's an optional package
which can be installed during initial set-up). SuSE installs a generic
kernel, and you probably need only a few of of the accompanying
modules. This is an excellent opportunity to familiarize yourself with
the mechanics of source code compilation, and you'll end up with a
smaller customized kernel with only the capabilities you need.
<p>
The GCC compiler and accompanying tools must be installed in order
to compile a kernel; these tools are a near-necessity on a Linux
system even if you're not a programmer. The YAST dependency
checking will help insure all required compilation tools are
installed.
<p>
Kernel compilation can seem daunting to a beginner, but it is a fairly
intuitive process. Three interfaces are available for the initial
configuration step. The first (and oldest) is a console-mode script
invoked via the command <TT>make config</TT>. This script asks a
series of questions and uses the results to write a file which guides
the compiler in its work. You need to know some basic facts about your
hardware such as what type of hard disk and CD-ROM drive you have. If
you want sound support you'll need to know the IRQ your card uses, as
well as a few other parameters which can be gathered from the card's
manual or the output of the DOS <TT>msd</TT> utility.
<p>
The other two interfaces are menuconfig and xconfig. The first uses a
modified version of the Dialog program mentioned above, which runs in
the console or an xterm and resembles the YAST setup tool. Xconfig is
a Tk-based version, designed to run in an X Window session. All three
accomplish the same task; the latter two let you make choices without
typing much. The kernel sources are well-documented. The README file
in the top level directory contains enough information to nearly
guarantee a successful build.
<a name="running"></a>
<H3>Getting X Up and Running</H3>
<p>
Successfully configuring the X Window System (specifically XFree86, which is
included with SuSE and most other distributions) can be a stumbling
block. There is such a multiplicity of monitors and video cards
that each installation of X must be individually configured. The
difficulty has been eased somewhat with the release of XFree86 3.2,
which is included with the most recent SuSE release. A Dialog-based
configuration tool can now be used in place of the previous
xf86config. Both are based on shell scripts similar to the one used
to configure the Linux kernel. Nonetheless, you will still need to
know your monitor's horizontal and vertical refresh rates as well as
the chipset installed on your video card. It helps to initially set
your sites low, i.e., get X functioning at a low resolution first
before attempting to make full use of your video card's
capabilities.
<p>
The SuSE developers have taken some pains in configuring the various
window-managers supplied. The first time you start X many of the
applications you elected to install will be available from the
mouse-activated root-window menu. Another entry on the menu allows
you to change the window background. Many well-designed icons are
supplied. This gives the new user a bit of a reprieve. After
getting Linux and X finally running, there is enough to do just
learning how the system works without feeling compelled to customize
the environment in order to make it tolerable to look at!
<p>
<a name="upgrades"></a>
<H3>Later Upgrades</H3>
<p>
The minute you've finished installing even the most up-to-date
distribution available it begins to incrementally become outdated. 
This is a slow process, but eventually you will feel the need to
upgrade some part of the system. Some distributions work best when
the native format of upgrade file is used, but SuSE works well using
the standard *.tar.gz format. SuSE follows in Slackware's footsteps
in this respect. The majority of software packages will compile and
install well (on a reasonably current Linux system) from the tarred
and gzipped format most developers use. There are a few tricky packages
out there; in these cases RPM can be used. The dependency checking
won't work, but RPM allows you to take advantage of a more
experienced user's makefile editing and configuration skills.
