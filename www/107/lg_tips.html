There is a much easier way to upgrade <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> using Yast2.

<P><STRONG>
All you have to do is add the following directory to the Yast sources

<A HREF="ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/supplementary/KDE/update_for_9.0/yast-source"

<P><STRONG>
To do this you use:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
Yast2 --&gt; Software --&gt; Change Source of Installation --&gt; Add FTP.
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Then in Yast2 select "Install and Remove Software". The package selections
will now have been updated to include all the packages in the updated kde.
The packages for which a newer version than the one you have installed will
appear in either red or blue (I can't remember which).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Select the packages you want to upgrade (no 'upgrade everything' button
available I'm afraid). Let Yast2 sort out package dependencies for you and
off you go.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Yast2 will then download, install and configure all the packages for you.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Bit like the extremely good apt that is available on <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>. apt4rpm is also
available for <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> if you'd rather have that flexibility.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
If the download site is too slow an alternative one can be selected. Go to
suse's site and find the list of ftp servers and choose an alternative.

All the best,

Thanks! That's a piece of info I've been missing. I've been told that
you can do it directly inside Yast, but couldn't figure out how. I'm

<P>
If you want to know what version of a package you have installed, just
open a terminal, and type
</P>

<blockquote><pre>emerge -pv packagename
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
The -p tells portage to pretend to emerge and the -v tells it to be
verbose about it. In effect this will show you the package version it
would like to install, and next to it in brackets it will show which
version of the package you currently have installed. It should also show
you any dependencies that need to be upgraded in case there is a newer
version. And of course the -v option will show you possible use flags.

This will search for anything with "packagename" in its packagename,

would list mozilla, mozilla-bin, mozilla-thunderbird, mozilla-firefox,

<P><STRONG>
Gentoo's package query tools (equery and qpkg) aren't complete.
They'll list the files a package contains but several other
features are marked "not implemented". There didn't seem to be
a way to quickly see which version of a package is installed:
something equivalent to "rpm PACKAGE" or "dpkg -l PACKAGE".
"emerge search PACKAGE" does it, but it takes several seconds,
and you have to page through other information and entries for
any other packages the substring matches.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
You might want to emerge app-portage/esearch - it provides about the
same functionality as emerge search, but uses a search-index, which
makes it a lot faster. (Of course, the index has to be built, which
takes time, but can be done with a cronjob.)

If you are used to rpm - you can use the tool epm which emulates rpm's
features. To list all packages installed (incl. versionnr.) do epm -qa. to
list info of one package - do epm -qi packagename etc. etc. It even does
the epm -V (verify md5sum etc. from install-time is still the same - ie. a
"small intrusion detection" tool).

As far nvidia gfx cards are concerned, seems for some it works without a
hitch, for others there seem to be problems. Although it seems to me
that proportionally many more users have no trouble with nvidia cards
than the ones that do.
</P>
<P>
Just a few pointers about nvidia cards under gentoo:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
Whenever you recompile your kernel, you need to re-emerge
nvidia-kernel AND nvidia-glx
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
you should then also always run
</P>

<blockquote><pre>opengl-update nvidia
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
Also in the <TT>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</TT> file, in the "Device" section, the driver
is called "nvidia" and not "nv".
Xorg's nvidia driver is used if you define it as "nv", nvidia's binary
driver is used if you define it as "nvidia".
</P>
<P>
Also, if you are using a 2.6 kernel, make sure that you dont have "4k
stacks" option active. I think its somewhere in the basic kernel config.
The default should be 8k stacks, and the nvidia drivers dont work well
if at all with 4k stacks. This info should be displayed at the end of
emerge nvidia-kernel.
</P>
<P>
On a little side note, ever since I've switched from xfree86 to xorg and
from kernel 2.4 to 2.6.8, my framerate in Quake3 Urban Terror has
increased by 20+-30+fps.
Dont know if your a gamer, but I thought that was pretty cool.

As far as samba problems are concerned, have you tried using
LinNeighborhood? Using that program, I have no problems mounting windows
shares.
</P>

<blockquote><pre>emerge LinNeighborhood

You mentioned that when you mount a samba share, then you are denied

yet, try LinNeighborhood.

<P>
I have read somewhere that Window's samba implementation can be screwey
depending on which version of windows it is. Some like scrambled
passwords, some dont. I'm sure you can find more info on the net.
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Windows 95 didn't even have the ability to encrypt its passwords, later 98 insisted on it (and wouldn't work without, unless you applied a patch to it). With other mswin versions your mileage may vary.  "lanman compatibility" seemed to mean "mention the password twice on the wire, the really old way and whatever new way du jour" - so I recommend any mswin admins out there try to avoid that, you lose enough bandwidth as it is, and it doesn't really help samba any.

<P>
By the way.
It is not recommended to blindly issue the "update all" portage command.
Sometimes new stuff, can break some old stuff, and there have been
plenty of cases where people simply did a emerge -u -deep world
and found their system not working anymore.
I find that the best way to update your system is to do a
</P>

<blockquote><pre>emerge -upv -deep world.
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
This will show me which packages COULD be updated and then I just
manually upgrade from there. Very handy if for example a newer version
of an app has been ported from gtk to gtk2 or to qt or whatever, and you
dont want to compile all this extra stuff.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, often enough when you update any packages, portage will tell
you that you need to run etc-update in order to update the config files.
Be VERY careful here as well. Since 90% of the time the only change to
config file is to label it as "version x.x.x".
However the process if not done carefully, will overwrite to specific
config file with defaults.
etc-update offers you options to manually select inside the file, what
can be removed and what not, but its quite confusing to read. I would
suggest, when it comes to etc-update, certain config files can be
overwritten no problem, e.g. all the ones that you havent changed in any
way. But always keep a current backup of all the configs that you
edited. e.g. make.conf, smb.conf, rc.conf, lilo.conf, etc.
I usually make copies, let etc-update overwrite them, and then manually
copy+paste relevant stuff back into the new file.
I'm sure there is a much better way to do this, and I recall that I read
something about that in the forums.
Either way, just letting you know to take care when etc-updating.
But then again, I think its always wise not to blindly update everything
as soon as it comes out. Unless its a much needed security fix.

<P>
Mike, in your article.
You mentioned that the day before your install, <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A>3.3 came out and it
was still in the "masked" section.
</P>
<P>
Just to clear things up. Masked, does not automatically mean unstable,
it also means "testing". More often than not apps in "masked" simply
havent been tested enough. Doesnt have to mean that this package will
definately fail to build or even crash once you use it.
However sometimes you need to use an obscure app which hasn't been
included in portage until recently, and the only version available is
masked. Although sometimes it can happen that a dependancy required by
the app is still masked.
Usually I would say, stick to the main portage tree as much as you can.
Recompiling small apps, once theyre moved from "masked" to "stable"
shouldn't be too big of a deal.

Using distcc is actually quite easy - one just has to ensure that if
you use f.ex. hardened (stack smashing protection and friends) your gcc on
all distcc machines (can even be a windows machine some of them) has to
have the same abilities. You can even use distcc to do all the compiling
on another machine, if you are installing on an older machine, it
sometimes makes most sense to let someone else do the hard work

<P>
The <TT>/etc/portage/package.mask</TT> package.unmask package.use and

to make portage do exactly what you want. Say you thrust that newest
releases of kde is stable enough for you to use (you can have several

Later, after you've installed X, you simply "emerge links"
again, and it will rebuild itself with the X support.

I realize you are using an example where you only temporarily set $USE,
but it might be worth noting that one can also set specific options for
separate packages, in a more permanent way, using
/etc/portage/package.use.

Some other interesting files in that directory are package.mask,
package.unmask and package.keywords. The last one is, btw, the preferred
way to add experimental packages, while running stable mostly.

<P>
The best way to implement a package differently than the package
maintainer intended is to create a local overlay of the portage tree.
This should be is the docs, but here's my quick notes:
</P>

<blockQuote><ol>
<LI>Uncomment the "PORTAGE_OVERLAY" option in /etc/make.conf

<LI>mkdir -p /usr/local/portage/dev-php/php/files

<LI>Copy /usr/portage/dev-php/php/php/php-&lt;version&gt;.ebuild to /usr/local/portage/dev-php/php - I suggest changing the build version or release number to identify your version

<LI>Tweak the ebuild file

<LI>Run 'ebuild /usr/local/portage/dev-php/php/php-&lt;version&gt;.ebuild digest'
</ol></blockQuote>
<P>
Now, if you use "emerge -pv php" you should see your build and a
notation that the ebuild is coming from the <TT>/usr/local/portage</TT> overlay
location. The biggest problem with all this is that now you are a
package maintainer but it's on your local system. Keeping your changes
in sync with new ebuilds from Portage can be a hassle. It's a good idea
to request a new USE flag for your desired <TT>./configure</TT> arguments in
<A HREF="http://bugs.gentoo.org"
	>http://bugs.gentoo.org</A> and let the official package maintainer worry
about it going forward.

<P>
Using distcc is actually quite easy - one just has to ensure that if
you use f.ex. hardened (stack smashing protection and friends) your gcc on
all distcc machines (can even be a windows machine some of them) has to
have the same abilities. You can even use distcc to do all the compiling
on another machine, if you are installing on an older machine, it
sometimes makes most sense to let someone else do the hard work

I'd seen people with problems a couple of times recently, but had no answer
to the problem of non-booting but "good" (as in MD5SUM) images. It appears
that the Gentoo folks came up with a possible solution, and did a respin of
the 2004-2 minimal install ISO that was "rebuilt to solve the problem of
certain buggy BIOS versions not booting the Minimal LiveCD."
</P>
<P>
If people write in with similar problems installing from the small Gentoo
ISO images, we could do worse than point them in the direction of the
revised image. Here's a link to such on one of the mirrors:

Hello all,
</P>
<P>
This is a ugly hack that I am using to search the google from command
line. Any decent Python programmer would be able to make it much better.
You need to have Pygoogle (<A HREF="http://pygoogle.sourceforge.net"
	>http://pygoogle.sourceforge.net</A>) module
installed. In its unaltered form, the script will require Python2.3 to
run. However, if you remove the #--ugly hack part (see the comments in
the code), it will run with Python2.2 too.
</P>

<blockquote><pre>#!/usr/bin/python2.3
import google,sys,codecs
from sgmllib import SGMLParser

# HTML Stripper class to strip out html from the google search
# returned.  shamelessly copy pasted from
# http://mail.python.org/pipermail/tutor/2002-September/017573.html

     def __init__(self):

     print

     #-- begin hack

     # if you want to call this script from within emacs, then you have
     #to put in this ugly hack. Other wise emacs will stop with an
     #error message &quot;UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode

     # see  http://www.informit.com/articles/article.asp?p=31272&amp;seqNum=5

##     print 'Title\t:', strip_html(in_str)
##     print 'URL\t:', result.URL

Mr. Brown:

I read your article on upgrading to kde 3.3 today.  The reason I'm mailing you is because I'm one of the developers for Superkaramba.  I noticed your article mentioned that the Superkaramba widgets are "always on top".  This has been resolved in the latest release, 0.34, and in CVS, with our pending release of 0.35.  You would need to recompile for <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> 3.3, as the code needed for the two versions are different and detect your version upon compilation.
