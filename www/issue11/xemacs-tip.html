Lately I've been enjoying exploring the myriad capabilities of GNU Emacs'
offspring and competitor, Xemacs.  Aside from the burden of downloading the
voluminous source, Xemacs offers quite a few features which Gnu Emacs
lacks. Luckily for those considering a transition, the basic keystrokes and
commands are nearly identical.

<p>One feature of Gnu Emacs which I began to miss after a while was the handy
pull-down menu which displays the first few words of each cut or copied
selection made in the current session, i.e. the "kill-ring".  The prospect of
figuring out how the lisp files work which determine the menu-bar's structure
wasn't too appealing.  I know a little lisp, but not enough to add a new menu
entry.

<p>Some weeks later, while idly browsing through some emacs newsgroup 
headers, I came across this posting, which I'll quote here in full:<br>

&gt When I used emacs (before I saw the light), I made use of a function
&gt mouse-menu-choose-yank which offered you the choice to yank from the recent
&gt history of selections via a popup menu, but I can't get it to work in
&gt XEmacs because x-popup-menu doesn't exist, and the parameters to
&gt popup-menu are different. Has anyone got an alternative. I enclose the
&gt ...

I have hacked the Emacs codes of mouse-menu-choose-yank to put in
Xemacs as follows:

<code>
(defvar yank-menu-length 40
  "*Maximum length of an item in the menu for select-and-yank.")
(defun select-and-yank-filter (menu)
  (let* ((count 0))
    (append menu
            (mapcar
             #'(lambda (str)
                 (if (> (length str) yank-menu-length)
                     (setq str (substring str 0 yank-menu-length)))
                 (prog1
                     (vector
                      str
                      (list
                       'progn
                       '(push-mark (point))
                       (list 'insert (list 'current-kill count t)))
                      t)
                   (setq count (1+ count))))
             kill-ring))))
</code>
For this to work, you have to put on your menu bar the following submenu
(use add-submenu for that for example):
<code>
      ("Select and Yank"
       :included kill-ring
       :filter select-and-yank-filter)
</code>
Hope this help

  It took a little experimenting to get this to work. The first section
of lisp code, ending with "kill-ring))))", can be copied unaltered into
the xemacs section of your ~/.emacs file. If you're using Xemacs 19.14
(the current version), it goes into your ~/.xemacs-options file.

<p>The second, shorter lisp snippet needs one small addition:<br>  
<pre>
<code>
           (add-submenu nil '("Kill-Ring"
                     :included kill-ring
                     :filter select-and-yank-filter))
</pre>
</code><br>

<p>As well as adding the proper syntax for <i>add-submenu</i>, I shortened
the menu-title, but it could be called anything you like.

<p>When I first restarted Xemacs after placing this code into the init file
the new submenu was nowhere to be seen.  I surmised that I'd made some error,
and put off further experimentation for another time.  A few minutes later I
was busily editing some file. I happened to glance up at the menu-bar and 
found a brand-new kill-ring submenu. Surprisingly the new menu only appears
after a selection has been cut or copied.

<p>I was happy, and thought that by relating my experience I could encourage
other Xemacs users (especially the ones who know as little lisp as I do!) to
try this neat hack.  Thanks to Dinh Tuan Pham, if he or she should happen to
see this.
