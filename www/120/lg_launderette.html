It would be a rather nifty thing if you folks wanted to participate; I
find myself travelling a lot, but often forgetting who's where (I was
just in Chicago last week, and remembered, too late and with much
chagrin, that Chris G. lives there.) A visual reminder just might be a
handy thing for any of us who can't recall all the written info ("say,
wasn't there a pin somewhere around here?")

That's what I've been chuckling about from the start of this. The
Censores and the Latinists have taken on a hell of a load - essentially,
they'll be either qualifying or picking (in most cases, IMO, and perhaps
several times over) the names for every single person who joins NR. I'd
offer to write something that could do basic vetting, but I've got
better things to do.

And (at least in the Orthodox tradition), asking a saint to pray for you
is no different than asking anybody else to pray for you.  They are
merely peers whose devotion to God is widely recognized, and venerating
them is a traditional form of honor/respect.  As to how can the dead
pray for you, they are "conscious" and awaiting the judgement (viz.
Revelation under the throne, "How long must we wait?").  You can pray
for them as easily as they pray for you, although it's not traditionally
done.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
As for "Who is a saint?", it's basically the people who knew them
treating them as such, and lobbying the officialdom to recognize it.

The answer is "effect".  Something that affects or effects causes an
effect.  Affect (noun) is a specialized term in psychology.  #3 says
this confusion goes back at least to the 1400s, and has an interactive quiz.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
(#2 fails to note that effect (verb) is formalese.
"The temperature reversal <EM>effected</EM> a major slowdown in the bacterial
growth rate."
Normal people would say "caused" instead.
"The temperature reversal caused a hurricane.")

	> [Ben] 
The distinction for me is that "effect" means "cause or accomplish",
whereas "affect" is "act upon or pretend". As well, "affect" as used by
psychologists isn't very different from one of the common meanings of
the word: "to affect an uncaring air" is to create an external
impression of an internal state. The major difference, as I see it, is
that the former is involuntary while the latter is consciously created;
otherwise, the meanings are similar.

Oh, come - there's a LOT more to hate about English than just _that._
Stupid pronunciations that have no relation to how the words are
written, that's my pet peeve. "Recipe"? "Queue"? "Though the tough cough
and hiccough plough him through"? Sheesh. Then there are the words that
are <em>  made  </em> to be mispeled: "wierd", "tounge", "beleive", and so on - and
words that damn near <em>  no one  </em> (noone?) can spell without staring at a
dictionary for a while (Mississippi, miscellaneous, Cincinnati,
extraordinary). And is it councillor or counselor or councilor? (The

I have some friends that work at an industrial/goth club called The Vogue,

Recently, I began using my box to connect directly (okay, it's dailup,
but as opposed to being behind NAT) to the internet. So, naturally, I
set up iptables to do NAT for the rest of the LAN and be fairly strict
about what it accepts. (Anything going out is okay, anything coming in
has to be ESTABLISHED or RELATED or else it's logged and dropped).

<blockQuote>
So when I started seeing weird UDP packets being dropped, I thought I
must have my DNS set up wrong or something, because it's highly unlikely
anybody's trying to get in to my system, right? Well, ulogd and tcpdump
tell this story: (IP addresses censored to protect the innocent)

I myself used to pick up very similar logs, and recently a family friend

from the ISP, (I setup the account) asking if I was aware of this
activity.  678 MALCIOUS objects later, and the machine was clean.

LWN writes about the broadcast flag's return from the dead (coming soon
to a legislator near you), and a similar initiative in Europe (Content
Protection and Copy Management: CPCM).  The new proposal would give the
FCC the authority to enforce the broadcast flag in TV-receiving devices
and on "digital networks".  This isn't quite the FCC "regulating the
Internet", but it's a step in that direction that could be exploited by
those who see the Internet as "one giant copying machine".

Open source developers should ignore Microsoft's so-called "success"

Linux will gain in mass appeal as Web applications (such as Ajax-style

traditional desktop applications that are compatible with Microsoft
Office and Windows. A bit more marketing would help as well!"

At the top of article &lt;pwgVe.7612$e96.5058@trndny09&gt;, which you crossposted
across alt.fan.bob-larson / alt.true-crime / misc.legal [1], you wrote:

   &gt; That's very nice, but what do you presume to say to God when you
   &gt; stand before Him at the Final Judgement?

   I will adopt Rick Moen's Strategy: "In the unlikely event of losing
   Pascal's Wager, I intend to saunter into Judgement Day with a bookshelf
   full of grievances, a flaming sword of my own devising, and a serious
   attitude problem." I'm guessing Ken will have a similar strategy.
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
I'm delighted to have given people ammunition in the eternal war against
idiocy.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
But the astonishing thing is that it was absolutely an <em>  offhand  </em> remark
that I made one day in 1997 in -- of all places -- the Robert Jordan
SF/fantasy newsgroup (rec.arts.sf.written.robert-jordan).[2]
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
That newsgroup was and almost certainly still is an amazingly literate
and funny group of slightly cranky people[3], who use Robert Jordan's
logorrhoeic epic fantasy series as an excuse to shoot the breeze on
almost everything.  Almost.  We had the misfortune to suffer an invasion
of "witness-bearing" envoys from the Jesus Christ Church of Latter-Day
Saints -- who had somehow taken it upon themselves to straighten us out
about the Book of Mormon and their church's creative approach to
American paleo-history.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Their entrance and quest were entertaining for about five minutes, but
then they became repetitious, tedious, and insulting to everyone's
intelligence.  The regulars proceeded to have a field day taking apart
their archeology, their logical consistency, <em>  and their theology .</em>
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I happened to be mopping them up over religious ethics, when I dropped
the quoted sentence as an afterthought.   (Mind you:  I have no problem with
people basing their ethics on religious principle.  I object only when
the outcome of that process is illogical, and especially if it is both
that <em>  and  </em> morally reprehensible.)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
And, to my amazement, that sentence was immediately quoted... well...
just about everywhere, became the thing I was best known for, for
at least the following five years -- and keeps showing up.  Go figure.
