Hi. I've dl'd and installed the IE6 running under Wine from
<a href="http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page">http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page</a> This is useful step 
in testing web page development ... I don't care enough about it to 
actually test with a real windows machine, but if I can test locally 
using IE6 it is not a big deal.
</p>

<p>
Under gnome or KDe it works just fine. But, it crashed (or stalls) under
icewm. I have tried to start from a terminal and from the toolbar. Under
a terminal I get the Wine debug prompt, and a "loading" window. But that
is about it.
</p>

<p>
I am thinking there is a path difference or something. But, I have
checked and don't see and obvious differences.
</p>

<p>
I have checked on the tatanka page and don't see anything on this topic. 
And a request to the IceWM users list has drawn a blank as well. Maybe 
one of you guys has an idea on this?
</p>

Are you telling Wine to manage its own windows, or are you allowing the
window manager to?  I would suggest you tell wine not to manage its own
windows to see what happens.

Not being a wine expert at all ... how does one do this? The ie6 thing I 
have is a script "ie6" which just calls wine with a complete path name 
to the installed location of the MS-binaries.
