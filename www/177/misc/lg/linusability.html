Linux usability -- an introspection (Code name ::  linusability)
</p>

<p>
In spite of all claims and evidence regarding the superiority of
Linux, one aspect of Linux remains to be its major weakness --
usability. This may be the reason for its slow acceptance by the
not-so-geeky user community. I am launhing a serious study into
various aspects of the usability aspects of Linux, so as to list
out the problems and hopefully help some people offer solutions.
</p>

<p>
I need help. Please, if you have any ideas on this subject, or if
you know any sources where I can get directions, or if there is
something I should (or should not) do, let me know directly, by
email. I will compile all my findings, and post them back in this
forum. Let us make Linux more enjoyable by more people.
</p>

<p>
Many thanks,

"Usability for whom?" is a question whose answer it is important to
establish before going too far.
</p>

<p>
At the very least you need to address two classes of users:
</p>

<p>
 1. Those who have used computers before (usually this means Windows
 but it could sometimes mean MacOS as well).
</p>

<p>
 2. Those who are using computers for the first time.
</p>

<p>
I think that a lot of effort (GNOME/KDE, openoffice, ...) has gone
into addressing (1); and that is indeed a difficult problem since
those users have expectations/prejudices.
</p>

<p>
There have been a number of worthwhile attempts at (2), such as the
Sugar interface for school kids. These have been successful on
the usability front.
</p>

<p>
Just my 2 paise worth.

There's a third, and even larger class of user- those who use Linux
without even realising that they are doing so.  I am unsure of just how
many web sites are driven by Linux, but I do know it's huge.

Dear Sir
   Sorry, but my opinion is that if you show Linux and teach how to use
it to people that had no previous knowledge of computers they will learn
it as fast as they learn windows. Of course I am speaking use Ubuntu or
similar linux.  I have seen some comparatives done in schools and they
show this fact.
  The fact that Windows is more widespread is the consequence of
multiple factors, one of them the money M spends promoting it and giving
away licenses to schools.

<p>
+ 1. IMHO, its about "attacking the mindset". A programmer focused
article, I wrote recently [1]  has a section on the same. There is
still a notion that Linux is tough. I mean, sure there is a learning
curve, but anything new has a learning curve- learning a new language,
learning to cook, you name it. Its the mind that has to be attacked,
and unfortunately that's as tough as it can get. M$ goes long back,
most young men/women of today started with computers which had Windows
on them and the associated software.
So, its not going to happen overnight.  A revolution is needed. How,
and when remains to be seen.

I suppose it depends on how you define "usability". If you're talking
about simple ease of application use for the average user, then you may
be operating from an outdated model of the situation.
 
As you probably know quite well, one of the major parts of any study is
designing the experiment environment - part of which is neutralizing any
observer bias. In this case, the strongest bias that I see is your
belief that Linux has usability as a "major weakness". I might have
agreed with you, say, 10 years ago; you could still make somewhat of a
case for it even 6 years ago. Today? I'd say that Windows has a very
serious usability problem (I just mentioned the screaming frustration of
trying to deal with a simple task under it the other day.) Linux has, in
my estimation, surpassed Windows in usability - and continues to improve
constantly.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, if you define "usability" as the total package - that
is, application usage, administration, program installation, etc. - then
Linux may well come up a little short by comparison for the moment. It
won't always stay that way, but for now, Linux definitely has some
places that could stand a lot of improvement. 
</p>

<p>
On the positive side, I've done a number of Linux installations (Ubuntu,
mostly) over the past several years. In most cases, these people had no
understanding of computers - they were just simple users - and simply
wanted to get on with their tasks: writing letters, sending email,
browsing the Web, using Skype. Once I set up their systems, walked them
through using the applications, and showed them how to install new
software, they were on their own... and guess what? None of them had any
usability problems.  One woman called me up because she was having
trouble using Skype...  turned out the problem was the microphone gain
on her daughter's computer on the other end of the connection.
</p>

<p>
This is not to say that Linux is problem-free - but then, we don't ask
that of any other OS, so that's not a rational metric. Here are the
problems that I currently see:
</p>

<p>
1) Windows and MacOS have <em>very</em> slick UIs: once you learn how to use
one app, there's a large hunk of interface dynamics that carries over to
every other app. This is, unfortunately, not true for Linux: given the
"bazaar" method of app creation in the FOSS community, just about every
program outside the standard KDE/Gnome set has its creator's idea of
"the perfect interface" - whatever new and different thing that may
happen to be. Worse yet, the FOSS competition model doesn't work, or
works only peripherally, for refining that part of the system - so a
Linux user has to learn and remember each app's UI. This is rather
inefficient, as well as being a pain in the ass. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> This is a big one,
and I don't know that much improvement is possible.
</p>

<p>
2) The Linux methodology for program installation is a wonderful thing
(especially when compared with the "infectious diseases ward"
environment of Windows software installation); however, it <strong>is</strong>
different. As such, it needs to be made more explicit and more obvious
to the new Linux user. Fortunately, this wouldn't take much: in my
opinion, an "Install New Software" icon on every freshly-installed
desktop would do a great job of pinging a user's interest and making it
obvious. Also, working to make that installation interface as intuitive
as possible - it's pretty good now, but could be improved - would be a
good idea.
</p>

<p>
3) System administration. This is a rather technical issue under Linux,
and is usually blown off with "oh, just go to the Ubuntu forums -
they'll explain everything!" THE AVERAGE USER IS NOT GOING TO DO THAT.
They'd rather go back to their comforting - albeit infected - Windows
world (spyware and viruses don't <strong>usually</strong> wipe out a computer these
days, and anti-virus software mitigates much of the pain anyway. Beware
the slippery road of "graceful degradation"...) I applaud Ubuntu's
effort in creating their "System-&gt;Preferences" and
"System-&gt;Administration" menus - but it's not enough. That UI - here's
that issue again! - needs a lot of improvement, and a lot more polish.
Perhaps giving it a look and feel that's similar to the Windows Control
Panel (which, in turn, looks similar to their file manager interface...
that's pretty good UI design, there) would be helpful.
</p>

<p>
4) As a competitive issue, there aren't enough Linux programs yet. Yeah,
sure, $BLAH thousands of programs... not nearly enough. Windows has
<em>millions</em> of programs that have been written for it, filling nearly
every niche, including lots of free apps. Many of them are <strong>really</strong>
good. With Linux, once you get away from the mainstream, you're mostly
out of luck. E.g., as a sailor, if I want a good charting and navigation
program, I have... um... well, there's 7Seas ENC (proprietary app, very
rough UI, badly thought-out) and OpenCPN (<a href='http://www.opencpn.org/'>http://www.opencpn.org/</a>).
There used to be 'xmap' - proprietary and longer supported. That's about
it. If you compare them to one of the many, many available Windows apps
- "The Cap'n", "SeaClear", "Fugawi", the excellent "MaxSea", or the
highly-professional "Tsunami"... well, there's really no comparison.
Niche business apps, like - say - restaurant POS software, medical
practice or childcare center management? Not happening under Linux
(although some people are working at it, and might have a usable product
in the next few years.) Not to knock the efforts of the people who are
writing the Linux apps - I'm really, truly grateful for their efforts -
but there's just a much larger software universe for Windows, and Linux
hasn't caught up yet.  This one will take some years - and, in my
opinion, this is where the real battleground lies.
</p>

<p>
The average user knows nothing (and cares less) about licenses,
philosophies, and larger ideas/issues behind Linux; most of them have
"free" (illegal/stolen) copies of Windows, so cost isn't a real issue
for them. What they do care about is getting what they want, with
minimum effort and minimum time investment.  In most cases, for most
users, Linux supplies that at least as well as - and sometimes better
than - other OSes. In some situations, it's not quite there yet.

Ben has reacted just the way many of us (including me) would react. It
is very easy and tempting to start comparing with MS-doze (but why
should we compare apples with oranges or bananas ?). I am trying to
make an objective study, believe me. I will also make many of my study
parameters visible soon (in LG itself deo volento). Let me get all
your views and suggestions till then. We have just started an
introspection. And maybe we will come out with some concrete
suggestions to make Linux more acceptable.
</p>

<p>
I would also like to know if anyone has made a scientific, unbiased
study of this aspect.
</p>

<p>
//** the strongest bias that I see is your belief that Linux has

</p>

<p>
Agreed, this was a provocative statement, but it is not completely
wrong (or biased). How else do we explain the slow acceptance of this
technology ? How do we explain the huge amount of queries we get on
the TAG forum itself ?

&gt;
&gt; 2) The Linux methodology for program installation is a wonderful thing
&gt; (especially when compared with the "infectious diseases ward"
&gt; environment of Windows software installation); however, it <strong>is</strong>
&gt; different. As such, it needs to be made more explicit and more obvious
&gt; to the new Linux user. Fortunately, this wouldn't take much: in my
&gt; opinion, an "Install New Software" icon on every freshly-installed
&gt; desktop would do a great job of pinging a user's interest and making it
&gt; obvious. Also, working to make that installation interface as intuitive
&gt; as possible - it's pretty good now, but could be improved - would be a
&gt; good idea.
&gt;
&gt; 3) System administration. This is a rather technical issue under Linux,
&gt; and is usually blown off with "oh, just go to the Ubuntu forums -
&gt; they'll explain everything!" THE AVERAGE USER IS NOT GOING TO DO THAT.
&gt; They'd rather go back to their comforting - albeit infected - Windows
&gt; world (spyware and viruses don't <strong>usually</strong> wipe out a computer these
&gt; days, and anti-virus software mitigates much of the pain anyway. Beware
&gt; the slippery road of "graceful degradation"...) I applaud Ubuntu's
&gt; effort in creating their "System-&gt;Preferences" and
&gt; "System-&gt;Administration" menus - but it's not enough. That UI - here's
&gt; that issue again! - needs a lot of improvement, and a lot more polish.
&gt; Perhaps giving it a look and feel that's similar to the Windows Control
&gt; Panel (which, in turn, looks similar to their file manager interface...
&gt; that's pretty good UI design, there) would be helpful.
&gt;
&gt; 4) As a competitive issue, there aren't enough Linux programs yet. Yeah,
&gt; sure, $BLAH thousands of programs... not nearly enough. Windows has
&gt; <em>millions</em> of programs that have been written for it, filling nearly
&gt; every niche, including lots of free apps. Many of them are <strong>really</strong>
&gt; good. With Linux, once you get away from the mainstream, you're mostly
&gt; out of luck. E.g., as a sailor, if I want a good charting and navigation
&gt; program, I have... um... well, there's 7Seas ENC (proprietary app, very
&gt; rough UI, badly thought-out) and OpenCPN (<a href='http://www.opencpn.org/'>http://www.opencpn.org/</a>).
&gt; There used to be 'xmap' - proprietary and longer supported. That's about
&gt; it. If you compare them to one of the many, many available Windows apps
&gt; - "The Cap'n", "SeaClear", "Fugawi", the excellent "MaxSea", or the
&gt; highly-professional "Tsunami"... well, there's really no comparison.
&gt; Niche business apps, like - say - restaurant POS software, medical
&gt; practice or childcare center management? Not happening under Linux
&gt; (although some people are working at it, and might have a usable product
&gt; in the next few years.) Not to knock the efforts of the people who are
&gt; writing the Linux apps - I'm really, truly grateful for their efforts -
&gt; but there's just a much larger software universe for Windows, and Linux
&gt; hasn't caught up yet.  This one will take some years - and, in my
&gt; opinion, this is where the real battleground lies.
&gt;
&gt; The average user knows nothing (and cares less) about licenses,
&gt; philosophies, and larger ideas/issues behind Linux; most of them have
&gt; "free" (illegal/stolen) copies of Windows, so cost isn't a real issue
&gt; for them. What they do care about is getting what they want, with
&gt; minimum effort and minimum time investment.  In most cases, for most
&gt; users, Linux supplies that at least as well as - and sometimes better
&gt; than - other OSes. In some situations, it's not quite there yet.

Most people find change to be painful, and will not do it unless there's
a strong motivation. What motivation is there for people to change to
Linux?
</p>

<p>
1) "But it's free!" - so is Windows, as far as the average user is
concerned. And once they've got it installed, "upgrade" costs don't seem
like too big of a deal compared to the disruption of installing and
learning a complete new OS.
</p>

<p>
2) "But it's Free!" - very few users care. Really. Most people don't
have a well-considered ethical basis; they simply operate from
self-interest, modified by the threat of the law or other external
circumstances. Getting to a larger perspective, or a higher state in
which things like this matter requires either education, much
meditation, or a natural ability to understand that the world isn't just
"me against them."
</p>

<p>
3) "No viruses and fewer crashes!" - yep, that's less painful. But
absence of pain is, again, a motivation that appeals to the thoughtful
and the intelligent (always a small segment of any population);
otherwise, it's not much of a stimulus. Severe pain is, but Microsoft's
main efforts are directed toward mitigating that (rather than fixing
their product in the first place) - and they're quite successful at it.
So, yeah: using Windows is annoying, but only up to a point... and most
people have better things to do with their time than reinstall and learn
a new OS. Seriously.
</p>

<p>
People who install Linux are somewhere in the Venn diagram of the above
motivations, plus a few others (curiosity, geekiness, experience, etc.)
For most people, they simply don't experience enough pain - that being
their tipping point - to cause them to change.
</p>

<p>
[shrug] The *nix environment has always favored the adventurous, the
curious, and the intelligent. Personally, I wouldn't want it to change -
even at the price of faster adoption.

<p>
The "huge" (you think this is huge? I'd characterise TAG as a low

Linux's usability. Nothing. At all.
</p>

<p>
You seem to be making the assumption that the simple fact that there
are queries to be made is somehow anomalous: it's not - there are
thousands of forums for Windows users out there, all full of
questions.

<p>
One thing i see is alot of people still have the old belief that 
'you get what you pay for' and wont use anything that doesnt have a cost
attached to obtaining it. I used to pick up computers that people would
throw out, and refurb them and then sell them, it would seem that people
who knew where they came from would not want them at any price (if
someone threw it out it must be bad). But if i said i recieved them from
a person who recycles them for refurbishing, they were fine (two
different ways of saying the same thing) 
</p>

<p>
This is a BIG obstacle in getting wider adoption...

&gt;technology ?
</pre>

<p>
Um, Beta vs VHS? IBM vs computer companies? Healthy food vs junk food?
</p>

<p>
Your original post said:
</p>

<p>
	In spite of all claims and evidence regarding the superiority
	of Linux, one aspect of Linux remains to be its major weakness
	-- usability. This may be the reason for its slow acceptance
	by the not-so-geeky user community.
</p>


<p>
Perhaps the first question you need to address is, um, the question. I
am tempted to restate what you seem to be saying in light of
subsequent posts:
</p>

<p>
	In spite of all claims and evidence regarding the superiority
	of Linux, one aspect of Linux remains -- slow acceptance by
	the not-so-geeky user community.
</p>

<p>
	Can this be explained by usability?
</p>


<p>
The first sentence will probably find few objections. 
</p>

<p>
Some would argue that slow acceptance by the not-so-geeky user
community is an advantage (for the rest of us). It's probably worth
investigating that proposition. How are we advantaged by having
not-so-geeky users adopt Linux? Unless one is committed to
proselytising, what's to be gained?
</p>

<p>
Don't provide user-friendly interfaces; let's aim for
user-antagonistic!
</p>

<p>
I can understand that we need enough like-minded devotees. But why do
we seek to convert people against their will?
</p>

<p>
Let me put this another way. I get countless jokes by email (we all
do). Almost invariably I am encouraged to "pass it on". Why? What is
there about this technology that makes people do that? (Indeed, is it
the technology?) People also tell me jokes. Never once has someone
said, "That was a great joke, wasn't it? Make sure you tell everyone
you meet?"
</p>

<p>
Why? Why is it different? If someone tells me a great joke, they don't
need to encourage me to tell someone else. Try to stop me. And if the
joke is a fizzer, why would I repeat it - by mouth or by email?
</p>


<p>
Usability.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps usability, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. I'm
with Ben on this. Whenever I go near a Microsoft system, I find it
really difficult to do the simplest things (which I want to do). It's
as if a fog of mediocrity and stupidity envelopes me and lowers my IQ.
</p>

<p>
Macs look good, but they are not for me. I'm sure if I wanted to do
the things that Macs excel at, I'd probably be impressed with a Mac.
But I don't and I'm not.
</p>

<p>
I happen to like the command line. All I want from a computer is an
xterm. Well, lots of xterms. But, hey, I'm unusual and I know it. I
don't play games which interact in real time. (I play two sorts of
Solitaire.) I read my mail with "less" in an xterm. I edit with emacs in
an xterm (NOT xemacs). Whenever I can, I browse with lynx. In an xterm.
</p>

<p>
I often use Firefox, but that's pretty much the same across platforms.
I avoid Word and Excel and such. But I admit, occasionally I'm forced
to go there. If someone sends me a Word document, I use "antiword" and
"less" to read it in an xterm.
</p>

<p>
But my way of doing things does not suit others. I understand that. I
would like to be allowed to continue doing things my way. I'm prepared
to let others do things their way - even if it means they inflict
Microsoft products on themselves.
</p>

<p>
Areas of usability.
</p>

<p>
If you want to talk about Linux Usability, there are areas that I
would suggest, but I suspect that these are not the areas that you are
interested in because they certainly would not interest the
not-so-geeky user community. Hell, they wouldn't even understand the
issues.
</p>

<p>
I've been thinking about these recently, hoping to put together an
article for LG: 10 Things I Hate About Linux. Here's a couple, just to
give you the flavour. 
</p>

<p>
Dynamic libraries. From what I can see Microsoft actually has a better
story here. I want to install Product X. I try the latest rev of
Product X and decide that it has gone downhill (probably in an attempt
to appeal to the not-so-geeky user community). But, I've still got my
Fedora Core 2 on one of my computers, and I love the version that was
there. So I try to run it. But it won't run because whatever distro I
have now (in that case it was FC5 - a long time ago!) doesn't have the
old revs of the libraries. Or something:
</p>

<p>
	/FC2/usr/bin/sol
	ERROR: Unbound variable: set-feature-word!
</p>

<p>
It would suit me better if I could get statically linked versions of
software. Then it should work from one distro to the next.
</p>


<p>
Incompatible upgrades. My editor is emacs. I wanted to add spelling
checking, so I set up a mechanism which used aspell. (My memory of the
details may be a little hazy). When I switched from FC2 to FC5, I
discovered that my spell-checker wasn't working. It turned out that
between one rev of aspell and another, one of the switches had been
changed to mean something else. Like the world is running out of
letter combinations.
</p>

<p>
The GNU people have a lot to answer for. They are extremely
disrespectful of compatibility. With EVERY new rev of emacs there is a
learning curve as one incompatible new feature or another is
introduced. Is it really so hard to arrange for a piece of software to
continue to operate as it has in the past? Can new features not be put
under switches or config files? 
</p>

<p>
Can the assumption that different is better really go unchallenged?
</p>


<p>
The not-so-geeky user community.
</p>


<p>
Finally (every body breathes a sigh of relief), I have a question
which I think is even more compelling. What explains the non-adoption
of Linux by the really geeky user community?
</p>

<p>
I have a circle of colleagues, a group who attend a Wednesday lunch
Algonquin. They are all competent geeky Linux (or Unix) users. They
all spend as much time as I do bagging Microsoft. Not one uses Linux
on his home desktop, and most don't on their work desktops. They all
use Microsoft.
</p>

<p>
It might be worth asking the LG user community: who runs Linux (or
some sort of *nix) on their desktop? I must confess that this is being
written on FreeBSD 8.0-RELEASE.
</p>

<p>
If you can't get the converts to go to your house of worship, why
would you expect passing infidels to be the least bit interested?

&gt; Can the assumption that different is better really go unchallenged?
</pre>

<p>
Oh boy, don't get me started.  In earlier versions of Linux, dynamic
libraries other than the core glibc followed a simple convention.  The
library name (soname) was simply [library].so.majorversion.minorversion;
A symbolic link for [library].so.majorversion, and [library].so ensured
that an application linked against a majorversion would always work
regardless of minorversion.  Binary interface compatibility was assured,
since interface changes only happened at the majorversion level.
</p>

<p>
Today, after so many years, and so many incompatible interface changes
to the core glibc, we are up to major version libc.so.6.  We should have
been at libc.so.36 if the glibc folks understood the first thing about
unix DLL versioning!  Instead, there's a whole new versioning system
built into the ld.so dynamic linker itself, resulting in silly messages
like "this application requires at least version xxx of the C library".
</p>

<p>
In other words, we currently have several incompatible versions of
libc.so.6.
</p>

<p>
Then there's C++, the fact that it is impossible to do C++ exceptions in
a statically linked C++ library (if the app does exceptions too), the
fact that with every version of C++, they decide to change the name
mangling algorithm which makes binary compatibility impossible, and the
fact that Theodore Tso (God bless him) has been tasked to come up with
an entirely new ABI versioning for 
C++.
</p>

<p>
Change just because different is better?  What about standards?
Consistency?  Maintainability and compatibility?  Decisions are made to
depracate tranches of the standard C library, just because someone
decides that strncpy is less safe than memcpy.  My question is: who got
to decide that?  the ANSI group?  It was their standard to begin with.
</p>

<p>
No.  Change is bad when it is done with the sole purpose of being
different.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Finally (every body breathes a sigh of relief), I have a question
&gt; which I think is even more compelling. What explains the non-adoption
&gt; of Linux by the really geeky user community?
</pre>

<p>
I believe you have answered that yourself.  The ethos of Linux has
changed.  Change is not necessarily bad, but then it is not necessarily
good either.  Lately, everyone seems excited about how close Ubuntu is
to running X as non-root.  Fancy that.  In 1986, I could do that by
typing 'startx' from my user session.  Ooooh! I can pop a CD in my drive
and see it without having to type 'mount -t iso /mnt /dev/cdrom'- well,
as for myself, the changing quagmire that is DEVFS and DBUS has given me
nothing but trouble.  I am sure a standard out the box Ubuntu or Redhat
would work perfectly, but why can I no longer build and maintain my own
system as easily as I once could?  
</p>

<p>
All the improvements to the 'GNU' part of Linux, introduce more and more
complexity, making it harder to maintain something which used to be
simple.  When a complex part of the whole is altered or deprecated, the
house of cards comes tumbling down.  Why would a geek adopt something
like that, unless he is a sucker for punishment?

That's not a Linux problem, that's the nature of shared libraries. If
you want to use out-of-date software, you have to use out-of-date
libraries - same on Linux, same on Windows, same on Mac OS X...

&gt; It would suit me better if I could get statically linked versions of
&gt; software. Then it should work from one distro to the next.
&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Then statically link everything you use. At least with open source,
you get that option.
</p>

<p>
Everything else you have to say falls under the same category. If
you're so averse to change, then don't upgrade. Or learn to make your
complaints a little more constructive, and direct them to the right
places. When a vocal subsection of the users of a piece of software
complain about something -- like 'the name of this switch is
misleading' -- <strong>and</strong>, when the developers ask 'does anybody use this?
will this break things?' and they get no response, then I think
they're justified in making an incompatible change. Which is what I
would guess happened with aspell.

&gt; Having used Linux for well over a decade now, my subjective opinion is

<p>
Since these are not only cooks but writers of recipe books, you are
free to (may the source be with you!) cook things your own way. Less
metaphorically, both Fedora and Debian provide source packages and
rather easy ways to create clean build environments to build these
source packages after making your own modifications.

It is easier today than it was once, since computers are faster today
than they were yesterday. (Not the same computers obviously!)
</p>

<p>
In general, you <em>can</em> build it. If you choose not to build it and use
pre-built binaries that "just work" then you will have to live with
the choices made by the people who built the binaries. In Debian,
(and I believe in Fedora as well) the reasons for these choices are
generally well documented.
</p>

<p>
To come back to the original question, the "low usability of Linux"
meme that has been around for a long while, is slowly losing ground in
a number of different ways. At the same time we need to stay sharp
to ensure that gains are not made at the expense of core values like
tinker/tune-ability ... and of course the "command-line interface".

In an earlier mail, Mr. Kapil H Paranajpe had commented as follows ::
</p>

<p>
//** "Usability for whom?" is a question whose answer it is important to
establish before going too far.
</p>

<p>
At the very least you need to address two classes of users:
</p>

<p>
 1. Those who have used computers before (usually this means Windows
 but it could sometimes mean MacOS as well).
</p>

<p>
 2. Those who are using computers for the first time. **//
</p>

<p>
YES I agree with him. There is one more dimension to what he said --
usability is also related to what one does with Linux :: sysadmin, s/w
development, office use, teach/train, distro. etc.
</p>

<p>
I stumbled on an ISO (9241 - 11) defintion of usability::
QUOTE  Usability: the extent to which a product can be used by
specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness,
efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use. UNQUOTE
</p>

<p>
The terms "specified user" and "specified context of use" map
respectively to the two aspects which Mr. Paranjape has exposed. Thank
you Sir.
</p>

<p>
I am also thankful to the TAG/LG community which has given me (and
continues to give me) so much copius amounts of opinions and ideas, on
a subject which is so dear to me.
</p>

<p>
To be able to take out the maximum of this discussion, and propagate
it to all others, I have set up a web page specifically for this::

I will enrich the page as an when I consolidate something sustantial.

Hello everyone,
</p>

<p>
'Linusability', this term reminds me of  the time when I shifted to linux.
Linux puts computer in <em>absolute</em> control of user and thats Linusability.
</p>

<p>
Would you like make a radio transmitter on your own or may be you
would like to have FM jammer for particularly noisy neighbours. Did I
hear someone say that you want your own OS, Linux is the answer my dear friend.
</p>

<p>
Linux, a kernel that can make a DJ night rock or make a space mission
successful or help SETI to find an extraterrestrials or make internet tick.
</p>

<p>
Linux has almost no limit as far as technical usability is concerned
but when we talk in terms of user base the story is a bit different.
Homo Sapiens by their very nature are slackers(no offence anyone!).
User base is more the problem of psyche of human beings than usability
of Linux. OS like  windows virtually dictate them what to do next to
get a task done....
 'Sir, please accept license terms or I wont install' or 'Sir, please
pay my maker a sum of XXX or I will format your entire HDD', well
maybe not that explicit requests, but the point is you dont have to
stress your brain cells to get things done.
As far as Linux is concerned its you who tell the system what to do next.
</p>

<p>
There is just 1 little thing which is as much as opportunity as a
problem, the number of 3rd party applications doesn't have as much
variety as windows has to offer (If I am not wrong this point has been
highlighted by Ben too.) This is opportunity for people like me to use
the freedom linux offers and make the software I need. This might not
sound a good idea to most of us but then someone has to take the
initiative.
</p>

<p>
'And how do you account for other flaws in linux', you say.
Every operating system has flaws, but the plus point with linux is
that you are always welcome to come ahead and work it out besides
other developers are always (well, almost always!!) on your side.
</p>

<p>
Thats Linusability for me.
Cheers to Linux for the way it is!!
</p>

<p>
regards
ernest104

&gt; I get countless jokes by email (we all
&gt; do). Almost invariably I am encouraged to "pass it on". Why? What is
&gt; there about this technology that makes people do that? (Indeed, is it
&gt; the technology?)
</pre>

<p>
Thomas Edison's biography describes a time when he was a telegraph
operator; it seems that operators all across the country would collect
jokes and forward them to the big facility in Philadelphia, which would
then "spread the joy" to everyone at the slowest time of the day. When I
read that, I found it both amusing and somewhat jarring. "Plus ?a
change", etc... It appears that the reason - or at least the capability
- is indeed an effect of technology.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Perhaps usability, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. I'm
&gt; with Ben on this. Whenever I go near a Microsoft system, I find it
&gt; really difficult to do the simplest things (which I want to do). It's
&gt; as if a fog of mediocrity and stupidity envelopes me and lowers my IQ.
</pre>

<p>
Right on the dot. It's as if there was a "YOU MUST BE BELOW <strong>THIS</strong>
MENTAL HEIGHT TO ENTER" sign beside the Microsoft doorway - and the
level of that portcullis is too low for me to crawl under.
</p>

<p>
I don't normally knock their products; "live and let live" is my
preferred approach to this. But after having had to use the stuff a
little while ago, I'm still quite annoyed.

I was a bit lost when I read that, too. I gather that Henry hasn't spent
a whole lot of time sussing out and dealing with the "DLL Hell" on the
MS side. Trust me on this one... you <strong>really</strong> would not want to trade
the Linux version for the Microsoft one.

&gt; 
&gt; One thing i see is alot of people still have the old belief that 
&gt; 'you get what you pay for' and wont use anything that doesnt have a cost
&gt; attached to obtaining it.
</pre>

<p>
There's an ancient Japanese proverb that states "the reverse side also
has a reverse side." People make cost-based assessments because most of
them don't have enough knowledge to make value-based ones (this is not
surprising; everyone can't be an expert in everything.)
</p>

<p>
Given that this is true, fighting that mindset isn't going to win you
any friends - and might garner you some enemies. Instead, it might make
sense to attach a small cost to the help you provide. E.g., offer to
help them install Linux if they invite you to dinner - or at least do
<em>something</em> for you, as an explicit "tit for tat" exchange. This would
definitely establish you, and Linux, as valuable resources.
</p>

<p>
Frankly, eagerly offering to install Linux for people puts them on the
defensive ("what does this person <strong>really</strong> want?") and gives the whole
interaction a slightly creepy flavor; in fact, I think it establishes a
small but definite <em>negative</em> perception of its value. If, instead, you
treat it the way you would approaching a MOTAS, it would fit into the
average person's worldview a lot more smoothly - and the result would be
a greater appreciation of the value of your time and of Linux.
</p>

<p>
Here, let's try a thought experiment:
</p>

<p>
The Anatomy of a Linux Seduction
</p>

<p>
--------------------------------
</p>

<p>
FWU (Frustrated Windows User): Blah, blah, viruses/spyware/crashes/
	headaches/expense, blah, blah....
</p>

<p>
MLG (Masterful Linux Geek): Wow, that's really raw. I run Linux, so I
	don't have to deal with any of that, but - ah feel ya pain, brother.
</p>

<p>
FWU: Um... isn't Linux, like, all techno-geeky and stuff?
</p>

<p>
MLG: Nah, that's just a story we spread to keep clueless people away.
	You know how exclusive clubs have an initiation fee, etc., but once
	you're in, you're on Easy Street? Well, with Linux, it helps if you
	bribe a Masterful Linux Geek like me and get him to help you install
	it the first time; it's the same deal. But it'll probably cost you.
</p>

<p>
[PAUSE]
</p>

<p>
	On the other hand... didn't you say you were Italian, and your
	grandma did all the cooking in your house? I just <strong>might</strong>
	be susceptible to a really amazing Veal Piccata and Tiramisu.
</p>

<p>
FWU: Uh... actually, that's what we were going to have, um, Thursday!
	You wanna come over for dinner?
</p>


<p>
That's not how the typical interaction goes, though. In fact, it's a lot
like the average teenager's first seduction attempt - and ultimately,
just about as effective. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I used to pick up computers that people would
&gt; throw out, and refurb them and then sell them, it would seem that people
&gt; who knew where they came from would not want them at any price (if
&gt; someone threw it out it must be bad). But if i said i recieved them from
&gt; a person who recycles them for refurbishing, they were fine (two
&gt; different ways of saying the same thing) 
</pre>

<p>
Not exactly. In one case, you were giving them someone else's garbage;
in the other, they were being financially wise and ecologically savvy.
</p>

<p>
The difference here isn't mechanical, or technical; it's social and
psychological. From the former perspective, the two approaches are
completely equivalent; from the latter, they're worlds apart. I'm
actually coming to have a much sharper appreciation of that distinction
these days, for a variety of reasons.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; i have lurked (and posted occasionally) for years, and while i am vested
&gt; this far, i just want to say, Ben, excellent job these years in doing
&gt; this project with the diligence and perseverance, with an eye on detail
&gt; etc. 
</pre>
 
Thanks, Sloopy - much appreciated! A lot of the credit goes to our
proofreaders and technical editors - Ren&eacute; Pfeiffer and Aioanei Rares
have been doing a stellar job in the recent few months - as well as all
the folks in The Answer Gang. Without all of us pulling together,
LG would evaporate like the morning dew.
