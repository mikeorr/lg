<blockquote>I've been trying to get <EM>more</EM> metal into my head, so I'm the wrong
person to ask. I had a two day hangover after Easter Sunday (woke up
in the home of my Polish friends, joined them for a traditional
Polish Easter breakfast (which happened to include a bottle of vodka
and a bottle of tequila), slept through the rest of the day, woke up
thinking it was still Saturday. Y'know, the usual) where all I could
do was play guitar. Out of the 16 or 17 more or less completed songs
I came up with, only 4 or 5 passed the quality control process
before being presented to my band (my next "Songs..." article will
have some of the details), but the thing that's really irking me
is that every time I try to finish off one of these metal songs, I
end up getting delicate acoustic music that'll never be played.

Jean-Michel Jarre??? Oh, well. There was some small chance of recovery
up until you did that, but now... it's not even worth attempting. Heavy
metal locked in by J-MJ is a self-replicating meme that results in an
instantly-fatal case of acne for its host if anyone tries to remove it;
you're permanently stuck. Don't worry, though; we'll keep AC/DC, some
'70s hair bands, etc., piped into your room at the asylum, and you'll be
able to lead some approximation of a normal life.

I went to my first computer conference at the New York Hilton about 20
years ago. When somebody there predicted the market for microprocessors
would eventually be in the millions, someone else said, "Where are they
all going to go? It's not like you need a computer in every doorknob!"
Years later, I went back to the same hotel. I noticed the room keys had
been replaced by electronic cards you slide into slots in the doors.
There was a computer in every doorknob.

Interesting birthday rituals you have, Mike. Most people just light some
candles and have a bit of cake, but to each his own, I guess.  BTW, when
is your birthday? I've got a pair of perfectly good wooden oars, about 4
feet long and 10 lbs. apiece, that are just going to waste for lack of

But check out the spy games Ben installed on the computer in the TAG

running away from a crime scene near Jimmy's house, and Jimmy puts his

The fact that Nigeria has a House and Senate like the US sounded suspicious, since
few other countries do, so I checked the president's name and government structure
against the CIA World Factbook

They seem to be correct, surprise, although of course maybe the spammer himself read
the Factbook entry and based his letter on it.

Now, why is the President of Nigeria sending an official e-mail from a Brazilian
address and asking people to contact an agent in Italy.  Does Nigeria not have a
working e-mail system?  Oh, of course it does, that's where the previous 419 scams
came from.

<blockquote>Basically, Ireland has a House of Representatives and a Senate, except they are

countries have modeled their system of government on America's (in Ireland's

Pity he decided to "improve" on the rights granted by the American Contitution
though -- rather than free speech and freedom of the press, we're only free
as long as the powers that be think we're being "decent" (porn was illegal
here when I was a pre-teen -- even things like Playboy were against the law),

constitution to be changed to even grant women the right to travel abroad for

<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"

Well, that depends on a couple things. There's nothing left of Social
Security right now. It takes money from young people, and gives it to
old people. There's no money in the system. Oh, sure, there's a "trust
fund", but as I understand it, nearly all of it is "loaned" to other
government programs. That is, we've spend the money, and we've promised
ourselves we're going to make up for it later. Given the spending habits
of the government, how much you wanna bet we ever get around to it?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I don't think the Social Security program as we know it can continue for
long. It's a bugger to deal with. On the one hand, I don't think the
government should really be moving money around in that way. It's the
responsibility of the individual.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
But on the other hand, we've said "No worries, we'll always be there for
you with this bit of money every month." We were, of course, lying for
political expediency. It's obvious the whole thing is going under and
was flawed from the start. But that doesn't matter now. We've got the
program, whether we like it or not.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
So, the question is, how do you faze it out while still being fair to
everyone? The answer is: You can't. You can rip off seniors by cutting
off "benefits" or you can rip off young people by having them pay in and
receive nothing back. There's no nice way out now. The thing was a
pyramid scheme from the start: Somebody's got to lose.

When you're used to "pudding" as a smooth silky sweet dessert, and then
you're all excited coz there's pudding on the menu, and then you get it
and it's this bread thing, it's a real disappointment.  That happened
when I was seven and I've been traumatized ever since.

Hahahahaha.  Sorry, I shouldn't laugh.  Hehehehehehehe.  Ordinarily, a
"pudding" is a sweet-dish, yes.  There's also "steak and kidney pudding"
-- the "pudding" part made from suet [1]. But that's savoury.  You
should try and look at a Yorkshire pudding in a new light -- cumberland
sausages [2] in a huge yorkshire pudding with onion gravy, is divine.
Mmmmmmm.  It's a typical English dish, for sure.

<blockquote><pre> Pouding de pain (mind the spelling)

 /Do not believe this word is from an English origin, it's actually
  French. The British adopted it one day and gave it its current
  spelling, 'pudding'.
  This bread pouding, similar to some other European recipes, was once a
  tasteful way not to lose remains of stale bread; it often used to feed
  little hungers at tea-time.
  At the time when the bread pouding was a family habit, the stale bread
  remains that were used were from good, old-fashioned bread; pouding
  made of modern bread is very likely to give disappointing results,
  unless one chooses so-called artisanal "country" bread./

   Raisins: 100g                            Fresh eggs: 4
   Amber rhum: 100cc                        Salt (optional): 1 pinch
   Stale country bread: 500g                Butter: 25g (for the mold)
   Cinnamon: according to taste             Ice sugar: plenty
   Sugar: 100g                              Milk: 250cc

 - Rinse the raisins quickly, remove the possibly remaining little
   tails; put the raisins in a bowl, add the rhum and let soak.
 - Break the stale bread into pieces. Put these in a salad bowl,
   sprinkle them with the milk until they fully absorb it; let soak.
 - Preheat the oven (180&deg;C).
 - Dry the bread with one's fingers to remove the excess of milk; crush
   it with a fork. One should obtain evenly sized chunks, not too big
   but not a pulp either. Add the desired quantity of cinnamon, the
   sugar, the beaten eggs. Taste and correct with the salt if
   needed. Add the soaked raisins, as well as their excess juice.
 - Pour into a buttered mold, flatten the surface. Put in the oven.
   Cook for 30 minutes (use this time to re-read a few chapters from
   http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin22/guide.html, for example). Check
   with a knife: the blade must remain dry when the cooking is over.

sheep, etc., stuffed with minced meat, suet, seasoning, boiled and kept till

Westphalian dial. puddek "lump, pudding," Low Ger. pudde-wurst "black pudding,"
Eng. dial. pod "belly," also cf. pudgy). Other possibility is that it is from
O.Fr. boudin "sausage," from V.L. *botellinus, from L. botellus "sausage"
(change of Fr. b- to Eng. p- presents difficulties, but cf. purse). The modern
sense had emerged by 1670, from extension to other foods boiled or steamed in a
bag or sack. Ger. pudding, Fr. pouding, Swed. pudding, Ir. putog are from Eng.

I don't believe that the etymology of "pouding" can be traced back in French
further than the English, although I'm willing to be caught out on this, as
medieval French is not my bailiwick.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
One can trace a possible "boudin --&gt; pouding" explanation, but "boudin"
definitely means sausage in French, while "pouding" is a rice pudding/bread
pudding concoction.  In English "pudding" applies across the board from "black
pudding" (clearly boudin noir) to the generic (non-American) "pudding ==
dessert in general unless otherwise modified" usage.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The English usage of "pudding" to mean dessert makes sense in that the original
versions were all boiled puddings, whether savory or sweet.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Are the French not using "pain perdu" as a term anymore?  This is the term used
in English language cookbooks for what's known in the U.S. as "bread pudding",
and previously as "poor knights".  There is a version known as "bread and
butter pudding" as well, which is similar.

It's still not fully passed yet.  The commission have approved it, but it

Sounds like the sports stadium syndrome.  The team owners (billionaires)
want the public to pay for a new stadium.  The public votes it down --
twice -- but the city or state rams it through anyway citing "emergency
economic necessity".  This happened twice in my state, and now a third
team is saying, "Hey, you did it for the other two, now it's my turn."

It would appear that today's events were as a result of 'process'.  From
what I've read the Danish minister could have lodged a request that the
item be removed from the A list, instead of asking for it to be converted
to the B list.  Had he done the former the Luxembourg Council Presidency
would have had to agree, but because he chose the latter they could
decline the request (and it has also been suggested that this was his
intent, having been forced by a Danish Parliamentary Committee to try and
have it removed).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Anyone who lives in a European country and cares about the software
patents issue should now be writing to their MEP explaining why they
should be voting NO for this when it comes before the EU Parliament
(which is likely to be sooner rather than later).

I only hope that you're right and I'm wrong.  I know that there is
considerable discontent among the MEP for the way that their votes have
been trampled, but I'm not sure that's enough.  Maybe they'll get
thoroughly disgusted and react effectively.
</blockQuote>

Some say that the existance of the EP serves more to provide the illusion
of a democratic process and that their vote is not really meant to be
deterministic.  Again, I hope it proves not be the case, but the whole

EU law.  Whole books have been written on the subject, and yet no one
really understands it.  My own idea of it, is that because we are a
member of the EU, we have MEPs (which represent us in the EU).  EU law
rules over any specific laws each respective country might have.  So in
that way, it can be fairly dangerous...

As I understand it, there are two main institutions, the European
Commission, which is made up of unelected officials from the various
member nations, and the European Parliament, which is made up of
representatives voted for by 27% percent or so of EU citizens, those who
could be bothered to express a preference.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
However, the Commission seems to have more power than the Parliament, a
problem that the European Constitution is supposed to go some way in
rectifying.

subject.

Thanks for your message. Following yesterday's decision in the
Competitiveness Council, the EP has requested that the Commission make a
statement to the EP Plenary tomorrow in Strasbourg at 6.00pm. MEPs are
awaiting with considerable interest to see what the Commission has to
say but it's important to remember that the EP has the right to retable
any of its first reading amendments not taken up in the Council's common
position, which the EP has yet to see, or to reject the common position
in its entirity. If Council still refuses to accept them, a
'conciliation committee' of MEPs and national civil servants will meet
to reach a compromise. If none is found, the proposal falls. The
important point is that the Ministers do not take the final decision on
this issue - they must work with the EP.

There was a book I read when I was little about a boy who met a Martian
who had a spaceship disguised as a car.  It was the intersection of two
technologies: (1) the spaceship walls couldn't be seen except with special
glasses, and (2) you could fold the car up and put it in your pocket.  Now
that's compressibilty.  I've often thought about how that would solve the
problem of parking spaces....

Actually, in my mid-teen years, I "invented" an inflatable car that
would go a long way toward that scenario.  Seriously. Did the research,
found out what it would take... looking back at it today, it's still
quite a reasonable proposition. It was an ACV, of course; tapped the
engine output to inflate and deflate (via a tiny two-chamber extraction
pump) the passenger compartment. You could stack these things, deflated,
on top of each other, in your garage or whatever.  Steered via a
joystick, <EM>way</EM> safer than a regular case in case of an accident... very
simple design, but - alas, I've never had the cred in that world or the

No special options were passed to either compressor, so this is the
defaults. I'm currently compressing a terabyte of nothing with bzip2.
This will probably take a couple days, so I'll report back my findings.
As if anybody cares.

Oh, I do! I'd really appreciate it if you'd send me a copy. Something
about the idea of this very tightly-coiled 500-mile-long spring (ready
to explode into a tangled mess of metal spaghetti if you poke it)

bzip2'd:

Again, it looks like two passes is the optimal for bzip2 when dealing
with weird data like this. I didn't try gziping because the resulting
file would be about a gig, but it occurs to me I could do two-pass
compression on the fly:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>~/prog/compression$ dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=1048576 | gzip | gzip &gt; terabyte.gz.gz
</pre></blockquote>

...so I'll have some figures on gziped data soon.

Anyway, since you request it, I'll send you a copy of it.
terabyte.bz2.bz2 is so small I'm tempted to attach it to this email, but
I'm afraid that someone on this list might have some sort of AV setup

Both of the servers, of course, have a minimal tool set (just enough to
accomplish the job they need to do) so that Mr. Cracker has nothing to
work with if he should get that far... so cracking the outside router
AND root on the servers that have a public "face" leaves him essentially
where he was before he started - or worse. Better yet, use Kapil's
"transparent FS" idea: the reads go through to the FS, but the writes to
everything except, e.g., the mail spool and the logs go off to

[bows] Thannnk you; Kapil's got the wheels spinning in my head on this
topic, although I have no time to fiddle with it for now. Sure, it's
security through obscurity... but face it, how many crackers would even
have the slightest clue? And what could they do about it if they did,
given that the tools are either missing or are sitting on the far side
of the chroot jail? It's kinda like using 'chattr' on certain key files
and then taking 'chattr' with you when you go away - only with more
hair, teeth, and muscles.

Still for the querent I think the best is to to decouple the
gui-mailer and the filtering to avoid long waits and hangs. Then
spamd/spamc should do nicely even on a rather meager system. I did not

CPU spikes.

[Nod] That's my experience as well. It seems to me that anytime you can
use an "older", console-based Unix utility or an older, time-tested
daemon, you're better off in terms of resiliency and broader
capabilities; certainly in regard to the range of things that can be
handled without bogging the system.

The flight  attendent was persistant, but the blonde replied, "No, I want to sit here, I've always wanted to see what it is like in  first class." The flight attendent was getting frustrated. Finally, after quite some time, she convinced her to move.  Another passenger who had witnessed the exchange asked the attendent, "How did you get her to move?" The flight attendent  replied, "I told her first class doesn't stop in Detroit."

John and Marsha decided that the only way to pull off a Sunday afternoon quickie with their ten-year-old son in the  apartment was to send him out on the balcony and tell him to report on all the neighborhood activities. He began his  commentary as his parents put their plan into operation. "There's a car being towed from the parking lot," he said. A few  moments passed. "An ambulance just drove by." A few more moments passed. "Looks like the Andersons have company," he called  out. "Matt's riding a new bike." "The Coopers are having sex." Mom and Dad shot up in bed. "How do you know they're having  sex?" "Their kid is standing out on the balcony too."

The man decided to test the robot. He walked out  the bar, turned around, and came back in for another drink. Again, the robot asked him, 'What's your IQ?' The man responded,  '100.' So the robot started talking about football, baseball, and so on. The man thought to himself, 'Wow, this is amazing.'  The man went out and came back in a third time. As before, the robot asked him, 'What's your IQ?' The man replied, '50.' The  robot then said, 'So, you gonna vote for Bush again?'

Every night when I have to get up to go to the bathroom, he  turns on the light for me, and then, when I leave, he turns it back off." The Doctor was astonished. He called the man's  wife and said, "I'd like to speak to you about your husband's connection with God. He claims that every night when he needs  to use the restroom, God turns on the light for him and turns it off for him again when he leaves. Is this true?"

That last is my favorite, for the page title: "We put the F in packet

The correction? Anyplace I wrote DVD-R or DVD-RW, I mean +R or +RW....
the Plus formats have error correction and much better data reliability
than the Minuw formats. I don't use anything else, ever, so I neglected
to think about it. Sigh.

I've always wanted
to implement a witty .sig generator, but don't have the patience to build
the data file.  You're lucky I didn't use cowsay instead (and I was
tempted)

I was curious about this quote in a <A HREF="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</A> article: "~$350,000 (Rs. 1.5
crores)".  Is a crore a multiple of rupees?  Or is this a typo?

I suppose, since the FF 1.0Pre I use handles it - probably because the
installed flashblock extension is preventing it.

Funny "small world" coincidence: we had a discussion on hydrogen powered
cars, etc. here a while ago - and I just got an article submission from
a fellow who works at Ris&oslash;, as the webmaster for their Hydrogen Storage
Group.
