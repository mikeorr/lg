<h2>News in General</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Google's Honeycomb may influence Android 2.4</h3>

<p>
Honeycomb is the new variation of the Android Operating System for tablets,
just announced in February and shipping currently on the Motorola Xoom
tablet.  But a new version of Android will probably be announced at or just
before the Google IO conference in May and it is expected some of the new
features in Honeycomb will migrate to the standard Android phone distro.
</p>

<p>
The newest version of the Android smart phone OS, nicknamed Gingerbread,
Android 2.3,  was announced just before Christmas  It features UI
improvements, better copy and paste selection, and improved power
management.  Android 2.3 better supports VOIP and Internet telephoney by
including a full SIP protocol stack and integrated call management services
so applications  can  set up outgoing and incoming voice calls. Android 2.3
also adds API support for several new sensor types, including gyroscope,
rotation vector, linear acceleration, gravity, and barometer sensors.
</p>

<p>
Honeycomb was announced in February and is designed for bigger, multi-touch
screen and longer user interactions.  It features improved 2D and 3D
graphics, redesigned widgets, improved applications such as Google Maps
that can take advantage of improved hardware and screen size,   Honeycomb
was pre-announced in January when a marketing video for the tablet OS
surfaced on YouTube and referenced Android 3.0:  
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/hPUGNCIozp0&amp;hl=en_US">http://www.youtube.com/v/hPUGNCIozp0&amp;hl=en_US</a>
</p>

<p>
A transition version of Android is expect to bridge the feature gap for
rest of 2011.
</p>

<p>
The developer site developer.android.com lists the Honeycomb features for
tablets as being part of the an upcoming Android 3.0 without a release date
target:
<a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-3.0-highlights.html">http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-3.0-highlights.html</a>
</p>

<p>
According to developer.android.com, Android 3.0 will allow users to "...
connect full keyboards over either USB or Bluetooth, for a familiar
text-input environment. For improved wi-fi connectivity, a new combo scan
reduces scan times across bands and filters. New support for Bluetooth
tethering means that more types of devices can share the network connection
of an Android-powered device."
</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Intel Goes MeeGo</h3>
<p>
At Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Intel made several announcements
regarding the MeeGo open source platform and the industry momentum backing
both MeeGo and Intel Atom processors.
</p>

<p>
According to Intel, since MeeGo was introduced one year ago, the open
source operating system platform has had multiple code releases. MeeGo has
also gained industry momentum with system integrators as well as OEMs and
products are shipping today in multiple form factors including netbooks,
tablet, set-top-boxes and in-vehicle infotainment systems in cars.
</p>

<p>
Intel demonstrated a compelling new MeeGo tablet user experience now
available through the Intel AppUp Developer Program. Intel also released
the MeeGo tablet user experience (UX). It features an intuitive
object-oriented interface with panels displaying content and contacts This
gives consumers fingertip access to social networks, people, videos and
photos.
</p>

<p>
The Intel AppUpSM developer program is expanding to accept apps for
MeeGo-based tablets and netbooks. The program now offers technical
resources, tools and incentives for developers to create, distribute and
sell MeeGo-based apps.  MeeGo apps will also be included in the Intel App
Store.
</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">The Document Foundation launches LibreOffice 3.3</h3>

<p>
The Document Foundation recently released LibreOffice 3.3, the community
version of OpenOffice 3.3, a short time after setting itself up as an
alternative to the Oracle-controlled product.  This first stable release is
available for download.
</p>

<p>
The next release, version 3.3.1, is expected around Feb. 14, following the
FOSDEM conference in Brussels on February 5 and 6, where LibreOffice
developers will be presenting their work during a one-day workshop with
speeches and hacking sessions coordinated by several members of the
project.
</p>

<p>
In less than four months, the number of developers hacking LibreOffice has
grown from less than twenty in late September 2010, to well over one
hundred. This has allowed them to release on the aggressive schedule set by
the project.
</p>

<p>
LibreOffice 3.3 is also important  for a number of other reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li> - the developer community has been able to build an independent
process, and get up and running in a very short time
<li> - with a large number of new contributors attracted to the project,
the source code is quickly undergoing a major clean-up to provide a better
foundation for future development of LibreOffice;
<li> - the Windows installer, which is going to impact the largest and most
diverse user base, has been integrated into a single build containing all
language versions, thus reducing the size for download sites from 75 GB to
11GB, making it easier to deploy new versions more rapidly and lowering the
carbon footprint of the entire infrastructure.
</ul>

<p>
Caol&aacute;n McNamara from RedHat, one of the developer community leaders,
commented, "This is our very first stable release, and therefore we are
eager to get user feedback, which will be integrated as soon as possible
into the code, with the first enhancements being released in February.
Starting from March, we will be moving to a real time-based, predictable,
transparent and public release schedule....". The LibreOffice development
roadmap is available at <a href="http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleasePlan">http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleasePlan</a> 
</p>

<p>
LibreOffice 3.3 provides all the new features of OpenOffice.org 3.3, such
as new custom properties handling; embedding of standard PDF fonts in PDF
documents; new Liberation Narrow font; increased document protection in
Writer and Calc; auto decimal digits for "General" format in Calc; 1
million rows in a spreadsheet; new options for CSV import in Calc; insert
drawing objects in Charts; hierarchical axis labels for Charts; improved
slide layout handling in Impress; a new easier-to-use print interface; more
options for changing case; and colored sheet tabs in Calc. Several of these
new features were contributed by members of the LibreOffice team prior to
the formation of The Document Foundation.
</p>

<p>
LibreOffice 3.3 also brings several new features, including in no
particular order: the ability to import and work with SVG files; an easy
way to format title pages and their numbering in Writer; a more-helpful
Navigator Tool for Writer; improved ergonomics in Calc for sheet and cell
management; and Microsoft Works and Lotus Word Pro document import filters.
In addition, many great extensions are now bundled, providing PDF import, a
slide-show presenter console, a much improved report builder, and more
besides. A more-complete and detailed list of all the new features offered
by LibreOffice 3.3 is viewable on the following web page:

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">IBM's Watson, DeepBlueQA, Wins on Jeopardy!</h3>

<p>
Reminiscent of the classic battle of John Henry and the Steam Shovel, the
first-ever man vs. machine Jeopardy! competition was aired in February
with two matches being held over three consecutive days.  And like John
Henry, the humans lost.
</p>

<p>
At a press conference in January, Jeopardy! and IBM revealed the non-profit
beneficiaries of the upcoming contest between two of the most celebrated
Jeopardy! Champions - Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings - and IBM's "Watson"
computing system.  Rutter and Jennings planned to donate 50 percent of
their winnings to charity, and IBM will donate 100 percent of its winnings
to charity.
</p>

<p>
The grand prize for this competition was be $1 million, with second place
earning $300,000, and third place earning $200,000.
</p>

<p>
Watson, named after IBM founder Thomas J. Watson, was built by a team of
IBM scientists who set out to accomplish a grand challenge - build a
computing system that rivals a human's ability to answer questions posed in
natural language with speed, accuracy and confidence. The Jeopardy! format
provides the ultimate challenge because the game's clues involve analyzing
subtle meaning, irony, riddles, and other language complexities in which
humans excel and computers traditionally do not.
</p>

<p>
The Jeopardy! game show, winner of 28 Emmy Awards since its debut in 1984,
was inducted into the Guinness Book of World Records for the most awards
won by a TV Game Show.

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Gemalto Launches One Time Password Application for Mobile Users</h3>

<p>
At the RSA Conference in San Francisco and Mobile World Congress, in
Barcelona, in February, Gemalto introduced Protiva Mobile OTP, a
convenient, secure and cost-effective new way for businesses and their
employees to deploy two-factor authentication, with their mobile phones.
The new solution is part of Gemalto's Protiva Strong Authentication family,
which encompasses the validation server and a range of Protiva
authentication application software and authentication devices.
</p>

<p>
A One Time Password (OTP) replaces static passwords with strong
authentication and provides a convenient additional level of security for
transactions and access control.
</p>

<p>
Protiva Mobile OTP works with the popular handset platforms, including
Blackberry, iPhone, and handsets running Java, Windows CE and Brew.
Employees simply need to download Gemalto's secure app onto their mobile
phone, which is setup to immediately generate and receive OTPs using the
phone.
</p>

<p>
Combining the mobile credential with their username and one-time-password
grants employees the appropriate access to company resources such as a VPN,
intranet, mail directory, digital signature, mail and Web pages. Protiva
Mobile OTP is simple for IT administrators to deploy and provision, and is
compatible with the majority of industry-leading IT infrastructure
elements.
</p>
