Yet another example of PHP fuckmuppetry. And this isn't going to stop,
since the creators of PHP <strong>refuse</strong> to fix the well-known vulnerabilities
in the language. [sigh]
</p>

<p>
If someone who speaks Deutsch wants to contact the owners of the first
domain and let them know, that would be a nice thing to do. I've just
contacted the webmaster of the second domain; hopefully, they'll take
that garbage offline and fix their leaks.

Also, just so you know, I nuke the originating SMTP hosts' IPs
(blacklist them in my MTA configuration), the moment they bleat these
phishing frauds in our direction.  You'll therefore never see two
fraudmails from the same IP -- or at least not unless they're really quick. 
(It's a bit harsh, but I hold the admins responsible for their outgoing
traffic.)
</p>

<p>
Of course, it would be good if I were able to also reject more of them
up-front (without collateral damage), something one works on, as an MTA
admin, but must be careful in testing.

<p>
Wouldn't something like Spamassasin work for filtering out the 
phishing?

As a SMOP, yes.  ;-&gt;  (<a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/S/SMOP.html">http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/S/SMOP.html</a>)
</p>


<p>
As background:
</p>

<p>
The MTA (Exim) has a fairly elaborate set of rules used to check the
incoming SMTP stream prior to saying "200 OK" in the SMTP conversation
(rules including "callback" ones that check the delivering IP for
RFC-complianc).  <em>Then</em>, if the stream passes those tests, and still
before Exim is willing to say "2000 OK", Exim runs a system-wide
SpamAssassin check on the mail, and allows the mail through only if 
SA-measured spamicity isn't too high.
</p>

<p>
Deferring the SA-checking until after the more-extensive Exim rules 
is important for system performance, as Exim's engine is much lighter
and faster than SA's.
</p>


<p>
Anyhow, if someone can tackle the phishing exercises du jour and craft
appropriate rulesets for me, preferably that <em>don't</em> also produce too
much collateral damage, I'll be glad to drop them in.  
</p>

<p>
I'm not really good at writing those, myself -- and badly written SA
rules turn out to be a very nicely efficient way to make a mail server
fall over.  I know this empirically, from having insouciantly grabbed a
bunch of rules from <a href="http://www.rulesemporium.com/rules.htm">http://www.rulesemporium.com/rules.htm</a> (and yes, I
did check them with spamassassin -D --lint), restart spamd, and watched
spamd immediately eat all my RAM.
</p>

<p>
(I do play with SA settings, occasionally, I'm just saying I have to be
careful about it, given that it's a production system and I really hate
having to drop everything and deal with sudden emergencies.)
