<h1>Hey, Researcher! Open Source Tools For You!</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/saha.html">Amit Kumar Saha</a></b></p>


<p>
<strong>Disclaimer:</strong><br> Your author is writing this article after
having just finished his latest task - conducting numerous experiments
which involved processing a lot of data, and finally writing the paper on
it in just under five days. He wonders how he would do it without some of
the tools he will be talking about in this article, leaving aside the
pleasure of working on Linux systems. His views are biased and are meant to
be taken <em>cum grano salis</em>, but I hope you will give him a fair
chance.
</p>

<h3>What am I addressing in this article?</h3>

<p>
My meeting with Linux happened accidentally 10 years ago, with the fun of
wiping out and putting in a Linux distribution numerous times on my first
computer without having any clue about how to work on it. Finally, after a
lot of such iterations I finally settled in, working on it full
time for the last 5 years. The accident that happened 10 years ago stood me in
good stead both when I was working at a software company and now when I'm
working in a research lab. In a research lab, we need to plot figures, run
batch jobs remotely, perform scientific and numerical computing, and last
but not least, publish results by writing papers. Just a few days before I
wrote to the Editor-in-Chief about this article idea, I helped a Windows
friend draw some plots (fixing them for publication) for her paper,
wondering all the while "Jeez, how do Windows users do it?" Most tools that
I used were primarily for Linux. On Linux, things are so much easier. You
can focus on the real job instead of bothering about setting up your tools.
This article is therefore an unabashed claim about the coolness of working
with these tools while you focus on your research. Some of these tools can
be set up on a non-Linux system too; however, I shall address their usage
on a Linux system only and make no attempt to cover any non-Linux issues.
The primary focus here is to introduce my readers to these tools, and not
to convert them to Linux. <em>It would, in fact, be a good exercise to get
all these tools that I talk about here on Windows!</em>
</p>

<p>
In this article, I shall take a look at (in no particular order) getting up
and on with LaTex, <em>gnuplot</em>, <em>GNU octave</em>, Python scientific
libraries, <em>Beamer</em>, and some other tools and libraries.
</p>

<h3><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Hello Linux</h3>
<!--SEC END -->

<p>
Before I start talking about using the scientific tools, I shall write a
few lines about how you can set up a Linux system for yourself - if you
don&rsquo;t already have one, that is. While bare-metal Linux installations
are the best case scenario, it may not always be possible because your
primary work may be on Windows. In such cases, the best solution is to go
for a <em>virtual Linux installation</em>. In my humble opinion, I have
found using <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> to be a
breeze when you need to set up a virtual machine. Just download a Linux
distribution like Ubuntu and install it using VirtualBox. Once you have the
basic installation, take a little time to gain some hands on familiarity
with the terminal, using the package manager to install packages, and using
a text editor.
</p>

<p>
Here are some resources which can help you getting started:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VirtualBox">Ubuntu community
documentation on VirtualBox</a></li>
<li><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/9.10/index.html">Documentation for the
latest stable version of Ubuntu</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Giving LaTex a try</h3>

<p>
LaTex is a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting and is
widely used for writing scientific papers, technical manuals, and even
creating presentations <em>(more on this later)</em>. <a href= 
"http://www.tug.org/texlive/"><em>TeX Live</em></a> is an easy way to get up
and running with LaTex on your Linux system. A file written in LaTex is
usually saved as a <em>.tex</em> file. Once you have created your
<em>.tex</em> file, you will compile the file using the <em>latex</em>
command, which gives you a <em>dvi</em> file, which you can convert to a PDF
file using a tool like <em>dvipdf</em>. You can also directly get a PDF
output using the tool <em>pdflatex</em>.
</p>

<p>
You can edit LaTex in your text editor of choice. The widely used
<em>VIM</em> and <em>Emacs</em> both support LaTex editing with
syntax-highlighting, code-completion, etc.
</p>

<p>
The best way to get started with LaTex is by getting started. Start your text
editor, type in some Latex and see the results. Here are some great
resources to help you master it:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=
"http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf">The (Not So)
short introduction to LaTex</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/textprocessing/">Text
Processing using LaTex</a></li>
<li><a href="http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html">Draw the LaTex
symbol and get the corresponding command</a></li>
</ul>

<!--TOC section gnuplot-->
<h3><!--SEC ANCHOR -->gnuplot</h3>
<!--SEC END -->

<p>
If you are doing experimental work, there is a fair chance that you are
going to present your results in a graphical plot. Please welcome <em>gnuplot</em>.
It is a command-line driven graphing utility for creating 2-dimensional as
well as 3-dimensional graphical plots. It supports output to many file
formats with <em>eps</em> and <em>fig</em> being of special interest to the
researcher. The easiest way to install <em>gnuplot</em> is using the package
manager of you Linux distribution.
</p>

<p>
Here are a couple of links to help you get started with
<em>gnuplot</em>:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/documentation.html">gnuplot
documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://t16web.lanl.gov/Kawano/gnuplot/index-e.html">gnuplot not
so Frequently Asked Questions</a></li>
</ul>
<!--TOC subsection Calling <I>gnuplot</I> from your C program-->
<h4><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Calling <em>gnuplot</em> from your C program</h4>
<!--SEC END -->

<p>
A cool way to use <em>gnuplot</em> is to use it to display continuously
changing data that your program may be generating. For this example,
let&rsquo;s assume that you have a program written in the C programming
language and you want to send the data it's generating to <em>gnuplot</em>.
The simplest way to do this is to use the <em>popen</em> system call. Please
refer to this <a href= 
"../168/misc/lg/2_cent_tip__piping_to_gnu_plot_from_c.html">
<em>2-cent tip</em></a> published here sometime back.
</p>

<p>
There is also an ANSI C interface to <em>gnuplot</em> available <a href= 
"http://ndevilla.free.fr/gnuplot/">here</a>, but I haven&rsquo;t personally
used it.
</p>
<!--TOC section GNU Octave-->
<h3><!--SEC ANCHOR -->GNU Octave</h3>
<!--SEC END -->

<p>
GNU Octave (referred to as Octave from now on) is a software tool intended 
for numerical computation. Octave has extensive tools for solving
common numerical linear algebra problems, finding the roots of nonlinear
equations, integrating ordinary functions, manipulating polynomials, and
integrating ordinary differential and differential-algebraic equations.
Octave is available for use on Linux, Solaris, Mac OSX, and Windows.  If
your study or play involves numerical computations, Octave is for you.
Octave has been designed with MATLAB compatibility in mind, so with careful
design you could write scripts which run on both MATLAB and Octave. It is
easily extensible and customizable via user-defined functions written in
Octave&rsquo;s own language, or using dynamically loaded modules written in
C++, C, Fortran, or other languages.
</p>

<p>
Octave is most definitely available in the package repository of your
Linux distribution and that is the easiest way to get it.
</p>

<p>
GNU Octave comes with extensive <a href= 
"http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/interpreter/">documentation</a>,
which is the best place to get started.
</p>

<p>
In case you happen to like this author&rsquo;s writings, he is currently
writing an article series on Octave elsewhere. Please refer to these
<a href= 
"http://amitksaha.wordpress.com/2009/11/30/article-series-getting-started-with-gnu-octave/">
blog post</a> for PDFs of the articles.

<!--TOC section Add Python to your toolkit-->
<h3><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Add Python to your toolkit</h3>
<!--SEC END -->

<p>
I shall not use this section of the article for <a href= 
"http://www.python.org">Python</a> language advocacy. Rather, I shall point
you to some ways you may consider using Python in your research, if you are
already using it, or think of using it in the future as just another of your
many experiments. Python is already installed on most of the Linux
distributions. Let us now see some of the ways you can use Python:
</p>
<!--TOC subsection As a scientific calculator-->
<h4><!--SEC ANCHOR -->As a scientific calculator</h4>
<!--SEC END -->

<p>
With its <a href=
"http://docs.python.org/library/math.html"><em>math</em></a> module, Python
can be a very useful command-line scientific calculator. For
example:
</p>
<pre class="code">
$ python
Python 2.6.4 (r264:75706, Dec  7 2009, 18:45:15)
[GCC 4.4.1] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; import math
&gt;&gt;&gt; math.factorial(10)
3628800
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

<p>
As you can guess, you will have to import the math module every time you
want to use it. You can avoid doing this by automatically importing it at
startup:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a file: .pythonrc in your $HOME and place this line:
<pre>
<em>import math</em>
</pre></li>
<li>Now in your .bashrc or similar:
<pre>
export PYTHONSTARTUP=$HOME/.pythonrc
</pre></li>
</ol>

<p>
Now, every time you start Python interactively, you should have the
<em>math</em> module already imported.
</p>
<pre class="code">
$ python
Python 2.6.4rc1 (r264rc1:75270, Oct 10 2009, 02:40:56)
[GCC 4.4.1] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
 &gt;&gt;&gt; math.pi
3.1415926535897931
</pre>

<p>
The <a href=
"http://docs.python.org/library/decimal.html"><em>decimal</em></a> module is
another interesting module which provides support for decimal fixed point and
floating point arithmetic. <a href= 
"http://docs.python.org/library/fractions.html"><em>fractions</em></a> is
another interesting module, which can be used for rational number
arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
The beauty is that you do not need to know the Python <em>programming
language</em> to use these modules. Just fire up the Python interpreter
and import the module(s) you want to use, then call the appropriate
function.
</p>
<!--TOC subsection Scientific libraries-->
<h4><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Scientific libraries</h4>
<!--SEC END -->

<p>
If you are already conversant with Python, then you would definitely like
to know about some scientific libraries which you may find useful in your
research:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NumPy and SciPy</strong>: <a href=
"http://numpy.scipy.org/"><em>NumPy</em></a> is an extension to the standard
Python programming language, adding support for large multi-dimensional
arrays and matrices. <a href="http://www.scipy.org/"><em>SciPy</em></a>
builds upon <em>NumPy</em> to provide various mathematical functions for
Integration, Optimization, Interpolation, Linear Algebra, Statistics, and
others.</li>
<li class="li-itemize"><strong>matplotlib</strong>: <a href= 
"http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">This</a> is a plotting library for
Python, which is also used by a lot of other Python scientific tools for
plotting data.</li>
<li class="li-itemize"><strong>NetworkX</strong>:<a href= 
"http://networkx.lanl.gov/">NetworkX</a> is a Python library for the
creation, manipulation, and study of complex networks. Even if you do not have
the need to build very complex networks, it is fun to play around with it to
create simple graphs too.</li>
</ul>
<!--TOC section Beam it with Beamer!-->
<h3><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Beam it with Beamer!</h3>
<!--SEC END -->

<p>
You have done your experiments, sent in your findings, they've
been accepted, and now you are going to present them at a
conference. You want to prepare some slides to give you company as you talk
about your work. OpenOffice.org Impress, KOffice? How about taking a look at
something different? You will surely like the results, I promise. <a href= 
"http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net"><em>Beamer</em></a> is a LaTex class
for making presentation slides. In LaTex parlance, it is just another
Document Class. You shouldn&rsquo;t even make an attempt to use Beamer, if
you have no idea what LaTex is. However, if you already use LaTex, chances
are you swear by it, then Beamer is for you.
</p>

<p>
The easiest way to install is to use the package manager in your Linux
distribution. You will see that some more packages providing other extra
LaTex classes need to be installed. Prominent among these are
&rsquo;latex-xcolor&rsquo; and &rsquo;pgf&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>
There is, of course, a way to install the LaTex class manually. It's easy to
do it, but not easier than the previous method. The LaTex Beamer user guide
shows how to do it.
</p>

<p>
With the danger of being pulled up by the chief editor for self-publicity,
the author would like to point to his article <em>Typesetting Presentations with
Beamer</em>, published elsewhere. The PDF copy is available from <a href= 
"http://amitksaha.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/02-beamer.pdf">here</a>.
</p>
<!--TOC section Others you may find useful-->
<h3><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Others you may find useful</h3>
<!--SEC END -->

<p>
In this section, I shall talk about some of the other tools, which are
useful for scientific computing that I know of:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sage</strong>: <a href=
"http://www.sagemath.org"><em>Sage</em></a> is an open-source mathematics
software <em>system</em> which brings together a huge number of open-source
mathematical libraries and tools under one common umbrella. In their own
words, the Sage community is building a car, and not reinventing the wheel.
The <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/index.html">Sage
tutorial</a> is a good place to start exploring it.</li>
<li><strong>Xfig</strong>: <a href="http://www.xfig.org">Xfig</a> is a
drawing tool which may be used to create figures, import and export figures
in various other formats. <em>fig</em> is the native format that Xfig uses to
save its images. A useful way to use <em>Xfig</em> that I have learnt is to export
your plots from <em>gnuplot</em> as <em>.fig</em> images, open them
in <em>Xfig</em> to add the relevant text/labels to your plots, then
export the plot in a format you desire.</li>
<li><strong>GNU Scientific Library</strong>: The <a href= 
"http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl">GNU Scientific Library</a> is a C/C++
numerical library providing support for Linear Algebra, Complex Numbers,
Numerical Differentiation and others.</li>
</ul>
<!--TOC section The small ones-->
<h3><!--SEC ANCHOR -->The small ones</h3>
<!--SEC END -->

<p>
One category of tools that I haven't talked about yet is some of the Linux
utilities, the ones that ship along with the Linux system - <em>Shell
scripting</em>, <em>awk</em> and <em>sed</em>. My knowledge of each is very
limited, but I have a working knowledge of them all, and I can get things done
with them, which is what matters a lot of the time.
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shell scripting</strong>: Shell scripting is very useful for
running batch jobs: fire up a job and it should finish without requiring any
intermediate user intervention. It's all the more useful when you have to run
an experiment of yours a large number of times. Writing a shell script is
often as simple as just writing several separate commands into one file in a
<em>for</em> loop and running that file. Of course, that's an oversimplification,
but sometimes it <em>is</em> just that simple to set up a batch job. Do not get put
off by the title, but the <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/">Advanced
Bash-Scripting guide</a> is a good place to get started with scripting for
BASH shells.</li>
<li><strong>awk</strong>: The only way I have used <em>awk</em> so far (and a
lot of times) is for text extraction from huge files containing numerical and
textual data. Even with this limited use, it can be a useful tool when you
want to extract text that is stored in a tabular format. The <a href= 
"http://www.gnu.org/manual/gawk/html_node/index.html">GNU Awk User's
Guide</a> is the place to get started to explore <em>awk</em>.</li>
<li class="li-itemize"><strong>sed</strong>: <em>sed</em> is a stream editor
and is useful to carry out batch editing as well as editing of individual
text files. <a href= 
"http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-sed1.html">This</a>
three-part series on sed is a comprehensive treatment of the features of
<em>sed</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It's often the case that we do not know of a great tool which would
simplify our work as we go about our research work everyday. My hope as a
novice researcher is to acquaint the reader with the kind of software tools
available in the Open Source world.  I have made no attempt to be
exhaustive here. There are a lot of other tools out there, which I
haven&rsquo;t yet used, so I have refrained from writing about them. I hope
you have enjoyed reading this article as much as I have writing it!
