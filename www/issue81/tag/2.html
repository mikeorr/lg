<p><strong>From Dominik Szczerba

</strong></p>
<P><STRONG>
Hello,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Do you have experience with ide-scsi emulation for IDE ZIP? For the last
week I have searched the whole internet wide and broad and found no info
on my very problem (only some similar ones), which is "unable to read
partition table" and/or "READ CAPACITY failed" on my dev/sda during
start-up (errors from dmesg and/or boot.msg, the disk was both in and
out for testing during boot). I have my internal IDE ZIP drive 250 MB on
my machine physically under <TT>/dev/hdb</TT> (internal ZIP 250MB), but I made it
emulated under <TT>/dev/sda</TT> (because I had similar problem just using
<TT>/dev/hdb</TT>, so I used ide-scsi after being suggested to do so). Apart from
errors in boot.msg and dmesg, "fdisk -l" or fdisk <TT>/dev/sda</TT> =&gt; 'p' doesnt
recognize the partition table of correctly formated (on other machines,
external USB IOMEGA ZIP 250, running usb scsi emulation) ZIP disks with
ext2 file system (I didnt try fat, I am not concerned). But I can mount
the disk, but I am affraid to write to it because of obvious error
messages.

Have you read the ZIP-Drive mini-HowTo?  Is your drive simple IDE or the
later ATAPI model?  From that document:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
IDE:
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The good news about this drive: no kernel modules or modifications are
needed to support it.  It looks to the kernel like an IDE hard drive.
It worked for me with no effort with kernel 2.0.31 and 2.0.32.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The bad news about this drive: because it doesn't use ATAPI, you can't
use the SCSI-to-ATAPI translation, which means you can't use mtools to
write-protect disks (or to eject them, for that matter).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
ATAPI:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
I use an ATAPI Zip drive and it works with both 2.0.32 and 2.0.33
kernels.  I've used it under both RH 5.0 and OpenLinux 1.2 (my current
used distribution).  To get it to work under OpenLinux, I just enabled
ATAPI floppy support in the kernel.  OpenLinux does not have this
support compiled in by default.
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
No other drivers are needed.  It will mount as an extended partition
on partition 4.  I.E, mine mounts on HDB4.  I mount it under <TT>/mnt/zip</TT>
as noauto, although I don't suppose there would be any real problem
with automounting.  I just wonder about ejecting disks.  I always
dismount the drive before ejecting a cartridge.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
There are more detailed instructions for the ATAPI install in the
Linux Gazette May 1998 issue. See the 2 cent tip section.

Have you inserted the ide-floppy module or is IDE Floppy support compiled
into your kernel. Only then you can use the ZIP drive like a removable
hard drive.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
so you do: "modprobe ide-floppy &amp;&amp; modprobe ide-scsi" and carefully watch
the kernel messages.
If it doesn't help, please post the part of your kernel boot messages
concerning the detection of the ZIP drive.

To make it yet more complex: if I now format a ZIP disk on MY
scsi-emulated IDE ZIP drive then I dont have ANY problems on MY machine
(format/partition table is correctly recognized) but on ALL the other
machines the disk is not recognized at all (not even mounting is
possible).

I can't offer much help on the overall topic, not having any experience with ZIP, but
one thing seems clear from the above: the "ide-floppy" functionality is
compiled into your kernel.

recompile the kernel, because it doesnt solve the problem of easy

"Or something" is not a useful error report; however, if it's compiled
in, you won't have a module - so this is another indication of the
above. Presumably, the error will look something like this:

I'm not sure what you mean by "the latest technology", but it should
have a reasonably new version of "ide-floppy" support - either compiled
in (as it seems to be in your case) or as a loadable module.

<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

Yes, SuSE's kernel should suffice. You can use the drive, and ide-floppy
support is built into the kernel.

I'm afraid that I missed the first part of this discussion, however -
when you say that the errors are reported on "another" computer, is
"ide-floppy" loaded on <em> _that</em> machine (either via being compiled in or
modprobing "ide-floppy")? The two machines that you report as being able
to format, copy, etc. are obviously getting it to work; the third one
isn't. So, the third machine has some kind of a problem - perhaps the
module does not get loaded on it?

Both of those are SCSI-related modules; I think that Dominic has already
determined that SCSI is irrelevant to what he's doing (unloading SCSI
emulation has no effect on the process.) As well, it's a good idea to
explain to people <em> _why</em> they should do things that you recommend: if
your exact suggestions don't pan out, they would be able to explore an
avenue that they may not have been aware of.

based ZIP drive.  As noted above, however, if they were built-ins, then you
wouldn't have them available as modules, but they would have been likely
to "just work".

I think he means that Zip carts init'ed on the problem machine can't be
read by other Zip drvs.  I would not rule out an alignment compability
issue here.

&lt;shrug&gt; I'd say, ignore "fdisk". It's not the smartest utility in the
world in the first place, and using it on anything except a plain HD is
asking for trouble.

While I wouldn't recommend using fdisk to set up partitions on the Zip
carts, I've used it with good results to show the status (fdisk -l).

Yes, ZIP disks don't have a standard partition table. Same with LS-120 disks.
I read about LS-120 &amp; Linux and it was said you should not low-level format
the disk as it can render it unusable.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The data partition on the ZIP disk is number 4, so you've to 'mount -t auto
<TT>/dev/hdb4</TT> <TT>/mnt/zip</TT>'.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
So, one tip is to format the disk using IOMEGA tools under Windows (arghh).
A different one is using the tools provided at
<A HREF="http://www.iomega.com/software/linuxtools.html"
	>http://www.iomega.com/software/linuxtools.html</A>
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
There you have formatting tools, tools to write protect your disks and
information utilities. Works with ATAPI ZIP 100 &amp; 250 and SCSI
counterparts.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

try mounting <TT>/dev/sda4</TT> <TT>/mnt/zip</TT>
zip drives historically have the data in partition 4
</blockQuote>

This should definitely solve the problem if when you format the drive
properly you get no problems

Is it possible just to have ZIP compatible

not I take the battle as lost and stop using ZIP drives... Warn
others...

that sounding the fire alarms and calling the New York Times would be
premature at best.

My use of Zip drvs has been confined to the SCSI (Linux &amp; MS) and parport
models (MS only).  I've never had any real problems, (other than very
slow with the parport version).

I checked with FAT file systems. The same. It works 100% OK... but only
on the machine it was formated on. I am sick with this.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Thank you guys for feedback, but I give up and throw away the stupid drive.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
No, no need to alarm New York Times, Ben, but a word of loud warning on
incopatibility of ZIP disks formatted on different machines will prevent
others from wasting their money.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
What I experienced just prooves how low quality service is offered by
iomega.
