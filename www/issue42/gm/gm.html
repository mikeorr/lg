It is written in C and interfaces to the X library, and therefore does
not require any proprietary toolkit in order to compile. Although the software
is copyrighted, it is available for free and can be redistributed without
fee. ImageMagick is known to compile and run on virtually any Unix system
and Linux. It also runs under Windows NT, Windows 95, Macintosh, and VMS.</font></font>

drawing package built using the multiplatform IPAD-Pro core and so provides
a very powerfull consistant interface across all supported platforms without

edited by IPAD have built in intelligence. They react to the mouse and
each other so as to maximise user productivity and reduce tedious repetitive
setup sequences.</font></font>

It includes complex, real, and parallel transforms, and can handle arbitrary

FFTW uses novel code-generation and runtime self-optimization techniques
(along with many other tricks).</font></font>

So far, no authoring tools for Linux are listed, although I've sent email

are working on both IRIX and Solaris ports, so I'd think it wouldn't be
a difficult port to Linux).</font></font></blockquote>

will convert RGB to CMYK easily? (easily as in push a button)</font></font></i>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A: <b><font color="#CC6600">ImageMagick</font></b>
has the command line tool <b>convert</b> that will convert between many
different file formats.&nbsp; One output format is raw CMYK.&nbsp; Keep
in mind that raw CMYK may not be quite right for print output - it doesn't
take into consideration display characteristics of either the monitor on
which you viewed the original or the device on which you'll be printing.&nbsp;
But it will probably be fairly close for many images.</font></font>

for me) is the Graphics Muse ^_^</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b><font color="#993300">'Muse</font></b>:&nbsp;
I'm flattered, but I often read most of the rest of the Gazette myself.&nbsp;
Larry Ayers and the other regular and guest writers tend to know a lot
more about systems administration than I do, and I often find bits of very
useful into there.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm just the graphics guy.</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Well, I use the
GIMP everyday and I frequently use a file-manager to launch it associated
with an image. I'd like GIMP to start only once. I'd like to launch it
once and then, afterwards, launch another image and make it load by the
first GIMP instance I launched.&nbsp; Any ideas ?</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b><font color="#993300">'Muse</font></b>:&nbsp;
If you want to work on the new image interactively, then I can only think
of one way to do it - Perl::Fu.&nbsp; But getting the Perl extension to
work with the Gimp can take a bit of work.&nbsp; I'm going to do an article
on it for the June issue of <a href="http://www.thegimp.com">TheGimp.com</a>
(this month will be on Gimp 1.2 status).&nbsp; You can also take a look
at the new O'Reilly text "<i>Programming Web Graphics with Perl and GNU
Software</i>".&nbsp; There is a chapter on the Gimp which goes into a&nbsp;
fair amount of detail on the Perl scripting interface for the Gimp.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The Perl extension has a
server portion, so you could write a perl script to connect to the server
and pass it the name of a plug-in and file that could be used to pop open
a new image window for the currently running Gimp.&nbsp; It will even,
I believe, launch the Gimp if its not already running.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I'm no Perl::Fu expert, however.&nbsp;
This is just my impression of how things work.</font></font>

Ok, I stand corrected.&nbsp; I just don't run WINE - I want these tools
to run natively on Unix.&nbsp; I've been waiting 10 years (since working
on the Dell Unix product) for applications to run natively on desktop Unix.&nbsp;
So I guess that's why I didn't consider WINE.</font></font>

Windows API calls using their UNIX or X11 equivalents.</font></font></blockquote>

<h2>
blah</h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I wondered around the Net a
bit this month, but couldn't find anything interesting to write about relating
to Web development.&nbsp; Oh, sure there are lots of topics.&nbsp; I just
couldn't find one that peaked my curiousity - and I could fit into my writing
schedule.&nbsp; I thought about looking at Zope, but it had some system
requirements I didn't have.&nbsp; I spent a bit of time trying to install
some other packages, some for the Vector Tools followup article and some
for some future articles, and didn't really want to deal with it again
for yet another package.&nbsp; But Zope does look interesting.&nbsp; I'll
try to take a look at it sometime in the near future.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Other than that, I only came
up with one Web-related item:&nbsp; After a couple of years of wondering
how to make this work, I finally figured out how to force text to flow
around a table.&nbsp; I like to use tables to place an image with a caption
below it, image in the top cell and the caption in a cell below it, but
I've always been stuck with shoving text into a cell in the table - I couldn't
just have text flow around the table like I do with non-tabled images.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Well, it seems that my use
of Netscape Composer had led me to ignore checking the completeness of
the HTML it created.&nbsp; I was perusing some other sites on the net -
I think it was the BBC news site - and saw one with a configuration just
like I wanted to make:&nbsp; image in a table, caption below it, text flowing
around it to the right.&nbsp; I looked at the HTML and didn't see anything
special.&nbsp; So I copied everything from that site's table to one of
my own, then started removing items one at a time to find the key element.&nbsp;
The key, it seems, is the ALIGN= argument.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>It is possible to make text
flow around a table, but not directly with Composer.&nbsp; Composer, although
it provides a toggle for the Align argument, doesn't actually place this
argument in the TABLE tag if you use the default option of "Left".&nbsp;
Arrgghh!&nbsp; You have to edit the TABLE tag and add the ALIGN=LEFT by
hand.&nbsp; So, configure your text editor in Netscape.&nbsp; I use vi&nbsp;
(if you use Emacs there is a good chance you're not using Composer anyway).&nbsp;
You'll want to create the table first, just as always.&nbsp; Make the table
just a bit wider than the image and leave the image left aligned in it's
cell (which leaves space between the image and the text that will flow
around it).&nbsp; Then add your text.&nbsp; Later, go back and edit the
HTML by hand (Edit->HTML Source) and add the ALIGN=LEFT argument to your
table.&nbsp; Viola!&nbsp; Right-side flowing text around your tables.&nbsp;
This modification will stay as long as you don't edit that table again.&nbsp;
If you do make changes to the table, you'll have to go back and add the
ALIGN=LEFT argument by hand again.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I guess it helps to check
these automated contraptions every now and then - just to keep them honest.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Oh, and as to why this was
titled "blah":&nbsp; that's the text placeholder in the template file I
use for the main page of the Graphics Muse.&nbsp; It seemed appropriate.&nbsp;
The alternative was "Yada Yada Yada", but I wasn't sure how many Seinfeld
fans there were reading the Muse.</font></font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">A Little Eye Candy, Please - XScreensaver</font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In most issues of the Graphics
Muse, I talk about useful tools, things with which you can perform some
real world task.&nbsp; That's fine, most of the time.&nbsp; But one needs
to have a little fun every now and then.&nbsp; Sometimes, you just need
to do something that, well, has no real purpose.&nbsp; Except to make you
smile.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In the world of graphics
tools for Linux there are probably several programs (we can't <i>really</i>
call them tools, per se) that could be considered just fun.&nbsp; No, I
don't mean games.&nbsp; That's entertainment.&nbsp; Despite what you read
in the press or hear from politicians, games are not completely mindless
jaunts for the juvenile crowd.&nbsp; No, we need something that has nothing
to offer but stunning visual preoccupation.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Thank goodness for screensavers.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Watching the ever streaming
line of announcements over at <a href="http://www.freshmeat.net">freshmeat</a>,
I noticed an announcement for something called cmatrix.&nbsp; It was said
to be a screensaver in the style of <a href="#movie">The Matrix</a>, that
wonderfully confusing cinema fantasy starring Keanu Reeves.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
it's not an X-based program.&nbsp; It runs under Curses, a terminal based
graphical interface.&nbsp; Then I saw that Jamie Zawinsky, late of Netscape,
had added a Matrix hack to his xscreensaver program.&nbsp; So I scrounged
around a bit and found xscreensaver, downloaded it and put it to work.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Cool.</font></font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Xscreensaver is a program that
manages other programs that draw on the root window.&nbsp; The root window
is a special window - it's the window inside which all other windows get
drawn.&nbsp; It doesn't look like a window like you might expect because
it doesn't have a window frame around it.&nbsp; But any program, properly
written, can draw on the root window.&nbsp; Jamie's design is to make xscreensaver
a daemon - a program that runs all the time in the background - that would
wait to see when there was a period of inactivity from the user.&nbsp;
When that period expires, xscreensaver runs another program.&nbsp; This
other program is the one that actually draws on the root window.&nbsp;
These other programs are called, in xscreensaver vernacular,
<a href="#hacks vs. demos">hacks</a>.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I don't usually run screensavers,
a screen blanking or energy-saving monitor suffices most of the time.&nbsp;
But the shear number of hacks available for xscreensaver was somewhat astounding.&nbsp;
I counted over 80 of these in the hacks directory.&nbsp; Jamie has screenshots
for most of these on his xscreensaver Web site (<a href="http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/">http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/</a>).&nbsp;
Be warned:&nbsp; it can take quite a while to download the page with the
screenshots if you're on a slow link.&nbsp; You don't really have to download
the latest version from this web site since most Linux distributions will
contain a version of xscreensaver already.&nbsp; But you might want to
check to see if any new hacks have been added or if a new version is availalble.&nbsp;
On my Red Hat 5.2 I had a considerably older version than the latest (3.12)
posted on Jamie's site.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Since xscreensaver runs as
a daemon and a client (the hack), you need to look at these seperately.&nbsp;
The daemon, <i>xscreensaver</i>, has no user interface.&nbsp; It's configuration
is controlled by a standalone client program called <i>xscreensaver-demo</i>.</font></font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="images/xs-demo.gif" height=281 width=553>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>xscreensaver-demo</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>If you don't have an <i>$HOME/.xscreensaver</i>
file, then xscreensaver uses its default configuration.&nbsp; In this example
case this means the demo window has all 80+ hacks available.&nbsp; This
if fine for the demo, but when you put together a menu option for your
favorite Window Manager to launch the screensavers, you may want to limit
this list using your own configuration file.&nbsp; We'll talk about the
configuration file a little later in this article.</font></font>
<p><font size=-1><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The demo dialog allows you
to double click on an entry in the list of hacks to start it.&nbsp; To
stop the hack just move the mouse or click a mouse button once.&nbsp; This
is handy for looking through the list of hacks to see what they all do.&nbsp;
You can also type a hack command (the command uses ordinary command line,
aka shell, syntax) in the text field just below the list.&nbsp; The buttons
perform obvious functions - run the next hack in the list, run the previous
hack in the list, quit the demo program and open the preferences dialog.&nbsp;
Quitting will exit the demo window but does not kill off the xscreensaver
demo.&nbsp; You do that manually with the <i>xscreensaver-command</i> program's
</font><tt>-exi</tt><font face="Arial,Helvetica">t

</table>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The demo window also has a preferences
dialog.&nbsp; Here you can configure the daemon's behaviour with respect
to when it notices inactivity and whether or not it requires using a password
to log back in.&nbsp; You'll notice there isn't any field for specifying
a password.&nbsp; Xscreensaver will use your password from the /etc/password
(or /etc/shadow, if you have that) file.&nbsp; Saver Timeout is the inactivity
period to wait on, while Cycle Timeout is the period of time the current
hack gets run.&nbsp; Xscreensaver will cycle through the list of hacks
in your .xscreensaver file's <u>programs</u> entry if more than one entry
exists and if the cycle timeout is set to something other than 0 (0 means
never cycle).</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The Fade Duration is used
only with writable colormaps.&nbsp; This causes the screen to fade to black
when the screensaver starts or between hacks when cycling is enabled.&nbsp;
Fade ticks controls how fast this fade should occur.&nbsp; Higher numbers
make for smoother fades, but take longer to complete.&nbsp; Fading to black
may not work with your hardware and X server configuration, so changes
to this field may have no effect.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The Lock Timeout is the grace
period after the screensaver has kicked in where no password is required,
even if Require Password has been set.&nbsp; If this value were 5 minutes,
for example, and the screensaver had only been running for 3 minutes before
you typed something or moved the mouse, then you wouldn't have to type
a password.&nbsp; Useful for those short periods you run to the bathroom
and hate having to retype your password just to get going again.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Password Timeout is the time
for which the password dialog will remain on the screen waiting for a valid
response before it gives up and returns to the screensaver.&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the example here, the dialog would be present for 30 seconds - ample
time for a decent typist with the right password.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>While the demo window and
it's preference dialog allow you to configure how the daemon will run,
it isn't really how you want to run xscreensaver in the background, say
from a Window Manager menu.&nbsp; As mentioned earlier, another program
is used to kill off the xscreensaver daemon - <i>xscreensaver-command</i>.&nbsp;
This is a command line program designed to issue commands to the daemon
without using windowing interface (although it can launch the Demo window
too).&nbsp; A hack in the programs list of your configuration file can
be called directly using the xscreensaver-command program.&nbsp; This is
how I set up a menu under FVWM2 to specifically run the Matrix screensaver.</font></font>
<p><b><u><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The .xscreensaver configuration file</font></u></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>All of the options you can
set interactively with the Preferences dialog can also be set using the
xscreensaver-command program.&nbsp; Alternatively, you can specify often
used options in your .xscreensaver configuration file.&nbsp; We've already
mentioned the programs entry, which is a list of programs to run in shell-syntax
format.&nbsp; You list one program per line and use shell continuation
marks, but cannot use semicolons.&nbsp; So, an entry like this</font></font>
<blockquote><tt>programs:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xmatrix;&nbsp; qix -root;&nbsp;
xv -root -rmode 5 image.gif -quit</tt></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>is invalid.&nbsp; Instead, you
would enter it like this:</font></font>
<blockquote><tt>programs:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
\</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xmatrix&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
\n\</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; qix -root&nbsp; \n\</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xv -root -rmode 5 image.gif
-quit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n\</tt></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Each of these programs are found
via your PATH environment variable, so if they aren't available from an
ordinary command line, then you may want to fully qualify the path name.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>When you use xscreensaver-command
to launch one of these programs specifically, you reference the program
by the order in which it appears in the list.&nbsp; So xmatrix is program
number 1, qix is number 2 and so forth.&nbsp; You can then invoke this
screensaver directly using a command line like this:</font></font>
<blockquote><tt>% xscreensaver-command -select 1</tt></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The -select option tells xscreensaver
to blank the screen immediately and run the hack specified.&nbsp; There
are variations on how you can do this using the xscreensaver-command program.&nbsp;
Check the man page that comes with the source for complete details.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>All of the options in the
.xscreensaver configuration file use a name:token format.&nbsp; That is,
you specify the name of the option, followed by a colon and the setting
for that option.&nbsp; Since the configuration option uses the same option
names as the X Resources file, you can also place these settings in your
.Xdefaults file if you like.&nbsp; I prefer using program specific files
like .xscreensaver because if I screw up that one file I don't take the
chance of breaking some other program like I might if I used my .Xdefaults
file instead.</font></font>

Future Directions</h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Next month:&nbsp; I'd like to
look at TV and motion capture cards, but I don't have any so the best I
can do is write about the drivers for them.&nbsp; Barring that, I'm not
sure what I'll look at.&nbsp; Maybe a little about dealing with drawing
using Gtk and Motif widgets, something I've been working on lately.&nbsp;
We'll see.</font></font>
