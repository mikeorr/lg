<p>
convert is a command line tool available with ImageMagick which can be
used to convert between image formats. This shell script uses it to
convert a bunch of images from '.ps' to '.png'. Follow embedded
instructions to customize it to your needs.
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
#Script begins here
 
#!/bin/bash
 
# Uses the 'convert' utility to convert a bunch of images from one
#format to another
# the script should reside in the same directory as the images
# You need to have 'ImageMagick' installed

<h3>2-cent tip: Linux Magic System Request Keys</h3>

<p>
Hello!
</p>

<p>
Some of you might now the Linux Magic System Request Keys (see the file
sysrq.txt in the kernel documentation). These keys allow to send some
commands directly to the Linux kernel. This is dangerous, but it can be
very useful since you can sync all buffers to disk, see all processes,
dump diagnostic information to the console and immediately reboot the
system. You can enter the commands on x86 system with the keys
ALT-SysRq-&lt;command key&gt;.
</p>

<p>
Well, what happens if your server is co-located and you don't have any
keyboard at hand? You can still use the magic keys by means of writing
to /proc/sysrq-trigger.
</p>

<p>
"echo s &gt; /proc/sysrq-trigger" "presses" the magic key 's' that syncs
all buffers. Likewise "echo b &gt; /proc/sysrq-trigger" reboots the system
immediately (i.e. without noticing applications and writing data to
disk!). The latter was very useful for when recovering a co-located
server from a crash of the kernel crypt daemon which blocked access to
the filesystem.
</p>

<p>
Best,
Ren&eacute;.
</p>

<p>
Hello, all.
On my laptop, I've got those lovely little function keys which, by default, do 
absolutely NOTHING in Linux.  However, all that can change!
</p>

<p>
I've found with my current distro, PCLinuxOS, a handy little utility called 
<strong>KeyTouch</strong>.  This program allows you to map your keys to what they are supposed 
to do.  You can easily map your keys like this, and, from what I understand, 
this doesn't work just with laptops, but also with multimedia keyboard, 
microsoft keyboards, and so forth.  Very useful.
</p>

<p>
Now, on my laptop, I've got one of those buttons which, I suspect, is supposed 
to change the power usage profile in Windows.  However, I've found a more 
useful job for it to do.  In keytouch-editor, I have it set so that when that 
key combo is pressed, it will run:
<pre>
kdialog --passivepopup "`acpi`"
</pre>
which pops up a little 'speech bubble' to show me the current battery status, 
as well as time remaining for discharge or recharging the battery.  Very 
useful, in my opinion.
</p>

<p>
What else do I have?  Oh, yes.  In Compiz-Fusion, there seems to be a bug with 
the alt-tab application switcher, which will occasionally kill off the 
Emerald window manager.  I thought it was a bug with the keyboard shortcut, 
until I remapped it to win-tab and it would still kill it.  So, if this is 
annoying you, disable the "Application Switcher" module, enable something 
like 
<b>"Ring Switcher"</b>, and map it to Alt-Tab.  Just like that, the decoration 
issue is solved.
</p>

<p>
Ever wondered how people get those 
<b>static-yet-dynamic sig-generators</b>?  It's 
easy to do, with a simple bash script.
First, create a file, let's call it sig.  Put in the information that you are 
wanting to stay static.  Make sure that there is an empty line at the end of 
the file.  Now, you probably want to use something like fortune to get the 
changing part of the sig, right?  Here's a shell script I use, called sig.sh:
<pre>
---8&lt;---
#!/bin/bash
cat ~/sig
/usr/games/fortune
---&gt;8---
</pre>
Set this little script to be executable, then go to the mail client of your 
choice, tell it to get the sig from a program, and tell it to use your 
sig.sh.  
</p>

<p>
And, finally, 
<b>corrupted ISO downloads</b>. A friend taught me how to fix these:  
If your ISO is corrupted, it seems like all you have to do to fix it is to 
create/get a torrent of it, stick the corrupted download in the directory 
where the ISO will be downloaded to by default, and let the torrent system 
correct it for you!  
</p>

<p>
Hope that these may help some users, will be giving more when I can think of 
some more!

<p>
When I see a post in The Answer Gang and want to try out some submitted
code, I often want to run it to see what it does - but the procedure to
do this (open another xterm, fire up 'vi', put it into "append" mode,
paste the code, etc.) is a pain. So, I've created a script that helps me
do all of this conveniently.
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
#!/bin/bash
# Created by Ben Okopnik on Sun Apr 13 11:22:45 EDT 2008
# Requires 'dialog' and 'xclip'
 
cd /tmp
label="New filename:"
while :
do
	fname=`/usr/bin/dialog --stdout --inputbox "$label" 7 40`
	# WEIRD: '-f' doesn't expand/handle '~'! We'll borrow the shell's brain.
	fname=`eval /bin/echo $fname`
 
	if [ -f "$fname" ]
	then
		label="\"$fname\" already exists. New name:"
	else
		[ "$fname" = "" ] &amp;&amp; exit
		/usr/bin/xclip -o &gt; "$fname"
		/bin/vi "$fname"
		break
	fi
done
</pre>

<p>
I also created an icon on my Window Manager toolbar that executes
"/usr/bin/xterm -e /usr/local/bin/snapedit". Now, whenever I highlight
any kind of text, I can click on the icon, enter a filename (optionally
including a path - otherwise, the file will be created in "/tmp") in the
dialog box, and get a 'vi' session with the selected content already in
the file. Ever since I created this thing, I've found more and more uses
for it. Give it a try, and you will too!

<h3>2-cent tips: Using git</h3>

<strong>Using git to recreate an old CVS layout</strong><br>I had to go hunting for old data in a CVS repository today, and wanted
to hang on to the data in one place. git-cvsimport does a nice job of
maintaining the CVS history of each module, but because of the way the
repository was laid out, each module had to be grabbed separately. To
join them back together, I created a new git repository, and used
'git-submodule add' to drag in each of the converted modules.
</p>

<p>
It's not as convenient as being able to look at the whole project
history at once, but at least it's a lot easier to pass to the next
poor soul who finds themselves in my situation.
</p>

<p>
 
<strong>Git as a better SVN</strong><br>I've been using git-svn for decentralised SVN access for a few months
- sometimes I don't have access to an internet connection, sometimes I
don't want to commit something until it's finished, sometimes I want
to be able to work on a branchwithout having to redo everything when I
want to merge - but today I found another use: to revert a whole
commit, instead of individual files.
</p>

<p>
There's probably a proper way to do it, but being able to open gitk,
right click on the commit and save it as a file, chop off the mail
headers and use patch -R -p1 was a lot quicker than the subversion
way. (Though SVN is probably a better if you just want to revert one
file from a commit).
