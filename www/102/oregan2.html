<h1>Debian dumps drivers, documentation</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/oregan.html">Jimmy O'Regan</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>
On the 26th of April, the Debian project announced the results of a vote
it held between the 11th and 25th of April. The result of this vote is the
modification of <a href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract">Debian's
Social Contract</a>. Where the social contract had previously read "free
software", these references have been changed to refer to free items in
general. This change was deemed necessary because several people thought
the social contract ambiguous when used in terms of non-software items,
such as documentation and content, and items which are not necessarily
software, such as firmware.

<p>
This decision means that non-free documentation and firmware are to be
removed from the Debian distribution, and placed in non-free, which will
result in a <a
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?safe=images&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&as_umsgid=1P6nW-4CL-19@gated-at.bofh.it">serious delay in the release of
Sarge</a>: the firmware will have to be split from the kernel and the
installer rewritten to handle the separate packages. In addition, many
important GNU packages, such as GCC and glibc, will not have
documentation.

<p>
Last month, Debian announced the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0403/msg00920.html">result of a
vote</a> to remove non-free. The vote, conducted from March 7th to 21st,
is the result of years of discussion, prompted by rms (Richard Stallman).
Unlike most other Linux distributions, Debian has always kept free and non-free
software separate. According to section 5 of Debian's Social Contract, however,
Debian maintains a non-free section as a convenience for its users. Any
software which does not comply with the <a
href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software
Guidelines</a> can be packaged as part of non-free, if it can be distributed at
all.

<p>
This policy has caused arguments between Debian developers and developers
of several open source projects. KDE was not distributed by Debian until
KDE 3.0, because the Qt toolkit which KDE is built upon used licenses
which were incompatible with the GPL used by many parts of KDE. The most
recent loud argument has been with the developers of MPlayer (<a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/debian-legal-200403/msg002
35.html">now resolved</a>), because MPlayer did not include license
details, and in many cases did not comply with section 2a of the GPL for
projects it included (i.e. did not provide changelogs).

<p>
The latest vote was brought about by two main factors: discussions about
the GNU FDL (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html">Free
Documentation License</a>), and binary firmware in the
kernel. The issue of firmware had been known for a <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/3467/">long time</a>; Richard Stallman had
been <a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node.php?id=204">concerned</a> about
this issue, as it meant Linux device drivers could not be used by the
Hurd.

<p>
The issue of the GNU FDL is more recent and possibly the most
responsible for the recent change. Debian had long ago decided that
several of the clauses in the FDL were non-free: Invariant Sections and
Cover Texts in particular, but campaigning by members of the Free Software
Foundation to have documentation considered differently than software
caused more attention to be paid in the examining of this <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2003/debian-legal-200305/thread
s.html">license</a>. A <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0308/msg01031.html">survey</a>
taken by Branden Robinson showed that the majority of Debian developers
considered the FDL non-free, and Manoj Srivastava prepared a <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~srivasta/Position_Statement.html">draft
Position Statement</a> about the GFDL.

<p>
The FDL issue is more easily solved, however, at least in the case of GNU
manuals. Debian will most likely start its own project to bring older
versions of the GNU manuals, which used a different license, up to date.
The firmware issue, however, is the most likely to cause pain among Debian
users.

<p>
Debian users can be (roughly) split into two categories: those who
appreciate Debian's technical excellence, and those who appreciate
Debian's stance on free software. Even outside of Debian, users of free
software feel the impact of Debian's efforts.

<p>
On a technical level, poor comparisons against Debian's apt have driven
RPM-based distributions to adapt similar systems for easily downloading a
package from wherever it resides (using a merged prioritized list of
repositories); and both Red Hat and Mandrake have adopted Debian's alternatives
system, which allows multiple packages of a similar nature to peacefully
coexist on a system.

<p>
On a free-software level, many people have benefited from Debian's
campaigning software authors to use free licensing terms. But on a greater
level, the <A HREF="http://opensource.org/">Open Source Definition</A>, the
document by which open source licenses are judged, is based on Debian's Free
Software Guidelines. The license dissections performed on the debian-legal
mailing list provide a valuable service to the community, as vague or non-free
terms are located and queried.

<p>
There's a growing trend among some Debian developers, however, to give
less leeway when interpreting licenses.

<p>
Three or four years ago, before I was cast back to the land of the modem,
I put myself into the New Maintainer queue, to become a package developer.
I passed the test to determine whether or not I understood the free
software guidelines; in fact, all I needed to do was get my GPG key
signed. It came, therefore, as a shock to see the interpretation of the
guidelines become so narrow, that clauses previously dismissed as merely
obnoxious are now being seen as non-free outright.

<p>
One example of this is the license with the Bitstream fonts, which does
not allow you to sell the software <b>on its own</b>. Previously, the
default reaction was to say "fine, we add scripts and a README to the
package anyway", but a there is a group who would wish to see this sort of
license rejected outright. (It is, however, still acceptable. For now.)

<p>
To sum up: Debian is stripping out binary firmware and documents which use
the GNU FDL (and the OPL [<a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/debian-legal-200402/msg002
83.html">OPL</a>]). Non-free is staying, though, so you can still get the
packages. <tt>vrms</tt> would complain, but vrms will be discarded as the
real rms would consider many of these packages to be free. Debian will be
harder to install, but since they're making great strides with installers,
it'll probably be about the same. People will be divided over whether to
think Debian a bunch of free-software purists, or free-software zealots.
There will be great upheaval, resulting in things looking pretty much the
same. There will be some mocking headlines ("Open source operating system
not so open after all") but we'd have those anyway.

<p>
<sub>Because of the objections to the OPL, I'd like to state that I make no
requirements against printed versions of this article.  Anyone who makes
modifications to it may identify themselves with a nickname, initial, number, or
significant white space. To provide the location of the original document, you
can tell people to go google.</sub>

Jimmy is a single father of one, who enjoys long walks... Oh, right.

<p> Jimmy has been using computers from the tender age of seven, when his father 
inherited an Amstrad PCW8256. After a few brief flirtations with an Atari ST
and numerous versions of DOS and Windows, Jimmy was introduced to Linux in 1998
and hasn't looked back.

<p> In his spare time, Jimmy likes to play guitar and read: not at the same time, 
but the picks make handy bookmarks.
