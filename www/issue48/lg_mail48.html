<BR>Subject: connecting SPARC and 386 for printing purposes

<P> having a SPARCstation 10/20 with Redhat 5.1/SPARC working fine on it, I
wanted to connenct a printer to the system.  Since the parallel port is not
supported under S/Linux, I wanted to connect my SPARC with a cheap 386. The 386
is working under MS-DOS.

<P> I bought an ethernet card for my 386, and connected the in-board ethernet
card on the SPARC with the ethernetcard on the 386. The cable is twisted-pair,
since only two computers are to be connected. 

<P> If I turn on both computers, I can start a testing program for the ethernet 
card on the 386. It will wait for any external signal. 
When booting the SPARC (the 386 sensing for any action), the SPARC checks for 
'eth0' but finds no other computer on the other side.

<P> Questions: 
(1) how can I  let my 386 tell to the SPARC he is there?
(2) How can I make the 386 accessible (that is: the parallel printer port) 
from the SPARC?

<P> Thanks in advance for any help!!

email but were unable to receive (email) with the message:
"Netscape's network connection was refused by the server svr.cma.com

connecting again later."

<BR>Subject: slowwwww ftp and partition problem

<P> I have encountered two problems with linux (Mandrake 6.1) that I haven't
figured out how to overcome.

<P> The first problem is the logon speed for ftp. I have 3 desktops and a laptop
that I have networked with 100 Mbps ethernet. 2 of the 3 desktops are dual
booted with OS/2 and linux, the remaining desktop and the laptop are linux only.
If I try to connect to ftpd on linux with an ftp client on either OS/2 or linux,
there is an approximately 3-5 minute wait before a logon prompt is returned.
This is clearly not running properly! I can use a linux client to an OS/2 ftpd,
and promptly get the logon prompt. I've tried "renice" at both -20 and +20 using
KDE's task manager. What do I need to do to speed this up?

<P> The second problem is:
I have one machine with an 8 Gb drive partitioned into a 2Gb,6Gb, and 128k
swap. Mandrake 6.1 is installed on the 2Gb partition, hda1. The 6Gb partition,
hda3, is an ext2 partition. After linux boots, the 6Gb partition is mounted to
/mnt/hda3. The problem that I've encountered is that when copying files to
/mnt/hda3, it is the first partition that fills up, not the second. What's
happening here? I was using kdisk to monitor the disk size when mirroring
another site to /mnt/hda3, and it wasn't the correct partition that enlarged.
After this occurred, totally filling the smaller partition, I could no longer
umount the partition, either, getting a message "device is busy."

<P> Any help to solve either of these problems??

<BR>Subject: Apollo P-1200 Inkjet Printer

<P> Today I purchased an Apollo P-1200 inkjet printer at
the local drug store (yes, drug store!), the main
attraction being it cost $90 *before* a $50 rebate! 
This is supposed to be a new 'low-end' printer, using
H-P technology.
The downside is that the CD that came with it only
covers installation for 'doze.
Has any other LG reader purchased one of these?  If so,
where can I find an appropriate Linux driver for it?  I
tried the http://www.myapollo.com site, but all that's
there is also 'doze stuff.
If anyone knows the nearest this thing is with any H-P
driver, that would also be useful.  I mainly use a
printer for printouts of txt and html documents, and
with Corel Word Perfect 8.0 for Linux.
Thanks in advance for any assistance.

<BR>Subject: Linux memory woes


<P> Hi, I've just installed Red Hat 6.0 and it's not detecting all of my
memory. I tried typing linux mem=64M at the LILO prompt as recommended
but then the boot-up fails. As it is it only detects 14M or so of my
64M.

<P> I had a look in my bios, and I noticed a line saying that there is a
memory hole at 15M. I'm guessing that this is causing Linux to not see
memory above this, but I don't know why this "hole" is there. I had a
look in my motherboard manual (PC Chips M577) but it didn't mention
anything useful. This hole doesn't seem to upset Windows; is there
anything I can do to get Linux to work too?

<P> I also tried swapping my DIMMs around, thinking that if the hole was due
to a bad DIMM it might move up to 47M (?) but it doesn't.

<P> I've been searching about the web for some insight but  I've had no luck
so far.

<P> Can you help?

<P> Editor,
I'm looking for some help in the Detroit, MI area.
I have a son, 16 yrs old - junior in high school, presently enrolled in
some special projects at school.  One of which is to learn Linux.  He
recently removed Windows from our home computer to install Linux.  After
attempting this for four weeks now he is frustrated and ready to give
up.  Rather than giving up and going back to Windows I thought that it
might be possible to find someone in our area who could help get Linux
up and operating on our computer.  Any suggestions?

<P> Problem with IMAP/Ipop3d server

<P> I have a problem with getting the Ipop3d/Imap server to work.
I use the Imap 4.5 package on my Red Hat 6.1 system.
After installing RH 6.1 and configuring the system all services like
Samba, Apache, FTP, telnet are working fine.
But now I want to add a pop3 server. I checked my /etc/services file
and Imap and pop3 services are enabled here.
in the /etc/inetd.conf file the imap and pop3 services are not enabled,
so i uncomment de following lines

<PRE>
#pop-3   stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd ipop3d
#imap    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd imapd
</PRE>

<P> After uncommenting these lines in the inetd.conf file i kill the
inetd proces to reload /etc/inetd.conf with the following command:
<PRE>
killall -HUP inetd
</PRE>

<P> When i try to telnet in to the linux box now by: 
<CODE>telnet 192.168.1.254</CODE>
(my linux box) i can't connect.
FTP'ing into the linux box gives a problem with the in.ftpd daemon.

<P> When i restore the original /etc/inetd.conf all problems are disappeared
and eveything works fine again.

<P> I can't figure out what is the problem.
I know that the problem starts when changing the /etc/inetd.conf file,
so perhaps its some kind of security issue???

<P> Any help is very welcome,

<P> Hi

<P> I hope this is the right address to right to with a Linux question.

<P> I have a lot of Joliet format CD's made with DirectCD in Windows. Linux
can read the CD's, but on files with long names (Over 20 characters or so)
the filesize is dramatically misreported. 6-7 meg files are listed as 2-3
meg files. Linux can't see it all, and this of course means the file is
pretty much corrupt and of no use in Linux. The CD's are readable fine in
Windows, but not Linux. I've searched high and low and can find no answer
to this problem. I hope you can help.

<BR>Subject: a complaint about issue 47

<P> Hello

<P> I am a regular reader of your gazette magazine who is using windows 95.  I
download and extract your magazine onto a local disk for reading at my
pleasure and I find it very useful and informative about installing and use
of linux.  I intend to move over to a unix like system permanently sometime
in the future and prefer to read your magazine on my windows hard disk while
I'm learning to get to grips with linux.

<P> So onto the complaint!  How can I read your magazine if your tar.gz files
won't extract onto my hard disk!  Why won't they extract or why won't issue
47 extract?  Your issue 47 tar.gz appears to be using a dos/windows reserved
system name for a directory or filename!  the lg/issue47/aux directory can't
be created on my windows disks because aux is one of those names.   Assuming
you or your contributors have used dos and windows in the past why didn't
they know about these names in dos and windows?

<P> Are you trying to stop windows users from learning about linux?

<P> I have been able to read your excellent magazine from issue 1 to issue 46
without any problems and would like to continue until and after I am no
longer using windows as my primary operating system.

<P> Thank you very much

<P> Andy Williams

<P> Not your - but my problem is, that the .gz-file carries date/time-stamp of 
my download - and that's Nov 11.

<P> Assume:
Someone has an old version - including the problems you've fixed. This 
person is looking for the fixed file.
Question:
does this person have to download 'lg-issue47.tar.gz' and unpack it
<UL>
	<LI> to find out he/she got the same (old) stuff
	<LI> or he/she got that, whats wanted.

File date/time can't be the criteria, because of touching by some clients...



<P><STRONG>The <I>Linux Gazette</I> Editor wrote:</STRONG>

<P> I'm not sure how to deal with that situation.  I'll put it in the
Mailbag and see if somebody can come up with a solution.  It might be
worth adding a changelog to the README, but that won't help you decide
whether the file you have is the old one or the new one.  I could link
the new file to a different filename (lg-issue47-fixed-nov-2.tar.gz),
but that would cause too much clutter in the directory and may not be 
welcomed by the mirrors.

<P> It seems like this is what the modification date is for, and if some
programs aren't preserving it on downloads, the solution is to fix those
programs or figure out how to work around them (e.g., set up an alias with
the correct command-line options to preserve the timestamp); otherwise, you'll
have even more problems later with other files, trying to figure out what is
up to date and what isn't.


<P><STRONG>Joachim responded:</STRONG>

<P> maybe one solution could be an aditianal note apended to one of the
files - or a new file with that.
The result should be a different filesize of the newly created tar.gz.

<P> Perhaps publishing the size of the old - and the size of the new file
may help.

<P> November's style *not* a new format;  this is a special edition.  People

<P> There were a great many messages this month, but they will be published in
December's issue, in the same format that October's was.
 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P> I understand that the new format is more search engine friendly so

	format for each primary topic. That way those of us that like to scan a
	whole series can do so without having to bounce back and forth between
	individual articles and the index and the associated page reload
	delays.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Not mentioned before is that cooking the TWDT version is a normal part of
my submission at the end of the month... Mike, this sounds like a request
to normally link that in at the Answer Guy Index level.
 
<P> Of course this returns us to torturing the search engines as it would hit
on TWDT.lg_answerNN.html for every amazing topic in linuxdom.  (Because we
get a wide variety of questions each month, and so few search engines search
for the keywords being anywhere near each other.)   I'm not at all sure 
I favor this.  This is why it hasn't been linked in even though my submits
have included TWDT format subfiles for a long time.  Mike, Jim, any opinions?

<P> However, Rob, to address what you really seem to be asking for: No. Sorry.
I am *not* going to republish the whole of the past answer guy messages
in TWDT format by the topics I selected.  It's weird enough that I only
picked one classification each, when several of them fit more than one.
Several of them are superseded long ago by changes in Linux itself.
It's an *index* ... that means it does *not* contain anything but pointers.
Since it doesn't point to any new content, it would be a waste of time
better spent on the newer messages.  Please bear in mind I do this work
for LG on a volunteer basis.  I have consulting work to do as well, and
would like to limit the time I spend on this.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	As a side note, I usually read the Gazette on my work machine which is

<P> That question is answered in the FAQ.  WinZIP for "that other system"
handles tar, gzip, or tgz files without complaint.   If you insist on

at winfiles.com.

<BR>Subject: to MIME or not to MIME?

<P> I can't take issue with your plea for writers-in to stop using HTML.
But I do take exception to this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P> And if your mailer splits long lines by putting an "="
	at the end of the line and moving the last character or two to the
	next line, please try to turn that feature off. Also some mailers
	turn punctuation and foreign characters into "" and "=E9" and the
	like. I can't reformat those, since I don't know what the original
	character was! -Ed.  P.S. This the first time ever I have resorted
	to blinking text, which I usually despise. I understand some mailers
	don't allow you to turn off this obnoxious "multimedia" formatting.
	But if you can, please do so.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> If your mailer can't understand MIME, and translate a so-encoded
document it back into proper text when appropriate, then your
mailer is broken, and you need either to fix it, or get another
that isn't broken.  It really is as simple as that.

<BR><STRONG>From: Pepijn Schmitz &lt;<A HREF="mailto:p.schmitz@xpuntx.nl">p.schmitz@xpuntx.nl&gt;</A></STRONG>

<P> You can use any extensions you want, as long as you configure your
webserver to use the text/plain MIME type for them. It's the mime type
that the browser uses to decide whether or not to display a file, not
the extension. Only when the web server doesn't provide a MIME type does
the browser try to guess at it using the extension.

<P> Also, regarding your request to turn off quoted printable characters
(, etc.), my question is: why? It's a lot better than leaving the
original 8-bit characters in, which may display very differently on your
screen than the author of the email intended, or may be control
characters which will screw up your terminal settings. Quoted printable
characters (and also the ='s at the end of a line) are part of the MIME
standard and should be converted back by any MIME compliant mail reader.

<P> HTML email is even better, because it allows you to include
international characters in a platform independent way (quoted printable
is not platform independent). If I were you, I'd upgrade to an email
reader that will handle all these things, such as Netscape Messenger.

<BR>Subject: Re: Filename extensions for web program listings

<P> You [the <I>LG</I> Editor] write:  

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	My question is, which filename extensions are safe to use so that
	they'll show up properly as text files in the browsers?  I'm wavering
	between using a language-specific extension (.c, .sh, .pl, .py, etc.)
	vs putting .txt at the end of all of them (or .sh.txt, etc.) What about
	listings that don't have an extension on the source file? They display
	as text on my browser, but do they display properly on yours?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> The correct solution is to use the correct language-specific extensions,
and to configure your server to give files with those extensions the
MIME type "text/plain".  This means that the browser doesn't need to
guess (and guess wrong, in most cases) about what type the file really
is.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Language-specific extensions would be the most ideal, because they
  offer the possibility of syntax highlighting if the browser supports
  it. (Does any browser support this?) However, I know I've tried to
  view files on other sites that I know perfectly well are
  text-readable, but the browser insists on downloading them rather than
  viewing them because it doesn't recognize the type. (Of course, that's
  better than the corollary, where it tries to view .tar.gz or .mp3
  files as text.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> All browsers should use the type supplied by the server in the headers;
only if the server fails to provide a "Content-Type:" header is the
browser permitted to guess.  If your server is Apache, for example, you
can perform the extension-to-type mapping in a ".htaccess" file in the
directory containing the listings -- see the Apache documentation for
details.

<P> Syntax highlighting can be done by providing two versions of the file,
one in plain text and the other (with, e.g., a ".c.html" extension) in
HTML as generated by a clever highlighting programm that you run once,
on the server side.  Again, nothing is left up to the browser; it's all
done on the server.

<P><STRONG>From: Rich Brown &lt;<A HREF="mailto:rabmar@FreeMars.org">rabmar@FreeMars.org&gt;</A>:</STRONG>

<P> My suggestion is xxxxx.c.txt, yyyyy.sh.txt, zzzzz.pl.txt, and so on.

<P> Keep up the great work.  LG is one of my prime resources.



<P><STRONG>From: Anthony E. Greene &lt;<A HREF="mailto:agreene@pobox.com">agreene@pobox.com&gt;</A>:</STRONG>


<P> I'd say no extensions should be used. Most web servers default to text/plain when sending unknown files to browsers. I've never seen a browser that supports highlighting, so language-specific extensions are of limited utility.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>[...]

<P> The answer to both objections is an easy-to-use, GUI, Mime setup
program. The other side of this is that so many software packages ignore
the system (and user for that matter) mailcap and mime-type files in
favor of their own.

<P> No extension should not be an option. Without an extension there is *no*
handle to decide what to do with the file. Add ".txt" to these.

<P> Where an extension is already present, leave it, but provide an
alternative of the same filename + ".txt". Thus "foo.c" would be
available both as "foo.ads" and "foo.ads.txt".

<P> Hope this helps,<BR>
== Buz :)


<P><STRONG>From: walt &lt;<A HREF="mailto:walt@aye.net">walt@aye.net&gt;</A></STRONG>

<P> use the .txt extension

<P> and if you really feal froggy, call it ".text" so the point and click
crowd
doesn't get confused.


<P><STRONG>From: Vrenios Alex &lt;<A HREF="mailto:Alex.Vrenios@motorola.com">Alex.Vrenios@motorola.com&gt;</A></STRONG>

<P> First, I believe that I can "set" my text editor to be called up when a
".sh" or a ".csh" suffix is found. But that might be oo much of a pain for
most people (even me) to do for every possible extension. Here's my
recommendation:

<P> Given mountfloppy.csh, a C shell script that mounds a floppy disk, use
mountfloppy_csh.txt

<P> Given convertIP.c, a C language program that converts an IP address from hex
to dotted decimal or back, use convertIP_c.txt

<P> The use of that underscore is visually descriptive, letting everyone know
exctly what kind of file it is intended to be, which the dot-txt tells your
OS which editor to bring up, for every one of these ascii files.

<P> Are there any files that you are considering setting up that are -not- ascii
text files? If not, maybe this will work. Good luck.


<P><STRONG>From: Jeff Rose &lt;<A HREF="mailto:whisper@iag.net">whisper@iag.net&gt;</A>:</STRONG>

<P> Subject: Filename extensions for web program listings ...

<P> I'm enjoying reading this issue of LG on my Palm Vx after downloading your text version then using a small conversion util to format into PDBformat.

<P> Anyway, I vote for the age-old '.txt' extention for filenames. Why re-invent the wheel? And the less formatting - the better. We have _plenty_ of utilities for conversion: but TEXT vs. PDF, etc., .txt is the painless route.

<P> My $0.02.




<P><STRONG>From: Sylvia Wong &lt;<A HREF="mailto:swon074@yahoo.co.uk">swon074@yahoo.co.uk&gt;</A></STRONG>

<P> Language specific extension wouldn't work coz it's too much hard work
to change the mailcap to browse a few program listing. I prefer language
extension + .txt. This way, when I want to save the file (I'm using
Netscape), I could just delete the .txt and don't have to type a .pl or
.c or whatever.

<P> Does Windose handle files with 2 extensions well? (Or maybe we don't
care about them at all as why would anyone read Linux Gazette using
windose).



<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>
	[I decided to go the <TT>*.sh.txt</TT> route, using a language-specific
	extension when one exists, but always ending in <TT>.txt</TT>.  This

<P> Dear editor,

<P> As you said in your reply to Mr. Offret currently there's no Spanish
translations of Linux Gazette. However, the only Linux on-line magazine
translated into Spanish is Linux Focus (ok, they're your competitors,
but it's the only you can get in Spanish for free). There're also a
number of Linux magazines in Spanish but, as far as I know, they're all
printed editions and they're not free!. Here is a list:

<UL>
	<LI> "Solo Linux"
	<LI> "Linux Actual"
	<LI> "Linux Journal" &lt;-- Yes, it's published in Spanish since october or
september '99!.
</UL>

<P> All of them are published by the same publisher "Prensa Tecnica". I
don't know if you can get these magazines outside Spain.

<BR>Subject: Re: Compiling everything myself

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P> Greetings, ladies and gentleusers. 
	
	I would like to compile my own Linux system. Not just the kernel.
	Everything. I've got enough room and partitions on my
	disk(s) to do it. Do not tell me do buy a distribution. Until now, I've
	tried a lot of them - I count eleven on my shelf - I do not
	like one of them the way I would like a self-created one. 
	
	I just need a place to start. All of the distributions must have started
	at some point or another - how did they do it? Please
	point to a location where info may be obtained. The LDP seem to provide
	_nothing_ concerned to this task. 
	
	Every hint will be highly appreciated. I would also love to contribute
	documentation of the process to the Free Software
	community. 
	
	Every reader is invited to answer via email. 

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> I currently am writing a series or articles that do this exact same
thing: building a new Linux distribution from scratch. Every program is
built from source (though you do need a working Linux to get it initial
working (eg: you need to have a running Linux + compiler to compile a
compiler so you can install that on the new system and start compiling
other things there). 

<P> There's one downside for you I'm afraid: I'm writing these articles for
a Dutch/Belgium Ezine and therefore the articles are in Dutch
(surprised? ;) But wait, there's a good side: I'm also in the process of
translating these articles into English. I decided to start translating
these articles a week or so ago and I haven't started doing so yet (the
usual excuse; too busy with other things).

<P> I'm also thinking of giving them to the LDP so they can be distributed
as a HOWTO of some sort. 

<P> Another reason I haven't started this translation yet is because I don't
know yet how usefull they would be (ie; if people actually are thinking
of doing this besides me). The Dutch articles aren't done yet either
because I got stuck after a while since I don't know 100% how to
configure every program and things like that (building from scratch for
me means also completely making your own sendmail.cf file and things
like the ruleset's are just a bit over my head at the moment).

<P> If you're interested picking up this project I'd be happy to start
translating the articles I already have written and then continue
finishing them with you (and possible other people who read this since I
CC'ed it to LG aswell).

<P> Hope to hear from you soon.

<BR>Subject: Will The Priests Please Refrain From Kicking The Heathens?

<P> Listen my children, and ye shall receive news, of a troublesome plague that
sweepeth across the Land of The Holy Penguin...

<P> Allow me to confess the blight which lay upon my soul:  I am cursed by
professional necessity with an MCSE,  but I want someday to hear the
revelation, the revelation that a Microsoft certification is about as
worthless, as worthless an ArcNet certification would be this very day.
Verily, I further want to have the luxury of looking upon my MCSE and saying
"there shalt not be further need to keepeth this foul brand upon my wretched
soul..."  Can I get an "Amen!?"

<P> The problem remains that, in order to maketh a living, I have to prepareth
my high-school aged disciples for the IT industry at large...and that
necessitates teaching them the blasphemy that is Microsoft. (On a happy
note, I finally got permission to get decent Linux curricula going - it will
be out in January. Refer to
http://linuxgazette.net/issue47/lg_mail47.html for more information, and
pitch some more opinions at me - I'm about half-way down that page.)

<P> But enough of the digression, my dear flock...let us kneel together, to
meditate upon the source of my distress...

<P> However, let's do it in plain English...because all kidding aside, we've got
a growing and serious problem here:

<P> While perusing the web for ideas about what would make a good set of Linux
classes, I come across a disturbing trend, one that was once only an
insignificant bother, but hath now become enough of a problem to warrant
attention:

<P> Linux Over-Zealotry.

<P> I guess it began to demand notice (for me) during the badly-managed PCWeek
NT vs. Linux security tests. Now, I believe that PCWeek made a huge mistake
(they forgot an RPM patch), but, IMO, an honest one...could have happened to
anyone. The reaction sickened me... zealots everywhere began screaming about
how PCWeek was "Microsoft's Whore", and how they were suddenly a part of
some huge conspiracy to quash Linux... I then begin to look about the
various Linux forums, to see even more venom and flame, directed at anyone
who dares to say that perhaps Microsoft does have software that will do
certain things better than Linux.

<P> I have a newsflash for the zealots: In some cases, NT is better than Linux.
In Others, Linux is better than NT. It all depends on your specific needs
and circumstances. Any real-world IT manager with more than three working
brain cells will tell you the very same thing.

<P> Now, what motivated me to write this was an article I noticed, which read:

<P> "The people who complain about it not supporting 100% of games or whatever
don't seem to get what the alternative is. It's easy to say Linux is better
than a certain monoploy(sic) based OS but to put your money (ok it's free
but nevermind) where your mouth is, is something else."

<P>     -James Rogers, recently in osOpinion

<P> Now, if I owned a business, didn't know much about computers, and needed an
OS that was compatible with all of the machines I have, the last thing  I
want to hear is: "Too bad you Microsoft scum!"

<P> If I were Joe Six-Pack, wanting a decent OS  at home to do my bills and send
the occasional e-mail to mom with (and an OS with all the cool games for my
kids, of course), the last thing I want to hear would be: "no way, d00d -
you gotta conform to the Linux way or else! We don't support yer fave games,
so deal with it!"

<P> You notice a trend here (at least I hope you do...): I used regular, typical
situations. If you want Microsoft's piece of The Market Pie, you're going to
have to woo these exact types of people away from their MS-run boxes...

<P> A Very Big Clue: You won't capture the heats and minds of MS users by
calling them "sheeple". You won't do it by insulting their intelligence. You
won't do it by shouting like a spoiled child whenever Linux gets bad press
(no matter the reason.) And most importantly, you certainly won't lure them
away form Microsoft by demanding that they do something the hard way, when
for only $85 they can do it easier with (insert big, bad, monopoly OS
product upgrade here.)

<P> You also won't do it by letting others perform these same indecent act
without nary a comment from members of the Linux community who happens to
catch them in the act...

<P> Now, it had always been (at least, used to always be) the case that Linux
adapted to needs - someone needed a driver for (insert oddball peripheral
item here), odds are that all he/she needed to do was ask, and there was
more than likely a driver written for it by (insert friendly programmer's
name here), and that it can be downloaded for free at (insert URL here).

<P> If Linux wants a bigger market share, this is exactly what needs to continue
happening....customer-focused, friendly service to the world community at
large.

<P> I recall - that there indeed is a perfect article for describing how we can
advocate, and by extension make Linux a dominant OS in this world...I
propose that we all read it at least once in our lifetimes:
http://www.ssc.com/mirrors/LDP/HOWTO/mini/Advocacy.html

<P> After all, if you want converts, you don't do it by kicking the heathens you
want to proselytize...especially not in a consumer-driven market such as
computer products.

<P>  There is one other note: If you see anyone misbehaving, thereby giving
Linux a bad name, then go out of your way to show that person the
light...and in the process showing the world at large that the Linux
community won't tolerate childish behavior...which would make an ever better
impression on the undecided and the unknowing.


<P> Now go forth my precious flock, to spread peace and Open Source among the
perilous world in which we live...
