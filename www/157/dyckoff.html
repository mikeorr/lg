<h1>Away Mission:  A Vision for Embedded Linux</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>


<h3>Away Mission:  A Vision for Embedded Linux</h3>

<p>
On the mark for its organization and on target for the current hot topics
in the Embedded Linux Community, October's M-Vision was a gem in the small
conference category.   The "M" stands for MontaVista, a company committed
to developing Linux kernels and tools for embedded and mobile devices. This
conference, MontaVista Vision, was much more focused and satisfying than
the competing mobile and embedded tracks at last August's LinuxWorld
conference.
</p>

<h3>MVison in general</h3>

<p>
This was an excellent location for a small conference - the SF Palace Hotel
entrance is just about 100-150 feet from the entrance to the regional
'subway' (BART).  There are multiple bus and municipal rail lines that
converge on the area, and it's only a 10-12 minute walk from the ferries.
</p>

<p>
The session presentations were not available on-line before the conference
and there was at first a hint that they would not be posted later, a
mistake cleared up by the first afternoon: most of these were on a 1GB USB
drive (not included in the conference bag) that had to be requested in the
afternoon in the registration area. There were 19 presentations on the USB
stick and about 11 missing. The organizers said that all presentations
would be posted, and most were indeed up after a week.
<br>
<a href="http://www.mvista.com/download/topic.php?t=18">http://www.mvista.com/download/topic.php?t=18</a> 
</p>

<p>
Conference perk: a good roller bag with detachable, separate shoulder
bag. The main bag was not padded for carrying laptops, however. Well,
it would have been nice to be able to use it for every occasion. There
were additional perks in the small expo area, but the best was the 2X
binoculars at one of the MontaVista podiums.
</p>

<p>
Of the breakout sessions, only one room had enchained power cords --
this one had a session with hands-on exercises. My own 15-foot
extension cord was invaluable in connecting to the few outlets in
rooms I attended sessions in, allowing others to share the same power
connection.
</p>

<p>
There was less competition for outlets as most participants took
hand-written notes.  This is largely due, I think, to MV's reliability
in depositing slides and videos on-line after their events.   There
also were a few product managers and marketeers in the audience.
</p>

<p>
On the food front, there was a good full breakfast - it was eggs, potatoes,
meats, fruit, cereals - and there was a decent box lunch with a bag of
gourmet chips that could be carried away.
</p>

<p>
While there was soda and a tea/coffee service at the breaks, there
were no snacks in the first afternoon.  A small amount of breakfast
pastry was available during the AM keynote break.  Cookies and
pretzels were put out for the afternoon break on the second day.
</p>

<p>
For the evening, there was a party with a SF theme and ethnic food
stations. There also was an awesome dessert bar, and Nintendo Wii stations
and computer arcade rides for fun.  Considering that the regular conference
cost was only $595.00 (USD) - $350 for customers - this was a very good
value.
</p>

<p>
Besides good conference swag and edibles, there were a good set of
keynotes and good mix of sessions on 5 separate tracks:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Working with Open Source
<li> High Availability
<li> Bringing up HW
<li> Linux on Freescale
<li> Monte Vista How-to Sessions
</ul>


<h3>M-Vision Keynotes</h3>

<p>
The MVison opening keynote was by Rusty Harris, CEO of MontaVista.
Harris called for more support for open source and explicitly more
contributions by members of the embedded community and more events
like M-Vision. "It's tough to work together when we can't find each
other," he told the attendees.
</p>

<p>
"The embedded Linux community is growing faster and is building more
smart devices than ever, and it shows no signs of slowing," said Rusty
Harris. "Generating this growth during today's economic uncertainty
shows how strongly committed embedded engineers are to getting the
most out of open source."
</p>

<p>
Harris said that the embedded community is driving Linux now that
there is more uniformity and standardization.  But he also spoke
of a need to counteract the PC and Windows bias of developers and OEMs
now that "Linux is the most viable model of open source on the
planet!"
</p>

<p>
He said MV would work more closely with semiconductor companies and
pledged MV resources to work with attendees to build a better embedded
community.
</p>


<p>
The second keynote, "Linux for Internet Devices" was presented by Pete
Kronowitt from Intel's Open Source Technology Center.  He discussed the
growth of Linux in mobile Internet devices (MIDs) and presented Intel's
view, noting that the embedded market has grown rapidly since 2000.
</p>

<p>
"Now there are about about 1.4 billion of us attached to the Internet -- but
there are another 4-5 billion who will soon be attached. They reside in
underdeveloped countries. And affordability will be key to driving the
next 2 billion users and probably the 2 billion users after that."
</p>

<p>
The number of  people using mobile devices to get to the Internet is
expected to triple from 2007 to 2012, and triple again in another 4-5
years. Kronowitt said the smart phone market is exploding and Linux is
growing even faster: over 30% of units in 2012 will be Linux-based.
</p>

<p>
A Forrester survey in February of 2008 asked potential buyers of a mobile
Internet device about the main deterring factor:
</p>

<ul>
<li>  60% of respondents say phone screens are too small to use online
<li>  24% say laptops are too big and heavy to carry every where
<li>  38% say they would pay up to $20 a month for wireless broadband
 service
</ul>

<p>
So this helps to define what Intel thinks of as the 3 pillars needed
for a good mobile Internet experience:
</p>

<ul>
<li>  The right ultra mobile size and performance with long battery life
<li>  Internet compatibility and SW consistency - with video especially
<li>  Always-connected, high-speed wireless
</ul>

<p>
He also gave a plug for Intel's Atom CPU, saying it was the "smallest
piece of silicon we've launched to date with our most advanced (45nm)
technology."
</p>

<p>
Intel launched <a href="http://moblin.org">Moblin.org</a> last year with
the goal of developing a lean FOSS SW stack to operate everywhere.  It also
has an application framework in development. The Moblin community is seeking
to lower component count and costs with optimized memory footprints.
</p>


<p>
But something happened along the way: the netbook exploded on the scene!
This has changed the game for device OEMs and consumers and expanded
Moblin's base rapidly. Currently, Moblin is a Linux-based software platform
for building  applications that run on devices based on Intel Atom CPU.
</p>

<p>
Kronowitt said that Intel isn't doing any advertising for Moblin.org: "Code
speaks louder than ads." He also hinted there would be  new Moblin
announcements in November.

</p>


<p>
In another keynote, Deepak Saxena - a principal in the OLPC project -
addressed "Linux Power Management Challenges for the OLPC and Beyond".
</p>

<p>
At first Saxena summarized vision and history of the
<a href="http://laptop.org/en/laptop/hardware/index.shtml">XO</a> and its current
status. He noted it was built for both the tropics and deserts and also for
rough handling. It needed a new model of networking for remote locations.
The XO was also designed for collaboration up front. It also had a goal of
10-20 hours runtime -- doing something all the while.
</p>

<p>
Saxena pointed out that the key element in power control is that the
graphics engine is not directly linked to the CPU, as in conventional
notebooks - the frame buffer is driven from the display controller. The
wireless chip also works even if the CPU is in sleep mode.
</p>

<h3>State of the Linux Kernel</h3>

<p>
Jonathan Corbet, the editor at <a href="http://lwn.net">LWN.net</a>, gave
the second day keynote.  Corbet reviewed the huge on-going effort that goes
into a Linux release and ways to contribute. He put up a slide showing
the wide diversity of of industry kernel contributors. Red Hat, IBM,
Novell, and Intel are standouts.
</p>

<h4>Who contributes?</h4>
<em>from 2.6.23 -> 2.6.27-rc5</em>

<pre class="code">
(Non-affiliated)         19%
Red Hat                  12%
IBM                       7%

Google                    1%
Astaro                    1%
</pre>

<p>
Corbet also spoke about new Linux file systems, specifically ext4 as a
descendant of ext3. This adds journal checksums and also lifts size
limits from files and filesystems. He also discussed btrfs, which has
a faster fsck, full checksumming, subvolumes and snapshots.
</p>

<p>
Corbet said there was lots of on-going work in drivers and the kernel and
also in userland space. He also asked why a project hasn't been started to
port <a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/817-6223">DTrace</a> to
Linux from Solaris.

<h3>Fast Boot Session</h3>

<p>
One session I'd recommend is "Fast boot: Tips &amp; Techniques for
Improving Linux Start-up Time" by Christopher Hallinan, who contributed to
the u-boot boot loader.
</p>

<p>
A typical embedded system contains a bootloader and kernel, both of
which are typically configured with many useful default features that
may or may not be important for a given product requirement. This
presentation shows how to significantly reduce boot time for embedded
systems.
</p>

<p>
Hallinan saw Intel's 5-second boot demo at the recent IDF conference and
wanted to see how far he could go on his own.  He set this up as a
personal project to see what was do-able in a short time. How short?
How about 5-7 person-days over a month?
</p>

<p>
Hallinan said he thought that Intel spent over 40 man-weeks on its
effort. And he got within 10% of Intel's 4.5-second boot. Not bad at
all.
</p>

<p>
Hallinan based his efforts in part on suggestions from Tim Bird of the
Linux CE forum, who had written a  paper on reducing boot times (<a
href="http://kernel.org/doc/ols/2004/ols2004v1-pages-79-88.pdf">http://kernel.org/doc/ols/2004/ols2004v1-pages-79-88.pdf</a>).
</p>

<p>
One key delay noted there is ide_init, which can take over 3 seconds
at boot time, even in modern Linux kernels. Bird noted that "The call
sequence underneath ide_init() shows that a large number of calls are
made to the routine ide_delay_50ms()...."  Many embedded devices use
SSD storage so this can be stripped out of many embedded kernels.
</p>

<p>
Hallinan used a Freescale MPC8349 Emitx board and U-Boot loader.  This
setup had 256 MB of RAM and 16 MB of flash with a 533 MHz clock, plus
serial and USB and net ports.
</p>

<p>
With a 2.6.25 kernel with typical configuration he had a boot time of
1:15 to cmd prompt, with ~5 seconds for U-Boot alone.
</p>

</p>

<p>
MontaVista also held a technical bootcamp on embedded Linux drivers the day
before M-Vision, pricing it at only about $100 more for M-Vision conference
attendees.
</p>

<p>
The tutorial instructor was Mike Anderson, chief scientist of the PTR
Group, an experienced instructor on embedded development. Hands-on
labs were included covering driver entry points, blocking I/O, moving
between user and kernel space, driver debugging, and other topics.
