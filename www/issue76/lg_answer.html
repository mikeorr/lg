<p>Hey everybody and welcome once more to The Answer Gang.  It's gotten a 
little crowded in our little weekender pub here -- one querent offered
us some cake though, and I'm sure we'll enjoy it...
</p><p>
The statistics:  We now have 60 members in The Gang.  Less than 10
people received no answer whatsoever (and this can be attributed to things
like no subject, or no clear problem description).  Spam is down immensely
since Dan went and made some of the dead trout into a Rube Goldberg machine,
reducing the mails that flew by me to somewhere around 500.
</p><p>
The dumb thing of the month:  Some mailers not only turn stuff into HTML, but
they smush all the spaces out of it themselves, and then put the results in
quoted-printable.  Glork.  Much to my amazement that person got some answers
though I can't tell if they helped him.  But it certainly didn't get pubbed;
I couldn't read it to tell if it was juicy...
</p><p>
But the real Rant Of The Month has to go to <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">The
GNU Project</a> for making it sexy to stop shipping man pages !?!   Sadly this
isn't news.  But definitely sadly, there are so many different places around
that helpful data <em>might</em> be ... and probably isn't, since many packages
pick one and don't have the others ... that we're gonna need a "<tt>wtfm</tt>" 
command.  An rtfm command that <em>works</em> would have to depend on it.
</p><p>
That stands for "Where's The Friendly Manual?"
</p><p>
Particularly egregious since distros now have to figure out their own way to
cook up replacesments, so when some cheerful soul pipes in "Oh just check the
man pages" ... the user can actually find one ... sigh ...  Debian has a 
standard undocumented.7 man page, which can be summarized:
</p><blockquote>
	Yes, we know there's no man page.  It's already been filed as 
	a bug, thus you see this.  If you'd like to write one for this 
	app and submit it we sure would appreciate it.
</blockquote><p>
Don't even get me <em>started</em> about distros that tell you that you can't
get any help at all unless your webserver is working.
</p><p>
Phooey!  I'm not going to let it ruin my weekend.  I'm going to a filk
conference, as I do a couple of times a year.  This particular one is 
<a href="http://www.consonance.org/">Consonance</a> in the Silicon Valley
area.  There will be bunches of computer songs there and I plan to be up 
late singing a few of them.  Regular readers already know about my 
<a href="../issue67/misc/tag/filksong-programmers-daughter.txt"
	>autobiographical filk song</a> but I've written one about my
laptop, and a couple about Linux'ing, too.  I'm not the really prolific
one though.  My friend Steve Savitsky has enough to fill at least a couple
of CDs... and heck, that's just his computer songs

</p><p>
Have a great month everyone.  I know I will!
