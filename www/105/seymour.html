<h1>Design Awareness</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/seymour.html">Mark Seymour</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3>Paradigms are much more than twenty cents</h3>

<p class="editorial"> (See the <a href="../authors/seymour.html">author's bio</a> for the  
preceding articles in this series.)

<p> Now that you've gathered your text and images, identified your files,  
and gotten your approvals and translations, you're ready to add  
structure to your data. To communicate effectively, you must create a  
hierarchy for your data, because our brains try to make order out of  
disorder instinctively.

<p> Early examples are star constellations, where prehistoric humans turned
the jumble of stars in the night sky into the Bear and Orion's Belt and  86
other named patterns (see  <a
href="http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellation_list.html">http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellation_list.html</a>
for a complete list), and playing cards, the first decks of which date
back to 14th century Italy. (For the history of playing cards, check  out
this British site, <a href="http://wopc.co.uk">http://wopc.co.uk</a>, or
this French museum,  <a
href="http://www.issy.com/statiques/musee/index.html">http://www.issy.com/statiques/musee/index.html</a>.)
Related to the Tarot  decks, but without their spiritual context, playing
cards are a very  dense informational unit. Sortable by suit and color and
numeric  position, these 56 ordered objects are used every day by people
who  speak no common language and have no hereditary aristocracy; it is
hard  to imagine another equally successful information system: <br><img
src="misc/seymour/cards.png">

<p> As a design challenge, try creating your own 'found' deck of cards (see  
<a href="http://www.communigate.co.uk/hants/playingcards/page4.phtml">http://www.communigate.co.uk/hants/playingcards/page4.phtml</a> for more on  
the concept) or check out the latest 'high-tech' deck at  
<a href="http://www.zbyte.com">http://www.zbyte.com</a>.

<p> In the five and a half centuries since Gutenberg (see  
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.de">http://www.gutenberg.de</a> and <a href="http://www.dotprint.com/fgen/history1.htm)">http://www.dotprint.com/fgen/history1.htm)</a>,  
several major information paradigms have been created: the book, the  
newspaper, the magazine, and the catalog. Each has its own distinct  
method of presenting information, giving each a traditional, and  
expected, graphical look. Each serves a particular niche in the  
information system; as Umberto Eco noted, "Egyptians could carve their  
records on stone obelisks, Moses could not." (For his complete 1996  
speech, <em>From Internet to Gutenberg</em>, see  
<a href="http://www.italianacademy.columbia.edu/pdfs/lectures/eco_internet_gutenberg.pdf">http://www.italianacademy.columbia.edu/pdfs/lectures/eco_internet_gutenberg.pdf</a>.)

<p> Most web sites emulate, with varying success, one or more of these four  
paradigms.

<p> Books have traditionally been the boring, stuffy cousins of the  
information family. Many now wear splashy full-color dust jackets or  
soft covers, looking more like a poster than a traditional  
leather-bound book: <br><img src="misc/seymour/tov.png">

<p> But their full-color covers are still wrapped around text-only guts,  
and almost all books still bear the half-title page, title page,  
copyright page, contents page, body-of-text organizational scheme  
developed hundreds of years ago. Most are set in one or two fonts, with  
little graphical distinction except on the chapter opening pages, and  
many still carry a quaint notion, the colophon, at the back, where the  
designer mentions the font used, often with the history of the font  
itself. The information in most books is very linear, yet the table of  
contents or the index (found in most non-fiction books), like the  
navigation bar or the search box in a website, allow you to quickly  
find a section of interest or a particular reference.

<p> Books published on-line or as downloadable files have generally  
retained this 'antique' look (see <a href="http://www.ebookmall.com/index.html">http://www.ebookmall.com/index.html</a>  
for examples), and there are many sites that provide free versions,  
especially of older texts: <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/">Project
Perseus</a> and <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.net/">Project Gutenberg</a>.
 Because books are  
often published off-line first, their on-line equivalents are forced to  
mimic the hard copy versions; unfortunately, the long-awaited  
"hypertext revolution" has yet to arrive.

<p> Newspapers have always been a 'cool' medium. Here are pairs of London
(1797 &amp; 1940) and New York (1863 &amp; 1945) newspapers, produced 143
and 82 years apart:
<p>
<table align="center">
<tr>
<td width="40%" align="left"><img src="misc/seymour/london1797.png">
<img src="misc/seymour/london1940.png"></td>
<td width="40%" align="right"><img src="misc/seymour/newyork1863.png">
<img src="misc/seymour/newyork1945.png"></td>
</tr>
</table>   

With the exception of the larger headlines (made necessary by a change  
in selling tactics from hawkers to racks), there's little to  
distinguish one era from another. While newspapers have adopted colored  
inks and color photography, within the limits of their paper stock,  
even the <em>New York Times</em> still looks much the same today, 141  
years after the Civil War issue above:

<table align="center">
<tr>
<td width="35%" align="center"><img
src="misc/seymour/nytfrontpage.png"></td>
<td><img src="misc/seymour/nytbanner.png"></td>
</tr>
</table>   

<p> Even on-line, the <em>Times</em> adopts the familiar multi-column layout:
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">http://www.nytimes.com/</a>, and still
looks like a newspaper. Note that  the paper continues to use an 'Old
English'-style (based on the German  black letter fonts) font for its
nameplate.

<p> This has been a traditional font for newspaper names around the world  
for over 150 years, though the <em>Times</em> of London had Stanley  
Morrison design its own eponymous font (Times New Roman, of course) in  
1931. (For a good overview of how the same font can be made subtly  
different, depending on the type foundry that produces it, see  
<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/times-roman/familytree.htm">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/times-roman/familytree.htm</a>.)

<p> Magazines, of course, have always been a 'hotter' medium. They began  
utilizing illustrations over text early on and, beginning in the 1940s,  
<em>Life</em> and <em>Look</em> made photography their primary information  
tool, often reducing the text to mere captions. Where early designs,  
like the 1944 'General Montgomery' issue of the <em>New York Times  
Magazine</em>, used photography alone, current magazine covers carry  
enough text references to articles inside, just as websites display  
prominent links to subpages, to qualify as tables of contents  
themselves, and often nearly obscure the underlying photo: 

<p> <img  src="misc/seymour/newyork1944.png">
<img src="misc/seymour/vanityfair.png">

<p> Catalogs are mailed out by the truckload (12.8 billion each year,  
averaging 1.7 catalogs per home per week, according to <em>Fast  
Company</em>), and exist on-line for nearly every product. Sears,  
Roebuck was one of the first mass catalogs, beginning in 1888; see  
<a href="http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/acs/1890s/sears/sears4.html">http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/acs/1890s/sears/sears4.html</a> for period  
details. More recently, the famed J. Peterman catalog (the real one,  
not the character from the Seinfeld show) was a high-art version of the  
paradigm, using hand-drawn illustrations and florid prose to describe  
the products. Recently reborn, its on-line version,  
<a href="http://www.jpeterman.com/default.htm">http://www.jpeterman.com/default.htm</a>, mimics the flavor of the print  
version almost perfectly. More commonly, catalogs use massive numbers  
of product photos, often shown in elaborate environments, to promote  
their wares, and their on-line versions usually match (see  
<a href="http://www.ikea-usa.com/">http://www.ikea-usa.com/</a> to compare): 
<br><img src="misc/seymour/ikea.png">

<p> Each of these paradigms, book or newspaper or magazine or catalog, has  
its own manner of hierarchy, and readers expect them to follow the  
norms for the category; a book that's formatted like a catalog might be  
intriguing but, unless its content is of very high value, readers will  
give it only a cursory look. When creating complex and multi-purposed  
information sets, like an annual report or a university catalog or a  
website, however, you have more flexibility; different sections of the  
piece can have very different purposes and require a different data  
structure and, often, a very different design structure.

<p> As noted earlier, there are on-line equivalents of existing  
hierarchical structures: navigation bars are similar to tables of  
contents, and search boxes are automated indices. The magazine cover  
model is used in websites every day, with the added advantage of image  
animation: <a href="http://www.kohler.com">http://www.kohler.com</a> and <a
href="http://www.luerssen.de/frame.html">http://www.luerssen.de/frame.html</a>
are good examples.


<h3>Putting It All Together</h3>
<p> So, how do we create hierarchy? You need to determine a design matrix  
or grid, where items of similar importance or shared relevance  
(headlines at the same 'level', standard text information, charts and  
graphs, photograph captions, etc.) are formatted using the same (or a  
markedly similar) style. Style, of course, consists of all the visual  
characteristics of text (font, font weight, font style, and/or font  
color) plus a number of traditional markers that indicate hierarchy.
These markers, for users of Western European languages, are pretty much  
the same: front, top, left, and size. That means that an object,  
whether it's text or a photo or an icon, that sits in front of another  
(think every web popup you see), or above another, or to the left of  
another, or is bigger than another, is more important. Similarly,  
something that is in a bolder font, or a stronger (not necessarily  
brighter) color, is more important; think of a red headline in  
<strong>bold</strong> versus a black one in a regular weight font. (Italics can  
sometimes raise something in importance, and sometimes diminish it, so  
be careful when using it or anything else from the Font Style menu in  
your design application.)

<p> If you check the front pages of the newspapers above, you'll see they  
all correspond to this system. Web-based materials should obey the same  
structure, with the addition of 'first' or 'early' in the case of  
animations and movies. (Note that I do not include the use of ALL CAPS  
in the emphasis variants; the style has lingered over-long in newspaper  
headlines, and should be used sparingly, if at all. Text is far less  
readable in all capitals, as shown <a  
href="misc/seymour/gettysburg.txt">here</a>, and 'screams' at the  
reader; it should be considered as impolite to use it in print or  
on-line as it is in emails.)

<p> Deciding <strong>what is important</strong> is, oddly enough, the most
important thing you can do. While that pretty photograph you  commissioned,
or the luscious chart you slaved over for hours, might  <strong>seem</strong>
important, is it important to your viewer? After they understand what your
piece is about (are you providing a history of your city, selling a better
mousetrap, or giving directions to the nearest hospital? Never assume that
the reader already <em>knows</em>), having a clear method of finding specific
information in your piece, whether a  thorough table of contents or site
map or index, is often what viewers  hope for and rarely find.

<p> Now slice and dice your carefully prepared data. Determine if a linear  
or some other information flow is appropriate to your material; working  
on-line, of course, lends itself to 'spider' or cross-linked  
information much more than a printed piece. Arrange each section and  
subsection using your chosen pattern, and decide what visual method  
you'll use to both connect them and distinguish them; that becomes your  
design matrix.

<p> Once you've determined the design matrix, meaning that you've set the  
size, font, and color for a headline or body text or a chart caption or  
a footnote along with all the other data types in your files, along  
with the proportional size for photographs and illustrations, you can  
easily apply it to your data. Don't, of course, be rigid in your use of  
the matrix; some things <strong>need</strong> to be in a different font, or a  
different color, to set off their own importance. A change in data type  
(from text to charts and graphs, for instance; the annual report is a  
classic example) may force a change (layout, font structure, or color  
system) to a particular section; consistency can be the hobgoblin of  
design, as well. But changing <strong>everything</strong>, just for the sake of  
change, only leads to dizziness. While it can be visually tempting,  
changing the data structure or the fonts or even just the system of  
color usage, whether on every page or from section to section, can  
confuse and often infuriate the reader. While a pissed-off user who's  
already purchased your book or magazine might just never buy another  
one, the frustrated customer holding your expensively printed and  
mailed catalog or viewing your expensively designed web page will  
merely throw it away or click to another site, and all your investment  
of time and money in its production is instantly wasted.

<p> Choose your fonts and color systems carefully.  Sure, you <em>can</em>
set a headline in 144 point Frutiger Bold Italic Outline in <font
color="#FF9900">#FF9900 orange</font>, and the text beneath it in 6 point
Helvetica Narrow Underlined in <font color="#FF0000">#FF0000 red</font>,
all on a background of <font color="#009900">#009900 green</font>, but do
you <em>have</em> to?  Use colors that don't fight each other, and keep the
choices of colors, fonts, font sizes, and font weights to a minimum.  Two
fonts, one headline and one text, used in three font sizes each  with,
sparingly, bold and italics for each, gives you a lot of  variations.
Picking a small and delicate color palette (see <a
href="http://www.visibone.com/color/">http://www.visibone.com/color/</a>,
<a
href="http://www.websitetips.com/color/">http://www.websitetips.com/color/</a>,
and <a
href="http://www.webcolors.freeserve.co.uk/">http://www.webcolors.freeserve.co.uk/</a>
for good web color systems) will keep the reader from going blind or
gagging. Of course, there  are situations (a good thrash site, for
instance; see <a
href="http://punkrockskateboards.com/stage_dive.htm">http://punkrockskateboards.com/stage_dive.htm</a>
or <a href="http://www.tenfootpole.com/">http://www.tenfootpole.com/</a>)
where anything goes, and the reader will welcome the best, or at least the
weirdest, you can offer.

<p> Now that you've applied your hierarchy system to the design of each  
section, make sure you step back (literally, if necessary) and see if  
the overall system is working. It is too easy to get caught up in  
manipulating the little bits (captions, headlines, footnotes, headers  
and footers, etc.) and not notice the glaring failure of the whole  
piece to provide a clear and understandable flow of information to the  
reader.

<h3>The Closing Note</h3>
<p> Creating hierarchy can be as simple (using ever-smaller font sizes) or  
as complex (using cross-linking and color systems and font families and  
animated buttons) as you want. But not doing it thoughtfully, or  
consistently, can be as if you never did it at all. Providing the  
reader with an elegant, easy-to-use system of determining importance  
and navigating information is a solution worth the effort.

<em>
<p> I started doing graphic design in junior high school, when it was still
the Dark Ages of technology. Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were both eleven
years old, and the state of the art was typing copy on Gestetner masters.
I've worked on every new technology since, but I still own an X-acto knife
and know how to use it.

<p> I've been a freelancer, and worked in advertising agencies, printing
companies, publishing houses, and marketing organizations in major
corporations. I also did a dozen years [1985-1997] at Apple Computer; my
first Macintosh was a Lisa with an astounding 1MB of memory, and my current
one is a Cube with a flat screen.

<p> I've had a website up since 1997, and created my latest one in 2004. I'm
still, painfully, learning how web design is different from, but not
necessarily better than, print.
