<h1>Common problems when trying to install Windows on KVM with virt-manager</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/silva.html">Anderson Silva</a></b></p>

<p>Let me start with a very basic question: why, oh why, would anybody want to run 
Windows on their Linux workstation? A web developer could argue that they need a
 way to test their applications on multiple versions of Internet Explorer. A 
system administrator could argue that they need a sandbox to test an email client
 like Outlook, or play around with integrating a Windows workstation into their 
network. In my case, I want a Windows virtual machine on my laptop because I 
want to be able to watch movies on Netflix. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)" />
</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with KVM, I would recommend that you take a look at the 
following guides before you read these tips:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If you are running Fedora: 
<a href="http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/13/html/Virtualization_Guide/">http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/13/html/Virtualization_Guide/</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    If you are running Ubuntu: 
<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The following is a set of tips and quick fixes I've collected over the last 
few months to get a Windows XP installation working under KVM being managed by 
virt-manager. Some of these tips will work for other versions of Windows, as 
well as for other Linux distributions other than Fedora 13 (my current 
distribution).</p>

<h3>Tip #1</h3>

<p>Before you even install the KVM, libvirt, and virt-manager packages, check your 
BIOS setting. Some computers, like Intel-based Lenovo Thinkpads, have a 
'Intel (R) Virtualization Technology' option turned off. You must turn that 
on for virtualization to work.</p>

<h3>Tip #2:</h3>

<p>Set selinux to permissive mode, or turn it off completely.</p>

<p>To do this:&nbsp; edit /etc/selinux/config and change the SELINUX 
parameter.</p>

<h3>Tip #3:</h3>

<p>
If you are going to install Windows from a CD/DVD (instead of an ISO file), make
 sure that the user which you are running virt-manager as, has read access to the 
optical drive device on your system. Otherwise, virt-manager may not let you 
select your drive as an install media location.</p>

</p>

<h3>Tip #4:</h3>

<p>During the installation of Windows XP (as far as I know it doesn't happen with 
Vista or 7), the error "A disk read error occurred" shows up during boot time, 
not allowing you to complete the installation. The problem here is that for 
whatever reason, virt-manager by default creates disk images using the raw 
format, and the Windows XP installer does not like that format. The solution is 
to convert your disk image to qcow2 format.</p>

<p>
<img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_93drjvkrfs_b.jpg" style=HEIGHT:463.32px;WIDTH:648px alt="Screenshot - A disk read error occurred">
</p>

<p>
To convert your existing image:
</p>
<pre class="code">
cd /var/lib/libvirt/images/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # or whatever other location you 
keep your images at
qemu-img xp.img -O qcow2 xp-qcow2.img
</pre>
<p><b>Note 1:</b> You may have to start the installation process again, and 
re-format the disk, after converting the image to qcow2 format.</p>
<p><b>Note 2: </b>Under Fedora 13, I've tried creating qcow2 disk images before 
starting the installation via virt-manager, but I got the same "A disk read 
error occurred" problem.</p>

<h3>Tip #5:</h3>

<p>Once Windows is installed, if you are not able to increase the screen 
resolution of your virtual machine, check the virtual video driver that your virtual 
machine is using. If it is not the 'vga' model, change it, and re-start your 
virtual machine.</p>

</p>

<h3>Tip #6:</h3>

<p>This tip, for whatever reason, was the one that took me the longest to figure out.
 It took long not because it was a hard problem, but mostly because I was 
looking at it from the wrong angle. As I said in the beginning of this article, I wanted
 a Windows virtual machine on my laptop to watch movies, and even though I did 
get Windows installed, I could not get the sound working on it.</p>

<p>One of the most frequent answers I found on the web was about exporting the 
variable QEMU_AUDIO_DRV with different parameters to get the sound working 
correctly, but none of the parameters worked for me. I also read that at least 
in Fedora, vnc doesn't support audio, which basically meant that I needed to find 
another way to view my desktop. That's when I decided to shift gears and look at
 SDL instead of vnc.</p>

<p>To do that, the following must be done:</p>

<p><img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_95g9js3hht_b.jpg" style=HEIGHT:464.13px;WIDTH:648px alt="Screenshot - Hardware Details">
</p>

<p>1. Remove the 'Display 0' property under Hardware Details, and add a new Graphic
 Device using 'Local SDL Window' instead of VNC Server.</p>

<p><img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_96dhxczpqw_b.jpg" style=HEIGHT:463.32px;WIDTH:648px alt="Screenshot - Add a new Graphics Device">
</p>

<p>2. Edit the /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf, and get qemu-kvm to run as your user:</p>
<pre class="code">
user = "ansilva"
group = "ansilva"
</pre>

<p>3. Restart libvirtd:</p>
<pre class="code">
service libvirtd restart
</pre>

<p>Now, if you open up virt-manager, and start up your Windows virtual Machine, it 
should show up as a separate window outside the virt-manager GUI.</p>

</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Hopefully, these six tips will be enough for you to get your Windows virtual 
machine running well enough under KVM and virt-manager, so you can do your work 
or even have your fun. I highly recommend that you also take a look at the command 
line tool virsh for managing your virtual machines, which could easily be the 
subject for an entire new article in the near future. Stay tuned.</p>
