Hi list
Any insights into how i can go about designing a SMTP protocol monkey
or any protocol monkey for that matter.
</p>

<p>
What exactly does RFC 2975 (The Infinite Monkey Protocol Suite (IMPS)
mean? Any simple *plain text* explanation?
</p>

No idea but is it along the same lines as the RFC for TCP/IP over avian 
carriers is it?

Sorry, but I don't know. This is the first time in my 30+ years in IT that 
I've ever heard of the term "protocol monkey". It is certainly not something 
in the mainstream, although it /might/ be an up-and-coming technology for 
all I know.

<pre>

<p>
It probably means that you've been had. RFC2975 is "Introduction to 
Accounting Management" (see ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc2975.txt), 
not "Infinite Monkey Protocol Suite".
</p>

<p>
Otoh, RFC2795 is "Infinite Monkey Protocol Suite", written by S. Christey of 
MonkeySeeDoo Inc, on April 1, 2000 (see 
ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc2795.txt). The date and author 
indicates that you have been the unwitting butt of a late April Fools joke.

<p>
Good one. 
</p>

<p>
Regarding the original query. I don't think RFC 2975 is about
monkeys or flying monkeys even in Oz.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps what is meant by a protocol monkey is an algorithm that has a
way of intervening in a network protocol without the two endpoints
noticing. The reference is to the Panchatantra story about the monkey
and the two cats.
</p>

<p>
That's enough animal references for now.

<p>
Depends on the protocol. Here is how the one for SSH works.
</p>

<p>
1. Client tries to connect to the server. The monkey intercepts and
relays.
</p>

<p>
2. The server sends its host key. The monkey intercepts and sents its
own host key instead.
</p>

<p>
3. The user gets asked by the client "Are you sure this is the right
key?" and a not-so-careful one accepts the monkey's host key in place
of the server's host key.
</p>

<p>
4. From this point on all conversation between the client and host
passes through the monkey who decrypts/modifies every bit.[*]
</p>

<p>
Of course, for the monkey to work it needs to ensure that all
network traffic between the client and server passes through it.
</p>

<p>
Regards,
</p>

<p>
Kapil.
</p>

<p>
[*] In case the user/server are using password-based authentication.
When key-based logins are used the monkey can do much less.

This means that the monkey sits on a device between the client &amp; the
server such that all traffic pass through it and thus giving it the
ability to change / intercept the data.
</p>

<p>
What are the possible devices on which a monkey can be set up?

<p>
Can't say. A router/bridge/gateway.
</p>

<p>
Note that the monkey might not be one but a tribe(!). One monkey
actually sits on the device relaying data to/from a smarter monkey
(GNU/Linux box of course!) which does the actual mangling of the
protocol.
</p>

<p>
Usually, for a (network) protocol to be considered insecure it is
enough to describe the monkey algorithmically so I haven't actually
coded one. Have a look at "dsniff" for a real Monkey program.

<p>
Well, I can think of two courses of action:
</p>

<p>
1) Go talk to the prof and ask for some clarification. The RFC you pointed 
out was meant to be a joke; if the prof has some serious purpose for this 
project, perhaps he can shed some light on the meaning /to your project/ of 
the joke RFC.
</p>

<p>
2) A non-frivolous interpretation of the "IMPS" RFC suggests that a program 
(or suite of programs) could exercise any given protocol by throwing random 
data at it. The more randomness and the more data generated, the likelier 
that acceptable traffic for that protocol would be generated. This could be 
one way to test the robustness of a protocol (albeit, a very expensive and 
time consuming way). Again, the prof should be able to shed some light on it.
</p>

<p>
In any case, your "protocol monkey" isn't accepted practice. Either your 
prof is trying to get you to think, or he's playing a joke on you.

Sorry, it wasn't meant to be be! I am also not sure that this is
actually the monkey whose tail (oops) tale inspired the phrase
"monkey-in-the-middle". I amy also be wrong about this being

<p>
In brief. Two cats get a piece of cake and want to share it. The
monkey says it will help as it has a scale/balance. The monkey
divides the cake in two and puts a piece on each side of the balance.
Each time it bites of the heavier piece "just a bit" to make it
smaller. At the end of the tale we have a contented monkey and two
hungry cats.
</p>

</pre>

<p>
Yes the plots are quite similar to tales elsewhere. The great art is
in the story-telling---a <strong>performing</strong> art that died somewhat after the
printing press.

<p>
For more about this "monkey", as well as getting it off your back and
monkey-attack prevention, google for "MITM" or "Man In The Middle
Attack" - where you'll find out all about the lives of Alice, Bob, and
Carl (or Carol, or Cathy - or even Mallory. Who says geeks aren't
imaginative?)
</p>

<p>
Also, do note that the author of 'dsniff' "lives" at
'<a href="http://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/dsniff">http://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/dsniff</a>'. I wonder if that could be the
source of the original "monkey" comment by the professor?

&gt; &gt; Incidentally, the Panchatantra stories reminded me very strongly of the
&gt; &gt; tales of Krylov (who had clearly cribbed his plots from Aesop, but
&gt; &gt; wrapped them in beautiful, poetic Russian.)
&gt; 
&gt; Yes the plots are quite similar to tales elsewhere. The great art is
&gt; in the story-telling---a <strong>performing</strong> art that died somewhat after the
&gt; printing press.

McLuhan's "Understanding Media" mentions exactly that as an example of
the things that we lose as we gain new technology. That's one that I
definitely miss. On the other hand, there are now people who make a
living at story-telling; I was lucky enough to hear one of them, Mark
Lewis, after hours at Renaissance Fair (I was working the Fair myself);
an amazing experience. He's not the only one, either. As long as
appreciation for these arts exists, there will be people who are drawn
to it as performers.
