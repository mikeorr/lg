First off, TWDT is no longer TWDT. If you click on TWDT you find that the 
mailbag has "Thread continues here" links. Could we make TWDT be TWDT?
</p>

<p>
Secondly, we have the answers to last month's geekword. It would be nice to 
have the questions with it, so anyone that wants to admire the subtlety of 
the clues, or pick nits, don't have to flick between windows.

Admiration of subtlety? Are we talking about the same author/puzzle? <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
</p>

<p>
While I did not design the geekword as it appears now, I assume the 
previous puzzle's clues were not included as no newspaper does so (space 
is too valuable in print).
</p>

<p>
However, I do like your idea and, time permitting (key point), I will try 
adding it to the formatting for the coming issue. However, if I am 
crunched for time and have only an "ok" layout then I will save it for the 
April LG.

<p>
Thank you for your input,

Reasonable - I'll add it to the ongoing projects page as something for
the Python team. Thanks for calling it to my attention.
