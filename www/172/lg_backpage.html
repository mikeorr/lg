<h1>The Backpage</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/okopnik.html">Ben Okopnik</a></b></p>

<p>
During the past month, LG has gone through several changes. For one thing,
our former proofreading coordinator, Rick Moen, is no longer associated
with LG in any capacity as of the 4th of last month; for another, our lists
are now hosted at a competent, reliable, responsive webhost (on a Linux
box, of course!) This provides additional reliability in our
infrastructure: if something should happen to our list server, LG itself
will not be affected; if the LG server should get whacked by an asteroid
strike, we'll still have a communication channel where we can organize
asteroid removal efforts and silicon chip-gluing parties, or whatever else
is necessary.
</p>

<p>
(A request for anyone who was subscribed to 'lg-announce', or anyone who
would like to be notified when the new issues come out: the membership
roster for this list was the only thing that I didn't manage to save from
our previous hosting arrangement - sorry about that! If you'd like to be
pinged about new issues, please go to
<a href="http://lists.linuxgazette.net/listinfo.cgi/lg-announce-linuxgazette.net">http://lists.linuxgazette.net/listinfo.cgi/lg-announce-linuxgazette.net</a> and sign up. Thanks!)
</p>

<p>
The Linux Gazette itself, by the way, remains hosted at <a
href="http://fullhartsoftware.com">Fullhart Software</a>, through the kind
offices of Thomas Fullhart, who also provides us with his stellar system
administration services. <em>(Unprompted ad: Thomas is awesome. I've known him
for years now, and can personally tell you stories of generosity, grace
under pressure, and great responsiveness and flexibility in tough times. If
you need great hosting, talk to him.)</em>
</p>

<p>
In addition, we've also decided to commit more time and effort to a "pet
project" that's close to my own heart: improving the quality and quantity
of technical writing available to the Open Source community by finding
interested authors and supporting them with positive editorial feedback and
critique. During my tenure as Editor-in-Chief, I've received a lot of
pleasure from watching a number of our authors grow and mature as technical
writers, and seeing their talents recognized in the business world. I take
a lot of pride in believing that LG was at least partly instrumental in
their current success, and that their experience here will improve their
lives and careers from here forward. It's all part of "Making Linux Just a
Little More Fun!" - by improving everyone's experience with Open Source
projects.
</p>

<h3>Recent Events: A Look Inside LG</h3>

<p>
Right after publication of the last issue, LG went through one of those
shake-ups for which Open Source projects and communities are well-known.
Tempers flared, metaphorical furniture was stomped into kindling, high
horses were brought out of their stables and ridden hard... and the end
result was a change in methods and policy. In this case, a change designed
to better serve our readership and our community.
</p>

<p>
I want to emphasize this point: as LG's Editor-in-Chief, I do my best to
<em>avoid</em> setting policy. I believe that, when given a mission and
left to their own devices within wide bounds, people will create solutions
and answers that will range from more-or-less reasonable to breath-takingly
wonderful. Policy is the thing that sets those bounds - and so, in the
traditional spirit of the Open Source community, I try to keep them as
broad possible.
</p>

<pre class="code">
UNIX was never designed to keep people from doing stupid things, because
that policy would also keep them from doing clever things.
 -- Doug Gwyn
</pre>

<pre class="code">
The handles of a craftsman's tools bespeak an absolute simplicity, the
plainest forms affording the greatest range of possibilities for the user's
hand. That which is overdesigned, too highly specific, anticipates outcome;
the anticipation of outcome guarantees, if not failure, the absence of
grace.
 -- William Gibson, "All Tomorrow's Parties"
</pre>

<p>
There is, however, a failure mode inherent in this method (as there is in
all methods). It is that of doing too little for too long - at which point,
flamewars erupt and furniture turns into splinters. In effect, the failure
is mine: as always, the captain of the ship is responsible for the welfare
of the ship and crew, and any failures are completely and utterly his
responsibility. For that, I apologize to anyone harmed by my previous
unwillingness to do the ugly but utterly necessary housecleaning - and
hereby, publicly, set the LG policy to handle those problems from here
forward.
</p>

<h3>In the "This shouldn't be news to anyone" category, we have...</h3>

<p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Be Polite. No Rudeness Allowed.</strong> This is the
all-encompassing policy statement that should have been at the top - Rule
#0 - of the LG list. Again, my fault - and my apologies to everyone - for
not realizing that it needed to be spelled out explicitly and that it
<em>was</em> this critical of an issue. This omission has now been
rectified, and will be enforced; by our list administrator in The Answer
Gang (my own posts explicitly <em>not</em> excluded; I confess to owning a
temper), and by me in our published material. 'Nough said.
</li>

<li><strong>LG is not anyone's personal rant forum.</strong> As the
Editor-in-Chief, I have entertained - and invited - viewpoints and styles
including some that <a href="..//117/raby.html">I disagree with</a>, some
that can be seen as <a href="../170/starks.html">inflammatory</a>, some
that are <a href="../109/park.html">completely opposite</a> of my own
thoughts on best computing practices, and so on. There's almost no
restriction on content other than LG's loose mandate of "making Linux just
a little more fun" - which, for the purposes of article acceptance, means
"related to Open Source computing, or at least humorous and relevant to
computing in some fashion."
</li>

<li><strong>There's no such thing as a stupid question.</strong>
<a href="http://lists.linuxgazette.net/mailman/admin/tag">The Answer Gang list</a>
exists, and has always existed, for the purpose of answering Linux
questions. As many such lists do, it has developed its own culture, one
that is amazing and powerful in its own right: it has produced some
<a href="../102/lg_backpage.html">hilariously funny exchanges</a>, a huge
number of <a href="../faq/kb.html">excellent answers and solutions</a>, and
- for those who participate - a terrific learning environment. It has also,
however, had instances of treating "clueless" questions - or, more to the
point, the people who ask them - less than respectfully. I want to make it
clear, here and now: there is NO such thing as a clueless question, this is
not alt.sysadmin.recovery, and there's no one here entitled to be a <a
href="http://www.iinet.net.au/~bofh/">Bastard Operator From Hell</a>.
<strong>Everyone</strong> is welcome to post and participate in TAG;
<strong>no one</strong> is allowed to be rude. The rule is, "if you can't
be pleasant, don't post."
</li>
</ol>
These rules also apply to the editing process all articles pass through.
The rules are not written in stone and shouldn't be too complicated.
If you have ideas for improvement or suggestions, we'd like to hear your
opinion.
</p>

<p>
(For those who, in times past, stopped by TAG and left due to a high
level of spam: that's gone as well, since we've changed our subscription
policy. <a
href="http://lists.linuxgazette.net/mailman/admin/tag">Come on in</a> - the
water is fine!)
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>So, what's left in LG?</h3>
<p>
Everything except the unpleasantness and the rudeness. In fact, from a
certain perspective, you might say that there are now <em>more</em>
possibilities and open avenues within LG: all relevant questions are now
welcome in TAG, and everyone will be treated in a civil fashion. Let's
focus on the answers to your questions and on how to exchange knowledge.
</p>

<p>
None of the foregoing should be a surprise. Perhaps one way to put all of
this into context is to consider the Linux Gazette as a
Linux-representative "business": although none of us get paid in cash for
our work here, we get "paid" in community respect, in recognition, and in
reputation - things that are important to every other service-sector
business. All of the above, points of policy and all, is nothing more than
clarification of LG's stance toward you, its "customers":
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li> We've swept out all the dark corners so that you won't get bitten by
any spiders. In addition, we've hung up some lights in those corners to give
you a beacon for navigation.
<li> Going forward, we'll make sure that all of our public spaces - and
that's all of LG - stay clean, bright, shiny, and pleasant.
<li> Pleasant, mannerly people are always welcome - as customers, staff,
friends, and neighbors. We'll even give you a 100% discount on all our
articles for as long as you participate (don't worry, we'll still make a
profit; we've got a great markup.)
</ul>
</p>

<p>
There will probably be some bobbles as things shake down; there inevitably
are. I don't expect instant perfection out of anyone (least of all myself.)
But I want everyone to know, and understand, that these are our goals; this
is what we're aiming for.
</p>

<p>
Welcome to your new, and hopefully ever-improving, LG.

Ben is the Editor-in-Chief for Linux Gazette and a member of The Answer Gang.
</p>

<p>
<em>
Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became interested in electricity
at the tender age of six, promptly demonstrated it by sticking a fork into
a socket and starting a fire, and has been falling down technological
mineshafts ever since. He has been working with computers since the Elder
Days, when they had to be built by soldering parts onto printed circuit
boards and programs had to fit into 4k of memory (the recurring nightmares
have almost faded, actually.)
</p>

<p>
His subsequent experiences include creating software in more than two dozen
languages, network and database maintenance during the approach of a
hurricane, writing articles for publications ranging from sailing magazines
to technological journals, and teaching on a variety of topics ranging from
Soviet weaponry and IBM hardware repair to Solaris and Linux
administration, engineering, and programming. He also has the distinction
of setting up the first Linux-based public access network in St. Georges,
Bermuda as well as one of the first large-scale Linux-based mail servers in
St. Thomas, USVI.
</p>

<p>
After a seven-year Atlantic/Caribbean cruise under sail and passages up and
down the East coast of the US, he is currently anchored in northern
Florida. His consulting business presents him with a variety of challenges
such as teaching professional advancement courses for Sun Microsystems and
providing Open Source solutions for local companies.
</p>

<p>
His current set of hobbies includes flying, yoga, martial arts,
motorcycles, writing, Roman history, and <strike>mangling</strike> playing
with his Ubuntu-based home network, in which he is ably assisted by his <a
href="../authors/tanaka-okopnik.html">wife</a>, <a
href="../authors/okopnik1.html">son</a> and daughter; his Palm Pilot is
crammed full of alarms, many of which contain exclamation points.
</p>

<p>
He has been working with Linux since 1997, and credits it with his complete
loss of interest in waging nuclear warfare on parts of the Pacific Northwest.
