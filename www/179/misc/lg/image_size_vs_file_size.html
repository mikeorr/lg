<p>
I've always been curious about the huge disparity in file sizes between
certain images, especially when they have - oh, more or less similar
content (to my perhaps uneducated eye.) E.g., I've got a large list of
files on a client's site where I have to find some path between a
good average image size (the pic that pops up when you click the
thumbnail) and a reasonable file size (something that won't crash
PHP/GD - a 2MB file brings things right to a halt.)
</p>

<p>
Here's the annoying thing, though:
</p>

<pre>
ben at Jotunheim:/tmp$ ls -l allegro90_1_1.jpg bahama20__1.jpg; identify allegro90_1_1.jpg bahama20__1.jpg 
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ben ben   43004 2010-09-28 19:43 allegro90_1_1.jpg
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ben ben 1725638 2010-09-28 14:37 bahama20__1.jpg
allegro90_1_1.jpg JPEG 784x1702 784x1702+0+0 8-bit DirectClass 42kb 
bahama20__1.jpg[1] JPEG 2240x1680 2240x1680+0+0 8-bit DirectClass 1.646mb 
</pre>

<p>
The first image, which is nearly big enough to cover my entire screen,
is 42k; the second one, while admittedly about 3X bigger in one
dimension, is 1.6MB+, over <strong>40</strong> times the file size. Say *what*?
</p>

<p>
And it's not like the complexity of the content is all that different;
in fact, visually, the first one is more complex than the second
(although I'm sure I'm judging it by the wrong parameters. Obviously.)
Take a look at them, if you want:
</p>

<p>
<a href='http://okopnik.com/images/allegro90_1_1.jpg'>http://okopnik.com/images/allegro90_1_1.jpg</a>
<a href='http://okopnik.com/images/bahama20__1.jpg'>http://okopnik.com/images/bahama20__1.jpg</a>
</p>

<p>
So... what makes an image - seemingly of the same type, according to
what "identify" is reporting - that much bigger? Does anybody here know?
And is there any way to make the file sizes closer without losing a
significant amount of visual content?

<p>
It has to do with the compression of the image. I am going to guess someone
else will have a scientific explanation, so I am not even going to bother...
There is an interesting graph on wikipedia here:
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG#JPEG_compression'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG#JPEG_compression</a>
</p>

<p>
But related to your photo, one thing that I noticed is if you open your up
with Image Viewer, and keep zooming in you will quickly notice that the
smaller photo will start getting 'pixelated' first.
</p>

<p>
This is very useful for what digital cameras call 'digital zoom' which
basically the process of zooming into the 'density' of DPI of the image,
instead of using optics.
</p>

<p>
Not sure if it helps at all, but I thought I'd say something :-p

I believe it has something to do with the file compression and resolution.
If you were to compress the image by lowering the image quality to something
like 75%, you will find the image size to be reduced even more. also, the
resolution plays a part. the higher the resolution, the larger the file size
because it has more pixels to store.

On top of that, most digital cameras add a thumbnail of about 1/20th
of the file size, lots of cameras duplicate information in EXIF, IPTC,
and XMP (which is uncompressed XML), etc., but the compression - and,
as it's a lossy compression, the homogenisation of similar areas - it
the main factor.

The thing is that the maximum "zoom" at which these are going to get
displayed is 1. However, there's no way to make a safe guess for what's
still going to look OK at a given compression.

<p>
Right - which is why buying digital cameras based on just "zoom ratio"
is silly; you have to distinguish between optical and digital zoom.

<p>
Well, not necessarily (maybe yours, yeah), but the photography that I do, a
lot of times, I will crop an image to give the 'digital zoom' effect, and
for a computer screen it still looks ok.
</p>

<p>
For example:
</p>

<p>
<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/afsilva/5018924879/'>http://www.flickr.com/photos/afsilva/5018924879/</a>
<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/afsilva/4884510746/'>http://www.flickr.com/photos/afsilva/4884510746/</a>
</p>


<p>
With a very high resolution, I was able to crop in and give the impression I
was taking a photo with some major zoom lens <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">

<p>
(I've clipped a lot of non-relevant info, like the EXIF data from
'bahama' and red/blue/green skew, kurtosis, etc. for both images.)
Please note that the compression type is the same for both - and the
number of pixels between the two has only about a 2:1 ratio. Moreover,
'bahama' has a <em>lower</em> resolution than 'allegro'.
</p>

<p>
GIMP tells me that the smaller image takes 12.8MB in memory, and the
larger one 34.6MB; again, about a 3:1 ratio - all reasonable, if it
wasn't for that 40:1 file size ratio.
</p>

<p>
Trying to save them from GIMP shows that 'allegro' has a current
compression of 85, while 'bahama' is at 98. That's about the only thing
I can see that would make a significant difference... saving 'bahama' at
a compression of 85 gives me a 451kB file. A lot smaller, but still huge
by comparison.

This one stood out to me. A quick google leads here:

<p>
"Common sampling factors used are 2x2, 2x1, 1x2, and 1x1.
2x2 is the default setting used in the IJG library and is therefore quite
common.
2x1 is the "traditional" setting coming from video. Nearly all digital
camera firmwares today still use this setting. Note also that the sample
quantization tables given in the JPEG standard where derived with this
setting.
1x2 is the result of lossless rotation of 2x1 sampled JPEG files.
1x1 is the recommended setting for higher quality JPEG images.

Looking at the first link leads to:

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It has to do with the compression of the image. I am going to guess someone
&gt; &gt; else will have a scientific explanation, so I am not even going to bother...
&gt; &gt; There is an interesting graph on wikipedia here:
&gt; &gt; <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG#JPEG_compression'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG#JPEG_compression</a>
&gt; 
&gt; On top of that, most digital cameras add a thumbnail of about 1/20th
&gt; of the file size, lots of cameras duplicate information in EXIF, IPTC,
&gt; and XMP (which is uncompressed XML), etc., but the compression - and,
&gt; as it's a lossy compression, the homogenisation of similar areas - it
&gt; the main factor.
</pre>

<p>
OK, that makes sense. And you're right, EXIF isn't a major factor here:
'jpegoptim --strip-all', which strips EXIF and comments, only reports a
minimal difference.
</p>

<pre>
ben at Jotunheim:/tmp$ jpegoptim -nt --strip-all bahama20__1.jpg 
bahama20__1.jpg 2240x1680 24bit Exif  [OK] 1725638 --&gt; 1704954 bytes (1.20%), optimized.
Average compression (1 files): 1.20% (20k)
</pre>

<p>
I think I'm starting to close in on an idea, like recommending, say, a
compression of 90 or so to my client. At 1:1, that'll probably look
fine, and it'll let him have all his images protected from crashing by a
safe margin.
</p>

<pre>
ben at Jotunheim:/tmp$ for n in `seq 80 90`; do convert -quality $n bahama20__1.jpg $n-bahama20__1.jpg; done
ben at Jotunheim:/tmp$ ls -lS [0-9]*bahama20*

<p>
Hmm, that's starting to look pretty reasonable. Even at 90, shrinking
the image down to 1/3 the size (with, presumably, a corresponding file
size reduction) would get it down into the 200k range - which would be
great. Heck, even 650kB is a big improvement already.

Huh. On <strong>my</strong> sample image, it reduced it by more than half, but with
yours, (with -quality 100) it actually increased the size :/ Using
-quality 90 -sampling-factor 2:1:1 brings it to 556k, 4:1:1 to 506k.

Oh. As well as the 2:1:1 stuff, you can just give it -sampling-factor

Whoa. Rockin'. I just compiled this plugin and installed it, opened the
image in GIMP and clicked 'Save for Web' on the 'File' menu; without
changing compression or anything else that I could see, it brought the
file size down to 334kB. Impressive.
</p>

<p>
Not useful for scripting, which is what I'd need here, but nice to have.

Just did. 2:1:1 doesn't seem to make much difference in size; 4:1:1 gets
it down a fair bit. E.g., with a quality of 90, it goes from 650kB (no
-sampling-factor specified) to about 505kB. Cool and excellent! <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Sometime before you said the image was 3 times as large, that's 9x the

displaying on computer screen, resize the image to 1024xwhatever
and use the resized image.

<p>
No, I mentioned that was in one dimension (it's actually a bit smaller
in the other one.) That's less than 3x the number of pixels - and that's
before you consider that the smaller image is actually higher resolution
(100x100 vs. 72x72).

<p>
OK, but that's not the problem - if it was just a single image, I
wouldn't have even posted the question. It's an entire class of problems
that I keep running into and would like to solve on a broader basis -
i.e., how do you "normalize" an average image file size but still keep a
fairly good quality, particularly when you have several thousand images
in a wide variety of sizes and resolutions to deal with?
</p>

<p>
The parameters in this case are roughly the following:
</p>

<pre>
Max thumbnail size: 245x245
Preferred actual size for "zooming": 1024x768 would be nice...
Max file size: Unknown, but 1.6MB kills PHP::GD with an OOM error
Current display sizes and file sizes:
 
find -iname '*jpg' -size +200k|xargs identify -format "%wx%h x %b\n"|sort -un -tx -k1,1 -k2,2
199x300 x 16587
200x300 x 41264
201x300 x 19176
203x300 x 53850

1020x1403 x 111763

&gt;&gt; Huh. On <strong>my</strong> sample image, it reduced it by more than half, but with
&gt;&gt; yours, (with -quality 100) it actually increased the size :/ Using
&gt;&gt; -quality 90 -sampling-factor 2:1:1 brings it to 556k, 4:1:1 to 506k.
&gt;
&gt; Oh. As well as the 2:1:1 stuff, you can just give it -sampling-factor
&gt; 2x2 etc., which is a little easier to remember

Google have released a new open source lossy image format, because
they've decided JPEG isn't efficient enough:

&lt;Leftmost&gt; jimregan, that's because deep inside you, you are evil.
&lt;Leftmost&gt; Also not-so-deep inside you.

Nice. But:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
Since this is a new image format, you won't be able to view your WebP
images in browsers or image viewers until support for the format has
been provided for those programs*. However, you can view WebP images by
converting them into PNG format and using your favorite PNG viewer.
Since PNG is a lossless compression, it will produce an exact rendition
of the WebP image content.
</pre>

<p>
That seems just a bit pointless: PNGs aren't known for scrimping on file
size. Well, let's see:
</p>

<pre>
ben at Jotunheim:/tmp$ identify 0mnia90_2.jpg 
0mnia90_2.jpg JPEG 720x1123 720x1123+0+0 8-bit DirectClass 1.062mb 
ben at Jotunheim:/tmp$ webpconv 0mnia90_2.jpg 
processing 0mnia90_2.jpg
Output file 0mnia90_2.webp
Used quality=85
ben at Jotunheim:/tmp$ ls -l 0mnia90_2.webp 
-rw-r--r-- 1 ben ben 166576 2010-09-30 20:56 0mnia90_2.webp
</pre>

<p>
"quality=85"?  Seems like a cheat. Let's see how it does at 100.
</p>

<pre>
ben at Jotunheim:/tmp$ webpconv -quality 100 0mnia90_2.jpg 
Target quality 100
processing 0mnia90_2.jpg
Output file 0mnia90_2.webp
Output file exists. You may change the output_dir
</pre>

<p>
[Sigh] I hate bondage-and-domination UIs.
</p>

<pre>
ben at Jotunheim:/tmp$ rm 0mnia90_2.webp 
ben at Jotunheim:/tmp$ webpconv -quality 100 0mnia90_2.jpg 
Target quality 100
processing 0mnia90_2.jpg
Output file 0mnia90_2.webp
ben at Jotunheim:/tmp$ ls -l 0mnia90_2.webp 
-rw-r--r-- 1 ben ben 410258 2010-09-30 21:04 0mnia90_2.webp
</pre>

<p>
About 2.7:1 reduction in size. Not bad, assuming the image quality
doesn't decrease significantly. Now, just for fun:
</p>

<pre>
ben at Jotunheim:/tmp$ webpconv -quality 100 -format png 0mnia90_2.jpg 
Target quality 100
Output format png
processing 0mnia90_2.jpg
Output file 0mnia90_2.png
ben at Jotunheim:/tmp$ ls -l 0mnia90_2.png 
-rw-r--r-- 1 ben ben 1605314 2010-09-30 21:06 0mnia90_2.png
</pre>

<p>
About 45% bigger than the original - woohoo! <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
In other words, it ain't quite there yet.
</p>

<p>
(Along the same lines, I just checked on the GuruPlug and the Ionics
Plug, which we discussed here about three months ago. Same story as
before, weeks and weeks of shipping time delays. One of these days, I
guess...)
