<P> OREM, UT-December 19, 2000-
<a href="http://www.calderasystems.com/">
Caldera Systems, Inc., </a>
announced that they have contracted with Richard Sharpe of the Samba team to
create a client library that will make Linux and Microsoft integration
easier for developers.  The Caldera-funded project includes the development
of library source code, associated reorganization and reuse of Samba code
and documentation of the library API. 
The library and documentation will be available
under the General Public License (GPL).  Caldera's engineering group will
work with the Samba team to complete the project by February 2001.
<p>
"Richard Sharpe is perfectly suited for this project," said John Terpstra,
vice president of technology and Open Source strategist for Caldera Systems,
"We believe this library built with Samba code will become the
standard for developers writing software that integrates with Microsoft
networks."

Red Hat's embedded technologies and services as part of its strategy to
supply a revolutionary silicon platform for stream processing applications.

<P> The Cradle contract

In further embedded Linux developments, Red Hat announces a deal with
<a href="http://www.rymic.com">Rymic Systems</a>
that will put Red Hat Linux (uClinux) behind as many as 50,000
Army trucks and fighting vehicles.  These vehicles will run a
next-generation Rymic appliance that assesses, in real time, the likelihood
of vehicle failure.  

<P> The device will monitor dozens of specific variables on an array of

when considering which forces to deploy, which fighting vehicles to pull
back from the battlefield and which vehicles require immediate maintenance
and repairs.

<FONT COLOR="green">SSH/SSL Vulnerability
</FONT>
</H3>
<p>
There have been a few articles going around regarding possible security
risks associated with the use of SSH and SSL. Kurt Seifried has written
several times on this subject, as far back as 
<a href="http://www.securityportal.com/closet/closet19990930.html">
September 1999</a>. More recently he has returned to the topic in
<a href="http://securityportal.com/cover/coverstory20001218.html">
an article</a> on 
<a href="http://www.securityportal.com/">www.SecurityPortal.com</a>, and a
<a href="http://www.securityportal.com/seifried/sslssh-followup20001222.html">
follow up article</a> responding to some of the feedback he got from
readers. This topic seems to have stirred up quite a reaction, and has been
further 
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/12/18/0759236&mode=nested">
discussed</a> by the contributors to Slashdot.
<p>
Without wanting to repeat too much of the discussion that has gone before,
the issue basically boil down to one of key exchange and trust. The only
real risk to SSH security is in the initial contact with a machine when you
do not know whether it is in fact the host you think it is. This is not an
SSH problem, as such, but rather is a difficulty with any public key
encryption system. The trick is to find a secure way to distribute your
public key that does not inconvenience your users too much.
<p>
Also, the largest risk to security is not, in general, software problems. Many
problems actually originate from users who ignore  or do not  understand
warning signs that something is wrong. The problems with software
highlighted in these articles are the extent to which they leave themselves
open to poor use.
<p>
It is certainly worth pointing out that none of these links highlight any
NEW flaw in the SSH/SSL system or implementation. The main reason for the
recent focus on these issues is the release of a new piece of software:
<a href="http://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/dsniff/">
dsniff</a>, which makes easy interception of SSH traffic more convenient for
a wider number of people. This is not because it exploits any weakness,
rather it provides some handy tools to automate the interception process.
However, wide availability of these tools does increase the chance of casual
attacks on systems.
<p>
The take-home message is that the best way to keep a system secure is by
educating yourself your boss and your users about security. It is only by
understanding what is going on that you have any chance of keeping your system
healthy (hardly earth-shattering news, but true none-the-less).

<P> SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, Dec. 14, 2000 - 
<a href="http://www.linuxnetworx.com">Linux NetworX, Inc.</a>, 
a provider of large-scale clustered computer solutions
announced that the Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley Calif., has selected a Linux NetworX
cluster computer system for its Drosophila Genome Project.

<P> Using the Linux NetworX cluster system with 40 processors, Berkeley Lab
is analyzing and sequencing the Drosophila (fruit fly) genome. 
The Drosophila's 15,000 genes are similar to a human's 100,000 genes and
have been used extensively in the past as a model organism for research
studies. 

<P> "The Linux NetworX cluster is much more cost efficient than the systems
we've used in the past," said Erwin Frise, systems manager and biomedical
scientist, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  Frise also explains that
because clusters are highly scalable, Berkeley Lab will in the future be
able to add additional compute modules to the system to keep it up to date,
something not feasible with a supercomputer.

Another core function  is monitoring the

<FONT COLOR="green">ACCESS Introduces Linux-based Browser Development Kit
</FONT> </H3> 

<P> MILPITAS, Calif./TOKYO, Japan - December 11, 2000 - 
<a href="http://www.access-us-inc.com/">ACCESS Co., Ltd.</a>
introduced a NetFront 2.6 Linux Software Development Kit (SDK) for the
worldwide market. This should speed the integration of ACCESS' popular NetFront
browser into Linux-based Internet appliances and other non-PC applications.
<p>
Since its introduction in 1995,
NetFront browsers have been shipped in over 18 million embedded devices from
40 manufacturers. NetFront is an ideal browser for Internet TVs, PDAs
(personal digital assistants), set-top boxes, car navigation systems, smart
phones, web/screen phones, vertical Internet terminals, video game consoles
and Internet kiosks.
<p>
The browser kernel
is less than 270 KB of code and fits in 1.3 megabytes of ROM and 2 megabytes
of RAM. It supports the full HTML 3.2 specification and selected portions of
HTML 4.0. It supports frames, JavaScript, cookies, web printing and
multilingual capabilities.
<p>
This SDK lets developers customize the user
interface to their desired look and feel and add plug-in applications
tailored for specific applications.
NetFront version 2.6 SDK for Linux will be available as a full source
code package. The SDK includes the NetFront version 2.6 browser kernel, a
sample user interface module and PIM suite, the Internet mail module, a
sample library for peer interface layer and graphics layer (GTK/SDL), and
documentation.
An SDK with five-seat development license is
available for $40,000 including three months support.

San Jose, CA-
<a href="http://www.2netFX.com/">2netFX</a>, 
a provider of streaming solutions for 
intranet and broadband Internet media delivery, and 
<a href="http://www.zapex.net/">Zapex Technologies, Inc.</a>
an industry leader of MPEG-2 compression 
products, are in alliance to design and deliver innovative hardware 
and software broadcast solutions to be used in the IP distance 
learning market.
<p>
The first system offered by the alliance is a Linux-based server 
solution, providing users a viable means to stream 
broadcast-quality transmissions. It includes 2netFX's StreamRider 
client and ThunderCast/IP server software and Zapex's ZL-330 
encoder with Dolby digital audio and MPEG-2 video. It is the first 
encoder of its type to achieve Dolby certification for Linux 
operating systems, and it eliminates inherent lip-sync issues by 
providing Transport Stream multiplexing within the Zapex encoder. 
<p>

The ZL-330 produces high quality video images at low bit rates. 
"The resulting low-bandwidth video stream from the ZL-330 permits 
an unlimited number of users to access a multicast video," says 
Gary Marsh, Zapex vice president of sales and marketing. "Coupled 
with the 2netFX software, PC users can interactively select which 
programming they wish to view, then capture and store the video 
locally. Effectively, customers can select their own viewing 
schedules, depending on application."
