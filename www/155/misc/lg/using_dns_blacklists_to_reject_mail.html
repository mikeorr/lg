<p>
Hi all,
</p>

<p>
I am wanting to gather some information about using DNSBL on mail
servers. I have been reading the information on most of the more popular
used blacklists like Spamcop and Spamhaus. Now I have come up with all
kinds of questions on the subject.
</p>

<p>
I would like to hear from any mail server administrators of their
experiences with these methods of rejecting spam at the "gate". It
seems apparent that one must gage what type of spam and what type of
lists to use very carefully because of the possibility of refusing valid
mail?
</p>

<p>
Is the implementation of using a DNSBL definitely something mail server
administrators should consider?
</p>

<p>
Is it common practice to use spamassassin and DNSBL together to reduce
bombardment of spam?
</p>

<p>
Although I have been using spamassassin for some time and see that it
does a very good job of filtering and correctly labeling mail. Also the
majority seems it could be prevented altogether by implementing the
correct DNSBL or DNSBL's at the mail server level as I can see by
spamassassin headers.
</p>

<p>
One thing I have heard is that it is not a good practice to put into
effect something like this because many bigger institutions can and
periodically do get put on blacklists, through no fault of their own.
One example I have seen:
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/services/email/antispam/blacklist.html">http://www.stanford.edu/services/email/antispam/blacklist.html</a> is this
an accurate representation of some of the possible effects of this being
put into practice?
</p>

<p>
Any recommendations as to suggested best practices in using these
measures?
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
</p>

<p>
<strong>I</strong> think so.  The only downside of that is when the DNSBL "goes out of
business" which slows down email delivery but is otherwise harmless, but 
overall, I suggest using it.
</p>

<p>
However, my favorite was of dealing with spam is to reject email that
doesn't follow the RFCs.  That's why I like postfix; they make it very
simple to reject emails that don't follow proper procedures
(<a href="http://jimsun.linxnet.com/misc/postfix-anti-UCE.txt">http://jimsun.linxnet.com/misc/postfix-anti-UCE.txt</a>).
</p>

</pre>

<p>
When I was running my own Postfix server, I got very little spam.  I
switched over to a hostgator account and my only choice for spam
filtering is SpamAssassin. It's not as good as using Postfix's anti-UCE
techniques + SA + procmail, IMO.  I now get several spams (&gt; 10) a day. <img src="../gx/frown.png" alt=":-(">

<p>
Yes, it happens, but over the years I've come to appreciate Rick Moen's
no-nonsense, hard-@$$^H^H^Hnosed approach: if Stanford gets blocked due to a
blacklisting, you'll hear about it and can whitelist them.

<p>
At least this is "common" at our IMSc mail server. This means that
we use DSNBL's as <em>part</em> of our spam scoring strategy.
</p>

<p>
I have found that rejecting mail based only on DNSBL's is fraught with
problems like the one you described. The situation is worse in India
since many ISP's completely ignore warnings about spammers operating
within their IP address ranges; this means that the DNSBL's tend to
classify the complete range as spammers.
</p>

<p>
Since we "herd cats" here ( <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)"> ) we want to avoid being lacerated for
false positives.[1] Hence our strategy is to check for RFC compliance
(we use exim4 for this). We also verify that the sender (Envelope From)
of a mail can be reached (bounce check). Finally, we have SPF records
and we do not accept mail from outside our LAN that has a sender
(Envelope From) within our domain. These are the only forms of
SMTP-time rejection that we do.[2]
</p>

<p>
We then score the mail using spamassassin and let our users filter
mail (or not) as they want (there are help pages on how procmail can be
used to separate mail based on spamassassin's scores).[3]
</p>

<p>
I admit that this is not the best strategy for a site where a
significant chunk of bandwidth cost is due to mail.
</p>

<p>
I have heard that allowing users some control on SMTP transactions
based on their own scoring can be more effective (greylistd for
example). We haven't had the time to test it here.
</p>

<p>
Regards,
</p>

<p>
Kapil.
</p>

<p>
[1] False positives is the term for mail that is genuine and gets
classified as spam.
</p>

<p>
[2] Even with this minimal setup I see that about one-third of all
SMTP connections to our mail exchangers are rejected everyday.
</p>

<p>
[3] Statistics based on spamassassin's classification of my inbox
(which is post the SMTP rejections in [2]) seems to indicate that
about two-thirds of the messages getting through are <em>still</em> spam.

<p>
I have been running sendmail for my own personal and business email for
the past eight years or so. And I have been using DNSBLs for most of
that time.  I think DNSBL is a great tool to fight spam. I do not use
any type of spam filtering that requires the user to sift through
junk/bulk folders as IMHO that completely misses the point.  I have
encountered two issues with using DNSBL that were easily addressed.
</p>

<p>
The two issues I have encountered are 1) blacklists sometimes list a
whole class C when they should only be listing specific IPs and 2) I
recently ran into a problem with the latency involved in using DNSBL.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally the ISP of a friend or business associate will become
blacklisted and that person can no longer send email to me, they bounce
back. Well when this happens it is invariably someone who knows another
way to contact me and does so.  At that point I check my maillog and
whitelist the ISP. Solved.
</p>

<p>
Recently one particular ISPs mail server began timing out while
communicating with my sendmail. I narrowed the problem down do a DNSBL
that had gone out of business, removed it from my config and all was
fine again.
</p>

<p>
Initially I used a long list of DNSBLs including spamhaus, abuseat,
njabl, blitzed, dsbl, ordb, JAMMConsulting and uceprotect. But over time
I have shortened that list and I currently only use zen.spamhaus.org.
</p>

<p>
I recommend DNSBL. I wish that many more ISPs would use DNSBLs as I
think they would work even better.

<p>
So using multiple DNSBL's together is relatively safe. I have heard that
using zen.spamhaus.org is not recommended for users using SMTP
Authentication on their server as it might block the roaming users from
authenticating.
</p>

<p>
Although I would think that perhaps the priority of the lines in the
configuration of sendmail could be arranged so as to allow users that
authenticate to bypass any ruleset?
</p>

<p>
Actually I would think that authenticated users could bypass such rules
regardless just as they do in order to relay?

I'm not sure if sendmail can be configured that way or not, I don't
authenticate and it's been a long time since I opened up the Bat book
(viva m4). Yes I am sure that a larger ISP would run into problems. I
just mean that, if more people were using DNSBLs, then the lists would
be better maintained and there would be fewer problems, etc. Catch 22 I
guess.

Quoting Joey Prestia (joey@linuxamd.com):
</p>

</pre>

<p>
Your question seems to presuppose that DNSBLs are a "method".  They're
not.  They're a source of information that can be used in a variety of
ways.
</p>

<p>
Information has value to the extent that you have confidence in its
accuracy and relevance -- which includes deciding whether or not you
(as MTA admin) think their listing policies are reasonable.  Experience
suggests that that's a question one must assess individually for each
DNSBL.  Further, DNSBLs have been known to be good for a while, then not
so good, then eventually may become counterproductive, e.g., because
they've ceased to be maintained.
</p>

<p>
It might seem counterintuitive, but one of the best things that some
past DNSBLs have done for the public was to -- after reaching a decision
to no longer maintain the database -- configure their DNSBL nameservers
to return a blacklist recommendation on <em>every</em> IP queried.  Why?
Because that's really the only effective way to notify MTA admins around
the world that they need to cease consulting the (now-obsolete) DNSBL.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, as I said, DNSBLs are not a "method" but rather a source of
information.  Many of us MTA admins find it most fruitful to feed that
information through a spamicity-rating service locally, e.g., raising or
lowering the SpamAssassin score with weighting set for each DNSBL
according to the degree to which we think each one should be, on
average, taken seriously.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; It seems apparent that one must gage what type of spam and what type
&gt; of lists to use very carefully because of the possibility of refusing
&gt; valid mail?
</pre>

<p>
Of course.  This survey might be one good starting point:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_DNS_blacklists">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_DNS_blacklists</a>
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Is the implementation of using a DNSBL definitely something mail
&gt; server administrators should consider?
</pre>

<p>
Yes -- for appropriate values of "implementation".
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Is it common practice to use spamassassin and DNSBL together to reduce
&gt; bombardment of spam?
</pre>

<p>
Sure.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Although I have been using spamassassin for some time and see that it
&gt; does a very good job of filtering and correctly labeling mail.
</pre>

<p>
SpamAssassin is a ruleset <em>and</em> a clearinghouse infrastructure for
receiving and processing information from arbitrary sources about a mail
stream's estimated spamicity.  
</p>


<pre>
&gt; One thing I have heard is that it is not a good practice to put into
&gt; effect something like this because many bigger institutions can and
&gt; periodically do get put on blacklists, through no fault of their own.
</pre>

<p>
Foregoing sounds like some combination of
</p>

<pre>
1.  non-sequitur reasoning, and
2.  special pleading (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading</a>)
</pre>

<p>
Early in the spam wars, special pleading was even more common than it is
today.  E.g., you as MTA admin would mention that you were likely to
join the rest of the sysadmin world in refusing mail from all known
open-relay SMTP sites, because there was simply no excuse for operating
such a site in the cutting-edge early-1990s world you then inhabited --
and <em>immediately</em> some nitwit from a local university would be on your
case:
</p>

<pre>
   "But, but, but... we <em>have</em> to operate open relays because our
   users insist on being able to relay outbound mail on port 25 from
   arbitrary IPs, and we university sysadmins lack the political power
   to order them not to, and it's simply <em>unfair</em> to hold the entire
   university responsible for what a few bad apples do."
</pre>

<p>
(I swear I heard exactly that sort of thing, back in the day, many
times.)
</p>

<p>
What I'm driving at is:  Some bigger institutions get put on blacklists
because, by and large, they got caught behaving like anti-social
screwups, i.e., for very good reason.  They can get off those blacklists
by following the delisting policies, which by and large loosely
approximate "Stop screwing up".
</p>

<p>
Of course, there are DNSBLs with bad/ineffective/arbitrary/onerous 
delisting policies -- but far fewer than asserted by critics who
include... surprise... habitual screwups who are following the <em>other</em>
bit of logic that accompanies special pleading:  blame everyone and
anyone but one's self.  
</p>


<pre>
&gt; One example I have seen:
&gt; <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/services/email/antispam/blacklist.html">http://www.stanford.edu/services/email/antispam/blacklist.html</a> is this
&gt; an accurate representation of some of the possible effects of this
&gt; being put into practice?
</pre>

<p>
The page doesn't give enough technical information about the "forwarding
to AOL" example to assess it.  I'm not certain offhand how the
hypothetically forwarded spam received at Stanford and then forwarded 
manually, or via a .forward file, could be expected to look (the SMTP
headers) as received at aol.com.  Therefore, I'm not certain whether
SpamCom can be rationally expected to be able to distinguish between
Stanford being a genuine spam-source on the one hand, and it being an
innocent recipient of spam that one of its <em>users</em> then forwarded to
his/her AOL account, on the other.  My <em>guess</em>, having not seen the
headers of such a forward, is that the Stanford page makes a good point,
and that SpamCop is vulnerable to submission of bad information.
</p>

<p>
As it happens, I don't personally use SpamCop's DNSBL information,
because I don't particularly trust it.  
</p>



<pre>
&gt; Any recommendations as to suggested best practices in using these
&gt; measures?
</pre>

<p>
Yes.  Read DNSBL listing and delisting policies carefully.  Use the
resulting DNSBL information with weighting according to your confidence
and agreement with their policies and according to your understanding of
their competence and good faith.  Take critics' bitching cum granum
salis, but also be aware that sometimes they're right even though
they're complaining.  ;-&gt;

<p>
It should be possible. It's easy in Postfix, you just put the SMTP AUTH
check before the DNSBLs and you're done. Another way is to use the
proper ports for SMTP clients (which is not port 25/TCP <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> any bypass
the DNSBLs this way.
