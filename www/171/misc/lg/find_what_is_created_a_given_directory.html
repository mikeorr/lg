Hey,
</p>

<p>
I know it sounds kind of weird but I want to know if it is possible to 
identify what process/program is creating this particular directory on 
my system.
</p>

<p>
Basically, in my home folder a directory called "Downloads" keeps 
getting created at random times. The directory doesn't have any content 
inside it and is just an empty folder.
</p>

<p>
I thought that it was probably being created by one of the applications 
I run at the time but when I tried to narrow down the application by 
using each one separately and waiting for the directory to be created I 
wasn't able to replicate the issue.
</p>

<p>
I also tried searching on Google for this but seems like no one else is 
having this issue or maybe my searches are too generic.
</p>

<p>
I am running Debian Testing (Squeeze)  and the applications I normally 
have running are:
</p>

<pre>
* Firefox (3.6)
* Thunderbird (3.0.1)
* Dolphin (Default KDE 4.3.4 version)
* Konsole (3-4 instances)
* EditPlus using wine
* Amarok (1.4.10)
* ksensors
* Tomboy Notes
* xchat
* gnome-system-monitor
</pre>

<p>
BTW, I noticed the same behavior when I was using Ubuntu last year (9.10).
</p>

<p>
Any idea's on how to figure this out? Have any of you noticed something 
similar on your system?
</p>

With a 0.9 probability, I would guess its Firefox which creates this
directory, for saving your "Downloads". But,
<a href='http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam/'>http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam/</a> may be a good candidate to look at to
find the program doing this.

I'd try something like
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
rmdir ~/Downloads
while [ ! -d ~/Downloads ]; do sleep 1; done # Wait for directory to appear
lsof | grep Downloads     # see who is using directory
</pre>

<p>
The above is completely untested.
</p>

<p>
If you look at the lsof man page you may find some helpful options to use.

Why not use inotify?

<p>
That's what I thought, however if Firefox was the one creating the 
directory I would expect it to do it everytime I download something 
which is not the case here.
</p>

<p>
For example the last time the directory was created was at 5:23 am when 
I was sleeping and my computer was mostly idle.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for the link though, its a very interesting read.
</p>

Hey Neil,
</p>


<pre>
&gt; rmdir ~/Downloads
&gt; while [ ! -d ~/Downloads ]; do sleep 1; done # Wait for directory to appear
&gt; lsof | grep Downloads     # see who is using directory
&gt;
&gt; The above is completely untested.
&gt;
</pre>

<p>
I tried the above but it didn't help. Basically what happened is that by 
the time the above condition was satisfied and the lsof command ran 
there was no process which was accessing that directory.
</p>

<p>
So it seems like the directory is created and then left alone. There is 
never any content created inside it.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for the advise though.
</p>
