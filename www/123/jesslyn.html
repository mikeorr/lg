<h1>uClinux on Blackfin BF533 STAMP - A DSP Linux Port</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/jesslyn.html">Jesslyn Abdul Salam</A></b></p>

<p>
<p> Intel and Analog Devices Inc. (ADI) jointly developed the Micro Signal
Architecture (MSA) core and introduced it in December of 2000. ADI's
Blackfin processor functions as a DSP and a microcontroller. This device is
currently used for multimedia applications.</p>

<p> This article provides an introduction to programming the BF533
STAMP board and is intended for readers with some experience in Linux as
well as with embedded devices. It contains a basic description
of using the board for embedded programming as I have done without any
problem. </p>


<h3>BF533 STAMP</h3>
<p>
<img src="misc/jesslyn/image001.jpg" align="left">
The STAMP board features:</p>

<ul>
<li>ADSP-BF533 500 MHz Blackfin Processor
<li>128 MB SDRAM
<li>4 MB FLASH memory
<li>10/100 Ethernet Controller
<li>RS232 Serial Interface
<li>JTAG interface for debugging and flash programming
<li>I/O connectors for Blackfin Peripherals:
	<ul>
	<li>PPI
	<li> SPORT0 &amp; SPORT1
	<li> SPI
	<li> TIMERS
	<li> IRDA
	<li>TWI 
	</ul>
</ul>

<p> The BF533 STAMP runs uClinux - a Linux port for embedded
devices. It has soft real-time capabilities, meaning that it cannot
guarantee a specific interrupt or scheduler latency.</p>

<p> The STAMP board has been specifically designed to support the
development and porting of open source uClinux applications and includes
the full complement of memory along with serial and network interfaces. The
STAMP uClinux Kernel Board Support Package (BSP) includes a CD with a recent
copy of the open source development tools, the uClinux kernel, and the
documentation. For more details visit <a
href="http://blackfin.uclinux.org">http://blackfin.uclinux.org</a>.</p>


<h3>uClinux</h3>
<p> The uClinux kernel provides a hardware abstraction layer. The uClinux
Application Programming Interface (API) is identical for all processors
which support uClinux, allowing code to be easily ported to a different
processor core. When porting an application to a new platform, programmers
only need to address the areas specific to a particular processor -
normally, this means only the device drivers.</p>


<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p> We have to note the following components of our development board:</p>

<ul>
<li>an Ethernet controller ( with an RJ45 Ethernet jack )
<li>a serial port ( DB9 serial connector - female ) 
<li>a power jack
</ul> 

<p> The development workstation is essentially a Linux box which should have</p>

<ul>
<li>an available serial port 
<li>terminal emulator software 
<li>an Ethernet card
</ul>

<p> There are two potential interconnections between the workstation and the target:</p>

<ul>
<li>the 10 Mbps Ethernet connection
<li>the RS232 serial interface
</ul>


<h4>Connecting the Hardware</h4>
<ol>
<li>Connect the serial port to your host computer from the STAMP board
<li> Connect the Ethernet cable to your network card of your Linux box (
use a straight cable with no cross connections )
<li> Start the terminal emulation program. Minicom is an example of such a
program, and is included in most Linux distributions. At the bash prompt
type the following command as root:

<pre>
bash# minicom -m -s /dev/ttyS0
</pre>

<p> From the configuration menu within Minicom, set the serial port connection to</p>

<ul>
<li>57600 baud
<li>8 data bits
<li>Parity none
<li>1 stop bit
<li> H/W flow control off
</ul>

<p> Now Save the configuration and choose Exit.</p>

<li>Connect the DC power cord and power up the board
<li>After the STAMP board powers up, you should see a U-boot start-up screen
in your terminal window. At this stage, if you allow the boot timer to count
down, the board will load the uClinux kernel from flash memory and boot it,
finally resulting in a command prompt.
</ol>


<h3>GNU/Linux tool chain for the Blackfin devices</h3>
<p> Install the binutils and the GCC tools on your machine:</p>

<p class="editorial">[ Note: 'rpm' is RedHat-specific. Use the appropriate
package manager for your distribution to install the latest 'bfin-gcc'
version; if your distribution does not have one, use the 'alien' utility to
convert this RPM to your required format. -- Ben ]
</p>

<pre>
bash# rpm -ivh bfin-gcc-3.4-4.1.i386.rpm
</pre>

<p> You may not find the same version of GCC tools on the CD. I had to
download the latest version since the one provided with CD
did not contain the required tools (e.g., the C compiler for building
programs on uClinux.) You may download the RPM from <a
href="http://blackfin.uclinux.org/frs/download.php/598/bfin-gcc-3.4-4.1.i386.rpm">here</a>.
Or you can visit the Blackfin <a
href="http://blackfin.uclinux.org/frs/?group_id=18">website</a> to download
the toolchain yourself.</p>

<p> In user mode, export the path for the tools:</p>

<code>bash# export PATH=/opt/uClinux/bfin-elf/bin:/opt/uClinux/bfin-uclinux/bin:$PATH</code>

<h3>Installing the uClinux Kernel</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the kernel source from the CD to your work directory 
<li>Uncompress the Kernel source<br><br>
<code>bash# bunzip2 uClinux-dist.tar.bz2<br>
tar -xvf uClinux-dist.tar</code>
</ol>

Now that the kernel is uncompressed in the work directory, you are ready
to start building your own uClinux kernel for the Blackfin processor.
</p>

<h3>Simple 'Hello World' Application</h3>
<p> Traditionally, development environments and programming languages have
always begun with the 'Hello World' program; we'll follow the precedent.</p>

<p>Copy the following into a file called 'hello.c':</p>

<pre class="code">
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
	printf("Hello, Welcome to Blackfin uClinux!!\n");
	return 0;
}
</pre>

<p> The next step is to compile 'hello.c' on you host PC:</p>

<pre>
bash# bfin-uclinux-gcc -Wl,elf2flt hello.c -o hello
</pre>

<p> The resulting executable is named <b>hello</b>.</p>

<p> Note that the <b>bfin-uclinux-gcc</b> compiler is used; this compiler
is used to compile programs that run on the uClinux operating system. It
automatically links our program with the uClinux run time libraries, which
in turn call the uClinux operating system when required ( for example ) to
print to the console. The compiler collection for the Blackfin processor
also includes another compiler, <b>bfin-elf-gcc</b>, which is used to
compile the actual uClinux operating system and uses a different set of
libraries.  If you want to try porting other RTOSs to Blackfin, you will
have to use <b>bfin-elf-gcc</b>.</p>

<p> Now we need to set up the Ethernet port on the Linux box; we'll set its
IP address to 192.168.0.2. After booting the uClinux kernel on the STAMP
board, you will have to configure its Ethernet interface as well; at the
bash prompt of the STAMP, type the following:</p>

<pre>
root:~&gt;# ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.15 up
</pre>

<p> At this point, the Ethernet link should be up. We can use FTP to
upload the 'hello' program from the host to the board. At the bash shell
prompt of the linux workstation type the following:</p>

<pre>
bash# ftp 192.168.0.15
</pre>

<p> Give the username and password as <i>root</i> and <i>uClinux</i>. Send
the 'hello' executable to the STAMP board.</p>

<p> Now modify the permissions and run:</p>

<pre>
root:~&gt; chown 777 hello
root:~&gt; ./hello
Hello, Welcome to Blackfin uClinux!!
</pre>


<h3>Segmentation faults</h3>
<p> The Blackfin processor does not have an MMU, and does not provide any
memory protection for programs. This can be demonstrated with a simple
program:</p>

<pre class="code">
// test.c
int main ()
{
	int *p;
	*p=5;
}
</pre>

<p> Compile 'test.c' using our native C compiler. Try to run the resulting
executable, and you'll end up with a segmentation fault.</p>

<p> Now, compile the program using 'bfin-uclinux-gcc' as I described above.
Send the executable to the STAMP board using FTP, change the file
permissions, and run it.</p>

<p> This time, it should run without a segmentation fault. Due to this, an
unprivileged process can cause an address error, can corrupt kernel code,
and result is obvious. This is not a limitation of the Blackfin
architecture, but simply demonstrates that uClinux is designed to support
devices without an MMU.</p>

<h3>End of Part I</h3>
<p> This is all I know well about uClinux on Blackfin. I have to look
deeper into uClinux and I shall try to include more next time!</p>

I'm currently doing my final semester as a Btech in Computer Science and
Engineering in MES College of Engineering, Kuttipuram, Kerala, India. I am
really fond of everything about Linux operating systems, maybe because I
want to know more about it, and I spend most of the time on my PC for the
same. My other areas of interest include reading, web surfing, and
listening to music.
