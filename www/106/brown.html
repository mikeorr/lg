<h1>Windows Defectors: Upgrading a KDE Installation to Version 3.3</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/brown.html">Tom Brown</A></b></p>

<p class="editorial">[This article is a follow-up to <a href="tag/4.html">this 
TAG thread</a>]</p>

<p> There's an old joke about how a burgler makes a cake. The recipe begins 
"To bake a cake, first steal two eggs". Of course, if you really don't want to 
do any baking in the first place, and all you really wanted was a simple 
pre-packaged cupcake, all this recipe stuff (not to mention hunting down the 
different ingredients needed) may be more trouble than it's worth. 
Occasionally, that's been my experience migrating from Windows to Linux. One 
such occasion has been my recent attempt to upgrade KDE from version 3.1 to 
3.3. Only in this case, the instructions were: "To install KDE, first find one 
recipe".

<p> Now, Windows users are a picky bunch. We expect to double-click on an icon, 
usually "setup.exe", and everything works automagically. The logic of what to 
uninstall, what to install, and what questions need to be asked of the person 
doing the installation, are all built into the process. With KDE, there's no 
such thing. Apparently, nobody feels it's needed, despite the multitude of 
different packages which must be installed (and uninstalled) in a particular 
order. But some sort of automation <i>is</i> desperately needed here. There is 
no excuse, in my opinion, for the installation of software to be difficult. 
Now, a lot of people who read LG will wonder what the fuss is about. This is 
Linux, after all, and you need to learn how to do all this. At the risk of 
being called a troll, I say that's just the wrong attitude to have. 
Installation (of device drivers as well as software) is an area in which Linux 
still has a very long way to go. I don't want to bake the cupcake, blast it, I 
just want to eat it!

<p> First, my thanks go to Faber Fedor for pointing me in the right direction 
in my KDE upgrade. There are days when my googling skills fail me miserably, 
and I appreciate Faber's help. I still didn't have an easy time doing the 
upgrade, and haven't gotten everything working (a few tiny annoyances still 
remain), but on the whole I managed it.

<p> Technical details: I'm running SuSe 9.0, with the original KDE 3.1 
installation that came with the distro. I upgraded using the binary RPM files 
from the SuSe website. That website still claims the files are for KDE version 
3.2, when in fact most of them are now for version 3.3 (dated August 19, 2004). 
Unfortunately, the KDevelop RPM there has not been updated, and won't install 
into KDE 3.3. That's one I'll tackle later, since for the moment, I don't need 
it. Using RPM files built specifically for your distro is the easiest way to do 
the upgrade, but if you can't find any, then you'll either have to build from 
source or wait for the right RPMs to become available. Notice that I'm 
installing the KDE development packages. Even if you don't intend to do any 
software development in KDE, some of this might be needed if you install 
software from the sourcecode.  

<p> Before beginning, you should backup your system. If you're using 
drag-and-drop to do this, remember that the ".kde" directory in each user's 
home directory is normally hidden, so make sure you're showing hidden files in 
Konqueror before doing so.

<p> Now, because I'm a Windows Defector using SuSe (and therefore, Yast2), I 
did the entire installation from inside KDE, not the command line. I had to do 
one extra step at the end to compensate for this rash and risky approach, but 
the benefit was double-clicking on the RPM file to perform the installation, 
instead of all that command-line nonsense (sorry, it's a Windows Thing). 

<p> Now it's only fair to tell you that a lot of folks recommend a different 
procedure for installing KDE. First, boot to the Linux command line instead of 
the GUI. In SuSe's Yast2, click the "System" icon, then the "Runlevel Editor" 
icon. Select the "Expert Mode" radio button in the subsequent dialog box, then 
change the drop-down list from "5: Full multiuser with network and xdm" (or 
what is called "runlevel 5") to "3: Full multiuser with network" (or what is 
called "runlevel 3"). If you're not using SuSe, then you'll have to edit the 
bootup runlevel setting in the file "/etc/inittab". Either way, the next time 
you reboot the machine, you'll get a command-line logon prompt, instead of the 
GUI one. From here, logon as root, uninstall all of KDE (and QT as well), 
install the new KDE (in the order I'm about to present), and reset your logon 
to runlevel 5. If you're running SuSe, you can do this from Yast2, either 
directly from the command line, or through the GUI by using the command 
"startx" to run the X server, and KDE. Now that Yast2 has been released under 
the GPL, hopefully it will be more widely available.

<p><b><u>Note</u>: Read this entire document carefully before trying any of it 
on your computer! Make sure you have all the materials necessary, and don't 
close any windows or reboot until you're done.</b>

<p> The order in which you install KDE is important, no matter how you do it. 
The first thing that gets installed isn't KDE, but QT, which is the graphics 
layer beneath KDE. Install the package "qt3.rpm". In SuSe, this is done by 
double-clicking on the file's icon. Trying to install this package results in a 
lot of dependency warnings/errors, which is to be expected for such a low-level 
package. In Yast2, a dialog box will list these dependencies, and offer three 
alternatives: don't install, force the install, ignoring the dependencies, and 
remove the offending packages. The dependency problem with qt3 is primarily 
with qt3_devel and qt3-non-mt. You're going to replace those two anyway in a 
moment, so go ahead and remove them before installing qt3 (forcing the install 
may also be ok in this circumstance, but I thought removal was safer. It might 
not make any difference). Before you do, though, take a good look at the 
dependencies on your machine. If you see anything other than QT or KDE stuff in 
that list, stop right there until you know what it is you're removing. On my 
machine, Yast2 informed me that 20 packages were in conflict, every one of 
which being some part of QT or KDE that was going to be replaced anyway.

<p> Once "qt3.rpm" is installed, go ahead and install "qt3-devel.rpm", followed 
by "qt3-non-mt.rpm". QT has now been updated.

<p> You now have to update arts, the audio support used by KDE. Install 
"arts.rpm", followed by "arts-gmcop.rpm", and then "arts-devel.rpm. I'm not 
sure if these last two have to be done in that order, but that's what worked 
for me.

<p> Next on the agenda are the KDE libs. First install "kdelibs3.rpm", and then 
"kdelibs3-devel.rpm"

<p> We're getting to the good stuff now. Install the file "kdebase3.rpm". Once 
more, you will get dependency errors. Two of these, the kate text editor and 
the konqueror browser you can safely remove, as you're going to replace them 
with 3.3 versions anyway before you're done. The nasty bit in my case was the 
reference to "kdebase-suse", which isn't part of the KDE release, but an add-on 
in the original SuSe distro. In this case, I simply forced the installation, 
ignoring the error, and Nothing Bad Happened.

<p> Install the file "kdebase3-devel.rpm" to finish the base installation.

<p> Now, re-install kate with "kdeaddons3-kate.rpm" and konqueror with 
"kdeaddons3-konqueror.rpm", so you don't forget. 

<p> Finally, install the remaining KDE packages. It doesn't matter in which 
order. 

<p> If you performed the upgrade from within KDE, as I did, you need to do one 
more thing, or you'll see lots of error messages that say "Unable to create 
io-slave". Delete the directory "/tmp/kde-user", where "user" is your login id 
(for example, I had to delete "/tmp/kde-tbrown"). Log out then back in to 
restart the X server and KDE. The upgrade is done.

<p> My KDE upgrade works just fine, except for the KDevelop and screensaver 
issues. I did install an updated "kdeartwork3-xscreensaver.rpm" file, but there 
must be something that I missed. One additional oddity is that windows 
generated by Superkaramba are now always on top, with no setting I could find 
that would make them behave like any other window. Obviously, something has 
changed between version 3.1 and 3.3 in the way KDE treats those windows, since 
they worked fine before the upgrade.

<p> I may be in the minority here, but I'd welcome a single-file installer for 
KDE, however large it would have to be to include all the necessary pieces. 
Most Linux programs don't need an installer, but KDE isn't one of them. Still, 
with a little information and experimentation, I managed to do without.
