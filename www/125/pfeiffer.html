<h1>Digging Secure Tunnels with IPsec</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/pfeiffer.html">Ren&eacute; Pfeiffer</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3>
Introduction
</h3>

<p>
The Internet was born using plain text and no encryption. For a long time the TCP/IP protocol
suite had no mechanism for cryptographically protecting transported data. Encryption was
added at the application layer &mdash; Netscape's Secure Socket Layer (SSL) being a famous example.
The design process of IPv6 incorporated encryption into the protocol itself, and the IPsec
(IP security) framework came into existence. IPsec provides encryption and authentication at the
packet level. While IPsec is obligatory for IPv6, you can optionally use it with IPv4. The Linux
2.6.x kernel series added full IPsec functionality to the main source tree. In this article we will
explore how we can use IPsec to build encrypted data paths between networked machines.
</p>

<h3>
The Parts of IPsec
</h3>

<p>
IPsec consists of a number of protocols. Encryption was not the only design criteria.
Protection against replay attacks, detection of unauthorised packet modification and
correctly authenticating the communication partners are also included in the design requirements.
IPSec also offers methods to manage keys used for encrypted communication. The
protocols by name have the following task.
<ul>
<li> Authentication Header (AH)<br>
     This protocol protects against replay attacks and makes
     sure that the communication partners are "correct" (it verifies authentication).</li>
<li> Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)<br>
     This protocol provides encryption. It also
     protects against replay attacks and in addition ensures authentication.</li>
<li> Internet Key Exchange (IKE)<br>
     This is a hybrid protocol that establishes the security
     policies between two IPsec endpoints and provides the authentication keys for
     services such as IPsec. If you provide the keys manually, you don't need to use
     IKE.</li>
</ul>
AH and ESP packets transport data. Both are new protocols whose protocol numbers can
be found in <tt>/etc/protocols</tt>. AH and ESP are
managed by the kernel, while IKE is managed by a userspace program.
</p>

<h3>
Preparing Kernel and System
</h3>

<p>
In order to use IPsec your kernel needs to have some code options enabled. Most modern GNU/Linux
distributions have IPsec-capable kernels. If you want to compile your own, make sure that
you have the following options set:
<ul>
<li> IPsec user configuration interface</li>
<li> PF_KEY sockets</li>
<li> IP: AH transformation</li>
<li> IP: ESP transformation</li>
<li> IP: IPComp transformation</li>
<li> IP: tunnel transformation</li>
</ul>
These options can be found in the section <i>Networking --&gt; Networking options</i>.
You also have to enable some or all cryptographic ciphers in the <i>Cryptographic
options</i> submenu. You will need at least MD5, SHA1, HMAC, DES, Triple DES EDE and AES.
Remember, the encryption is handled by the kernel. If the kernel doesn't know about a
cipher, it cannot use it. This is important in case you want to speak to other IPsec
devices or hosts (such as MS Windows or Cisco machines). 
If you want to
use IPsec with IPv6, then you have to make sure the IP transformations are set for IPv6 as
well. I have two screenshots for you where you can see the <i>make menuconfig</i> menu:
<a href="misc/pfeiffer/kernel_ipsec1.png">screenshot 1</a> and 
<a href="misc/pfeiffer/kernel_ipsec2.png">screenshot 2</a>. If your machine acts as a
router, you might wish to consider activating the <i>IP: advanced router</i> option, too.
The kernel treats packet queues differently if you use the advanced routing option.
</p>
<p>
Now our kernel can handle IPsec. We now need some tools to make it work. We will need at least
the <i>ipsec-tools</i> package. This is the name of the project and the Debian
package. If we want to deal with key management and IKE, we need another program.
The Linux IPsec stack can work together with <i>pluto</i> from the Openswan project,
OpenBSD's <i>isakmpd</i> or <i>racoon</i> from the KAME project. The use of IKE is
optional though. We will use <i>racoon</i> in our examples.
</p>

<h3>
Manual Keying, Policies, Tunnel and Transport Mode
</h3>

<p>
IPsec can be used to link networks via tunnels by using the so-called <i>tunnel mode</i>. In its
simplest form it can also be used to encrypt network traffic between two or more hosts by using the
<i>transport mode</i>. The only things you need for that are the keys and a way to tell the kernel
which packets need to be sent via IPsec. The 2.6.x kernels have no special device for handling IPsec
packets. Everything is sent over the already existing network interfaces. The Security Policy Database (SPD)
decides which packets are to be handled by IPsec. In order to manipulate this database you need the 
<b>setkey</b> command from the <i>ipsec-tools</i> package. Usually you prepare a file with all the
settings and activate it by using <b>setkey -f /etc/setkey.conf</b>. As an
example, let's say we want to enable IPsec between the machines 10.0.0.23
and 10.0.0.42. The policy for telling the kernel looks like this:

<pre class="code">
#!/usr/sbin/setkey -f
#
# SPD for 10.0.0.23
#
spdadd 10.0.0.23 10.0.0.42 any -P out ipsec
       esp/transport//require
       ah/transport//require;

spdadd 10.0.0.42 10.0.0.23 any -P in ipsec
       esp/transport//require
       ah/transport//require;
</pre>
The first policy states that any packet coming from 10.0.0.23 and leaving for 10.0.0.42 has to be
encapsulated in IPsec packets. Transport mode has to be used. The policy is valid for ESP and AH
packets alike (that's why we have to use <i>spdadd</i> twice). IPsec is mandatory as indicated by the keyword
"require". If one of the hosts lacks the right key or hasn't initialised its SPD, there won't be any
traffic because it can't be encrypted. The second policy is the first one reversed.
The IP addresses are swapped and the direction is changed from <i>out</i> to <i>in</i>.
</p>
<p>
So the kernel knows when to use IPsec. There are still no keys. Apart from that I told you about
authentication checks that the IPsec protocols can do for us. Our <b>setkey.conf</b> needs to be
extended to include this information as well. <b>setkey</b> also defines the Security Association
Database (SAD). The SAD tells the kernel who our neigbours are and how we can make sure that we are not
talking to an impostor. Extending our <b>setkey.conf</b> by the following lines enables
authentication and encryption. In addition to that we supply the keys for every host.

<pre class="code">
# AH SAD entries with 160 bit keys
add 10.0.0.23 10.0.0.42 ah 0x200 -A hmac-sha1 0x46915c30ed7e2465b42861b6ab19f2772813020c;
add 10.0.0.42 10.0.0.23 ah 0x300 -A hmac-sha1 0xc4dac594f8228e0b94a54758f7fbf2fdf4e37f3e;

# ESP SAD entries with 192 bit keys
add 10.0.0.23 10.0.0.42 esp 0x201 -E rijndael-cbc 0xa3993b3dfc41ef0a1aa8d168a8bf2c27e48249ac17b61e09;
add 10.0.0.42 10.0.0.23 esp 0x301 -E rijndael-cbc 0x8f6498928ba354bd45cfad147f54c67b3b742896b3bafc02;
</pre>

Again we have a line for every direction. The IP addresses are reversed, but we use a different key
for every IP and protocol. The bit length of the key corresponds to the authentication or encryption
algorithm used. The switches <i>-A</i> and <i>-E</i> indicate the algorithm to use for AH and ESP
respectively. <i>hmac-sha1</i> requires a key length of 160 bits or 20 bytes. <i>rijndael-cbc</i> can be used with
128, 192 or 256 bits. The example uses 192 bits or 24 bytes. The man page of <b>setkey</b> has a
table with all possible values for every supported algorithm. Bear in mind that the kernel must also
have a module for the algorithm in its cryptographic options or else you cannot use this particular
algorithm. The hexadecimal value behind the protocol name is called Security Parameters Index (SPI).
The SPI identifies a set of parameters used for the IPsec connection in combination with the IP
addresses involved. When doing manual keying, make sure that the SPIs are unique. Speaking of
unique, make sure that your keys are <i>unique</i> and <i>random</i>. Never use any keys that have
been published! I used Ralf's method from the IPsec HOWTO to extract the sample keys from the Linux
random device.

<pre class="code">
# dd if=/dev/random count=24 bs=1 | xxd -ps
24+0 records in
24+0 records out
8f6498928ba354bd45cfad147f54c67b3b742896b3bafc02
24 bytes transferred in 0.000180 seconds (133298 bytes/sec)
</pre>

Set <b>count</b> to the desired byte amount. The command <b>xxd</b> used to convert the binary output
from the device is part of the <b>vim</b> package.
</p>

<h3>
Testing Transport Mode
</h3>

<p>
We are now ready to test our configuration. In order to do this you will need the
<a href="misc/pfeiffer/setkey_transport.conf.txt">full setkey.conf</a>. I only added two lines that
clear the SAD and SPD before loading new rules, just to be sure.

<pre class="code">
flush;
spdflush;
</pre>

Copy it to your hosts. Be careful, we've only created the <b>setkey.conf</b> for 10.0.0.23. If you use
this file on 10.0.0.42 you have to swap the policy for the direction of the packet flow (the
<i>in</i> and <i>out</i> keywords for the SPD). Now use a root shell on 10.0.0.23 and enter the
command:

<pre>
setkey -f /path/to/setkey.conf
</pre>

Check if you can ping 10.0.0.42. This should not be possible, because we told 10.0.0.23 to
communicate with 10.0.0.42 over IPsec only. If you run the <b>setkey</b> command on 10.0.0.42 as
well, you should be able to ping 10.0.0.42 from 10.0.0.23. Take a look with your favourite sniffer
in order to make sure the kernel isn't playing unencrypted tricks on you. If you use an ICMP ping,
the sniffer should only show you encrypted AH or ESP packets. The same goes for TCP and UDP
transmissions.
</p>
<p>
Next time we will configure an IPsec tunnel to connect two different networks and we will take a
look at automatic keying with X.509 certificates.

<p>
Ren&eacute; was born in the year of Atari's founding and the release of the game Pong.
Since his early youth he started taking things apart to see how they work. He
couldn't even pass construction sites without looking for electrical wires that
might seem interesting. The interest in computing began when his grandfather
bought him a 4-bit microcontroller with 256 byte RAM and a 4096 byte operating
system, forcing him to learn assembler before any other language.
</p>

<p>
After finishing school he went to university in order to study physics. He then
collected experiences with a C64, a C128, two Amigas, DEC's Ultrix, OpenVMS and
finally GNU/Linux on a PC in 1997. He is using Linux since this day and still
likes to take things apart und put them together again. Freedom of tinkering
brought him close to the Free Software movement, where he puts some effort into
the right to understand how things work. He is also involved with civil liberty
groups focusing on digital rights.
</p>

<p>
Since 1999 he is offering his skills as a freelancer. His main activities
include system/network administration, scripting and consulting. In 2001 he
started to give lectures on computer security at the Technikum Wien. Apart from
staring into computer monitors, inspecting hardware and talking to network
equipment he is fond of scuba diving, writing, or photographing with his digital
camera. He would like to have a go at storytelling and roleplaying again as soon
as he finds some more spare time on his backup devices.
