<H1>INFOWORLD MAGAZINE HONORS RED HAT SOFTWARE, INC. AND THE LINUX
COMMUNITY</H1> 
<P>
February 5 1998--Research Triangle Park, NC--InfoWorld Magazine threw
its impressive weight behind the Linux community with  its Product of
the Year  Issue when it named Red Hat Linux 5.0, the OS that acts as a
UNIX workstation for the personal computer,  the Network Operating
System of the Year and gave the Linux user community the award for Best
Technical Support.
<P>
"Find out what you've been missing while you've been rebooting windows
NT," writes InfoWorld Magazine's Eric Hammond of Red Hat Linux 5.0.
Proving that Linux has indeed come of age in the software industry,
Hammond suggests  that, "There isn't any reason why Linux can't be
implemented as an enterprise computing solution...Red Hat recognized
commercial organizations' need for reliable support, and so the company
now provides several help options, including telephone support."
<P>
Hammond mentions "several help options," and an integral component of
these "help options" is the Linux user community.   Active, vocal, and
technically-sophisticated,  the Linux community displays the kind of
pride that comes with ownership.  And since the Linux OS is
cooperatively developed over the internet by many of these users, the
pride of ownership rings true.
<P>
Of the Linux user community and their pride of ownership, InfoWorld's
Ed Foster states, "Linux users rave about the technical support they
receive that goes far beyond the call of duty."  And Foster addresses
the use of Linux in the business environment by writing that
corporations "found the support they received to be far more impressive
than what they were used to with commercial software."
<P>
With Red Hat Linux 5.0 winning the Product of the Year and the Linux
user community receiving accolades for best technical support,
arguments grow stronger in favor of the Linux operating system not only
as a viable alternative to other systems but rather as a preferable,
technically superior OS.
