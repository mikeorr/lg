Thanks for the feedback.&nbsp; I'd heard about this but until Moritz passed
me the URL I hadn't seen the trailer.&nbsp; I didn't try this trailer,

for the medium Linux user as I am, to buy a good graphics card (such as
the TNT fron nVidia, with OpenGL hardware support), or to spend my money
for a commercial X server, given tyhe fact that I cannot afford them both!</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This is not a silly question
for me, for I am still a bit confused on when is good (or even necessary)

<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b><font color="#993300">'Muse:&nbsp;</font></b>
That is a good question.&nbsp; The simple answer is actually a question:&nbsp;
what do you need to do with your computer?&nbsp; What you plan on doing
with your computer will determine what you need to spend money on.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>If you can only spend money
on the hardware OR the software (but not both), and you <i>REALLY</i> need
3D graphics, then spend the money on the video card.&nbsp; But, do you
<i>REALLY</i>
need 3D graphics?&nbsp; What tools do you use that require it?&nbsp; Are
you doing graphics development?&nbsp; Is it 3D graphics development and
do you have to have a 3D, interactive modeller (like Side Effects Houdini)?&nbsp;
The only other big need for 3D graphics are games, and right now there
aren't many that require 3D video cards for Linux.</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This curiosity has
arisen in me reading your article: you must be a professional (?) graphics
user, so before making your choice you must surely have evaluated the variuos
opportunities.</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>'Muse:&nbsp; My purchase decisions
are based on two things: what do I need to do right now, and what will
benefit me in the long term.&nbsp; I spend more up front for hardware in
the expectation that the extra expense will allow me to use that hardware
for a longer period (thus I won't have to keep upgrading hardware every
few months or even every year).&nbsp; I spend less up front for software
because my software needs vary fairly often.&nbsp; Thus, I spent more money
for the Matrox Mystique a few years back, and it's still working quite
well 2 years layer.</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>May I ask you what
do you really think of Commercial X Servers (like the ones of Xi Graphics),
and to whom you'd suggest one?</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b><font color="#993300">'Muse:</font></b>&nbsp;
I recommend end users buy low end video cards and spend the extra cash
on a commercial X server.&nbsp; I've used XFree86 servers but was not satisfied
with their quality.&nbsp; Take that with a grain of salt, of course.&nbsp;
It's been 2 years since I've used XFree86 with anything other than my Matrox
Mystique.&nbsp; However, I tried the SVGA server from XFree86 last year
in order to make use of it's support for XInput (so I could use my drawing
tablet), but it produced some artifacts on my display, enough that I finally
decided to go back to my AcceleratedX server and forget about the drawing
tablet for now.&nbsp; I've heard Xi has added better tablet support in
their latest releases, but I don't have a copy of that so can't say if
it's any better than the version I have now (which doesn't support X Input
for use with the Gimp at all).</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Most end users have no need
for 3D - even most games on Linux don't make use of hardware acceleration
yet.&nbsp; If you're not doing 3D work, then you just need a fairly fast
2D card, and most of the cards available today handle 2D drawing quite
well.&nbsp; Spend a little extra on extra memory on the card so that you
can have high resolution running with a Truecolor visual (ie 16 million
colors).</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Of course, high end users
- like the folks at Digital Domain trying to do effects for films - really
do need that hardware acceleration.&nbsp; I don't often get asked by those
folks what I recommend.&nbsp; They know what they need, and are even in
a position to help push the advancement of 3D support for Linux better
than I am.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>As to which commercial X
server, I'd recommend Xi Graphics.&nbsp; There are only 2 commercial X
servers for Linux currently:&nbsp; Xi and Metro Link.&nbsp; Metro Link's
servers are fairly good, but I wasn't impressed with their installation
tool.&nbsp; X servers are a strange bit of software - end users only deal
with them once and seldom have to muck with them after that.&nbsp; So the
installation tool is one of the most visible aspects of the product.&nbsp;
Being able to select a video card or monitor by name makes life easy.&nbsp;
All of the X server configuration tools (including XFree86) allow this,
but I like Xi Graphics the most.&nbsp; I especially like the text based
installation tool - none of the X based tools (for any of the X server
vendors) is very easy to use.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Still, the decision on which
to use should depend on how well that product supports your hardware.&nbsp;
You need to be able to try it out - both Xi Graphics and Metro Link allow
you to try demos of the server to see if it will work with your hardware.&nbsp;
But you should also check to make sure they have money back guarantees
that extend at least 30 days beyond the date of purchase - preferrably
60 days.&nbsp; Sometimes it may take a while to find strange behaviours
in the server until you get the right combination of applications running
at the same time.</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This would be an
important answer for me, and still an important one for the Italian *.comp.linux
newsgroup, that usually gets involved in discussions of this kind, but
without any owner of a commercial server...</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b><font color="#993300">'Muse:</font></b>&nbsp;
To my knowledge, none of the X server vendors have any native italian speakers
working for them.&nbsp; Metro Link and Xi Graphics are mostly english speaking
(although Thomas Roell at Xi is German).&nbsp; I'm not sure about XFree86,
since
they have developers from many parts of the world involved in their project.&nbsp;
It might just be that none of them has time to follow newsgroups anymore.&nbsp;
I know I don't.</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Thank you in advance,
and excuse me for my intrusion in your mailbox.</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b><font color="#993300">'Muse:</font></b>&nbsp;
No problem.&nbsp; It's no intrusion.&nbsp; You ask a very important question
that I'm sure many of my readers have also wondered about.</font></font>

<h2>
Cataloging and Clipping - gathering online data</h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>One of the projects I've been
working on lately has had to do with gathering information from the Web.&nbsp;
At first glance the information can seem difficult to collect - so many
different pages with so many formats.&nbsp; How does someone make sense
of all that data, especially when it's wrapped inside the sometimes incomprehensible
world of HTML?</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Well, that was my dilemma
originally.&nbsp; I&nbsp;knew that many of the popular Linux sites (freshmeat
and slashdot, for example) have much of their data in standard text files
that can be parsed manually.&nbsp; And I knew that there were some tools
available for parsing those files.&nbsp; Perhaps those tools could be extended
for parsing Web pages.&nbsp; So, my first step was to start looking for
these site-specific tools over at Freshmeat.net.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Most of the tools at freshmeat
were perl or python scripts, and many were capable of processing various
popular sites.&nbsp; The tools included names like sitescooper, pagesucker,
as-news, etc.&nbsp; One wonders what people drink before naming their projects.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>One of the tools I found
was called <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~dwc3q/code/DailyUpdate/">DailyUpdate</a>,
a perl based parsing system.&nbsp; DailyUpdate was originally a free package
but now has been renamed <a href="http://www.newsclipper.com/">NewsClipper</a>,
a commercial open source product.&nbsp; The product's open source version
is free, with personal versions running $29.95US and corporate versions
running $299US.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>NewsClipper is rather slick.&nbsp;
It's a perl script that makes use of a series of existing Perl modules
(the complete list of dependencies is provided in the README and can be
downloaded via the <a href="#Downloading from CPAN:">automated CPAN&nbsp;archives</a>).&nbsp;
A template file is created of an HTML&nbsp;output file that includes NewsClipper
command embedded in HTML&nbsp;comments.&nbsp; NewsClipper reads the commands,
fetches and parses the specified sites on the Internet and replaces the
commands with appropriate HTML in an output file.&nbsp; You can specify
the name of the input template and output HTML&nbsp;files on the command
line as well as have NewsClipper download updates to any existing handlers
you might have that have recently been updated.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The trick to NewsClipper
is it's use of three types of handlers:&nbsp; acquisition, general, and
output.&nbsp; There are over 190 handlers available from the NewsClipper
site.&nbsp; Handlers are just perl scripts that filter the data either
as it is retrieved from the remote site, after it's been retrieved but
before output to HTML, or as it's being output.&nbsp; By far the majority
of handlers are written for acquisition - the retrieval of data from Web
sites.&nbsp; A few stock general and output handlers are provided as well.&nbsp;
As you'll see, I&nbsp;was able to use these latter filters without modification,
allowing me to focus on the acquistion filters completely.</font></font>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>One
of the interesting things I learned while playing with NewsClipper was
how easy it is to update my Perl modules.&nbsp; In order to link NewsClipper
to a database, I&nbsp;installed <a href="http://www.hughes.com.au">mSQL</a>.&nbsp;
In the book, <i>Official Guide to MiniSQL 2.0,</i> by Brain Jepson and
David J. Hughes there is a chapter on using mSQL&nbsp;with Perl.&nbsp;
Here I found the little pearl which made updating my Perl modules a breeze.&nbsp;
I simply run</font></font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>%
perl -MCPAN&nbsp;-e SHELL</font></font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>and I
get into a shell hooked to the CPAN&nbsp;archives.&nbsp; I can then just
run</font></font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>cpan>&nbsp;
install &lt;module></font></font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>where
&lt;module> is the name of the module you want to install.&nbsp; What's
really nice is that any prerequisite packages are also installed.&nbsp;
There are cases where you might not want to install the prerequisites (none
came up when working with NewsClipper or mSQL, however), but for most cases
this little trick will be a real time saver.&nbsp; If you use this, be
sure you're logged in as a user who has write permissions to the directories
where existing Perl modules are installed.&nbsp; Normally, this would be
the root user.&nbsp; I did wonder if running this as a root user with a
connection across the Internet was a possible security violation for my
local system, but since I don't do it often I&nbsp;didn't worry about it.</font></font></font>
