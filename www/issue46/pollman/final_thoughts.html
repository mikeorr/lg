<center><b><font size=+1>Final Thoughts</font></b></center>

<p><b>Updates: </b>All the work you have just done is not worth the effort
if you do not keep your programs up to date. New holes are found every
week and the crackers stay very much up to date. Visit your distribution's
home page often and check what updates are available. Install them immediately!
The Mandrake distribution has one of the best solutions I have seen with
their MandrakeUpdate program.
<p><b>Turn off what you do not use!</b> It might be cool to have all sorts
of services running on your machine (like http, ftp, finger, etc) but unless
you need them, all they do is leave a door open to who ever wants to come
in. Edit your /etc/inetd.conf file and comment out (put a # at the start
of the line) everything you do not need. Since staying up to date is hard
enough, the fewer programs you have to worry about the better your security
will be.
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>How to add a machine into your network later:&nbsp;
</b>It is likely that you'll add systems to your network after you've completed
this setup at some point in the future.&nbsp; Here are the key files that
must be updated with your new system and it's IP&nbsp;address information:</font><font color="#FF0000"></font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hosts.allow</font>

<p><b><i><font color="#33FF33">JC, we need a section like this for machines
and users in each article.&nbsp; DNS and SendMail have some very specific
things that must be done to add systems or users ... we should document
those in the "Final Thoughts" section.</font></i></b>

<p><b>Additional resources</b>: There are plenty of resources available
on the net. Most are for the professionals, but they have some relevance
to us at home as well.&nbsp; Below are some pages we feel are critical
to home security:
<p><a href="ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/security/lasg/">The
Linux Administrator's Security Guide</a> The best source of security related
info available! Get it, print it out, (178 pages as of today) and read
it! Note: it is in pdf format.
<br><a href="http://www.xmission.com/~howardm/security.html">Linux Basic
Security</a> Nice overall look at security
<br><a href="http://rlz.ne.mediaone.net/linux/">Linux Firewall and Security
Site</a> The most comprehensive list of security sites on the net.
<br><a href="http://www.linuxpowered.com/html/linux_links/sec.html">LinuxPowerd.com</a>
Another very comprehensive list of security sites, including pages for
updates of the more common distributions.
