<h1>Automatic Backups with rsync and Anacron</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/odonovan.html">Barry O'Donovan</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>
The thing about backups is that they can just be a pain. Everyone 
<em>knows</em> just how important they are, but very few people actually take 
the time to perform proper backups. Even after they have felt the pain of 
losing all those important files. 

<p>
In this article I am going to show you how to quickly set up your computer for 
simple, hassle-free, and transparent backups using only rsync and cron (or 
Anacron). The premise is simple: every night your computer will make an 
automatic mirror of all the files you wish to backup, and at chosen intervals 
these mirrors will be archived and kept for a specified period of time.

<p>
Before you get our hands dirty on actual implementation you need to design 
your own backup policy. In section 3 I discuss what a backup policy should and 
should not be. I will then introduce the necessary background information on 
rsync and cron separately. Finally, I will put it all together leaving you with 
a simple but effective backup regime.

<h3>2. Intended Audience</h3>

<p>
This article and the presented backup procedure is intended for anyone wishing 
to keep an effective backup of their important data. It is definitely not 
intended for large organisations or businesses with mission critical data. I 
would imagine the ideal candidates would include: home users, home office/small
office users, students/postgraduates, and researchers.

<h3>3. Backup Policies</h3>

<p>
A common misconception among many people is that a good backup policy is as
simple as making a regular copy of your data ("mirroring your data"),
always overwriting the previous copy. This, although more effort than most
might make, is almost as bad as doing nothing. 

<p>
Consider, for example, if one of your files becomes corrupt over time. It takes
you a week or two before you use it again. In that time, you have made two
"backups". You open your file to find your data destroyed. "But", you think to 
yourself, "that's alright, I'll just turn to my backup". You open your backup 
to find the exact same corrupted file. You realise only too late how useless 
your backup policy was.

<p>
Most of us have hundreds, if not thousands, of important files in our home
directories; address books, e-mails, letters, work related data, programs we
have been working on, etc. Some of these files we might use every week, while
others might not be looked at for months or even years. 
	
<p>
A good backup policy is one which takes "snapshots" of your data and
keeps them for a specified period of time. It is up to each individual to
decide just how many snapshots to keep and at what intervals. Often this will
be decided for you by storage limitations. Where possible, data that changes
regularly will benefit from snapshots of smaller intervals, while data that
rarely changes requires fewer intervals. The following table demonstrates my
own backup procedure:

<p>
Each of the snapshots is compressed to reduce space. The largest data in my 
policy is the website. This rarely changes so I keep only a few snapshots. My 
systems <code>/etc</code> directory also changes rarely, but as it is only 28Mb 
I have chosen to keep all possible snapshots. You should now make a similar 
table and decide which data you want to backup and how often.

<p>
The next consideration is where to store your backups. Again, this is your own 
choice. Some locations simply won't be available to you while others might just 
seem like overkill. The following list gives the various options listed from 
the best to the worst:

<dl>
<dt><b>1</b>. On a networked computer in a remote location (such as backing up 
from home to your office computer or vice-versa)</dt>
<dd>This is clearly the ideal situation. Your data will be protected from fire, 
theft, electrical outages, power surges, water/sprinkler damage, etc.</dd>
<p>
<dt><b>2</b>. On a networked computer in another room of you home or office</dt>
<dd>Not as good as (1) above as both original and backup computers could be 
caught by fire, power surges, etc.</dd>
<p>
<dt><b>3</b>. On a second disk drive in your computer</dt>
<dd>Far better than having no backups at all, and you will be protected if one 
of the hard drives fails, but you will still be vulnerable to fire, theft, etc. 
I would certainly recommend a power surge protector if your PSU (power supply 
unit) doesn't have one built in.</dd>
<p>
<dt><b>4</b>. On a separate partition on the same disk drive</dt>
<p>
<dt><b>5</b>. On the same partition on the same disk drive</dt>
<dd>The last two on my list are by far the worst. This couldn't really be 
considered a backup policy of merit. Any hard drive problems, a virus, an 
accidental mistake, etc could ruin you. You are really only insuring yourself 
against accidental deletion or similar operation on the original files.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
If you do not have access to a remote computer yourself, then consider joining 
up with a friend; each of you backing up to the others computer. Security 
concerns can be addressed by encrypting the data before/during transfer and 
only placing the encrypted versions on the remote computer.

<h3>4. rsync - The Fast, Flexible File Transfer Utility</h3>

<p>
rsync is a very fast and flexible file transfer utility. It uses its own 
"remote update" protocol to transfer just the differences between two sets of 
files. It can operate locally or across a network link using rcp, ssh or its 
own daemon. rsync is included with most standard Linux distributions by 
default, or it can be downloaded from its website (<a 
href="http://rsync.samba.org">http://rsync.samba.org</a>).

<p>
We are going to use rsync to mirror our files every night. rsync is the ideal 
choice as it will <em>only</em> transfer new files, the differences between 
existing files that have changed, and remove old files, minimising the 
bandwidth usage for dial-up/broadband customers. 

<p>
The mirrors are easiest to implement when we take entire directories and its 
sub-directories. Let's take the case where you are mirroring all your e-mail 
files from your home computer to your office computer. We would use rsync as 
follows:
<p>

<pre class="code">
rsync -r -e ssh --delete /home/username/mail username@mycomputer.mycompany.com:/backups/mail
</pre><p>
where:
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><code>-r</code></dt>
<dd>Instructs rsync to copy directories recursively.</dd>
<dt><code>-e ssh</code></dt>
<dd>Tells rsync to use the ssh remote shell. More about this below.</dd>
<dt><code>--delete</code></dt>
<dd>Instructs rsync to delete files on the receiving side which do not exist 
on the sending side.</dd>
<dt><code>/home/username/mail</code></dt>
<dd>The directory we are mirroring.</dd>
<dt><code>username@mycomputer.mycompany.com:/backups/mail</code></dt>
<dd>Log in as user <code>username</code> on 
<code>mycomputer.mycompany.com</code> and create/update the mirror in 
<code>/backups/mail</code> </dd>
</dl> 
</blockquote>

<p>
This will create a mirror of <code>/home/username/mail</code> on 
<code>mycomputer.mycompany.com</code> under the directory 
<code>/backups/mail/mail</code>. This is what we want. If you wanted the 
reverse (backing-up from <code>mycomputer.mycompany.com</code> to your home 
computer) you would simply switch the source and destination:
<br><br>
<code>rsync -r -e ssh --delete username@mycomputer.mycompany.com:/home/username/mail /backups/mail</code><br><br>
	
<p>
I recommend that you use the ssh protocol to ensure the secrecy of your data 
while it is being transferred. If you are performing this backup on a closed 
network, feel free to use the older rsh protocol or rsync's own daemon. Using 
networked backups creates one more problem: we want this to be automatic, with 
no user interaction, but using rsh or ssh generally requires a password to be 
entered. We will overcome this by using public/private keys 
<strong>without pass-phrases</strong> to achieve this.

<h4>4.1 Setting up password-less authentication for ssh</h4>

<p>
This article is not intended as a tutorial on ssh so I will only provide a 
brief instruction on setting up private/public key authentication using ssh. 
Please refer to the ssh documentation for a more thorough discussion.

<p>
The following two commands will set up password-less authentication from your 
computer to <code>mycomputer.mycompany.com</code>:

<blockquote>
<code>$ ssh-keygen -b 1024 -t rsa -f /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa</code><br>
<em>(do not enter a pass-phrase - leave it blank)</em><br>
<code>$ scp /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub username@mycomputer.mycompany.com:/home/username/.ssh/authorized_keys</code><br>
</blockquote>

<p>
Usually any problems encountered are down to the permissions of the various 
key files. Use ssh in verbose mode (<code>ssh -v</code>) and check the ssh 
daemon logs on both machines (usually <code>/var/log/secure</code>).

<p>
In using this method it is important for you to be aware of the security 
concerns that arise. The <code>ssh-keygen</code> command produced two files:
<ul>
<li><code>/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa</code>: the private key
<li><code>/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>: the public key
</ul>
You should ensure the permissions of the private key are 
<code>-rw-------</code> (i.e., only readable by the owner). This file is the 
equivalent of having a text file containing your login password to your account 
at <code>mycomputer.mycompany.com</code>; <strong>anyone who gets their hands 
on this file will be able to log into that account without knowing your 
password</strong>. However, any potential hacker must first gain access to your 
home computer in order to get at this file. 
	 
<p>
If you use this method you should also consider the following security measures:
<ul>
<li>ensure both machines have an effective firewall configured (see my article 
in last month's edition <a href="../103/odonovan.html">here</a>). You can
use some of the features of iptables such as specifying the exact IPs
that are allowed access to the system.</li>
<li>set-up a new user account on the backup machine and use that account for 
backups only.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. cron - Daemon to Execute Scheduled Commands</h3>

<p>
cron is an integral part of most Linux distributions. It is used to execute 
commands at specific times according to a schedule you set. We will use it to 
set-up a nightly mirror of all the files we wish to backup, and to create the 
snapshots at the intervals we determined in section 3.

<p>
Each user on a Linux system has their own cron table ("crontab") which 
contains the schedule of commands. This can be listed using 
'<code>crontab -l</code>', removed with '<code>crontab -r</code>' and edited 
with '<code>crontab -e</code>'. Let's add the daily mirror command so that
it occurs at 2am every day by placing the following in our crontab:

<p>
<pre class="code">
00 02 * * * rsync -r -e ssh --delete /home/username/mail username@mycomputer.mycompany.com:/backups/mail
</pre>

<p>
where the five fields (<code>0 2 * * *</code>) are (respectively):
<p>
<blockquote>
<table border="1" summary="">
<thead>
<tr>		
    <td align="center">Field</td><td align="center">Allowed Values</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tr>
    <td align="center">
	minute<br>
	hour<br>
	day of month<br>
	month<br>
	day of week
    </td>
    <td align="center">
	0-59<br>
	0-23<br>
	1-31<br>
	1-12<br>
	0-7<sup>*</sup>
    </td>
</tr>
</table>
( <sup>*</sup>0 or 7 is Sunday)
</blockquote>
	
<p>
So, in our case, we will mirror the contents of 
<code>/home/username/mail</code> at 02:00 on every day of every month. We can 
place similar entries for all other directories you wish to mirror. 
Alternatively, we could create a script containing all the entries and use cron 
to execute that script.

<p>
There are two useful environment variables you can also set when editing the 
crontab to override the defaults:<br>
<code>
SHELL=/bin/sh<br>
MAILTO=username</code>
	
<p>
The <code>MAILTO</code> is important as all error messages will only be sent 
by e-mail and so you will notified if your backups are failing. Refer to the 
crontab man page for more information and examples.

<h3>6. Putting It All Together</h3>

<p>
Now that we have the basics of rsync and cron, all we have left to do is to put 
them all together to create our backup policy. Let's continue with the example 
where your home computer is sending its daily mirror to your office computer. 
You office computer will now be responsible for the remainder of the backup 
policy: the snapshots at the predefined intervals. We will use another crontab 
on the office machine to accomplish this and I will demonstrate using the 
schedule for my thesis from section 3.

<p>
The method is quite simple. For example, every Sunday we will move the 3 week 
old snapshot to 1 month old snapshot, the 2 week old to the 3 week old, the 1 
week old to the 2 week old and archive the mirror to the 1 week old. So, 
depending on the time of the week, the 3 week old snapshot could be as young 
as 2 weeks or as old as 3 weeks.

<p>
My schedule requires snapshots that are 1, 2, and 3 weeks old and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 
months old. We will work from the oldest down (as otherwise we would only be 
propagating the new snapshot):

<pre class="code">
# Back up mail files with snapshots of 6, 4, 3, 2, 1 months and 3, 2, 1 weeks
# Order 4m-&gt;6m, 3m-&gt;4m, 2m-&gt;3m, 1m-&gt;2m, 3w-&gt;1m, 2w-&gt;3w, 1w-&gt;2w, mirror-&gt;1w

# At 3am on the 1st of Jan,Mar,May,Jul,Sep,Nov copy the 4m to the 6m
00 03 1 1,3,5,7,9,11 * cp -f /backups/thesis/backup/4month.tar.gz /backups/thesis/backup/6month.tar.gz

# At 3.02am on the 1st of every month move the 3m to the 4m (and continue for other months)
02 03 1 * * cp -f /backups/thesis/backup/3month.tar.gz /backups/thesis/backup/4month.tar.gz
04 03 1 * * cp -f /backups/thesis/backup/2month.tar.gz /backups/thesis/backup/3month.tar.gz
06 03 1 * * cp -f /backups/thesis/backup/1month.tar.gz /backups/thesis/backup/2month.tar.gz
08 03 1 * * cp -f /backups/thesis/backup/3week.tar.gz  /backups/thesis/backup/1month.tar.gz

# And then every Sunday take care of the weekly snapshots and the archiving of the mirror
10 03 * * 0 cp -f /backups/thesis/backup/2week.tar.gz  /backups/thesis/backup/3week.tar.gz
12 03 * * 0 cp -f /backups/thesis/backup/1week.tar.gz  /backups/thesis/backup/2week.tar.gz
14 03 * * 0 rm -f /backups/thesis/backup/1week.tar.gz
16 03 * * 0 tar zcf /backups/thesis/backup/1week.tar.gz /backups/thesis/thesis/*
</pre>

<p>
And that my friends is your automatic, hassle-free, and effective backup system.

<p>
A few points on the above:
<ul>
<li>I have placed each command 2 minutes apart to allow the previous one to 
complete. Adjust this depending on your own file sizes, system load, hard disk 
speed, etc.
<li>In the example in section 5 for the automatic mirroring I set the mirror 
time to 2 a.m. Ensure, as I have done here, that the snapshots get created after 
the mirror (i.e., allow enough time for the mirroring to complete)
<li>Before the first run you should ensure all directories are created, 
archive the existing mirror, and copy it to all the required files (copy 
<code>1week.tar.gz</code> to <code>2week.tar.gz</code>, 
<code>3week.tar.gz</code>, etc) to prevent unnecessary error messages
</ul>

<h3>7. Anacron vs. cron</h3> 

<p>
Anacron is a periodic command scheduler similar to some uses of cron, but it 
does not assume that the system is running continuously. It can therefore be 
used for our backup policy on systems that don't run 24 hours a day. Just like 
rsync and cron, Anacron is now part of most standard Linux distributions.

<p>
Every time Anacron is run, it reads a configuration file that specifies the 
jobs Anacron controls, and their periods in days. If a job wasn't executed in 
the last n days, where n is the period of that job, Anacron executes it. The 
configuration file is usually <code>/etc/anacrontab</code>.

<p>
For the daily mirroring we could add a line to this configuration file such as:
<p>
<pre class="code">
1   20  mirror  rsync -r -e ssh --delete /home/username/thesis username@mycomputer.mycompany.com:/backups/thesis
</pre>
<p>
where the fields mean:
<dl>
<dt><code>1</code></dt>
<dd>the period in days indicating how often this command should be executed</dd>
<dt><code>20</code></dt>
<dd>the delay in minutes after Anacron begins before it should execute this 
command</dd>
<dt><code>mirror</code></dt>
<dd>a unique identifier for this job so Anacron can keep track of when it was 
last executed</dd>
<dt><code>rsync...</code></dt>
<dd>the command to execute</dd>
</dl>

<p>
And similarly on the backup machine we would place the following in the Anacron configuration file:
<pre class="code">
# Back up mail files with snapshots of 6,4,3,2,1 months and 3,2,1 weeks
# Order 4m-&gt;6m, 3m-&gt;4m, 2m-&gt;3m, 1m-&gt;2m, 3w-&gt;1m, 2w-&gt;3w, 1w-&gt;2w, mirror-&gt;1w

# Every 60 days (2 months)
60 20 bup1 cp -f /backups/thesis/backup/4month.tar.gz /backups/thesis/backup/6month.tar.gz

# every 30 days (1 month)
30 22 bup2 cp -f /backups/thesis/backup/3month.tar.gz /backups/thesis/backup/4month.tar.gz
30 24 bup3 cp -f /backups/thesis/backup/2month.tar.gz /backups/thesis/backup/3month.tar.gz
30 26 bup4 cp -f /backups/thesis/backup/1month.tar.gz /backups/thesis/backup/2month.tar.gz
30 28 bup5 cp -f /backups/thesis/backup/3week.tar.gz  /backups/thesis/backup/1month.tar.gz

# And every 7 days
7 30 bup5 cp -f /backups/thesis/backup/2week.tar.gz  /backups/thesis/backup/3week.tar.gz
7 32 bup7 cp -f /backups/thesis/backup/1week.tar.gz  /backups/thesis/backup/2week.tar.gz7 
7 34 bup8 rm -f /backups/thesis/backup/1week.tar.gz
7 36 bup9 tar zcf /backups/thesis/backup/1week.tar.gz /backups/thesis/thesis/*
</pre>

A few notes on this:
<ul>
<li>You really need to plan well if using Anacron. What if the office machine 
is regularly off while the home machine is trying to rsync? Anacron can work 
best in this situation if it is the <em>source</em> machine that is not always running; 
it can perform the rsync and then take care of the snapshots.
<li>Ensure you make proper use of the delay time to ensure one job has 
finished before the other starts
<li>Anacron is also ideal for laptop users 
</ul>
