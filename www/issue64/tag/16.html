Hello TAG--
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have attempted recompiles of RH 6.2 several times, and have
encountered similar problems every time.  After recompiling the
kernel, the new kernel will boot correctly but some modules don't
load because of dependencies on other modules that are not loaded.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Just now, I have encountered a more fatal problem--no modules
will load at all.  When I try to "insmod" or otherwise load the
module, it lists symbols that it cannot resolve.  One in particular
that I checked out--best_malloc--is a symbol that appears to be in
the kernel itself.  Every module seems to need it, and none can
find it.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The modules themselves appear to be in the right place.  ksyms -a
appears to see the symbols that the modules are looking for,
when those symbols aren't in other modules that aren't loaded.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
So, two questions.  (1) Is there a simple utility/series of steps
for compiling and loading all modules and their dependent modules,
avoiding potential problems in xconfig associated with not
specifying all of the proper module dependencies, and (2) do
you know why this latest recompile doesn't let any modules load
at all due to external symbols that it can't find in the kernel?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Any help is appreciated.
</STRONG></P>

Just a guess, off the top of my head - are you doing the "make modules"
and the "make modules_install" steps? Here is the complete list of steps
for a "from-scratch" kernel compile for my own system:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
make mrproper                           # Not necessary for a recompile
<BR>make [config|menuconfig|xconfig]        # Choose one; xconfig is easiest
<BR>make dep
<BR>make clean
<BR>make [zImage|bzImage]                   # I always use bzImage these days
<BR>make modules
<BR>make modules_install
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><dl>
<dt>Save the old kernel (I keep a "current" and an "old" copy) -
<dd><tt>mv /boot/vmlinuz-2.2.17 /boot/vmlinuz-2.2.17-old</TT>
</dl></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><dl>
<dt>Put the new image in <TT>/boot</TT> and rename it -
<dd><tt>cp /usr/src/kernel-source-2.2.17/arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-2.2.17</TT>
</dl></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have symlinks, "<TT>/vmlinuz</TT>" and "<TT>/vmlinuz-old</TT>", to "<TT>/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.17</TT>"
and "<TT>/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.17-old</TT>";
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
all that remains, since my "<TT>/etc/lilo.conf</TT>"
is properly set up, is to run "<TT>/sbin/lilo</TT>":
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><pre>

<BLOCKQUOTE><dl>
<dt>Save the old system map -

<BLOCKQUOTE><dl>
<dt>Copy the new one -

<BLOCKQUOTE><dl>

<dd><tt>mv /boot/config-2.2.17 /boot/config-2.2.17-old</TT>

<BLOCKQUOTE><dl>
<dt>Copy the new one -
<dd><tt>cp /usr/src/kernel-source-2.2.17/.config /boot/config-2.2.17</TT>
</dl></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Obviously, all of the above can (and should) be put in a shell script with
some options on what to run.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Done.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note that if you try to run a new kernel with old modules (or vice versa,
by not installing the new kernel properly), you'll get just the kind of
errors that you're reporting.

make modules ; make modules_install

<p><strong>
and it appeared to copy the right object files in
the right directory tree, and compiled cleanly.

<p><strong>
Is it possible that the symbol table used
to resolve external references between modules and
the kernel has been corrupted?

Hey Mike,
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This may or may not help you.  I use <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> 6.4 as my distribution (2.2.14
kernel).  I too have to go through all of that cool build stuff.  One thing
that the SuSE distribution says to do.  I have to copy
<TT>/usr/src/linux/System.map</TT> to the root directory (<TT>/</TT>).  That file contains
kernel symbols which are needed by the modules to launch kernel functions
correctly.  I know that Linux is Linux, but, I must be careful when passing
this information.  It applies to the SuSE 6.4 distribution; maybe it applies
to your <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> distribution.

Let someone with more Linux knowledge answer your other questions.

Thx for the interest...should have laid out the entire process
that I followed for compiling but didn't because I don't have
linux on the net, needed to switch to Windows to send e-mail...
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Still stumped.  Something is really broken.  I must be doing
something wrong to not have the kernel compile right out of
the box.  Just can't find it.  Followed all directions to the
letter.

It's not necessarily you doing anything wrong. The compile-and-install
procedure, as I have laid it out, is somewhat tedious (hence, my
suggestion of a shell script) but not difficult - if you follow it step by
step and it still doesn't work, you need to look at other things.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Where did you get the source? If possible, you should use the package that
your distro producer has - they may have done some quirky stuff in the
setup that needs to be there for it to work properly. In theory, you
<EM>should</EM> be able to just download it from kernel.org, compile, and run -
but people like RedHat have <EM>so</EM> many things already configured in that
I'd rather not guess. Somehow, (mirabile dictu!) I've avoided doing a
RedHat kernel recompile, and <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> has never cared where the source comes
from, but it's a possibility.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Try "disabling" the old modules by renaming the directory that contains
them -
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
mv /lib/modules/2.2.17 /lib/modules/2.2.17-old
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Then, after doing the "make modules_install", check in "<TT>/lib/modules</TT>" to
make sure that you have a new "2.2.17" directory, that there is a
reasonable directory tree under it ("block", "fs", "misc", "net", etc.),
and that the modules that should be there are indeed there. (Obviously,
you'll have to change the numbers for your own kernel version.) I seem to
remember having a problem, in the past, where "modules_install" failed
rather quietly and did not create the directories or copy the modules...
I'm trying to recall the fix, but the best I can come up with is that it
had something to do with the Makefile syntax in "modules_install".
Whatever it was, moving the old modules directory made the error obvious,
and the fix wasn't a difficult one.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Whenever I've found myself in this kind of a maze of little passages, all
alike, The Canonical Fix that always worked was a complete, from-scratch
(meaning, including "mrproper" and "clean") compile, perhaps including
deleting the existing source tree and re-unpacking the tarball or package.
If <EM>that</EM> doesn't work, I'd either suspect the provenance of the source, or
I'd write to the kernel maintainers with a complete description.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course, if you're building an experimental kernel, you're on your own.
Subscribing to a developer's list might be the only answer.
