Interesting interview with a former adware blackhat.

<p>
Quote describing adware wars between competitors:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
M: [...] I used tinyScheme, which is a BSD licensed, very small, very
fast implementation of Scheme that can be compiled down into about a 20K
executable if you know what you're doing.
 
Eventually, instead of writing individual executables every time a worm
came out, I would just write some Scheme code, put that up on the
server, and then immediately all sorts of things would go dark. It
amounted to a distributed code war on a 4-10 million-node network.
 
S: In your professional opinion, how can people avoid adware?
 
M: Um, run UNIX.

<h3>SugarCRM and badgeware licensing, again</h3>

</p>

<p>
By the way, I've just now reminded Bruce Perens of his kind offer, last
February, to let Prof. Moglen know about the latest SugarCRM ploy.  I've
stressed that we'd be glad to hear any feedback, if Prof. Moglen has
time.  I'll let <em>LG</em> know if/when I hear back.
</p>

<p>
To correct my below-quoted wording, strictly speaking, SugarCRM's latest
licensing doesn't literally replicate the "_exact same_ badgeware clause"
as in the prior proprietary licence, but it's really close:  As written,
the licensing ends up requiring derivative works to display the firm's
trademarked logo or equivalent text (if technology used doesn't support
displaying logos) on _each and every user interface page_ of SugarCRM's 
codebase that the derivative uses.

&gt; &gt; Zimbra is distributed under the Yahoo Public Licence, which isn't

</pre>

<p>
That's because it's proprietary -- and because Zimbra (now Yahoo)
deliberately avoided submitting it for OSI certification, knowing it
would be denied.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; It is basically the MPL, and reasonably free, from my research.
</pre>

<p>
It's a "badgeware" proprietary licence that deliberately impairs
third-party commercial usage through mandatory advertising notices
forced on third parties at runtime for all derivative works, one of a
series of such licences produced by Web 2.0 / ASP / Software as a Service
companies that carefully avoid seeking OSI licence certification,
because they know they can't get it.  Non-free.
</p>

<p>
In YPL's case, the clause that makes it non-free is 3.2:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
    3.2 - In any copy of the Software or in any Modification you create,
    You must retain and reproduce, any and all copyright, patent, trademark,
    and attribution notices that are included in the Software in the same
    form as they appear in the Software. This includes the preservation of
    attribution notices in the form of trademarks or logos that exist within
    a user interface of the Software.
</pre>


<pre>
&gt; OTOH, not all components of Zimbra are covered under it, so the whole
&gt; thing is kind of non-free, depending on your tastes.
&gt; 
&gt; I believe the entire OS edition is freely available, though.
</pre>

<p>
This is a very typical marketing tactic for badgeware:  There is a
"public licence" (badgeware) version to entice new users, that's left
buggy, feature-shy, and poorly documented.  If those users then try to
submit bugs, or request fixes, or inquire about customisations, the
sales staff then launches an all-out effort to upsell them to the
"commercial version".  (***COUGH*** SugarCRM ***COUGH***).

Hello list,
</p>

<p>
Has one any faced the problem with latest rootkit hunter ( 1.3.4 ) ? I have 
upgraded the rootkit hunter to 1.3.4 and after that it reports a huge 
warning.  I don't know if the Warnings really indicate any hole in my system 
or it is just the rootkit hunter it self which creates false alarm. Below is 
the scan report. Any idea ?

<p>
I'm trying to do something rather abstruse and complex with a weird mix
of software, hardware, and crazy hackery (too long to explain and it
would be boring to most people if I did), but - I need a "magic bullet"
and I'm hoping that somebody here can point me in the right direction,
or maybe toss a bit of code at me. Here it goes: I need a module that
would create a serial-USB device (/dev/ttyUSB9 by preference) and let me
pipe data into it without actually plugging in any hardware.
</p>

<p>
Is this even possible? Pretty much all of my programming experience is
in the userspace stuff, and beating on bare metal like that is something
I've always considered black magic, so I have absolutely no idea.

Both the computers there and my home computer use linux. I might not be able

Hi, I was wondering what are the possibilities of creating and using virtual
disks for. I understand I can use dd to create it then mkfs.ext3 or
something like it to format the disk. What purpose could they be used for
besides serving as a foundation for creating a live cd?
</p>

<p>
I want to do this from the cli so no gui.
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
