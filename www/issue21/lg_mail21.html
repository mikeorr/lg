Subject: Difficulty running programmes

<p>I am using Linux Slackware 3.0 with kernel version 2.0.  I am running   
a LAN and whenever I try to run a script or a program that I created on
the server, I get a command not found error, even though I have read
write permissions on the file in my own directory.  If I transfer that
same file to another Linux box on this LAN, I can run it without any
problems.

<p>Is there an easy fix to this problem?

<p>Thank you.

Subject: Connecting to dynamic IP via ethernet

<p>Hello.
I want to connect my Linux box to our ethernet ring here at my company.
The problem is that
they(we) use dynamic IP adresses, and I don't know how to get an adress.
I use win95 on
one partition on my pc, from where it works fine to connect. I know the
IP adress to the
DCHP-server (that the one who distributes the IP-adresses, right?) but
how do I do to get
assigned an IP-adress from Linux? I got so tired of trying, that I
finally just assigned an adress
myself and hey, somethings work. I can use telnet and ftp but X takes 15
minutes to start, and
emacs likewise. I can't wait that amount and also I'm sure there are
several thing that don't work.
Please, if you know how to do, explain carefully, I'm not all that good
at linux and tcp/ip hacking.
<p>Denny

Subject: Printing PostScript to a DeskJet 682C

<p>I've got a question that I'd to have answered. I've got an HP DeskJet
682C printer that I'd like to use to print pages out from Netscape.
Unfortunately, the printer only recognizes text and PCL 3, while
Netscape only uses PostScript. Is there a filter that is capable of
converting PostScript to PCL 3. Also, to print text to this printer, I
have to pipe the file that I want to print to todos and then pipe that
to the printer. How can I automate this? Thank you very much in advance
for any help that you can give me.

Subject: Problem with adaptec 2940U

<p>Answer: RedHat versions <4.0 use older kernels which don't have aic7xxx
support, I found this out the hard way, back when the aic7xxx driver was
only being developed, if you are talking about a version of RedHat that
uses 2.0.x kernels, then they get loaded in as a module (when it asks
what type of SCSI host adapter you have), if this is not loading then it
might be an idea to check if it is sharing an IRQ with another device in
windows 95 (if you are unlucky enough to have it!), and manually change
it.  The aic7xxx driver is very new (>2.x kernels only) but there are
problems on some hardware configurations.

Subject: Linux Help needed to connect to Internet

<p>I am a new Linux user, and inexperienced in Unix environments.  My aim in using
Linux is to connect to the internet without needing to use Windows, in order to
learn about Linux and update my linux setup (Slackware Linux Toolkit March 1997,
which I will install again soon).  I have had X Windows and Netscape Navigator
3.01 installed,and will do so again after a hard disc upgrade.  I am unable to
connect to the internet. Could anyone help me to do this?
My modem is on COM2, and works under windows as a generic modem. I know the
number of my ISP, that my IP address is server assigned.  I have the IP
addresses of the primary and secondary DNS, and have my own username and
password.  Is there anyhing else I need to know, and can anyone help me with
this?  I would be very grateful for all assistance given.

Subject:LILO Problems 

<p>I have this 2 gig scsi drive. I have Linux and Windows 95 on my system.
95 is on the first gig and Linux is on the 2nd. Lilo gives me problems
with booting Linux from the second gig. And windows just will not see it.
Its a old scsi disk. So I cant use sector compadibility mode. Right now.
I use Lodlin (and some 95 proggy) to drop out of 95 and kick linux in.
Eather this or I have to use a installation floppy (I cant load lilo on
a floppy because it gives me disks problems there too) You know of any
boot managers that I can gain access to that can read the entire disk? I
know the NT boot loader can do this. But there is no point in loading NT
for this task.
Another problem I have is this. I have a Windows NT box as a proxy
server for my internet connection. (I can't convert it to Linux, it's not
my box) I can get Windows 95 to send all ip requests threw the proxy
using the ms proxy client. (ex: quake over the net) But with Linux I
can't seem to do that. I have used Netscape a bit for this purpose. But I
still can't do anything else. Is there a way to get Linux to work over a
proxy itself? I could just dail into my ISP va PPP. But I already have
a 10 megabit connection to them. What's the point of using a modem. Is
there a way I can get around this problem?
Another question I have is can I make a swap from an image or some other
media. I don't want to kill my Linux partition to gain this. But, I have
a 16 meg swap partition and 16 megs of ram. Trying to run progams like
Wabi is of no use. They don't seem to have enough memory. Is there a way
to add more swap space with out disturbing the exsisting partitions?
Well thank you for your time.
Long live LINUX!!!<br>

<p>Hey all,
<p>Do you guys know of any information regarding programming a game in
Linux on the X11 platform? I want to use it as a cross developer for
some DOS games. The main issue here is this: How do I display my output?

Subject: Apllixware -- Fax

<p>I bought applixware some time ago and found that I was supposed to roll
my own Fax interface.  Somebody at work suggested just setting up a
"printer" for fax.  Logical to me.  As I don't do Linux for a living or
a hobby; it would be nice if somebody could write and article on how to
do it.   Or point me to instructions.  I looked around and was unable to
find any.
<p>There is supposed to be instructions in how to make netscape do
standard PGP/RSA digital signatures that can be verified on any PGP
system, not just inside of netscape.  Simple instructions on this would
be nice.  
<p>If I get around to doing these things first, I will write an article on
how I did it.
<p>
Enjoy<br>

November issue of Linux Journal. While the magazine won't be out until next
month, the listings that go with it (including his front end) are available

Subject: Organize and overtake!

<p>Well, I'm pretty sure there are people doing this, but not very fast or
efficiently. We need a stable, friendly, easy-to-install system that
comes equiped with applications that allow the user to begin working
right away, and configure without programming knowledge!

<p>Yes, it's *nix.
Yes, it's a programmers environment.
Yes, it doesn't HAVE to be terse, hard to configure, etc.

<p>Hell, maybe I'll have to do it!

Subject: MS quote

<p>This comes via a Mac friend of mine.  We should look closely at aligning
with the Mac users of the world.  They hate MS almost as much as we do.  :-)

This tidbit is from:
Dave Reiser, <a href="mailto:dbr@ptd.net">dbr@ptd.net</a>

In a page 1 article in the July 28, 1997 Computerworld there's an article
ENTITLED "Microsoft Declares War" about how MS has announced that it will
not ship the Java class libraries.

I absolutely howled when I read this quote:

"'We have no intention of shipping another bloated operating system and
forcing that down the throats of our Windows customers'" [attributed to
Paul Maritz, Microsoft Group Vice President]

Are they feeling guilty about the fact that they've already rammed one
bloated operating system down their customers' throats?

Subject: Descent 3D for Linux? 

<p>Linux has always been the perfect platform for games, it's just very
few developers (id and Crack.com
are the only two worth mentioning that I know of) know that.

<P>Actually I think many of the developers know the value of Linux, but
there is no marketing proof that a Linux port will make money.  As many
others have said in the past, we need certifiable numbers to prove the
market exists and that its willing to spend money on commercial
products.  I don't have any info on it, but I'd love to know if either
Id or Crack.com made any money on their Linux ports.  And I'd like to
know if it was enough, in their eyes, to warrant future ports.  I've a
gut feeling the Id guys may have done their port simply because they
liked the idea and did it for fun, but thats just an unsubstantiated
hunch.

<P>I just got back from SIGGRAPH today and after having talked to many
engineers from lots of different companies I can say that nearly all are
*very* aware of Linux and most (that I talked to) are using it.  One
engineer from Cosmos Software, the new division at SGI, said they'd
probably be happy to let someone do the port of the new Cosmo Player
1.0  to Linux (although he wasn't sure how to go about getting that
done).  Most of the companies at the conference who are Unix aware are
also Linux aware.  They just need a little proof that the market will
return their investment within a reasonable time frame.

<P>One of the things I decided to do while I was at SIGGRAPH was to write
an article outlining how to begin to get reasonable market figures for
Linux with respect to graphics tools and games (other vertical markets
are a bit out of my league).  I'm sketching this out now and will
probably submit it to the Linux Journal in September or October.  Much
of it resolves around the use of simple Multimedia applications.
Anyway, once we have the numbers to back us up, it will be a little
easier to convince game developers to include Linux ports of their
software.

Subject: Firewire and DV

<P>I just got back from SIGGRAPH.  To my knowledge there are no plans for
Firewire support for Linux, but I have to admit I didn't specifically go
looking for it.  I'm not even completely sure what it is (although
thought it was just another 3D chipset).  I've been on a personal
crusade to get Linux noticed as a terrific platform for image processing
and graphic arts tools, and that includes (eventually) Digital Video
(DV) tools.  However, although there are quite a large number of tools
for doing computer graphics (including plenty of support for OpenGL,
both commercially and in the freeware MesaGL package), I've not seen any
DV style tools.  I'd say its a little early for such tools on a
commercial basis since more basic tools are not commercially supported
yet.  But its certainly something I'll continue to keep an eye on and do
my best to encourage.

<P>DV tools would work as well on Linux as any other high-end Unix system,
but tools like graphics tablets and scanners need better support before
we'll get into DV tools.  We also need a decent GUI toolkit.  Motif is
ok, but a bit bloated.  Most of the other toolkits don't have enough
printed documentation available yet.  While at SIGGRAPH, Mark Kilgard
told me that there is a new toolkit that sits on top of GLUT that might
be a good basis for a more advanced toolkit.  I haven't had time to look
at it yet (I just got back today).

Anyway, I hope this helps a little.  If you find any DV tools or have
contacts that could use a little polite prodding, feel free to drop me a
line.
