Hi I a, new to Linux I have installed Vector Linux on my machine but 
unfortunately where I live only dial up internet is available and I can 
only dial up the internet if I am signed in as root, if I sign in with 
the other account, chestnut dialer will not dial up at all it keeps 
telling me it cannot open the modem, is there a way to be able to use 
the other account to dial up the internet since I keep getting the 
warning message that I shouldn't run the computer in root?Thanks Vesna

I'm not familiar with Vector Linux, but in most distributions the usual 
solution is to add your user to the group that "owns" the modem. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/slackware-linux-help/84737-dial-up-modem-works-fine-root-but-permission-denied-ttys0-when-user-tries.html">http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/slackware-linux-help/84737-dial-up-modem-works-fine-root-but-permission-denied-ttys0-when-user-tries.html</a> 
suggests that for vector the required group is "dialout".

As Neil has already suggested, you probably need to add yourself to the
group that has the permissions to use the modem device. I'll walk
through the procedure in detail, since this is a common admin task and
comes in useful in other places (e.g., allowing only a certain group to
use a given directory, for instance.)
</p>

<p>
First, check the ownership and permissions on your modem device. E.g.,
if it's /dev/ttyS0 (the first serial port), issue the "ls -l" command:
</p>

<pre>
ben@Tyr:/tmp$ ls -l /dev/ttyS0
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 4, 64 2008-09-18 08:21 /dev/ttyS0
</pre>

<p>
Mine is correctly set up - it's a "c"haracter device, belonging to
"root" and with group set to "dialout", with read and write permissions
set for owner and group.
</p>

<p>
In the general case, that's exactly what it should be. Note that the
group name isn't critical - it may be something other than "dialout" on
some systems; what's important is that the group exists and that the
users who are allowed to use the device belong to it. The permissions
should be set so that the owner and the group (but no one else) can both
read from and write to the device; this allows for nicely granular
control on systems with many users.
</p>

<p>
Let's assume that all of this is completely wrong on /dev/ttyS0, and we
need to set it all up; in fact, let's assume that the "dialout" group
does not exist, and that we need to grant modem use permissions to user
'bob'. Here's how that would go (note that you need to be root to do
this):
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
addgroup dialout                    # Create the group
chown root:dialout /dev/ttyS0       # Set the owner/group
chmod 660 /dev/ttyS0                # Set read/write perms for owner/group
adduser bob dialout                 # Add 'bob' to 'dialout'
</pre>

<p>
Note that if "bob" is logged in, he'll have to log out and log back in
for the group membership change to take effect.
</p>
