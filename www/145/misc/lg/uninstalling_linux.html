So a friend of mine sends me a couple of hard drives for my birthday
telling me one used to be a linux drive and that i will more than likely
need to partition it. So i hook it up in my tower and turn the thing on.
Here's what I see....
<pre>
  [Linux-bzImage, setup=0x1e00, size=0x16eb71]
  initrd /initrd -2.6.15-1.2054_FC5.img

1.  The very first Google hit on "remove Linux" is 
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314458">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314458</a> , "How to Remove Linux and
Install Windows XP".  Article appears to be sufficient albeit grossly
overcomplicated.
</p>

<p>
2.  However, I would think it <em>should</em> suffice to just boot your
MS-Windows XP installer from its CD or DVD or whatnot, and tell it to 
blow away whatever's on the target hard drive.  I'm pretty sure that
<em>even</em> XP can handle that extremely elementary installation task.
</p>

<p>
Basically, what you tried to do was boot the hard drive.  As the old
technical support joke goes, Don't Do That, Then.

If you're booting the MS-Windows XP installer CD/DVD, the installer
program (Setup or whatnot) would (usually/often/always) hiccup if it
finds that your master IDE HDD has a partition on it. Setup doesn't
care what kind of partition, as long as there's a partition. Then
you'd get the infamous BSOD, or your screen would just blank out.

I actually checked using an XP installation CD and the ThinkPad T42p
test machine in front of me, which has a bunch of Linux swap and ext3 
filesystems on it.  No such problem seen.
</p>

<p>
I did not proceed to actually wipe the drive, as I have uses for those
filesystems, as yet.
</p>

<p>
FWIW, in the general case, I'd just keep a live CD around, boot it, and
"dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdXX bs=512 count=1".  Clean, fast, foolproof.
But the "I want to install XP" querent wouldn't want to hear that, so I 
didn't bother to tell him.

<p>
When I said that Setup would hiccup, I have actually tried to boot the
installer CD on a PC with two IDE HDDs and two IDE CD/DVD drives. The
booting and installation processes didn't go smoothly, because
/dev/hda wasn't a partition-free drive, meaning that there shouldn't
be anything on it just like what you'd get when you purchase an IDE
HDD. BTW, /dev/hdb wasn't connected to the motherboard when this was
happening.
</p>

<p>
I then proceed to wipe everything on /dev/hda, and then run the
installer CD again. This time, no BSOD and the installation went OK.
</p>

<p>
It works on my ThinkPad R40. But I'd need to download extra drivers to
accelerate the GUI. I chose to install Slackware 12.0 instead.
</p>

<p>
You're right.
</p>


<pre>

<p>
Good thinking.

A "quick and dirty" way is to get yourself a copy of a Knoppix
distribution. Perhaps from Knoppix 5.x onwards, maybe from 3.x onwards
would also do the job. Here, I assume that you use Knoppix 5.0.1 or
5.1.1 CD/DVD distribution.
</p>

<p>
[1] Set up your BIOS to boot a CD/DVD drive first.
</p>

<p>
[2] Boot up the Knoppix live CD/DVD. This will take a while to load X
and get you into KDE, a graphical session under Linux.
</p>

<p>
[3] Once KDE is ready to use, locate the "K" icon in the bottom-left
corner of your screen. This is the menu for KDE, similar to the
"Start" menu under Windows XP.
</p>

<p>
[4] Click on the K menu and locate "System". You need to be patient
with live CD/DVD distributions, depending on your system's hardware
specifications. Once the "System" menu pops up, click on a program
called "QTParted". I think there are two icons for this tool within
the "System" submenu:
</p>

<pre>
1. QTParted (create, reorganize and remove partitions)
2. QTParted (QTParted)
</pre>
You can choose either of these two programs.
</p>

<p>
[5] I assume that you're using IDE HDD(s) and IDE CD/DVD drive(s).
Once QTParted is up, you need to familiarize yourself with the
"Device" tree on the left side of the program window. If you have two
IDE HDDs, then your master hard drive will be /dev/hda (this is also
the case if you have only one IDE HDD), and your slave drive will be
/dev/hdb. Your IDE CD/DVD drive(s) will be /dev/hdc for the master
drive, and /dev/hdd for the slave drive.
</p>

<p>
[6] Familiarize yourself with /dev/hda and/or /dev/hdb, as the case
may be. Note down the drive and/or partition(s) that you want to
delete/wipe/format/reformat. Say you want to keep /dev/hda intact, but
you want to wipe everything on /dev/hdb. Then on the "Device" tree,
click on /dev/hdb. A visual representation of the drive should appear
on the right side of your screen. This is similar to what you would
get if you have ever format/reformat/defragment drives under Windows
XP.
</p>

<p>
[7] Right click on any partition to get yourself familiar with the
options for formatting, resizing or deleting partitions/drives.
</p>

<p>
[8] In your case, I assume that you want to delete all partitions on
/dev/hda. In the "Device" tree, click on /dev/hda. Then right click on
a partition and choose "Delete" to wipe it out. This won't actually
wipe out the partition, yet, but just an indication that you want to
wipe it. Do this for as many times as you have partitions. Once you're
happy that all partitions have been marked for deletion, go to File -&gt;
Commit. Be cautious here; this will actually wipe out all partitions
that you've marked for deletion.
</p>

<p>
[8] Once all partitions on /dev/hda have been wiped out, reboot your
machine. If everything goes well, you should now be able to
install/reinstall MS-Windows XP on /dev/hda.
</p>
