I know this is not strictly "Linux", but I think it's ok...
</p>

<p>
What's the current thinking about Macromedia Flash and accessibility. I've 
done some googling and many accessibility guides I've found are fairly old, 
(&gt; 5years).
</p>

<p>
Reason I'm asking is that an organisation I help out has had someone 
volunteer to do them a new website. The initial new homepage is entirely 
macromedia flash.
</p>

<p>
In general I'm severely prejudiced against flash, but I want to give them 
considered balanced advice that meets their requirements re.
<pre>
  - accessibility
 
  - ability to do future changes/updates to info on the web pages
</pre>
any comments/advice welcome
</p>

<p>
cheers
Jim

Well, it runs on GNU/Linux, so why not? <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<p>
AdobeÂ® Flash, CAPTCHAs and relying on images are generally a major
showstopper for accessibility. During one of our annual GNU/Linux events
here in Vienna we had talks focussing on accessibility. Most of the
talkers (including blind ones) confirmed that.
</p>

<p>
There are tons of best practices and standards from the W3C available:
<a href='http://www.w3.org/WAI/guid-tech.html'>http://www.w3.org/WAI/guid-tech.html</a>
</p>

<p>
Most designers follow WAI standards (which can be quite hard). You could
try some of the tools to test against accessibility compliance
(<a href='http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/complete'>http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/complete</a>), it might give you some
arguments.

<p>
Best,

Plus google still cant read flash (they were developing a tool to be
able to search for content inside a flash file, but i dont think its
running yet) - no google is a really bad thing nowadays.

 [[[Elided content]]] 
Google can certainly read at least some types of Flash. Try
'filetype:swf hello' as a search term, and you'll get lots of hits, with
a tag that says "File Format: Shockwave Flash" right at the top.
