	>Transcoding UTF to ISO8859-1</H3>


<p><strong>From Riza Aziz 
</strong></p> 
<p></strong></p>

<p align="right"><strong>Answered By:  Jimmy O'Regan,
 Ben Okopnik
</strong></p>
<P><STRONG>
Dear Answer Gang,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I am having some problems with reading converted
UTF8-encoded web pages on my Palm PDA. I can't figure out
how to transcode UTF, which the Palm doesn't understand,
into ISO8859-1, which the Palm displays properly.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Some background: I have a script that downloads the latest
news from a few sites. It's an ugly RSS look-a-like for
sites that don't support RSS. I then use "htmlconv", a Perl
script from the txt2pdbdoc package, to convert the
downloaded pages into a text-only format which I can then
upload to the Palm. The script also converts character
entity references (egrave, quot etc.) into ISO8859-1
characters. On the Palm, I use Cspotrun to read the PDB
files.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I downloaded the txt2pdbdoc package a long time ago and it
worked fine with Redhat 6. When I upgraded to Redhat 9,
Perl's UTF handling broke the script because it assumed I
wanted the converted web page in UTF. This poses a problem
because the Palm doesn't understand UTF characters;
accented letters and certain punctuation marks become
strange symbols. By adding
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>	use encoding 'latin1';
	use open ':encoding(iso-8859-1)';
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
everything worked again.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Now, I've come across a website
(<A HREF="http://www.zmag.org/recent_featured__links.cfm"
	>http://www.zmag.org/recent_featured__links.cfm</A>) that uses
UTF directly. Instead of using "egrave" for an accented E,
it uses the UTF character directly. The converter script
doesn't know what to do with the character and I get all
sorts of strange symbols when viewing the file on my Palm.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Is there any way to convert the UTF characters directly
into ISO8859-1? And how do I get rid of any characters that
don't map directly, so strange symbols don't show up on my
Palm? I've messed around with the encoding pragmas but I
can't get anything to work.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks!
</STRONG></P>

Righto. I have a silly perl script that prints out the Polish alphabet
(so I don't have to trawl through the iso-8859-2 man page for the long
names of the odd characters) that looks like this:

<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="../misc/tag/alfabet.pl.txt">alfabet.pl.txt</a></tt></p>

To get iso8859-1 output, I could replace the last two lines with:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>use Encode;
$alfa = encode ("iso-8859-1", $Alfabet);
print "$alfa\n";
print lc "$alfa\n";
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote><CODE>
(or perl alfabet.pl|recode 'utf-8..iso-8859-1')
</CODE></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
To get rid of the extra characters, you'd probably be better off
converting to ASCII rather than ISO-8859-1 -- Perl will print a question
mark instead. (recode will too, if you use the -f option, to force an
irreversable change. Otherwise, it'll stop as soon as it finds a
character that it can't convert).

I did try
substituting all the UTF characters with their common ASCII
equivalents e.g. open &amp; closing quotes with ". I created a
hash as above and used s/// but nothing happened.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
One strange thing: the single closing quote character under
UTF is \x{2019}, which I tried substituting for. However,
running hexdump on the file shows the character is actually
E28099... what gives? What can I do to get a straight ASCII
dump of the file?

The following byte sequences are used to represent a character. The
sequence to be used depends on the Unicode number of the character:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>U-00000000 - U-0000007F:  0xxxxxxx
U-00000080 - U-000007FF:  110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
U-00000800 - U-0000FFFF:  1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
U-00010000 - U-001FFFFF:  11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
U-00200000 - U-03FFFFFF:  111110xx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
U-04000000 - U-7FFFFFFF:  1111110x 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
The xxx bit positions are filled with the bits of the character code
number in binary representation. The rightmost x bit is the
least-significant bit. Only the shortest possible multibyte sequence
which can represent the code number of the character can be used. Note
that in multibyte sequences, the number of leading 1 bits in the first
byte is identical to the number of bytes in the entire sequence.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Examples: The Unicode character U+00A9 = 1010 1001 (copyright sign) is
encoded in UTF-8 as

<blockquote><font color="#000033"><br>    11000010 10101001 = 0xC2 0xA9
</font></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
and character U+2260 = 0010 0010 0110 0000 (not equal to) is encoded as:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><font color="#000033"><br>    11100010 10001001 10100000 = 0xE2 0x89 0xA0

I don't know, to be honest. I'd assume that if you want to do that,
you'd be strongly encouraged to use Unicode. (Umm... actually, these
days, you're encouraged to use XHTML rather than HTML. Since XHTML is
based on XML, it's UTF-8 unless stated otherwise).

Thanks for the link to an excellent website on most things
Unicode. It cleared my misconception that Unicode sequences
correspond to actual byte sequences, when they don't e.g.
\x{2019} is actually E28099, not 2019.

Erm... be careful with your phrasing there. The part that's written to
disk is an encoded version of the Unicode sequence. UTF-7 is a good
example of how it works: IIRC, it's UTF-8 encoded with Base64.

<P><STRONG>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"

I think I have the
problem mostly solved. I added the following pragmas:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>       use encoding 'utf8';
       open( OUTPUT, '&gt;:encoding(iso-8859-1)', "$txt_file"
)
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
So, the script processes everything in Unicode but spits
out the results in ISO-8859-1.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The hard bit for me is the substitution. The following
snippet is supposed to do the substitution, but it doesn't
work:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>    %utf_entity = (
    	"\x{2019}",	'"',
	"\x{201c}",	'"',
	"\x{201d}",	'"',
	);
    s/(\X+);/exists $utf_entity{$1} ? $utf_entity{$1} : $1
/eg;
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
Instead, I get an error for each non-matching Unicode
character:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>	"\x{2019}" does not map to iso-8859-1 at
/home/riza/bin/htmlconv-utf line 302
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
However, using s/\x{2019}/"'"<TT>/eg</TT>, s/\x{201c}/"'"<TT>/eg</TT> and so
on for every non-matching character works. It's a really
clunky way of doing things but the resulting file displays
perfectly on the Palm. How do I match hex sequences for
non-matching Unicode characters in a regex, without wiping
out all other characters?

OK, so you have something like this:
</blockQuote>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="../misc/tag/utf-1.pl.txt">utf-1.pl.txt</a></tt></p>
<blockQuote>
With some functions from the Encode module, you get the right output:
</blockQuote>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="../misc/tag/utf-2.pl.txt">utf-2.pl.txt</a></tt></p>
<blockQuote>
The regex still isn't working though. Let's break it down:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><font color="#000033"><br>s/(\X+);/
</font></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
I'll assume the semi-colon was a typo. I think the pattern should really
be (\X) though; you're using it to match individual characters against a
hash, so you don't want to get more than one character. If you want to
see what you're matching, you could use something like this:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><font color="#000033"><br>s/(\X)(?{print "Matched: $^N\n"})/
</font></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
and shouldn't it be $utf_entity{"$1"} instead of  $utf_entity{$1} ?
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
But do you really need to do that stuff with the hash when you could use
tr instead?
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><font color="#000033"><br>tr [\x{2019}\x{201c}\x{201d}] ["];
</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><pre>Jimmy O'Regan wrote:

I think the problem was with the encoding of the file
handle and a bit with the regex itself. Below are snippets
of my version of the converter script. However, I'm
following the original author's method of slurping up all
the input and putting it into $_, whereas your script loops
through the input. Which method is better?

This is not a good idea. You're reading in &lt;INPUT&gt; as a list (which
takes ~5x the memory for the amount of data), then "join"ing the list -
seems rather wasteful, particularly since you don't need to do any of
the above (entities are not going to be broken across lines.) For future
reference, try this:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>open Fh, "foo" or die "foo: $!\n";

{
	local $/;	# Undef the EOL character
	$in = &lt;Fh&gt;;	# Slurp the content in scalar context
}
close Fh;
</pre></blockquote>
<P><STRONG>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"

</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>close( INPUT );

if ( $txt_file ) {
    open( OUTPUT, '&gt;:encoding(iso-8859-1)', "$txt_file" ) or
	  die "$me: can not open $txt_file for output\n";
    select OUTPUT;
}

### various HTML-stripping bits here

%utf_entity = (
	"\x{2019}",	"'",
	"\x{201c}",	'"',
	"\x{201d}",	'"',
	"\x{2026}",	"...",
        "\x{fffd}",     "",
);
s/(\X)/ exists $utf_entity{$1} ? $utf_entity{$1} : $1 /eg;

print "$_\n";
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
The above regex works. I found that I didn't have to use $_
= encode_utf8($_) to get it running, as long as the
non-matching UTF characters were stripped out before
output. If a character was left in, its Unicode sequence in
plain text was shown in the output file e.g. \x{fffd}.

I think your way (of looping through the file) is actually
better for a large range of file sizes.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I usually "cat" a bunch of HTML files together before
converting them with the script. Using the slurp method, a
cobbled-together file of 1 mb or more pretty much kills the
computer
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=" :) "

OTOH if you loop over the file, that would allow it to

Depends on your meaning of "loop over" - if you load the entire file
into memory and loop over it (as both slurping and the 'for' loop will),
then no. This is one of the things I constantly emphasize to my Perl
students: you can easily bring down your machine by slurping files - do
not do it unless you're very confident that the maximum file size will
be no more than a tiny fraction of the memory.
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre># Wrong ways for arbitrary file sizes, OK for small files:
### Slurp into array
@file = &lt;Foo&gt;;
### Load &lt;Foo&gt; into memory as an array
for $line ( &lt;Foo&gt; ){ do_stuff( $line ); }
### Load Foo into memory as a string
{ local $/; $file = &lt;Foo&gt;; }

# Right ways when in doubt:
### Read the filehandle one line at a time
while ( $line = &lt;Foo&gt; ){ do_stuff( $line ); }
### Read a paragraph at a time, in case there are continuation lines
### (e.g., mail headers)
{ local $/ = "\n\n"; while ( $line = &lt;Foo&gt; ){ do_stuff( $line ); }

Both Jimmy and I mentioned the reasons why slurping can be dangerous,
but there are times when you can't avoid it - although constructs like
this one tend to handle most of the "line-continuation" scenarios:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>while ( $line = &lt;Fh&gt; ){
	while ( test_for_incomplete_line( $line ) ){
		$line .= &lt;Fh&gt;;
	}

	# Process $line further
	...
}
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
In other words, if there's some metric you can use for distinguishing an
incomplete line, then you don't need to slurp. Conversely, if you're
looking at formatted text, you can also avoid slurping by processing a
paragraph at a time:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>$File = "/foo/bar/gribble.qux";
open File or die "$File: $!\n";
{
	local $/ = "\n\n";	# Define EOL
	while ( &lt;File&gt; ){
		process_content();
	}
}
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Asking which method is "better" makes no sense until you consider the
data that you're processing. In your case, since entities don't break
across lines, slurping is unnecessary - so processing it a line at a
time is quite sensible.

That would be my guess. Either that, or he didn't even consider the
issue. Either way, handling the problem in the script would have been
trivial:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre># After processing all the command-line options, loop over files
for ( @ARGV ){
       if ( -s &gt; $MAX_SIZE ){
               warn "File $_ rejected: TOO LARGE!\n";
               next;
       }
       process_files( $_ );
}

Well, what makes them <EM>entities</EM> is that they're atomic - i.e.,
irreducible units. That means that they _can't_ be broken, across lines
or in any other way - otherwise they become, erm. non-entities.

Erm... not quite. Let me veer off-topic a little...
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
In SGML and XML you can define your own entities, which can contain
pretty much anything you want -- a multi-line disclaimer, for instance.
Since the trend in browsers has moved towards generic XML browsers that
render using CSS or XSL stylesheets (but with a fallback mode to handle
the mangled mess that is HTML), defining your own entities is possible,
though not advisable.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
You <EM>can</EM> define binary data as an entity, but anything other than plain
text will at best be ignored, at worst cause an error. If you want to
output a CR, for example, you would have to use XSL-FO (though there is
a way to preserve whitespace from XSL, including CR or CR/LF, you just
can't do it as flexibly as plain text).

(Defining your own tags is OK, though - browsers ignore tags they don't
understand. Most HTML browsers can handle XHTML[1] because of this).

[1] That is, as long as the XHTML namespace isn't prefixed, and some
browsers have trouble with &lt;br/&gt;, &lt;hr/&gt;, etc. (Though they can manage
&lt;br <TT>/&gt;</TT>, etc)

Jimmy, correct me if I'm wrong but - we <EM>were</EM> speaking of HTML
character entities, right? Otherwise, the methane-based entities from
the Dravidian cluster are going to complain about discrimination. If
we're going to bring in every other kind of entity and ignore them,
it'll look like solid grounds for a lawsuit.

To restate my point with a bit more precision, though: HTML character
entities cannot be broken - otherwise, they'll be, well, - broken.

Sorry. Thought the original question was something completely different.

Thanks for all the help in solving this UTF problem and
giving me some insights into the murky world of Unicode, at
the same time cleaning up my atrocious Perl
