&gt; I have read your article discussing swf and possible open-source readers and players.
&gt; My Debian Linux machine (a Mac Quadra running Sarge) is nowhere near adequate to
&gt; your suggestions. Is there a swf to jpeg converter that could run on my system?
&gt; Thanks - Larry in the Ontario deep woods.

<p>
Hi, Larry - I know it's taken a while to answer, but I've been tied up
in a lot of other things, all while trying to find an answer - although
it was for reasons different from yours, but a similar problem.
</p>

<p>
As far as I can tell, the solution for reading SWFs on older, slower
machines is to use a viewer other than Adobe's; e.g., 'swf-player', or
Gnash (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnash/">http://www.gnu.org/software/gnash/</a>), or one of the viewers listed
at osFlash '<a href="http://www.osflash.org/">http://www.osflash.org/</a>'. Have you tried any of those yet? I
found that swf-player is pretty easy on the CPU and disk space both.
Please let us know how it goes.
</p>

<p>
Coming at it from the other end, I'm using Ubuntu on a 64-bit AMD laptop
- and as it happens, I have (well, had) the same problem from the other
end: I couldn't view SWFs because there isn't yet a 64-bit Flash viewer
for Linux. Well, some people - including GNU - are working on one,
but... it's all very alpha and experimental and non-usable (at least by
me.) So, after spending a bunch of time on this, I just dropped the
whole idea of doing it in 64-bit and built a 32-bit chroot enviroment
for those apps which haven't quite made the transition yet. Now, when I
type "firefox32", it fires up the chroot, runs the 32-bit version of
Firefox, and - <em>voila</em> - I've got Flash and all.
</p>

<p>
Now, if I could just find similarly easy fixes for my GL and WiFi, I'd
be all set....
</p>

Thanks for your attention and thought. No happy dance here yet.
</p>

<p>
swf-player installs as a Mozilla plugin (but Mozilla is on long list
of programs that give n identical CORBA ORB error messages, and then 
abort on invocation.) Firefox just barely runs, here.
A swf plugin for Dillo would be good.
</p>

<p>
osflash wants Intel, and gnash requires compilation from source with
programs and libraries not ported to Debian Sarge. Debian Etch is not
available on my architecture (m68k.) All other roads have dead ended.
</p>

<p>
I really think that a flash to jpeg converter is my route.
Has the swf format tech/spec  been released? 
</p>

<p>
Thanks for your advice and help.

Hello,
</p>

<p>
I tested out libming-util. Unfortunately for those who want
conversion to "jpeg" or some other bitmap format, Collinge's drawings
are just that -- vector graphics. So you cannot use libming-util to
extract a jpeg as there is none in there!

Try libflash-swfplayer. This is supposed to work with "any" browser.
For some reason this blanks out some of the text when I use it to

In a sense yes. You can read the spec but you can't use the knowledge

The swf data format is a work of art that may be viewed but not be copied or derived from?
A Norman Rockwell painting and the Rockwell estate?
Gotta be a lawyer, I guess?  I write a perl script that translates swf to jpeg, share it
then expect to be threatened with legal face time. 
SIGH!

It seems that is even more complex than I thought. Apparently
(according to the authors of swfdec and gnash recently interviewed on
LWN) in order to work on a swf renderer you should never have
accepted the EULA for the proprietary viewer. Some have claimed that
it is OK to have accepted the license in the past as long as you have
now transferred the rights you so obtained to someone else (How? By
signing a letter transferring your rights of course!).
</p>

<p>
That <strong>is</strong> wierd.
</p>

<p>
So you <strong>can</strong> write your perl script as long as you have never
downloaded/installed the "free" (as in beer) player distributed by
MacroMedia (and now Adobe).

Good laugh, thanks.

<p>
On m'lady's Mac, Internet Explorer and Netscape Communicator but not 
ICab read swf. If Adobe asserts that an 'intellectual right'
on their encoding scheme. swf, extends to the reproduction rights over
the encoded contents, fine. Their position was different regarding pdf
but that was long ago and a different country. 
</p>

<p>
I have other tasks calling me.

I can read the Linux Gazette on the Mac rather than on my Linux system.

I just tested out gnash from Debian "testing" (=lenny). This works
fine with the HelpDex .swf files.
</p>

<p>
The only problem is that "gnash" is slooow. So, for a while I thought
it had bombed on the graphic. Not so.
</p>

<p>
The "gnash" program just installs on "etch" pulling in "libgnash0"
along with it. The mozilla plugins renders once and then gets stuck.

How about an SVG? Or do they use some weird internal format for their
vector graphics that can't be used for anything other than Flash?
