hi linux gazette
</P>
<P>
first thanks for your great work.
</P>
<P>
id like to connect over a serial cable to a windows 2000  ras server. i
already know that the problem isnt the null modem cable, because i just
could remote control my second computer while using getty and windows's
hyperterminal on the other side. (btw  i first tried gnu/linux's minicom
instead of window's hyperterminal but it seemed to me minicom just works
with a modem a the end of the cable, am i wrong or is there any other
program out there which i should give a try ?) ok ive already read those
Serial-* and PPP* howto but i probably missed something. further, i also set
the same baud rate at the ras server side. so any idea, why i
dont get any reply to my LCP ConfReq Request ??
</P>

I installed Redhat 8.0 on an existing system that has XP pro on it. XP
is on ide0 and the Redhat is on ide1 XP hard drive is fat file system.
When it boots it asks go to Redhat or dos… I don’t have dos. How do I
get back to the windows? What needs to be done to change the boot
loader. I thought I had set it up so Linux only booted with a floppy… I
guess not
Thanks for any help.

Go ahead and choose "DOS".  That will boot into the other partition
which is set up (hopefully) to boot XP.

Hello all,
</P>
<P>
I have exactly the same problem described by Michael Hansen. Modules
doesn't load after recompile Kernel. I'm also a newbie in Linux, but I
see (If you are using red hat at least), it creates a directory
<TT>/lib/modules/2.4.xcustom</TT> (in fact kernel version pass to 2.4.18custom in
my case), but when you do make modules it copies to directory 2.4.x. If
you rename directories the problem comes when you try to install a new
driver that use uname -r command during installation to find modules
directory (uname -r result is 2.4.xcustom). I don't know how solve
this problem.
</P>
<P>
Best regards

<P>
Dear Answer Gang members,
</P>
<P>
I have a linux home network which is connected to the internet through a
gateway. This computer runs linux with a 2.2.18 kernel. I use IP-chains to
block some unwanted incoming traffic.
One of the machines runs mldonkey. This program needs the ports 4161 and 4162.
I get the following error from server i contact:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>ERROR: Your port 4662 is not reachable. You have a LOWID.
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
This port is open. The solution to this problem seems to be to redirect
incoming packets from the internet for port 4662 directly to the machine
where mldonkey runs.
</P>
<P>
The following iptable should do this:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -p tcp -d $4 --dport 4662 -j DNAT --to 192.168.1.100
</pre></blockquote>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>$4 is the gateway
<br>192.168.1.100 runs mldonkey
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
I use a 2.2.18 kernel with ipchains on the gateway. In Howto's and other
documentation i can't find a way to do this with ipchains. Do you know if
it's possible and how?
</P>
<P>
Please your help.
</P>
<P>
greetings Dean Buhrmann.
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Articles about trevails, with details are always welcome when you solve

one or the other interface.

I had an IBM 20G hard drive that had a lot of bogus information in the

formatting with the jumper off. It wouldn't load an OS, and it locked up

but your little DOS assembly program

<BR>Question by Stelian Iancu (stelian.iancu from gmx.net)

<P><STRONG>
Hi!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I was reading the December 2002 issue of LG (btw, great magazine! I've
just re-discovered it, and it's fantastic!) and I saw the PC-MOS thread
originated by Reilly Burke.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I remembered that I saw something like a prototype for a POS software on
the net and I went searching for it. The address is
<A HREF="http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/src/pos"
	>http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/src/pos</A> and the author is no other
than jwz (Jamie Zawinski).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
As fas as I can see, there is only an idea and a "little prototype" (as
the author describes it), but maybe this prototype can be used for
further developement by somebody else.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
HTH!
</STRONG></P>
<P>
If you need a restaurant-specific POS and don't mind going commercial
(for a very small fee as compared to other POSes, actually), I have only
good things to say about the ViewTouch POS 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.viewtouch.com/"
	>http://www.viewtouch.com</A>&gt; in
spite of its closed-source nature. The interface is <EM>very</EM> well
thought-out and beautifully done; the layout, menu, employee, and
ingredient list configuration is a snap. It supports all the popular
touchscreens, industry-standard narrow printers, and all the standard
cash drawers.  Despite the documentation that insists on "RedHat-only"
compatibility, I've run it under <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> from day one (three years or so
ago), and it works fine.
</P>
<P>
My biggest concern with it, of course, is that it <EM>is</EM> closed-source. I
would have liked to tweak some minor features for the client I had who
was interested; as well, I wonder what would happen if the developer
disappeared off into the ether... but that's the nature of that
particular beast. It is, however, an interesting and well-executed
option. Interestingly enough, I spotted a major restaurant near
Baltimore (a Brazilian steakhouse in Columbia, MD) using it about a year
ago. The employees using it didn't have any negative comments, either.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
P.S. Keep up the good work!
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Thanks, Stelian. That's the reality <EM>and</EM> the plan.

<P>
LG is looking for proofreaders.  The main qualifications are a good command of
English grammar, a native or near-native sense of English word usage, and the
ability to recognize and clarify phrases that are too academic, not 
understood outside their own country, or unnecessarily difficult for those
with limited English ability to read.  

<P> Depending on the number of proofreaders, the workload would be at most
one article per month, but more likely one article every 2-3 months.  Of
course, you would be able to refuse articles you don't have time to 
proofread, or if you're not interested in the subject.

<P> If interested, send <A HREF="mailto:gazette@linuxgazette.net">gazette@linuxgazette.net</A>
some samples or URLs of stuff you've written or proofread (any topic, any
length) that demonstrates your wording style.

Have you ever thought of publishing the gazette and require subscriptions? I
would sure like to get a monthly magazine then browsing the gazette online.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
We've had several requests for a print version of LG.  However, the cost of
producing it would be prohibitive.   (Printing, postage, software to track
subscriptions, customer service staff, etc.  And if you want a glossy magazine
rather than just a xerox copy, there's layout costs, more printer's fees, etc.)
Commercial magazines like our <I>Linux Journal</I> can do it because most of
their revenue comes from advertising, but Linux Gazette does not
accept advertising (except sponsorships).

We have repeatedly asked if any readers would be willing to set up their own
print-and-distribute service for LG, but nobody has offered.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
What kind of equipment would be required to print-and-distribute services?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
At minimum, a lazer printer, envelopes, stamps, and a list of subscribers.
That's how small, do-it-yourself zines work.  You'd want some kind of
cover or binding unless you're just going to send a stack of loose sheets.
</P>
<P>
But mailing costs alone will soak you, especially since a single issue of LG
is something like fifty printed pages.  (I've never printed an issue, so that's
an estimate.)  Sending fifty pages via first-class mail within the US is $3-4,
so that's $48/year.  Would you pay $48 for LG?  You may be able to get a better
deal with book rate or presorted rate but you'd have to check with the post
office.  But how will you recoup your cost for toner cartridges, paper, printer
repair/replacement (since it will wear out sooner), envelopes, and the time to
write the addresses or attach labels, not to mention the time dealing with
subscription requests, complaints about "I didn't receive my issue", etc?
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Today many free magazines put ads into the magazine and make money to
publish the magazine. It would be a good idea to maybe advertise, but
I'm not sure if LG has a high number of subscribers. I can see where the
management issue would be a problem (billing, distributing, etc).
Hopefully one day maybe.

LG has a huge number of readers all over the world.  I don't know the number
because people who read via mirrors or off-line are uncountable.  But there
are mirrors in fifty countries, and I figure any country with a mirror must
have a subtantial LG readership.  Either that, or it at least has one LG
fanatic....

You bring up an interesting point.  LG itself is not interested in running
ads, at least not at present.  I like to think of LG as an ad-free zone, a
safe haven from ads.  But since LG content is freely redistributable, there's
nothing prohibiting a print-and-deliver service from inserting ads in their
version.
</P>
<P>
Actually, our author Alan Ward in Andorra said he's seen a Spanish print
version of LG on the newsstands there.  I assume it was the Spanish
translation of <I>Linux Journal</I>, which may include some LG articles.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I've seen few sites publishing their works into magazine (including ads)
and subscribers did not get angry at the ads, because they understood that
to publish costs money and if the work is quality it's worth subscribing
for.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
HAPPY NEW YEAR and good luck.

There <EM>are</EM> a few articles in LG that may not be redistributed in a
commercial print publication (where "commercial" means you're charging any
amount of money for it).  Those articles have a message to that effect at the
bottom of the article.  The ones that come to mind are:
</P>

<ul>
<LI>Some of Shane Collinge's HelpDex cartoons: he sold the print rights to a
certain publisher.  This affects only a limited number of cartoons. <P>

<LI>One or two other articles that have corporate ownership.
</ul>
<P>
In those cases, you will have to contact the author for permission.
