<EM>This article explores Linux's potential role in assistive technology
(AT).  AT allows those living with multiple schlerosis, other handicaps or
the affects of aging to take greater control in maintaining their health and
living independently.
</EM>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P> Some of the most criminal and immoral aspects of the
monopolistic practices of Microsoft, which for all
practical purposes eliminated or curtailed competition,
is the fact that PCs today are
<UL>
<LI> much too expensive.
<LI> insanely unreliable.
<LI> maddeningly complex.
</UL>

<P> These negative attributes of the Windows world
makes the PCs of today useless for the truly needy:
<UL>
<LI> the aging population.
<LI> the physically disabled.
<LI> the learning disabled.
<LI> and the professionals working with all the above.
</UL>
The sum of these people account for more than half 
the population of the world. They are in need of a 
collaborative assistive technology (AT) system which 
operates with telephone-style simplicity. An end-to-end 
AT-based collaborative system connected via the Web
will allow the professionals to provide support group-style
assistance in the form of a simple virtual community.

<P> Now that Linux is available, it is feasible to approach 
this very large market using a low-cost, rugged and simple
client system. Linux-based client systems connected
to Linux servers are perfect for such end-to-end
AT systems offering. The reliable and simple features
of Linux coupled with low cost Linux based hardware
and platforms and applications are the only solution
for these  end users who need AT capabilities.

<H2>The work to be done</H2>

<P> A very significant upgrade of self-supported health 
improvement can be achieved using assistive 
technologies (AT) connected via the Web.
Recent scientific studies by major universities 
in the field of behavioral medicine including 
psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) indicate that getting 
involved with collaborative group activities 
has significant rehabilitation potential. In fact
behavioral medicine can prevent disease, and
improve quality of life and rehabilitate. 
Of course it does not replace the pharmaceuticals, 
but it does improve their effectiveness.

<P> It is suggested that the collaborative virtual community
systems, based on Web-connected AT clients and servers, 
supporting the disabled and the aging can also be used for
the able-bodied eyes-busy, hands-busy professionals to 
improve their productivity. Also learning-disabled children
can make very good use of AT. This low cost set of AT
platforms and associated Web connectivity could be 
very useful in many government and commercial employment 
arenas. This dual-use type approach will significantly lower 
the cost of the needed technologies for all groups.
 
<P> Of course there is still work to be done. Applications for AT technologies 
must be developed or perfected to allow collaboration between the health 
service professionals 
or social worker professionals and the many people in need. 
Web connected AT oriented software components running on Linux client 
machines connected to Linux servers have to be created such as
<UL>
<LI> simple and application specific user interface.
<LI> voice based interaction via computer/telephone.
<LI> always-on and always-available systems.
<LI> a collaborative virtual community systems.
</UL>

<P> Through such systems the professionals can monitor, 
mentor and moderate and even medicate the members 
of the collaborative community. For a good example: 
when dealing with students with learning disabilities, it is 
important to get their attention, to bolster their behavior 
and finally to improve their cognitive productivity.  With 
assistive technology people can prevent further destruction 
of their faculties, improve their quality of life and can even be 
rehabilitated somewhat.  Just the idea of being productive 
adds to a person's self-esteem enormously.  

<H2>A personal example</H2>

<P> I have many years of personal experience using AT and found 
it very helpful in SPMS (secondary progressive multiple sclerosis)
conditions as described below in a brief review of my
personal experiences.  

<P> In addition to my extensive experience with AT I also have
related graduate credentials from both California State 
Univ at Northridge  (the center for AT corporate interactions) 
as well as CSU in Sacramento and UOP in Stockton.   
        
<P> In spite of my handicap, I find it gratifying and fulfilling to 
concentrate my efforts on projects worthwhile to a very deserving community.  
Involvement such as this has proved to have healing powers for me.  I am 
living proof of the powers of PNI based on personal involvement.       

<P>  Having relied on AT in order to survive my wheelchair imprisonment, 
specifically voice recognition for writing, I see dual value: one for the 
hands-busy, eyes-busy professionals increasing their productivity through 
ease of use, and the other, of course, for use by the physically disabled.

<P>  Being disabled with MS, I use IBM ViaVoice on a MAC to write. It allows 
me to verbally communicate by email with my friends as well as giving me the 
opportunity to express myself and get involved with worthwhile projects in 
the AT arena.

<P>  Typically voice recognition systems spell very well but now and then 
some of them do make typos which really take the cake:   
<UL>
<LI> emerge -&gt; eat March
<LI> inevitable -&gt; in edit a bowl
<LI> Nazi -&gt; not see
<LI> multiple schlerosis -&gt; multiple skull roses
<LI> idiosyncracies -&gt; HBO sink receives
<LI> A loud sneeze from my husband nearby inspires the computer to type 
"aha". 
</UL>
     
 
<P>  I receive enduring fulfillment from developing my intellectual strengths 
and putting them to positive use. I learn from my negative experiences which 
have been many in my 54 years of existence and I savor my positive 
experiences  to learn optimism.

<P>  The best way to use these intellectual strengths is to get involved with 
collaborative teamwork and personal communications within the disabled 
community and with companies who provide assistive technologies for this 
community.         

<P>  It is important for me to maintain what little health I have and 
to become involved in something I hold great faith in.  So I have decided to 
become involved in the latest AT systems available to people with 
disabilities.  I am especially interested in technologies that help the 
disabled express themselves, such as voice recognition for writing and 
voice-activated telephone service for talking.

<P>  There are many AT type technologies that focus on, and make good use of 
the physical abilities a disabled person may still have such as voice, lip 
movement, eye motion and brain waves. These capabilities can be used with 
brain-actuated computer systems and voice recognition software, to name a 
few.  Integrating these already-existing technologies into something usable 
by disabled clients so they can express themselves will offer them freedom in 
spite of their handicap.    

<P>  Understanding that there are companies already seeking to address this 
market makes my involvement in the area that much easier and completely 
natural.  Finding companies geared toward brain-actuated computer control 
systems is my next assignment.  

<P>  As a handicapped woman who still has control of her mental faculties and 
voice, I have something to offer by connecting the right people so that I can 
integrate systems through the Internet to develop a mutually beneficial 
virtual community.       

<H2>Conclusion</H2>

<P>  Personal communications and collaborative teamwork need assistive 
technologies to further the self-esteem of the disabled.  Linux, due to its
low cost, open architecture and international development, provides an ideal
platform for building these technologies.  Those living with handicaps
(and their relatives and friends) can make a unique contribution to this
effort because they know firsthand what benefits AT can provide.

<P>  Involvement in AT projects can help disabled people in another way too.
Not only does it provide a distraction from their problems, but it's also a
constructive way to spend their time while furthering a cause they believe in.  

<P>  The positive rehabilitative effects of Behavioral Medicine is my method 
of surviving and thriving until a final cure for MS is developed.
