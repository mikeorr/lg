It's this email thing they have nowadays. You just put the mouse cursor
on the little square that says 'Reply' in your Outlook Express, and go
"clicky-clicky"... <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; And why would a message about UN compensation be sent <strong>to</strong>
&gt; info at un.gov? The United Nations is compensating the United Nations?
</pre>

<p>
Well, they know that you're just going to want to contribute every penny
of that toward world peace, and what better way than to give it to the
UN? They're just streamlining the process, that's all.
</p>

<p>
I do have to say, that's pretty slick on the spammer's part: the
'From:' address is easy to fake, but I didn't know you could fiddle with
the 'To:' and still have it delivered correctly. I wonder what they did
- but without the headers, that's not happening.

[blink] I kinda doubt that.

<p>
The rest of it, though, says that Chris Giles (a Youth Offending Team
manager out of Morden, it seems) did indeed send this - perhaps via
someone having infected his system with a spam server.

<p>
10.130.200.13 is an RFC1918 address - i.e., reserved for private
networks - and it doesn't seem to me like a mail server would have one
of those listed as part of the mail transport chain... but then, as has
been noted elsewhere, over 50% of the world's mail servers are
misconfigured, so who knows.

<p>
Seems like Barracuda (anti-spam hardware system, as I recall) thinks
about it much as I do. Suspicious. But overall, they've done a pretty
slick job on it.

<p>
Oh, right - I just got it. The headers are out of order; the only ones
that are real are the ones <em>above</em> the 'Return-Path: ' header. That's a
private network that's got a heavily-tweaked mail server which sends out
absolutely minimal headers; the only way you're going to get who they
are is at SMTP time, when you can see their actual IP. The rest of it is
just glued on. Clever.
</p>

<p>
I'd have been able to see that if you'd included the actual 'From '
header; I'd lost track of who does what and in what order without it.
