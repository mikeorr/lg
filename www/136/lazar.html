<h1>A Beginner's Guide to Dual Booting Linux Mint and Windows XP</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/lazar.html">Shane Lazar</a></b></p>


<p>This article is a first for me. I wrote it for a friend of mine who is interested
in trying out an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"
target="blank">Operating System (OS)</a> that I have a habit of promoting - you
guessed it, we are talking about Linux. But he is unsure how to go about it and is
not really ready to get rid of Windows - yet. And I understand him: moving to a new
OS can be unnerving and would be easier if it was done in phases. I promised I would
help him, but since he is in another country, I decided that writing an article would
be the best way to go. In this spirit, I am going to show how to go about this by
actually going through the steps of the installation.  </p>

<p>What is <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/" target="_blank">Linux Mint</a>? This
is a rather new <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/linux-distribution"
target="_blank">distribution</a> that is based on the very famous <a
href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> Linux distribution. Linux
Mint is, in my opinion, easier for new users - since most of the bells and whistles,
including support for proprietary hardware, is supposed to work out-of-the-box. And
in its latest incarnation, Linux Mint 2.2 Bianca, things just got a lot better!</p>

<p>First, you will have to <a href= "http://www.linuxmint.com/download.html"
target="_blank">download</a> the install CD image (<tt>LinuxMint-2.2.iso</tt>); it's
about 700MB, so it will take some time. Once you have it, you can verify it by
getting the <a href=
"http://distroplanet.com/downloads/LinuxMint/LinuxMint-2.2.md5sum">checksum</a> file
and following <a href="http://community.ofset.org/wiki/HowTo_Verify_a_MD5_sum"
target= "_blank">these instructions</a>. Then, you will need to burn this image file
to CD. This does <b>not</b> mean just adding the <tt>LinuxMint-2.2.iso</tt> file and
burning a data CD. <a href="http://www.joomlatraining.org.uk/content/view/300/65/"
target= "_blank">Here</a> and <a href="http://iso.snoekonline.com/iso.htm"
target="_blank">here</a> are two websites that explain how to do this in Windows. I
recommend that you burn the CD at the slowest speed possible to avoid errors. Once
you are done, there should be two folders on the CD named <tt>casper</tt> and
<tt>isolinux</tt>, and a file <tt>md5sum.txt</tt>.  If not, something has gone wrong
and the CD will not work.</p>

<p>In all my messing around with installing various distributions, I have never faced
a scenario where I lost all the data on my hard drive - and I have certainly done
enough messing around. However, better safe than sorry - so, I would recommend you
backup all the data on your computer. I am just avoiding any possible lawsuits
here... <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)" /> No, really - do make sure to back
up.</p>

<p>Next, you will need to make some space on your hard drive in which to install
Linux. Mint needs an absolute minimum of 3GB, but I would strongly recommend at least
5GB - with hard drives as huge as they are today, there's no excuse for cramping
yourself (more would be even better.) Make sure to run <em>Disk Defragmenter</em> and
defragment your entire hard disk, so that all your free space is located in one big
chunk and not spread out in little bits. Now, I am not sure how it works in Windows -
it's been a while since I used it - but you probably should <b>not</b> use your
computer while defragmenting (otherwise it starts defragmenting from the beginning
each time there's a write to the hard disk.) Linux avoids this whole problem by not
allowing the hard disk to get fragmented in the first place. Clever, huh? Once you
are done with this, we can move to the fun stuff - installing Linux Mint!</p>

<p>Put your newly-created Linux Mint CD into the CD/DVD drive and reboot; you may
need to set your BIOS to <a href="http://www.hiren.info/pages/bios-boot-cdrom"
target="_blank">boot from CD</a> before the hard disk. On booting from the CD, the
first screen you'll see is the boot options screen below.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/1.png" border="0" alt="boot options"
width="384" height= "288"></p>

<p>Just hit <tt>Enter</tt>, sit back, and watch the pretty boot splash as Linux Mint
starts up. When everything is loaded, you'll be greeted by a very attractive desktop
that can only be appropriately described as <em>mint</em>! Have a look.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/2.png" border="0" alt="desktop screenshot"
width="600" height="450"></p>

<p>Linux Mint is a Live CD. This means that it boots into a functional OS that runs
entirely from the CD. And while in this state you can use it without making any
changes to you hard disk. The disadvantage is that you cannot make permanent changes.
Each time you reboot all changes are lost.  Also, depending on the amount of RAM you
have the Live CD is slower than an OS installed on the hard disk. So you can play
around with it as a Live CD if you are just trying to see what Linux Mint is all
about. But we're not here to play around, we're here to dig into the real stuff! See
the Linux Mint icon on the desktop labeled <tt>Install</tt>? Double click it and
we'll be on our way with the installation.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/3.png" border="0" alt="step one of
installation" width= "600" height="450"></p>

<p>Now, the installation dialog pops up. The first thing I noticed is where it says
'Step 1 of 6' on the bottom left. 6 steps?! Is that how easy installing Linux has
become? You bet it is! If we were <em>not</em> going for a dual boot setup, any sort
of guide would be totally irrelevant. But don't worry - setting up the dual boot isn't
hard either.</p>

<p> Back on track - the first screen is self-explanatory. Choose the language you want
for your final system and click <tt>Forward</tt>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/4.png" border="0" alt="step two of
installation" width= "600" height="450"></p>

<p>The second step is just as easy as the first: simply choose your time zone from the
drop-down list. Optionally, you may click on your region in the world map, and the map will zoom
in allowing you to select your city directly. Then click <tt>Forward</tt> again.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/5.png" border="0" alt="step three of installation" width=
"600" height="450"></p>

<p>Now, it's time choose your keyboard layout. You can test your keys in the field below the lists
(as I have demonstrated). This is so easy... Remind me again, why does this need a guide?</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/6.png" border="0" alt="step four of installation" width=
"600" height="450"></p>

<p>Who are you? No, we don't want a philosophical rant... just enter your full name and the name
you want to use to log in. Enter your password twice, and a name for your machine. The account
created here will be the administrator account with full control of the OS. I will talk about user
accounts at another time. <tt>Forward</tt>...</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/7.png" border="0" alt="step five of installation" width=
"600" height="450"></p>

<p>Guess what: we've reached the 'hard' part - disk partitioning. We don't want to erase the entire
disk, so we choose the second option. We're going to do this manually! <tt>Forward</tt>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/8.png" border="0" alt="partition editor start screen"
width="548" height="443"></p>

<p>This opens the partition editor application. It will scan all your hard disks and display the
present partitions and all their details. If you have more that one physical hard drive, then you
can switch between them using the drop-down menu at the top right. Your master drive is usually
first - i.e., <tt>hda</tt> or <tt>sda</tt>. The slave will be <tt>hdb</tt> or <tt>sdb</tt>. And the
partitions are numbered as <tt>hda1, hda2, hda3</tt> and so on.</p>

<p>If you are attentive, you will notice that my hard disk is divided into three partitions -
<tt>hda1</tt> is my linux-swap partition, <tt>hda2</tt> holds my main installation of Ubuntu Linux
and <tt>hda3</tt> is my test partition which I use to play around with other Linux distributions.
But in this case it is an empty NTFS partition, the <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system" target="_blank">file system</a> which Windows XP uses. I
am not about to delete my Ubuntu partition just so I can show you how to resize an NTFS partition.
So imagine that <tt>hda3</tt> is the partition in which <b>you</b> freed 5GB (or however much) for
Linux at the beginning of this guide. If you are thinking in terms of <tt>C:\, D:\, E:\,</tt> etc.
drives in Windows, there is no direct correlation between that and the Linux <tt>hda1, hda2,
hda3,</tt> etc. naming system. I suggest going by the size of the partitions and the free space
available in each one to know exactly which partition you are going to resize. Right-click on the
partition you wish to resize and select <tt>Resize/Move</tt>. The following dialog will pop up:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/9.png" border="0" alt="resize NTFS partition dialog"
width="420" height="198"></p>

<p>There are a number of ways you can define how you want to resize your partition.
The easiest way is just to type the number of megabytes you wish to have for Linux
Mint in the last input field where it says 'Free Space Following (MiB)'. For 5GB, you
would enter 5000 there. I have less than 5000 in that field, but I am the teacher
here - I am allowed to cheat! Actually, I am not. The partition editor will not make
any changes until you tell it specifically to do so by clicking the <tt>Apply</tt>
button. So for now, click <tt>Resize</tt>.</p> <p align="center"><img
src="misc/lazar/10.png" border="0" alt="after resizing partition" width= "549"
height="442"></p>

<p>As you can now see, the NTFS partition has been reduced and there is now some
unallocated space after it. This is where Mint is going to live.</p>

<p class="editorial">[ Be careful when altering partitions. Make sure you have a backup of all
valuable data and be sure that your computer isn't interrupted when performing the resizing
operation. If you know that the system may hang or is unstable, don't do it or try to use
a fresh or otherwise unused harddisk. -- Ren&eacute; ]
</p>


<p>Next, you need to create a <em>primary</em> or an <em>extended partition</em>.
This depends on how many partitions you already have on your hard disk and what kind
they are. A hard disk can have a maximum of four <em>primary partitions</em>. If your
partitions are named <tt>hda1</tt> through <tt>hda4</tt>, they are <em>primary
partitions</em>. <tt>hda5</tt> and above are <em>extended partitions</em>. So, if you
have one or two <em>primary partitions</em>, you can create <em>primary
partitions</em>; otherwise, you will will have to create <em>extended
partitions</em>.</p>

<p>Every Linux installation needs a swap partition; it is the equivalent of the
Windows paging file. Think of it as an extension of your computer's RAM. The general
rule is that the size of your swap partition should be the amount of RAM on your
machine multiplied by 1.5. However, nowadays with the size of RAM getting very large,
the size of swap doesn't need to be very big. I would consider 512MB as a maximum for
desktops. Linux Mint recommends a minimum of 256MB. Click on the unallocated space
and then click the <tt>New</tt> button at the top left to create a new partition.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/11.png" border="0" alt="create swap partition"
width= "393" height="202"></p>

<p>Simply type the amount of swap space that you want in the 'New Size (MiB)' field.
As an example, I have 256MB RAM and my swap space partition is 384MB. This much has
been more than adequate for my computing needs. <b>I</b> don't need another swap
partition - Ubuntu and Mint can both use the one I already have. The space for the
swap partition is what I took out of the 5GB earlier when I 'cheated'. Then choose if
it is going to be a <em>primary partition</em> or an <em>extended partition</em>,
as appropriate, from the drop-down menu, and select <tt>linux-swap</tt> from the
other drop-down menu. Click <tt>Add</tt>.</p>

<p>Now we will create the partition where we are going to install the actual OS. Click on the
remaining unallocated space and then click on the <tt>New</tt> button at the top left.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/12.png" border="0" alt="create linux partition" width=
"392" height="202"></p>

<p>Make sure this partition fills the entire unallocated space - the 'Free Space Preceding' and the
'Free Space Following' fields should both be 0 (zero). Again select <em>primary</em> or
<em>extended partition</em> appropriately and choose a file system in the lower drop-down
menu. Linux Mint defaults to <tt>ext3</tt> which is tried and tested. I prefer <tt>reiserfs</tt>
which is newer and has some performance advantages over <tt>ext3</tt>. Take your pick. After all,
that is what Linux is all about - <b>freedom and choice!</b> Go ahead... click <tt>Add</tt>.</p>

<p>Have a look at the pending operations in the partitioning application window;
check and see if your partitions are the way you want them to be. There's no turning
back after this. Take a deep breath and click <tt>Apply</tt>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/13.png" border="0" alt="apply partition changes" width=
"416" height="108"></p>

<p>Oops, wait... a warning pops up... click <tt>Apply</tt> again!</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/14.png" border="0" alt="partitioning complete" width=
"355" height="172"></p>

<p>And... success! Click <tt>Close</tt>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/15.png" border="0" alt="aet partition mount points"
width="548" height="441"></p>

<p>Finally, we reach the end of our lengthy step 5 - partition mount points. Verify that the
partition you created for Linux Mint is mounted at <tt>/</tt>, the swap partition as <tt>swap</tt>.
The rest go under the <tt>/media/hd*</tt> mount points according to their partition numbers. I am
not sure if the NTFS partitions are mounted here by default, since I deleted my NTFS partition.
If not, there is a tool to do this later on. Also check that the <tt>/</tt>
and <tt>swap</tt> partitions are marked for reformatting and the rest are <b>not</b>. That's it -
bravo, you are done with partitioning! Click <tt>Forward</tt>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/16.png" border="0" alt="step six of installation" width=
"549" height="442"></p>

<p>Here we are, at the final step! Actually, this is more of a summary of what the
installer will do. The only option here is choosing the location of GRUB, the boot
loader (the first thing you will encounter when you boot your computer.) Don't
change anything here; most likely, it will work just fine as is. Now, bravely click
<tt>Install</tt>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/17.png" border="0"
alt="installing the system" width= "259" height="88"></p>

<p>The installation will take about 20-25 minutes, so you can go do whatever it is
you do when you've got nothing to do. I fixed myself a midnight snack - eggs and
baked beans... No, its not what Linux people eat... It's what lazy people eat. At
least nobody is going to bother me today!</p> <p align="center"><img
src="misc/lazar/18.png" border="0" alt= "installation complete reboot dialog"
width="305" height="170"></p>

<p>And now, we have reached the end of our journey... actually, <em>your</em> journey has just
begun. Just out of curiosity, I actually timed this install. Of course,
this is not the first time for me, but I did do it at a leisurely pace - plus I took some of the screenshots
you see here. From booting with the CD to rebooting took me just under 55 minutes. Not
bad for the so-called 'complicated', 'only-for-geeks' OS. And on top of that, everything worked fine -
from playing mp3 files to websites loaded with Flash. Even this article, including all the image
editing was done on Linux Mint!</p>

<p> If you discover that you need more help with this distro, go over to the <a
href="http://www.linuxmint.com/forum/" target="_blank">Linux Mint forum</a> and the
friendly people there will surely be happy to help.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, go ahead and give that <tt>Restart Now</tt> button a good whack - and enjoy!</p>
