Subject: <b>Help??  Firewalling under 2.0.X</b> <BR> 
From: jwells@nwlink.com (James E. Wells) <BR> 
<P> 
Greetings,
<P> 
   I know this message should normally be sent to one of the linux
newsgroups, however I felt this to be a bit more efficient.   Basically
the problem is that I can't seem to get IP Masquerading going under 2.X.
I have enabled firewalling / masquerading and disabled forwarding /
bridging.  When I look at /proc/net I have two alias files which have to
do with the IP Aliasing, and I have IP Accounting, Forwarding, Input,
and Output, however I have no Masquerading.  I have rebuilt the kernel a
number of times to no avail.  I have toyed with ipfwadm a number of
times and found that it works fine for all forms of firewalling except
for Masquerading.  Any help from you or the readers of this, the best
electronic mag on the net, would be greatly appreciated.

Ps: great job with LG, keep it up ...
<blockquote> <I>  
(Oops, didn't read that one close enough, I guess. I'd say that was a definite
typo, and it would have been nice to have mentioned Linux more directly. This
product does work for Linux--there is an article by Dr. Wampler about it
in the upcoming December issue of Linux Journal. Anyway I've changed it to
take out all Windows references. Sorry about that. --Editor)

From: Phil Lewis lewispj@eeye.com.sg <BR> 
<P> 
Could you please provide the lg in postscript format please so that it
will be possible to easily read it in hard copy format - It will get a
wider readership and reduce unnecessary multiple www downloads each time
within our organization.

Thanks,

Subject: <B>New Set Up of LG </B><BR> 
From: Tushar Teredesai Tushar@Agents.ECE.IIT.Edu <BR> 
<P> 
Hi,
<P> 
I miss the old set up of LG whereby I could download the whole of the LG
which was contained in a single page. Even issue 9 had and alternative
comprising the whole LG in a single page. Hope U provide such a complete
page again. Though there is text version of the entire thing, I would
prefer a html version.
<P> 
Maybe I could do that combining to a single .html and .txt if U tell me
how (i.e. the rules for formatting.) 
<P> 
BTW, great job. Very useful for guys like me who are new entrants to
administration of their own systems after being dependent on others to
do the dirty job.
<P> 
Thanx. <BR>

<P> 
in the current (issue 10) of the <I>Linux Gazette</I> you mentioned that a

Linux version.  thanks for the assist.<BR>

Subject: <B>mailing list </B><BR> 
From: Markus Gutschke gutschk@uni-muenster.de <BR> 
<P> 
Have you considered to set up a mailing list that distributes copies of
<i>Linux Gazette</i>? For me, it is very cumbersome to actively look for new
versions of files and to download them from the net; sending/receiving
e-mail/news is fine though, because this can be automated and I do it
in batch-mode every night.
<P> 
Markus
<blockquote><i>
(Yes, this has been requested before, and is on the list of things to
possibly do in the future. However, setting up and maintaining a mailing
list is not something I have time for in the foreseeable future. Since I 
plan to have a new issue up on the first of each month, you only have to 
look for changes once a month. That shouldn't be too cumbersome.--Editor)

Greetings,
<P> 
In reference to your article on whether or not Linux is a registered
trademark or not...
<P> 
First off allow me to say &quot;This guy is the lowest in the scum chain.&quot;
There is commercialization, and there is gluttony. Seems to me this person
is trying to take over the Linux name to better his pockets. I
wish you had printed his e-mail address, and let him get a feel for
the anger and disgust...
<P> 
At any rate, keep up the good work!

would probably not have been productive. Lawyers are working on this situation, and

this week, something will break. It will be on the "Linux Hot News" button

Hi -
<P> 	Just wanted to let you know that the URL ftp://ftp.ssc.com/pub/lg
pointed to
in, roughly, the middle of the front page actually points to ftp.ssc.com/lg
which will
display the directory structure but things cannot be accessed. Not a
real big deal, but...  Thanks for everything.

(Thanks for letting me know. I've got it fixed now. Don't know why, but
leaving out the /pub happens to me often when I type that address. Think
it must be time to set up an abbreviation for it, so vi can take care of 
it for me. --Editor)

From: paulc@sunsite.unc.edu <BR> 
<P> 
I noticed a few people recently wanting to take versions of the Linux 
Gazette home with them or trying to convert them to run on MS-Win 
systems, well there is a program on the Amiga which fetches pages from 
the web and changes links over in the process to either an absolute or 
relative path - great for the gazette. Well, I'm in the process of 
converting this program to Linux, and would be happy to supply you with 
the compilable source code so that you can then place the file generated 
by this program on one of the pages for download (after gzipping it 
maybe)

Subject: <B> Xwindows depth </B> <BR> 
From: James Amendolagine uq274@freenet.victoria.bc.ca <BR> 
<P> 
Hello,
<P> 
     I have recently been messing with my x-server, and have managed to
get a depth of 16, ie 2^16 colors. This works really nice with netscape,
but some programs (doom, abuse, and other games) wont work with this
many colors. Do you know of a fix? I have tried to get X to support
multiple depths--to no avail. The man-page suggests that some video
cards support multiple depths and some don't. How do I know if mine
does.
<P> 
     I would really like to see an article on this subject, 
<P> 
     Thanks, <BR>

Hi, <BR> 
I am a student of Computer Science at University of Messina and I am the

I have written the form to become a mirror of the Linux Gazette but I

(Massimo, I seem to be having trouble getting mail to you--it keeps coming
back with unrecoverable errors. There is a README.mirrors file on the ftp site,

is very cool, and I will be happy
