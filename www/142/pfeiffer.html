<h1>SMTP Authentication with Postfix</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/pfeiffer.html">Ren&eacute; Pfeiffer</a></b></p>

<p>
Sending and receiving email is still one of the most important aspects
of the Internet. Anyone who has ever worked in first level support knows
this. Sending email is not a trivial task anymore, because a lot of
Internet service providers fight against unsolicited email known as
spam. For end users this means that you have to configure a fixed
mail server that accepts email from you and relays it to other servers.
This usually works fine as long as you aren't mobile. Laptop users with
ever changing IP addresses sometimes need to change their relay
mail server depending on their location. Accepting email from dynamically
assigned addresses is best done by SMTP Authentication. I will show you
how this works.
</p>

<h3>
Prerequisites
</h3>

<h4>
Who is Who
</h4>

<p>
The configuration can be done with almost all GNU/Linux distributions. 
Nevertheless I
will focus on using Debian Etch together with Postfix. We will also use encryption, so
you need to have OpenSSL and a suitable certificate at hand. The article
<a href="http://linuxgazette.net/124/pfeiffer.html">"Migrating a Mail Server
to Postfix/Cyrus/OpenLDAP"</a> in issue 
#124 shows you how to prepare Postfix for encryption. Your Postfix
installation will therefore need Transport Layer Security (TLS) support.
On Debian you can enable TLS by installing the <tt>postfix-tls</tt>
package.
</p>

<p>
We will be speaking of two distinct components when dealing with email.
</p>

<ul>
<li> Mail User Agent (MUA)<br>
     This is the program for reading, writing and sending email. Typical
     MUAs are Mozilla Thunderbird/Icedove, mutt, Sylpheed, Evolution,
     KMail, and Pine. Some MUAs speak Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
     (SMTP), some don't and submit the mail to a local program for
     relaying. MUAs are mail clients.</li>
<li> Mail Transport Agent (MTA)<br>
     This is the software also known as a mail server. MTAs relay mail to
     other mail servers by using SMTP/ESMTP. Any mail destined for local
     users will be dispatched to a local mailbox by means of the Local
     Delivery Agent (LDA). Typical MTAs include Exim, Postfix, Sendmail,
     and qmail.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I will focus on using mutt as a MUA. The confusing advantage of mutt is
that it submits the email to a MTA on the local machine for delivery.
</p>

<h4>
Authentication Software
</h4>

<p>
We need a source for the authentication information. The easiest way is
to use the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework,
which allows us to use a variety of sources through a single
mechanism. The packages <tt>sasl2-bin</tt> and <tt>libsasl2-modules</tt>
are needed for our purposes. <tt>sasl2-bin</tt> contains the utilities
to maintain and query the user database with the passwords and is only needed on
the MTA that should use SMTP Authentication. The
<tt>libsasl2-modules</tt> are needed on both sides. Some MUAs already
provide code for SASL authentication.
</p>

<h3>
Configuration
</h3>

<p>
Now let's try to get everything to work together seamlessly.
</p>

<h4>
Postfix as Inbound Mail Relay
</h4>

<p>
Postfix will use the SASL Authentication daemon <tt>saslauthd</tt> in order to decide
whether the authentication is correct or not. The query is done by using
<tt>saslauthd</tt>'s UNIX socket, usually found in
<tt>/var/run/saslauthd/mux</tt>. This is a problem since Postfix runs in
its own chroot environment, <tt>/var/spool/postfix/</tt>, and can't see
the socket. You now have two options - give up Postfix's chroot or move
<tt>saslauthd</tt>'s socket to another place. Fortunately, the last
option can be done easily by editing <tt>/etc/default/saslauthd</tt>:

<pre>
# This needs to be uncommented before saslauthd will be run
# automatically
START=yes

# You must specify the authentication mechanisms you wish to use.
# This defaults to "pam" for PAM support, but may also include
# "shadow" or "sasldb", like this:
# MECHANISMS="pam shadow"

MECHANISMS="sasldb"
PARAMS="-m /var/spool/postfix/var/run/saslauthd"
</pre>

<p>
We changed the <tt>MECHANISMS</tt> to the SASL database (we don't want
to use system accounts for SMTP AUTH) and we moved the socket into
Postfix' chroot by using the <tt>-m</tt> option. We still have to make
sure that the path to the socket exists.
</p>

<pre>
antigone:~# mkdir -p /var/spool/postfix/var/run/saslauthd
</pre>

<p>
Now we can turn our attention to the Postfix configuration. It needs to
be told that it should use SASL for authentication and what options it
should accept. First, we create a directory and a file with the options:
</p>

<pre>
antigone:~# mkdir /etc/postfix/sasl/
antigone:~# cat &gt; /etc/postfix/sasl/smtpd.conf
pwcheck_method: saslauthd
auxprop_plugin: sasldb
saslauthd_path: /var/run/saslauthd/mux
mech_list: PLAIN LOGIN CRAM-MD5 DIGEST-MD5
^D
antigone:~# 
</pre>

<p>
<tt>smtpd.conf</tt> tells Postfix to ask <tt>saslauthd</tt>'s user
database the path to the socket and the allowed authentication options.
PLAIN and LOGIN are simple cleartext authentication methods. Leave them
out in case your MTA doesn't support encryption. LOGIN is deprecated so
you won't need it anyway; I just included it as example. CRAM-MD5 and
DIGEST-MD5 based on challenge-response or digests respectively. Most
modern MUAs know them, so it's good to allow them in this configuration.
</p>

<p>
The last thing you need to do is to add the authentication directives to the
Postfix main config file <tt>/etc/postfix/main.cf</tt>:

<pre>
smtpd_sasl_auth_enable      = yes
smtpd_sasl_security_options = noanonymous,noplaintext
smtpd_sasl_application_name = smtpd
smtpd_sasl_local_domain     = $mydomain
broken_sasl_auth_clients    = no
</pre>

<p>
The first line enables SASL AUTH. The security options define what to
accept. It is very important to include <em>noanonymous</em> or else the
authentication allows <strong>any</strong> mail relaying, which is not what you and
I want. Be careful to double-check that <em>noanonymous</em> is present!
The application name tells Postfix the name that should be used when
initiating the SASL server. It corresponds to our file
<tt>smtpd.conf</tt>, which contains the options we wish to use. The SASL
local domain defines the realm that should be used as the authentication
realm. Every user has a login, a realm, and a password. Usually the realm
corresponds to the domain your server is part of. The last option deals
with the special needs of some MUAs. Set this option to <em>yes</em> if
a Microsoft Outlook Express Version 4 and Microsoft Exchange server
Version 5.0 use your Postfix as authentication mail relay. Otherwise, it
is safe to use <em>no</em>.
</p>

<p>
We still need to tell Postfix that authenticated clients are ok. You can
configure this with the <tt>smtpd_recipient_restrictions</tt> directive.
</p>

<pre>
smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
    permit_mynetworks,
    reject_unlisted_recipient,
    check_recipient_access hash:/etc/postfix/rcpt_blacklist,
    check_helo_access hash:/etc/postfix/helo,
    reject_non_fqdn_sender,
    reject_unknown_sender_domain,
    permit_sasl_authenticated,
    reject_unauth_destination,
    reject_rbl_client realtimeblacklist.example.net,
    check_policy_service inet:127.0.0.1:60000,
    permit
</pre>

<p>
We added a <tt>permit_sasl_authenticated</tt> right before the blacklist
and greylist check. Make sure you accept the authenticated
connection as soon as possible, but don't skip important checks in case
the MUA gets something wrong. The files <tt>rcpt_blacklist</tt> and
<tt>helo</tt> are custom hash files with blacklisted addresses and faked
name in the HELO/EHLO dialog. You can skip them if you don't have
them yourself. The same is true for the real time blacklist. You don't
have to use one.
</p>

<p>
We're almost done. We only need the account with username and password.
You can add users by using the <tt>saslpasswd2</tt> command.

<pre>
antigone:~# saslpasswd2 -u your.realm username
</pre>

<p>
The tool will prompt twice for the password. Now you are all set. Reload
or restart <tt>saslauthd</tt> and Postfix. Make sure the UNIX socket in
Postfix's chroot environment was created. Check with <tt>telnet</tt> for
the SMTP AUTH banner.
</p>

<pre>
lynx@agamemnon:~ $ telnet antigone.luchs.at 25
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to antigone.luchs.at.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 antigone.luchs.at ESMTP ready
EHLO client.example.net
250-antigone.luchs.at
250-PIPELINING
250-SIZE 10380902
250-ETRN
250-STARTTLS
250-AUTH DIGEST-MD5 CRAM-MD5
250 8BITMIME
QUIT
221 Bye
Connection closed by foreign host.
lynx@agamemnon:~ $ 
</pre>

<p>
If everything works you should see the string <em>250-AUTH DIGEST-MD5
CRAM-MD5</em> after the <em>HELO/EHLO</em> command.
</p>

<h4>
Postfix as Outbound Mail Relay with Authentication
</h4>

<p>
Since I use mutt, the component that deals with SMTP is my local Postfix.
It doesn't know about SMTP AUTH yet, but we only need two additional
options in <tt>main.cf</tt>
</p>

<pre>
smtp_sasl_auth_enable   = yes
smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
</pre>

<p>
The first directive enables SMTP AUTH in Postfix's SMTP client component.
The second dictates which username and password to use when talking to
each server. A sample <tt>sasl_passwd</tt> map looks like this:
</p>

<pre>
smtp.example.net        username:seckrit
192.168.1.1             username2:geheim
</pre>

<p>
Don't forget to create the hash of the map by using <tt>postmap
/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd</tt>. Now point your <tt>relayhost</tt> 
variable to one of the servers listed in <tt>sasl_passwd</tt> and 
reload the Postfix configuration. Mail relay should now be using SMTP
AUTH. If the login fails, check for the presence of the
<tt>libsasl2-modules</tt> package. Without it Postfix will try to use
authentication, but will fail because no suitable authentication methods
can be found.
</p>

<h3>
One Word About Encryption
</h3>

<p>
Although I didn't show how to configure encryption in this example, I
strongly suggest using TLS with every MTA you run. The setup isn't too
hard and having encrypted SMTP AUTH sessions is the best way to protect
the passwords.

<p>
Ren&eacute; was born in the year of Atari's founding and the release of the game Pong.
Since his early youth he started taking things apart to see how they work. He
couldn't even pass construction sites without looking for electrical wires that
might seem interesting. The interest in computing began when his grandfather
bought him a 4-bit microcontroller with 256 byte RAM and a 4096 byte operating
system, forcing him to learn assembler before any other language.
</p>

<p>
After finishing school he went to university in order to study physics. He then
collected experiences with a C64, a C128, two Amigas, DEC's Ultrix, OpenVMS and
finally GNU/Linux on a PC in 1997. He is using Linux since this day and still
likes to take things apart und put them together again. Freedom of tinkering
brought him close to the Free Software movement, where he puts some effort into
the right to understand how things work. He is also involved with civil liberty
groups focusing on digital rights.
</p>

<p>
Since 1999 he is offering his skills as a freelancer. His main activities
include system/network administration, scripting and consulting. In 2001 he
started to give lectures on computer security at the Technikum Wien. Apart from
staring into computer monitors, inspecting hardware and talking to network
equipment he is fond of scuba diving, writing, or photographing with his digital
camera. He would like to have a go at storytelling and roleplaying again as soon
as he finds some more spare time on his backup devices.
