 Hi!

<br><br>
 Did you hear about TV cards in LInux? am I dreaming?
</strong></p>

<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif"width="50" height="28" alt="(!)"

	I've heard about them.  However, I don't have one to
	play with and I haven't even found a decent
	<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/">HOWTO</A> or
	website to explain what's required and what's broken
	(if anything).

	<em>[At press time, the
	<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Hardware-HOWTO-22.html#ss22.5"
	>Hardware Compatability HOWTO section 22.5</a> mentions some
	programs that support several TV tuner cards. It's mostly pointers
	to tgz files, though, not real help with setup. -- Heather]</em>

 What about dual monitors? In WIndows 98 it needs at least a PCI bus, but
 what about 486 users? I found something relative for Linux (<TT>multimon</TT> or
 something like that) but It works with a black and white video card
 (don't remember exactly), anything to work with two monitor in Linux,
 using two ISA video cards?
</strong></p>

<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif"width="50" height="28" alt="(!)"
align="left" border="0">
	As I've explained before, the classic situation with PC and
	multiple monitors used to be that the you couldn't put two
	VGA (actually any combination of two VGA/EGA) cards into the
	same system.  Thus you could put a monochrome video card
	(text only or "Hercules" MGA) into a system to co-exist with
	a VGA or EGA.  Frankly I don't remember where CGA was in this
	mess, though I could look it up if I really cared.  I personally
	never used CGA --- it was just the worst of all worlds.

<br><br>
	The '<TT>multimon</TT>' patches for the Linux kernel are very old --
	and probably haven't been updated to the 2.0.x (much less
	the 2.1.x) kernels.  I've never used them.  I seem to recall
	that it only applied to using a system with one VGA (or
	EGA?) card and one "Hercules" MGA (monochrome graphics adapter)
	or possibly an old MDA (text only monochrome display adapter ---
	the original IBM video card).

<br><br>
	Another approach that used to be possible was to use very
	specialized adapters like the old TIGA (Texas Instruments
	Graphics Array?) or DGA (?) cards.  These were high resolution
	graphics adapters that cost thousands of dollars and weren't
	compatible with VGA or any other "standard" cards or software.

<br><br>
	However I've never heard of Linux (XFree86) drivers for
	TIGA or DGA cards --- and I'm not sure if they are still
	in production.  In fact I don't actually know anything about
	these old beasts --- I just vaguely remember some discussions
	I had with other nerds back in the late 80's where the
	subject came up.

<br><br>
	When I
	<a href="http://linuxgazette.net/issue17/answer.html#vidX"
	>last discussed this in LG</a> (many moons ago) I didn't
	know that some of the modern PCI video cards had the option
	to be used in a "non-VGA" mode.   Thus you can take some
	PCI video cards configure them to co-exist in a system with
	another VGA video card.  I have heard that some of the
	commercial X servers support multiple physical displays
	on some cards.  I don't seem to recall any of them for
	XFree86 --- but a search of their web pages:

<blockquote><code><A HREF="http://www.xfree86.org/">http://www.xfree86.org/</A>
</code></blockquote>

	...would provide a far more definitive answer.

<br><br>
	The last I read none of the XFree86 servers support multi-headed
	operation.  This is from the following entry in their FAQ:

<blockquote><code><A HREF="http://www.xfree86.org/FAQ/index.html#TwoCards"
	>http://www.xfree86.org/FAQ/index.html#TwoCards</A>
</code></blockquote>

	I have yet to see anyone using this feature.  One of these
	days I might try it.  However, not this month.

<br><br>
	The Commercial vendors to check with would be:

<DL>
<DT>		Xi Graphics (formerly X Inside):
		<DD><A HREF="http://www.xig.com/">http://www.xig.com/</A>
</DL>
	... and:

<DL>
<DT>		Metrolink:
		<DD><A HREF="http://www.metrolink.com/"
			>http://www.metrolink.com/</A>
</DL>
	(there may be others but these are the two that I think
	of when I think of the commercial X servers for Linux).

<br><br>
	BTW:  Metrolink didn't appear to have any online FAQ or
	web site search engine.  However Xi's FAQ lists a sample
	configuration for use with two Matrox Millenium cards at
	<A HREF="http://www.xig.com/support/faqs.servers.html#Anchor-a5"

 What is <TT>inetd</TT>? when I am trying to install the ftp rpm, I get the
 message "you need inetd", but in my Red Hat 5.0 CD, in the RPMS
 directory there is nothing similar to that name.
</strong></p>

<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif"width="50" height="28" alt="(!)"

	That sounds wrong to me.  I would expect that message from
	the <TT>ftpd</TT> (the FTP Server package).  The default ftp client
	should be a part of the NetKit package (probably in the
	base RPM).

<br><br>
	'<TT>inetd</TT>' is a IP service dispatcher.  It listens to
	a list of TCP/UDP ports and dynamically launches programs
	as connections are requested for the corresponding "well known
	services"   The mapping of ports to services is done via
	the <TT>/etc/services</TT> file, and the mapping of programs (daemons)
	to services that will be managed by inetd is in <TT>/etc/inetd.conf</TT>.

<br><br>
	In all of the major Linux distributions most of the the
	inetd services are configured to run <TT>tcpd</TT> (TCP Wrappers).
	This utility will check the the IP address of the client that
	is making the connection request against one or two lists
	of rules (<TT>/etc/hosts.allow</TT> and <TT>/etc/hosts.deny</TT>).
	'<TT>tcpd</TT>' also makes some sanity checks, for example to see
	if the client's reverse mapping (a DNS request --- <TT>gethostbyaddr()</TT>
	actually --- matches one of the addresses that's returned by a forward
	mapping (<TT>gethostbyname</TT>).  That's called a "double reverse
	lookup" and is somewhat more difficult for an attacker to
	"spoof" than just a reverse (<TT>in-addr.arpa</TT>) entry.

<br><br>
	Are you trying to use an ftp client or a server (daemon)?
	You might also try <TT>ncftp</TT> (Mike Gleason?) which is a nice
	curses mode (full screen) client.  You can also try <TT>lftp</TT>
	which has some nice scripting features.  In fact <TT>ncftp</TT>
	also has some rather handy features for use in scripts.

<br><br>
	Another option is to use <TT>mc</TT>'s (midnight commander) ftp
	features.  To do that just load the program and type
	<TT>cd ftp://.....</TT>	(the URL form of the ftp site's name).

<br><br>
	Shortly thereafter you should see the files and directories
	from your FTP site appear in one of <TT>mc</TT>'s navigation panels
	--- you can than navigate the other site, tagging, copying,
	and managing the remote files as though there were in a
	local directory tree.

 One thing more, what about download managers? I use Get Right, but there
 is no version for Linux, well there is no Java Runtime Environment for
 Linux. Any other good application for that?
</strong></p>

<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif"width="50" height="28" alt="(!)"
align="left" border="0">
	I presume you mean that you'd like to select a number of
	files in an ftp client and have the system continue to
	try downloading ('<TT>get</TT>'-ting) them until they are all
	successfully retrieved.  Perhaps you'd even like to just tag the files
	and defer the actual download until later (say, late at night
	when there's just less bandwidth in use all over the 'net).

<br><br>
	I think there are many programs that can do this.  I've used
	'<TT>mirror</TT>' (Lee McLoughlin's Perl script) many times --- but that
	is more of a programming utility and it has no interactive
	front end.  The best bet would be to search the Linux Software
	Map (<A HREF="http://www.ssc.com/linux/apps.html"
	>http://www.ssc.com/linux/apps.html</A>) with the words "<TT>ftp</TT>"
	and "<TT>client</TT>"

<br><br>
	I suppose it would be nice to have an FTP client that had
	an option write all your file selections to a file and
	execute the fetch later as an '<TT>at</TT>' job.  Perhaps one of
	our readers will know of one.

<br><br>
	Also there is quite a bit of Java support for Linux.  I don't
	know about the JRE specifically but it appears to be supported
	according to the canonical Linux/Java site
	(<A HREF="http://www.blackdown.org/">http://www.blackdown.org</A>):

	I hope that helps.  Look at the Blackdown.org site for
	more info about Java under Linux.
