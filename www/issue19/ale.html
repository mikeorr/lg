<H2>Atlanta Showcase Report</H2>

<a href="http://www.ale.org/showcase">The Atlanta Linux Showcase</a>
is over, and everyone is beginning to recover.
Recover, that is, from being awake too long, being on a plane too long and
stuffing more Linux than will fit into one weekend.

<p>ALS was put together by the Atlanta Linux Enthusiasts, the local
Linux user's group in Atlanta, Georgia.
The show began on Friday evening, June 6 and ran through Sunday
afternoon.
More than 500 people attended.
The report following this one by Todd Shrider covers much of the show,
including the talks.

<p>I want to thank Amy Ayers and Karen Bushaw for making their photos
available to us with a special thank you to Amy for getting them scanned and
uploaded to the SSC ftp site.

<p>I spent most of my time in the <I>Linux Journal</I> booth giving away
magazines and talking to show attendees.
One aspect that made this show special for me is that I didn't spend
most of my time explaining that Linux is a Unix-like operating system to
the attendees.
Instead, I got to discuss Linux with experienced people with thoughtful
questions, letting them know in the process how <I>LJ</I> could help them.
Each attendee was truly interested in Linux and stopped at each booth in
the show.
I expect attendees appreciated the low signal-to-noise ratio in the
booths; that is, conversations were solely about Linux.

<h3>The Roast</h3>

<p>On Saturday night there was a roast--no, I didn't change from a
vegetarian into a meat eater overnight--we were roasting Linus.
That is, a group of people presented interesting stories about Linus,
intended to only slightly embarrass him.
At the end of the evening, I felt that the roast had been successful in
every way.

<p>In front of a crowd of about 115 people, Eric Raymond, David Miller, Jon
"maddog" Hall and I got to pick on this Linus character.
Topics varied from Linus almost being hit by a car in Boston because he was
so engrossed in talking about a particular aspect of kernel code, to the evolution of
the top-half/bottom-half concept in interrupt handlers and to why Linus was
apparently moving from geekdom to becoming a "hunk"
sportswear model. (See the cover of the San Jose <I>Metro</I>, May 8-14, 1997.)

<p>Maddog finished the roasting by telling a few Helsinki stories and showing
a video that included Tove's parents talking about Linus.
A good time was had by the roasters and the audience and, as Linus'
closing comment was "I love you all," we assume he had a good
time too and wasn't offended by our gentle ribbing.

<h3>The Future</H3>

<P>The show came off very well. I consider this sucess an amazing feat for an
all-volunteer effort.
The ALE members plan to write an article for <I>Linux Gazette</I> about how
they made this happen.
We'll also make this information available on the <a
href="http://www.ssc.com/glue">GLUE web site</a>.
I would like to see more shows put on by user groups.
The local involvement, the enthusiasm of the attendees and the all Linux
flavor of the show made this weekend a great experience.
We are already thinking about a Seattle or Portland show and would like to
help others make regional shows a reality.

<P>I first started writing this article in my hotel room late Sunday evening
(or early Monday morning) planning to get just enough sleep that I would
wake up in time to catch my plane. The plan didn't work--I
missed my 6:00 AM flight out of Atlanta.
I did the second draft while waiting for my new 9:45 AM flight.
The third draft
came (yes, you guessed it) while waiting for my 1:30 PM connection from
Detroit to Dayton, also having missed the previous connection because of
my first flight's late arrival. Suffice it to say, I'm now back home in
Indiana and still enjoying the high received from the Atlanta Linux
Showcase.

<P>Thanks to all the sponsors and to our host, the Atlanta Linux Enthusiasts
user group, the conference started with a bang and went off
without a hitch. The conference was a three day event, starting with
registration Friday and ending Sunday with a kernel hacking session led
by none other than Linus himself. In between there were numerous
conferences found in both a business and technical track, several birds of
a feather (BoF) sessions and a floor show. These events were broken up
with frequent trips to local pubs and very little sleep.

<P>This was my first (but not last) Linux conference, and I found that an
added benefit of ALS was meeting all the people who
use Linux as a viable business platform/tool. (These same people tend to be doing
very cool things with Linux on the side).
From companies such as Red Hat to Caldera to others such as
MessageNet, Cyclades and DCG Computers, it was obvious that many people
have very creative ways to make money with
Linux. This wasn't limited, by any means, to the vendors. Many of the
conference speakers talked of ways to make money with Linux or of their
experiences with Linux in a professional environment.

<P>
All of these efforts seemed to compliment the key-note address, World
Domination 101, where Linus Torvalds, called for applications,
applications, applications. Did I say he thought Linux needed a few
more useful applications? Anyway, he pointed out the more or less obvious
fact that, if Linux is going to be a
success in a world of commercial operating systems, we need every
application type you find in other commercial operating systems. In other
words, if you're thinking about doing--don't think--just
do it.
Another thing that Linus pointed out, and that I was glad to hear echoed
throughout the conference, was that Linux needs to be easy to use. It
needs to be so easy that a secretary or corporate executive
could sit and be as productive as they would be
with Windows 95. We need to make people realize that Linux has gotten rid
of the high learning curve usually associated with Unix.

<P>Something pointed out by Don Rosenberg, while speaking on the "how-to" and
"what's needed next" of commercial Linux, was that we are now in a stage
where the innovators (that's us) and the early adopters (that's us as well
as the people using Linux in the business world today) must continue to
push forward so that we can get a group of early adopters (the old DOS
users) to take us seriously. In Maddog's closing remarks he urged us all
to find two DOS users, convert them to Linux and then tell them to do the
same. As a step in this direction, today I introduced a local computer corporate sales
firm to Linux; whether they take my advice and run is left to be seen, but
believe me, I'm pushing.

<P>The rest of the conference was filled with business and technical talks.
The business talks included things such as Eric Raymond's "The Cathedral
and the Bazaar", talks on OpenLinux by both Jeff Farnsworth and Steve
Webb and "Linux Connectivity for Humans" by none other than Phil Hughes.
Lloyd Brodsky was on hand to talk about Intranet Support of Collaborative
Planning while Lester Hightower brought us the story of PCC and their
efforts to bring Linux to the business world. Mark Bolzern spoke of the
significance of Linux and Bob Young talked of the "process" not
the "product" of Linux.

<P>The technical discussion track started with Richard Henderson's discussion
of the shared libraries and their function across several architectures.
Michael Maher gave a HOWTO of Red Hat's RPM package management system and
Jim Paradis discussed EM86 and what remains to be done,
so that one can run Intel/Linux binaries under Alpha
Linux. David Miller then followed giving a boost of enthusiasm with his
discussion of the tasks involved in porting Linux to SPARC and Miguel de
Icaza took us on a trip to the world of RAID and Linux. We convened the next
day to hear David Mandelstam discuss what is involved with wide-area
networks and Mike Warfields anatomy of a cracker's intrusion.

<P>All in all, the conference was a huge success. What I might suggest as an
improvement for next year is more involvement from the vendors (or maybe
just more vendors), a possible sale from the vendors of their special
Linux wares to the conference attendees and a possible tutorial session
like the ones seen at Uselinux (Anaheim, California, January 1997). Other than
that, a few virtual beers (I owe
you Maddog) and lots of great geek conversation made for one wild weekend.
