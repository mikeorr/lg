<P> That's me, Didier from Belgium (of The Answer Gang fame) and Mick from
Ireland (of News Bytes fame) in Chester, England during my UK trip in July.  We
spent the day in Chester walking on the medieval wall, looking at Roman
columns, and visiting the Roman amphitheater and the Chester Cathedral.  More
pictures from my trip are at 
<A HREF="http://iron.cx/pix/">http://iron.cx/pix/</A> in the 2002 section.

WACKO TOPIC OF THE MONTH

<P> All this talk about England reminded Ben of a pseudo-<EM>Beowulf</EM>
quote his <CODE>fortune</CODE> program doth said once:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Meanehwael, baccat meaddehaele, monstaer lurccen;
Fulle few too many drincce, hie luccen for fyht.
[D]en Hreorfneorht[d]hwr, son of Hrwaerow[p]heororthwl,
AEsccen aewful jeork to steop outsyd.
[P]hud!  Bashe!  Crasch!  Beoom!  [D]e bigge gye
Eallum his bon brak, byt his nose offe;
Wicced Godsylla waeld on his asse.
Monstaer moppe fleor wy[p] eallum men in haelle.
Beowulf in bacceroome fonecall bemaccen waes;
Hearen sond of ruccus saed, "Hwaet [d]e helle?"
Graben sheold strang ond swich-blaed scharp
Sond feorth to fyht [d]e grimlic foe.
"Me," Godsylla saed, "mac [d]e minsemete."
Heoro cwyc geten heold wi[p] faemed half-nelson
Ond flyng him lic frisbe bac to fen.
Beowulf belly up to meaddehaele bar,
Saed, "Ne foe beaten mie faersom cung-fu."
Eorderen cocca-colha yce-coeld, [d]e reol [p]yng.
 -- Not Chaucer, for certain
