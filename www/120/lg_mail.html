Hello, Gang!
</P>
<P>
I appologize in advance because I know this is going
to be a long letter. The thing is, I've had this
problem for more than a year now and I hope that you
can help me solve it. Plus, I just have to tell
somebody about it 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</P>
<P>
The problem showed itself for the first time when I
installed NVIDIA GLX drivers on my box. At the moment,
I had a Riva TNT2 M64, and I wanted to see how far can
I get with those drivers. Although most people hated
NVIDIA drivers, I had no problem with them. Or, at
least I thought so. Quake3 was fine, blender too, but
as the time passed, I noticed that my box wasn't
stable any more. Sometimes it happened that, out of no
obvious reason, X hangs. I can move my mouse pointer,
but computer doesn't respond to anything. Curiously
enough, if I had xmms started, the songs would
continue to play on normally, and everything seemed to
work fine - except the fact that X is hung and I
couldn't switch to console, either. Later, I found one
way to reproduce the bug quickly, rather than to wait
untill it happens (it was simply playing the "Virtual
Machine" screensaver but, as you will shortly see, it
seems that this wasn't of any importance) and I tried
to log in from my laptop via telnet when the hang
occurs. I succeeded, and everything seemed to work on
the box side, I couldn't find ANY reason why X was
hung, nor any indication that it actually happened.
Furthermore, when I killed X (from telnet), box would
have returned to console happily, and I was able to
start X again! As soon as I returned to the original
nv driver, system was steady as rock again. So, buggy
NVIDIA driver/X version/kernel, I figured. But, as the
time passed, I've changed a lot of those and so many
combinations (XFree86, Xorg, kernel 2.4.x, 2.6.x,
almost every NVIDIA driver...) that I finally had to
admit that something was seriously wrong. Many nights
without sleep and I finally found the way to
workaround the problem -- setting "NvAGP" option to
"0". As it shows, using either internal NVIDIA AGP
support, or kernel agpgart hangs the X in a mentioned
manner. I didn't know why, but now everything was
accelerated, and system was stable again, so I forgot
about the incident.
</P>
<P>
Since then, I've "upgraded" Riva to Radeon 9200. For a
long time I was using only ati driver (FireGL drivers
didn't support Xorg, and I didn't want to revert to
XFree out of principle), but a month ago I had
everything ready to actually try FireGL drivers. After
some problems, I finally got it to work, and I was
happy. But, after few hours -- same thing as with
Riva. Hang of death. The old trick of reproducing the
error doesn't work now, but I found another one --
dragging the mouse pointer rapidly while holding left
mouse button (over empty <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> desktop). All other
symptoms were exactly the same as with Riva (music
plays, everything works...) except that now, when I
kill the X from laptop, whole system hangs and nothing
wors anymore (including networking -- telnet session
terminates). So, it's almost certain that this is a
hardware problem, but none of this happens under XP.
So, I try to tweak various fgl parameters
(disabling/enabling user page locking,
internal/external AGPGART, ...), but the problem
persists.
</P>
<P>
Is this a hardware problem (XP works fine, after all)?
Do I have something misconfigured (I tried various AGP
aperture sizes in BIOS, but it doesn't solve the
problem)? Is there any way that I can "disable" usage
of AGP as I did with NVIDIA driver? I don't have
enough money to buy a new motherboard, so please don't
tell me that it is the only solution

And, finally (finally!) techical stuff:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>Box: 	AMD Duron 750
	384MB RAM
	VIA CT-7AIA
	Radeon 9200 64MB DDR

(at the moment:)
	Slackware 10.2
	kernel 2.6.11-9

$ /sbin/lspci | grep -i agp
00:01.0 PCI bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT8363/8365
[KT133/KM133 AGP]
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
I have via-agp module loaded <em>  before  </em> loading agpgart,
because fglrx module doesn't work without it
(fglrxinfo reports usage of Mesa, not ATI drivers, and
3D acceleration doesn't work).
I appreciate your help!

<BR>Jim Harvey (<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net?cc=harveyj@entrenet.com&subject=%20Re%3A%20%5BLG%20120%5D%20help%20wanted%20%232">harveyj from entrenet.com</a>
<BR>Answer by Rick Moen (<em>LG</em> Contributing Editor)

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000066"><EM>
I am trying to get a copy of the Fractal Image and Sequencing Codec
(FIASCO) that was announced  in the Sept 2000 issue of your journal.
</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
You've actually written to the mailing list of the Answer Gang, which is
a group of volunteers who collectively write column in the magazine that
researches and answers people's technical Linux problems.  In that
spirit, let's see what we can turn up.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The item you mention appears to be at
<A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/issue57/lg_bytes57.html#software"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/issue57/lg_bytes57.html#software</A> .  (I mention
that because it'll help the other volunteers if they wish to lend a
hand.  It's always a good idea to make it easy for others to assist you,
if you're hoping for help.  Thus, URLs in this case are useful.)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The kit's maintainer, Dr. Ullrich Hafner, also had a January 2001
<em> Linux Journal  </em> article on the subject:
<A HREF="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4367"
	>http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4367</A>
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000066"><EM>
All of the links returned by various search engines appear broke.
</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Some amount of googling later, I found that the FIASCO toolkit appears
to have become unmaintained <em>  and  </em> is not found mirrored downstream in
any of the usual places.  That's unfortunately all too common among open
source inventions that were precariously hosted only in one single
location and never quite caught on.  Ours is a rather carelessly
Darwinian software ecology.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Depending on what you're looking for, you might find equivalents of
particular tools (cjpeg, djpeg, etc.) in the libjpeg source (currently
jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz) published by the Independent JPEG Group at
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg"
	>ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg</A>
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
NNetpbm (<A HREF="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net"
	>http://netpbm.sourceforge.net</A>) does include pnmtofiasco, which
compresses the named pbm, pgm, or ppm image files, or Standard Input if
no file is named, and produces a FIASCO file on Standard Output.  "
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Anyhow, back to Hafner's reference implementation of the FIASCO CODEC --
Internet Archive to the rescue:
<A HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/20000829071003/ulli.linuxave.net/fiasco"
	>http://web.archive.org/web/20000829071003/ulli.linuxave.net/fiasco</A> (the
last mirrored version of Hafner's page) has mostly broken links -- but
the source code RPM package, fiasco-1.1-1.src.rpm, is still retrievable.
I have done so, pulled apart the RPM, and extracted its tarball for the
benefit of you and posterity.  You'll now find it  at:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
<A HREF="http://linuxmafia.com/pub/linux/utilities-general/fiasco-1.1.tar.gz"
	>http://linuxmafia.com/pub/linux/utilities-general/fiasco-1.1.tar.gz</A>
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
There is also a copy of the RPM SPEC file for that source tarball.
I hope that helps!

Hi Rick:

Thanks for all the help. I fully understood that your groups mandate was to
answer Linux technical problems. However, from past experience volunteer
groups are by definition enthusiastic, challenge-oriented people. You have
just confirmed this observation.

Thanks again.

<P>
Dear Supporter of Noepatents.eu.org,
</P>
<P>
Let me thank you for your participation in our web demonstration in the
spring.  As you know, our efforts ultimately led to the rejection of the
proposed software patent directive by the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
We now have the next opportunity to demonstrate the unpopularity of
software patents, and to draw attention to our cause.  For the most
prestigious awards in EU politics, the "EV50 Europeans of the Year
Awards" by the European Voice (an EU-focused weekly newspaper), the jury
has nominated two software patent critics, Michel Rocard MEP and
NoSoftwarePatents.com founder Florian Mueller.
</P>
<P>
With the power of the Internet, we would like to ensure that our
candidates win, and nominees who are in favor of software patents (such
as EU commissioner McCreevy) lose.  Please participate in the public
Internet poll, and you can find voting recommendations and further
instructions here: <A HREF="http://www.nosoftwarepatents.com/en/m/ev50/vote.html"

Hi There,
Recently a Linux guy (Now moved away) setup a Linux Redhat Firewall server
connected to a Cable Modem for our Windows PC's to share Internet etc.
</P>
<P>
Now the Browsing is ok and Email is ok, but we are having problems with
FTP.
</P>
<P>
We can connect ok to the IP Address and the username/password verifies ok,
but then we get a message saying eg:-
</P>

<blockquote><pre>500 I won't open a connection to 192.168.0.13 &lt;http://192.168.0.13&gt; (only to

192.168.0.13&lt;<A HREF="http://192.168.0.13&gt"
	>http://192.168.0.13&gt</A>;.
</P>
<P>
Now i tried passive mode using the same ftp port 21 and same problem.
The linux guy said we have to mod the IP Tables somewhere, but he is
not exactly sure where to do it to allow us to FTP from local windows pc's.?
I have included the full error message ftp log below. I found the IPTables
File on the Linux box, but have no idea what to do there. Any help would
be greatly appreciated.  (Full FTP Log Error).

article has been published, and will not be changed.
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
Can I have your permission to forward your mail for publication next month?
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Only if I have permission to publish your e-mail aswell.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Of course.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
1) multiple people working on the installer/updater
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Yes, it is true that WinLibre had more than just one people working
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
on that. But! If you look at the project listings from other mentoring
organizations, you can see that the same thing is present in the
following mentoring organizations too: Python, Nmap, Internet 2, Drupal
and possibly more... Why does it bothers you only at the winlibre project?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
The impression I got is that these were separate implementations of the
same thing. With the other projects you mentioned, it was clear that
these students were working on different aspects of the same project.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Well, it's partially true for the both cases. As for WinLibre, we had 2
students working on separate implementations of the same thing, while the
others were working on different aspects. As for the others, I know (source
SoC students themselves) that in some cases 2 or more students were working
on separate implementations of the same thing aswell. The reason why it is
ok, is that the mentoring organizations had no way to know if a student will
finish his/her project or not. The number of finished projects is less than
90%, and even this percentage is way above the expectations (66.67%) on the
beginning of SoC. So it was fairly reasonable for some mentoring
organizations to have 2 students working on the different implementations of
the same thing in case the thing was high priority for the mentoring
organization.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
If this installer is really a single installer with several people
working on different aspects, as with the other projects, then please
accept my unreserved apologies, and my promise that a correction will be
published next month.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
To compleatly clear it out, here is the correct list of the WinLibre
projects:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
Finished projects:
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
- installer (2 students)
- updater (1 student)
- control centre (1 student)
- MacLibre (1 student)
- 3 -original- games (3 students, 1 per game)
- Final Touch <TT>/or</TT> Image Manipulation Tool/ (1 student)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Failed projects:
- CDRoast GUI (1 student)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
2) Michael Rybak's "Sneaky Snakes"
Your text about this project is a complete missinformation. First:
please take a look at it before you call it a "snake clone", because it
has a totally unique concept, and it is not even similar to the snake
game in any aspect. Also, you've used the words: "One project that has
been singled out as a waste of funding". Ok, yes it was singled out, but
by -one- single person, Uros Trebec, while all the other people on that
thread in summer-discuss (which is undoubtable your source) supported
the project. Also you should check out Uros's previous posts on
summer-discuss, and you will find out that your only source is a person
that was planning to cheat in SoC, but got rejected.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I will admit that that message was <EM>a</EM> source for that opinion, I will
also admit the possibility that it was the source for the other places I
saw that opinion voiced, but it was <EM>not</EM> the only source of that or
similar opinions.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Can you -please- point out the other sources?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Hmm. Can't find anything at the moment, and I'm starting to suspect that
there was only one other source, and it was in comments on <A HREF="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</A>.
</P>
<P>
I'll get back to you if I find anything.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Have you actually downloaded it?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
No.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Snake clone:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
- you have one (or in some cases 2 or more) snake that collects pieces
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
on the playground and gets larger for each collected piece, if the snake
touches itself (or the other snakes), the player loses.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Sneaky Snakes:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
- 2 snakes are fighting each other by shooting their parts, they don't
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
collects pieces and if the snakes touches themselves or the other snake they
don't lose.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
That said, thank you for correcting me about the game: to my eyes, it
looked like a snake clone -- a more modern snake clone, but a snake
clone none the less.
</P>
<P>
Also, because it seems to have been unclear, I did not share that
opinion. I thought that my contrasting the game with the installers made
that clear, I'm sorry if it didn't.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
It wasn't clear.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I would also like to inform you that every single SoC student I've
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
talked with finds your article very disappointing partially because of
the lack of objectivity and because some of the projects were left out
from the lists.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
As for objectivity, well, the magazine is called <EM>Linux</EM> Gazette. I
can't and won't apologise for giving a better write up to the projects I
personally had interest in: the article simply would not have been
written otherwise.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Hmm... Especially because it's -Linux- Gazette... You want Linux to be
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
more popular, or not? Do you want to see the Average Joe using Linux or not?
Well, if you do, here is an interesting fact: The Average Joe uses Windows.
If you want to attract him to opensource, you must show him that it's good.
How can you show him that? You give him opensource for Windows as step one,
as a step two, he'll be more openminded about Linux...
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I was coming from the PoV that if you show people the cool things they
can do with Linux that they <EM>can't</EM> do with Windows, they'll be more
likely to switch. The truth, I suspect, is somewhere between these views.
</P>
<P>
Projects were only omitted simply because I could find no information
about them. Please feel free to tell people to pass on information I
missed, either to me personally, or to <A HREF="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net"
	>tag@lists.linuxgazette.net</A> (from

Lev Olkhovich:
Codehaus also has 12 applicants with only two projects. It is
especially strange because the link in the article points to a page
with times more projects.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I tried to provide a link to the proposed projects for each mentoring

projects listed were the only ones I could find information about.

<P><STRONG>
Pradeep Padala:
I actually didn't look at the article closely. It was forward to me by
a friend. Looking closely, it shows SoC in a bad light, I agree.
</STRONG></P>

Kai Blin:
Also, I think the author didn't really do his homework. I can only talk
about the wine projects, but he missed a couple of details there.

<P>
I realise that Kai's project has been added to CVS since I submitted the
article, but beyond that I don't see what details I missed.

However, I must say, not everything he said is not wrong either.

Wed, 05 Oct 2005 09:28:36 +0100
</p>

<P><STRONG>
Hello,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I've forwarded your replies to the Google Summer of Code internal
mailinglist, so I guess people will contact you with their projects if they
want to. The attitude of most of them about the article is pretty negative
tough, so don't expect miracle.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Well, I guess that must have something to do with the way in which it
was presented, because the other mail I've received has been positive.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I'm not representing WinLibre in this issue, I'm writing only my
toughts, but I think it would be fair from your side if you'd publicly
apologize both to WinLibre and Google because of the unneeded negative
criticism presented in your article, especially because you stated that the
actual reason of this attack was the fact that the WinLibre is providing OSS
for the Windows platform. (note: we do it for MacOS too now, and the 3 games
are cross platform)
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Erm... no, I don't see how you've come to that conclusion. That WinLibre
is (was) a Windows-specific project is the reason I didn't take a very
close look at the projects: hence, why I termed 'Sneaky Snakes' a snake
clone. I admit that was inaccurate; I should also admit that I have very
little interest in games in general: it's most likely that I would have
come to the same conclusion no matter how hard I looked at it, simply
for lack of a better comparison.
</P>
<P>
The criticism was aimed at the duplication of effort in the installers.
That I called it a "waste of effort" was an error in tact -- I had
intended on changing that sentence to read "unnecessary duplication of
effort", but it slipped my mind. Even that, though less so, is still
going to be offensive to some.
</P>
<P>
I apologise wholly and unreservedly for the unnecessarily offensive
wording of that phrase; however, I will not apologise for having and
expressing a negative opinion of the duplication of effort.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
As a personal note: I don't understand why is it needed to have a
negative attitude about Google Summer of Code in any aspect, when Google
invested 2.000.000 USD in opensource. The entire OSS community should be
thankfull for this, no matter if there were glitches or not. The only thing
you can achieve by this attitude is to stop Google and potentially other
companies to make programs like SoC in future. Is really that what you want?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I think you're overreacting here. I made two critical comments of my own
in that article (the other was towards criticism made by an Ubuntu
representative), the rest was merely a reflection of the criticisms made
elsewhere: it would have been a bold-faced lie to say that everyone was
entirely happy about how SoC went.
</P>
<P>
As for Google discontinuing SoC because of some criticism? You must
realise how far-fetched that idea is. If Google was that thin-skinned as
a company, they wouldn't have survived long enough to have the first.
</P>

Take care,

Hi Jimmy,

<P><STRONG>
Just read your Linux Gazette article on the Summer of Code, and I'd like
to submit a correction if at all possible. I was one of the students who
worked for Google, and you've got my project listed as Charun, which
isn't quite right. Charun was sort of a stunted proof-of-concept that I
put together for my qualifying exams, and while it's certainly the
intellectual ancestor of Query by Example (my actual project), QBE is
(1) far more robust, and (2) actually integrated into PostgreSQL (as in,
it modifies the SQL language itself, rather than being an after-the-fact
add-on).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
You can find QBE at <A HREF="http://pgfoundry.org/projects/qbe"
	>http://pgfoundry.org/projects/qbe</A>, with source code
and (sparse) documentation. If it's possible to correct the link in the
article, I'd really appreciate it.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I'll pass this on to my editor, who gets final say on what does and does
not get corrected.
</P>
<P>
Can I also have your permission to pass this on to our mailbag for
publication next month? (Some of our mirrors are slow to update, and the
correction will go unnoticed by anyone who has already read the article).
</P>

Absolutely. Thanks very much!

<P>
We (LG's editors) are thinking about deleting or changing the Site Map page,
and would like to get readers' input on it.  The
<a href="http://linuxgazette.net/lg_index.hmtl">Site Map</a> is basically
a concatenation of the monthly TOCs, a kind of poor man's search engine.
It was really useful when it was made, but now has become so huge (309 KB)
that it's inconvenient to use, and will only get bigger.  Also, our search
engine at the time alternated between being broken, anemic, and
nonexistent.  Now we have a Google-powered search, and
<a href="http://linuxgazette.net/authors/">author pages</a> linking to all
articles by each author.  So the only other use for the Site Map seems to
be offline searching, for people who don't have immediate access to the
Internet.  Are people using the Site Map page?  Does it have any other
uses we've missed?

As for the Site Map, if we need to keep it (and I'd rather keep it as-is

<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
I'm curious - not for or against, but simply curious - about the reason
that you don't like the idea of a dynamic page. For me, it has the
benefit of de-bloating the tarball. Am I missing some way in which it
would be a detriment?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Mike] 
Whenever I use the site map, I use the version that came on Linux
Format's DVD, rather than run up my phone bill... I'm sure we have a
quite few off-line readers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Thomas] 
It wouldn't be a detriment --- if the reason you're doing this is to
reduce the size of the tarball, then that's fine.  I welcome it, as
there's probably still a lot of people on dial-up trying to get each
issue.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Thinking about it some more, I missed the reason (if there even was
one) why the current <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> maintainer doesn't ship the sitemap for
each LG deb  (this to me was always a grave mistake on his part --
plenty of other debs have much larger amounts of crap in them).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Heather] 
Probably the same philosophy that had him leaving out TWDT.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Thomas] 
If we came up with a script that would do this for us (perl, awk,
whatever -- a language that was certainly common on almost all Linux
installations) then it would be a trivial matter to have it called as
part of the post-install scripts.  A similar process applies for RPMs.
Distributing it as part of lg-base.tgz (as I had mentioned in the past)
for those that download the raw tarballs from our FTP site would mean
they too get the benefit.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
That's how I see things.  It's a good balance, because:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
*  You don't need any quantitative measures as to whether a certain
amount of people want to keep or remove the TOC.
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
*  It reduces the size of the tarball considerably.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
*  It means that it can be generated as and when, for those that want
it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Just my thoughts.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Heather] 
... a "limited fare" meta-TOC [only covering issues you have
present] would not serve a purpose of spotting a specific past issue to
glom.  Though the KB does mention the right issue in the hotlink, since
our hotlinks mention issue numbers.

Are we going to publish the

AFAIC, it's a dead letter already. There was never an overwhelming
