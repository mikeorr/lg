[[[  I've clipped out the offending message and tossed it into the /misc
directory as <a href="../156/misc/lg/undeliverable">http://linuxgazette.net/156/misc/lg/undeliverable</a> if you
actually are curious about what "these things" look like. -- Kat  ]]]
</p>

</p>

<p>
Subscribers might (or might not) be curious about what I do with these
things.  Basically, Faber had it about right:  I do indeed decide where
to aim the Blacklist of Doom and fire freely.
</p>

<p>
In this case, IP address 207.65.4.4 (rex2.isdn.net), running proprietary
MTA Communigate Pro, confessed that it had received (forged) mail from
IP address 71.75.8.158, which at the time was falsely claiming to be
"lists.linuxgazette.net" and conveying mail from
tag@lists.linuxgazette.net to downstream recipient chet@multipro.com.
</p>

<p>
And that incompetently run MTA, on rex2.isdn.net, <em>believed</em> that
particular barefaced lie -- and thus decided to send "back" to the forged,
falsified sender address, tag@lists.linuxgazette.net, the scintillating
intelligence that the illustrious Mr. Chet is over quota and sadly
cannot accept "our" mail.
</p>

<p>
This is incompetent mail administration in part because rex2.isdn.net
has no excuse for believing that lie:  Merely conducting the most basic
of checks of our SPF record would have revealed that 71.75.8.158 is
<em>not</em> an authorised MX for lists.linuxgazette.net.  Also, rex2 is
ethically obliged to be particularly careful about what mail it accepts
for redelivery to (e.g.) downstream hosts like multipro.com's MXes (mail
exchangers), specifically because of the risk of "backscatter spam" of
this sort.
</p>

<p>
In short, I've blackholed rex2.isdn.net completely on
lists.linuxgazette.net (for all SMTP purposes), which is indeed
hard-assed but ensures that it will not backscatter-spam us again.  If
there are any legitimate users on that mail host, they lose.
</p>

<p>
(As a reminder, TAG is particularly vulnerable to spam, because its
posting model has to date prevented it from being set so that all mail
from non-subscribed addresses is held for listadmin vetting.  All 
other mailing lists I run duck that bullet, and are for all practical 
purposes spam-free.)

<p>
Hello friends,
</p>

<p>
I have a remote suse server where I have a shell script and in that I have the 
configuration of iptables firewall. so, after executing the script I get my 
firewall ready. I could also write a deamon there which can execute the 
script after booting the linux.
</p>

<p>
I wounder if there is anything in debian to do that. When checking iptables I 
have found the following
</p>


<pre>
iptables
iptables-apply
iptables-multi
iptables-restore
iptables-save
iptables-xm
</pre>

<p>
shall I just write a deamon which will then call the configuration file ? 
or there is already something in debian which I have missed ?
Kindly suggest.
Thanks
</p>

Dear list,
</p>

<p>
I generally worked with Linux terminal. Frequently I have to do "rm" to delete 
files/folders which are not required any more. And this actually raised a 
oquestion in mind. what to do if some point of time I need a file/foldr which 
has been already deleted before few min. ago. I have googled a lot but have 
not found any open source tools which can recover the deleted ones. testdisk 
is there but it is totally different. there are some commercial GUI based 
tools available but I am looking for a CLI tool or technique which 
<strong>practically</strong> recover the deleted file/folder.
</p>

<p>
Hope some one can enlighten me.
Thanks

Once I tried Mandrake linux at my friend's PC. I have never seen that type of 
console in any other distro ( though I worked with redhat, debian, suse and 
puppy). The fonts are not so big which I see in debian or RH; they are neat 
and clean. more over at the bottom of the console there was a logo of 
mandrake !! Could any one suggest or give me any clue so that I can modify my 
present console to that fancy one ?

Hello.

<p>
I need some help and I'm hoping you can do it. Ok,here goes.
I traded a guy at work for an Apple laptop with Linux installed. He got
it from a guy who didn't have the Root password. How nice! I've tried to
</p>

<p>
+ reinstall Opensuse 10.2 to gain controll of the laptop,and it won't
autorun. I made sure the discs were in ISO form. When the disc is in the
cdrom
</p>

<p>
+ it shows how big the disc is but it doesn't show how much space is
available. The memory shows that there's' 2.34mb avaliable. I'm very new at
this
</p>

<p>
+ Linux and don't really understand it yet. So, do you think you'ins' can
help me?
</p>

<p>
ON Opensuse site it said if it didn't start auto to open Bios setup and
go from ther. I'm not sure how to do that ,or where to type in Bios.
Any help would be greatly welcomed and appreaciated!

Dear all,
</p>

<p>
I am a debian user but once I got a chance to test Mandrake 
Linux and there I saw first time the magic of Linux console. First of all; the 
Mandrake console was neat and clean with high resolution support and 
Colourful text. More over a transparent Logo was there at the buttom of the 
screen. It was really nice looking and at the same time disclousing the fact 
what power is inbuilt inside Linux console!!
</p>

<p>
I compiled the kernel ( in my debian box ) with Fb and vesa support. Then I 
add the vga=791 at the kernel configuration line at grub.cfg and now I get 
high resolution screen with linux logo support at booting. But There are so 
many things still unresolved and I'll be grateful to the list if some one 
atlest show me the right direction
</p>

<p>
1&gt; How can I test what max. resolution my monitor can suport with a command ?
</p>

<p>
2&gt; High resolution can be opted by SVGA, VGA or fbdevice. What are the 
difference between these and how can I know which one is best for my Display 
card ?
</p>

<p>
3&gt; How to get colorful text; like the text in knoppix during booting ?
</p>

<p>
4&gt; and finally how can I get the tranparent logo at  the butom of my console ?
</p>

<p>
A no. of question <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)"> may be these are already there in some document in the 
system itself. But currently I have no clue and it would be great if Someone 
atleast show me the direction following which I can be able to resolved all 
these myself.

<p>

How do I run/install downloaded programs using linux?

<p>
Wind0ws usually opts for an auto run or save. It seems linux wants to
save. So once I have it saved (which I do) how do I actually run or
install that downloaded program?

Hi, J.Bakshi.  This note is to advise you that your choice of ISP is
causing your mail to be interpreted upon receipt as suspect, when
automatically parsed by spam-detection software.  My SMTP software
keeps kicking your mail addressed to this mailing list into an
administrative queue, to verify that it's not spam.  Even though
I've whitelisted _you personally_, your ISP's IP address keeps failing
several tests used within Spamassassin.  Those are:
</p>


<p>
RCVD_IN_SORBS:  This is fairly serious.  Your ISP's SMTP server IP
address (63.223.93.2) is in the SORBS (Spam and Open-Relay Blocking
System) antispam blocklist, which means it's been extensively used for
spamming activity (not by you).
</p>

<p>
RCVD_IN_SORBS_WEB:  This is also fairly serious.  That same IP is also
in a separate SORBS blocklist of sites that are known to have
exploitable vulnerability (e.g., FormMail scripts) that are widely
abused by spammers to send mass-mail spam.
</p>

<p>
FORGED_RCVD_HELO:  This refers to the fact that your ISP sends out a
mistaken/malformed greeting string during its SMTP delivery attempts.
In this case, IP address 63.223.93.2 (firewall.wahju.com) is sending a
greeting string claiming it's "icsmail.net".  Doing so violates mailing
list technical standards and makes your ISP's SMTP host look like a
spammer haven.
</p>

<p>
RCVD_IN_XBL:  This is <em>really</em> serious.  This means your ISP's SMTP
server IP address is also in the Spamhaus XBL blocklist, described as
"wholly incorporat[ing] data from two highly-trusted DNSBL sources, with
tweaks by Spamhaus to maximise the data efficiency and lower False
Positives. The main components are the CBL (Composite Block List) from
cbl.abuseat.org, and the NJABL Open Proxy IPs list from www.njabl.org".
Essentially, this means your ISP's mail server has been verified to be
repeatedly used by spammers to a high degree of certainty.
</p>


<p>
I cannot really advise you, except to say that, unless/until some of the
above facts about your ISP -- not your fault and not under your personal
control -- change radically, you are likely to have significant problems
with software classifying your mail as probable spam.  Some users in
similar situations have found it best to change providers.
