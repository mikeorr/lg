<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Summary of Vector Drawing
Tools for Linux</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="http://epb.lbl.gov/xfig/">XFig
</a><font size=-1>-
<a href="xfig.html">screen
shots</a></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Requirements:&nbsp; just
a regular X Window System installation, plus the Xaw3D library if you want
the 3D buttons and so forth.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Probably the grandfather
of vector tools on Linux, xfig is a fairly feature rich package that requires
no extra packages to get running on a stock Linux distribution - basically
it should build and run pretty quick on any Red Hat, SuSE, Debian, Pacific
High Tech system.&nbsp; Any distribution with a standard X Windows System
installation (and that should be all of them) should work.&nbsp; You can
build xfig using the Xaw3D libraries, which will give the UI a much nicer
3D effect, but thats not required.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The main window opens pretty
large and resizing doesn't automatically realign the buttons along the
left side of the window.&nbsp; You can specify the use of smaller icons
during the build process.&nbsp; This may help if you use a smaller display
resolution like 800x600.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The HTML based help system
tries to launch Netscape but doesn't check for an existing Netscape process
first.&nbsp; It also doesn't open the browser to the pages of interest.&nbsp;
The code looks like it tries to do so, but for some reason it didn't do
it.&nbsp; Maybe it was my Netscape configuration, I don't know for certain.&nbsp;
Besides HTML based help, there are PDF help files too.&nbsp; These require
the Adobe acroread program.&nbsp; Information is provided in the documentation
that accompanies the source on where to find this tool.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
if xfig doesn't find acroread at run time, there are no messages saying
it wasn't found.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>One good thing about xfig
is that it installs under /usr/local by default, which is better for system
administration purposes.&nbsp; Tons of examples are provided in the source
distribution, but these do not get installed so hang on to the source directory
if you want to take a look at them.</font></font>

- <font size=-1><a href="tgif.html">screen shots</a></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>TGIF gets installed under
/usr/X11R6 by default, which is a little more difficult in terms of managing
software packages.&nbsp; Its not clear from the Imakefile, the README or
the Imake templates how to change this behaviour, either.&nbsp; Requirements:&nbsp;
just a regular X Window System installation, plus the Xaw3D library if
you want the 3D buttons and so forth.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The interface has improved
dramatically since the last time I used TGIF, probably 2 years ago.&nbsp;
Its amazing how a little 3D look can improve the impact of the UI.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>An annoying aspect of the
new UI is that mouse clicks don't get recognized unless I move my mouse
after clicking.&nbsp; Seems a minor thing, but after a while it gets to
be a bit annoying.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>TGIF, like xfig, doesn't
realign buttons along the left side either but it does a better job of
UI design by allowing a much smaller window to be fully viewable.&nbsp;
You don't lose as many buttons, options, etc, when you sqeeze the window
way down like you do with xfig.&nbsp; Thats useful on smaller displays.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I found it a bit hard to
find help using this package, but you can find useful info in the FAQ at
<a href="http://bourbon.cs.umd.edu:8001/tgif/faq/">http://bourbon.cs.umd.edu:8001/tgif/faq/</a>.&nbsp;
You can also find the very large man pages, in various formats (ASCII,
PDF, HTML, etc) at <a href="http://bourbon.cs.umd.edu:8001/tgif/download.html">http://bourbon.cs.umd.edu:8001/tgif/download.html</a>.&nbsp;
The man page is also available in nroff format in the source distribution.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>There are some examples at
<a href="http://bourbon.cs.umd.edu:8001/tgif/goodies.html">http://bourbon.cs.umd.edu:8001/tgif/goodies.html.</a>&nbsp;
There are a few interesting examples there, but not as many as XFig has.</font></font>

<hr SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="50%">
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="http://www.online.de/home/sketch/Default.htm">Sketch</a>
- <font size=-1><a href="sketch.html">screen shot</a></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Sketch is implemented completely
in Python, a high level interpreted language.&nbsp; It has some limitations,
such as the visuals it will support.&nbsp; The Web site says:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>For Sketch to work
properly with transformed text, you also need an X-server capable of scaling
and transforming fonts. (XFree86 does support this.&nbsp; Otherwise, you
need X11R6 as far as I know).</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Xi Graphics AcceleratedX also
supports this, at least from version 4.1.&nbsp; I don't know if Metro Link
does, but assuming its an R6 conformant server, it should.&nbsp; This is
the first time I've seen this requirement on any X program.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Sketch requires Python v1.5.1
or later, the Python Imaging Library, v1.0b1 and Tcl/TK, version 8.0 or
later.&nbsp; To build the Python Imaging Library (aka PIL) you can't use
the RPM version of Python - you have to build the python distribution from
source and install it.&nbsp; This is because you have to build PIL under
the "Extensions" directory of the Python 1.5 directories.&nbsp; Although
I have Python 1.5 installed on my stock RH 5.2 box, there is no Extensions
directory.&nbsp; Plus, if I just made the directory where 1.5 is installed
(/usr/lib/python1.5), I'd have to build the PIL as the root user.&nbsp;
Not a good thing.&nbsp; So I downloaded the Python 1.5 source, built it,
then tried the PIL buid.&nbsp; It didn't work - something about missing
a config directory.&nbsp; And all this before I could even try to build
sketch.&nbsp; Can you say "pain in the butt?"&nbsp; Why do I have to install
10 packages every time I want 1?&nbsp; I&nbsp; find myself yearning for
the dear old days of Xt and Athena based tools.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Sketch appears to come with
a lot of pages of HTLM documentation, but there isn't really much content
in them.&nbsp; Keep in mind, of course, that sketch (like most of the other
tools) is still in early development.</font></font>

<hr SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="50%">
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="http://wwwiti.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/~sattler/killustrator.html">KIllustrator</a>
- <font size=-1><a href="killustrator.html">screen shots</a></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>KIllustrator requires the
QT 1.41 libraries and the K Desktop Environment (KDE) version 1.1 or later.&nbsp;
The web site specifically states the current version does not compile with
gcc 2.7.x, which comes standard on RH 5.2.&nbsp; It will compile with egcs-1.x,
however, and that <i>does</i> come with RH 5.2.&nbsp; Its getting annoying:&nbsp;&nbsp;
first the migration from a.out to ELF, then migrating from libc5 to libc6
(aka glibc), and eventually migrating to egcs from gcc.&nbsp; I hope this
last migration is simpler than the previous two.&nbsp; <i>sigh</i>&nbsp;
Is Linux ever going to go 2 full years without some major migration?</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The information on the web
site is quite useful and the tool looks impressive.&nbsp; If you run KDE
already then you might want to take a look at this one.&nbsp; Let me know
if you had much trouble getting it up and running and I'll pass that along
to my readers.&nbsp; (No fair saying it was a breeze if you're one of the
developers!)</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I didn't try this one because
the installation of KDE is an adventure in itself (there are a ton of packages
listed on the KDE home page and its not completely clear which ones are
mandatory and which are not).&nbsp; Any application that is so tied to
some other application is a little more than I'm willing to deal with right
now.&nbsp; Even the Gimp isn't tied to GNOME.&nbsp; Killustrator should
be decoupled, if possible, from KDE so non-KDE users could enjoy its benefits
as well.</font></font>

- <font size=-1><a href="gilt.html">screen shot</a></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This is a merge, of sorts,
of XFIG and Gimp, in very early stages of development.&nbsp; The project
is currently a one-man work. The goal is a freehand-like program with the
following features:</font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>uses openGL (hardware acceleration
possible)</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>transparent objects</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>gimp user-interface (means good
user-interface)</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>plug-ins and scripting (currently
under work)</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>most wanted: loading most postscript
files</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>multiple layers</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>guides</font></font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>According to the author, Ralf
Engles:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The current state
of the project is pre-alpha and not usable but making fast progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I am currently looking for experienced programmers. My plan is to be faster
than the Correl-Draw Version for Linux, which is hard as a one man team.</font></font></blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="50%">
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="http://www.demon.co.uk/titan/">IPAD/XEBOT</a>
- <font size=-1><a href="xebot.html">screen shots</a></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>These tools are neither shareware
nor freeware.&nbsp; They are currently only available in binary format
and are free for evaluation purposes.&nbsp; XEBOT has not superceded IPAD,
but the Web site recommends looking at it instead since it includes all
the functionality of IPAD plus some extras. According to the author, Sergio
Masci:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>IPAD is a vector
graphics tool and XEBOT is a forms / dialog editor come IPAD-Pro core interface.&nbsp;
IPAD, XEBOT and ZMECH are all derived apps built on the IPAD-Pro core.&nbsp;
IPAD uses a large subset of the IPAD-Pro interface in its raw form. In
the past users were encouraged to use XEBOT instead of IPAD because XEBOT
has all the vector manipulation capabilities of IPAD and at that time I
did not have the time to spare to maintain the seperate IPAD release.</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The binary comes in SVGA and
X11R6 versions.&nbsp; The X11R6 version is not completely statically linked
and is compiled with libc5.&nbsp; That means RH5.2 users (and possibly
others) may have to do a little fiddling with the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable to get this to work.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>When I ran both XEBOT and
IPAD I got a bunch of X protocol errors.&nbsp; This is because neither
program likes running in 24-bit (TrueColor) colour visuals.&nbsp; I had
to restart in 8-bit mode (256 color) to run this.</font></font>
