Dear, mr. answerguy. I am consulting with a movie rental
store. There current computer system is running on a menu driven
operating system called PC-MOS. I know what your thinking, that I
mis-pelled PC-MOS and it should be PC-DOS. Unfortunately, it
really is PC-MOS. 
</STRONG></P>

No.  I'm not thinking that.  I used PC-MOS occasionally a
few years ago.  My favorite local pizza parlor runs a
billing and order entry system under PC-MOS.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
PC-MOS is/was a multi-user PC-DOS clone that was published
by TSL (The Software Link) during the late eighties.  There
were also a couple of other multi-user/multi-tasking
operating systems with more or less DOS compatability.  I
professionally used CCI's version of Concurrent DOS
(licensed from Digital Research's C-DOS, which was later
called MDOS).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I can't seem to find links to TSL in Yahoo! and Google
searches.  I guess they must have disappeared completely.
Apparently they were involved in some landmark lawsuits
related to shrink-wrap software licenses.  Most of the
links I found at Alta Vista and Google were in discussion
of these and UCC Article 2B (ancestor of the UCITA)
laws that relate to the enforceability of these licenses.

Anyway, I had them back some files up on a
5'1/4' floppy disk. And when I put the floppy into my 386
Dos-based computer to try and read it, the computer tells me that
the disk is not formatted, and would I like to format it. My
operating system on my computer will not even recognize the disk
as a valid disk. Can you offer any suggestions? Is there any
conversion software utilities that could make the data files
readable on my dos-based machine.

People don't use 5 1/4" (I don't think you meant 5 1/4'
-- FOOT) diskettes and more.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Is this a high density (1.2Mb) drive?  Is it a
360K diskette?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I'd buy a $30 dollar 3.5" disk drive and install that.
I'm pretty sure that your 386 and PC-MOS will support
the hardware.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1.2Mb floppies were always much less reliable than
their 3.5" 1.44 Mb cousins.  Also those drives could
not reliably interoperate with 360K media and the 1.2Mb
media weren't terribly reliable when formatted to 360K
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
My advice:  remove all 5 1/4" drives (some of us may
want to store on shelves for reading legacy media as
it shows up) and replace them with 3.5" drives (at least).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It would be nice to replace 3.5" HD (1.44Mb) media and
drives with something like LS120 or Zip Disk.  However,
none of the large capacity formats is really ubiquitous
enough to declare it to be the new de facto standard.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
CDRW isn't more than about three times more expensive
than LS120 --- but it has five times the capacity.
DVD-RW isn't more than than ten times more expensive,
but it does offer more than 20 times the capacity.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I'm not suggesting LS120, CDRW, or any of that to
your situation. PC-MOS and your old 386 probably won't
support these newer media.   The versions of PC-MOS
and CDOS that I remember didn't have support for
SCSI --- or had very limited support for only a few
SCSI host adapters.  You might be quite challenged to
find a controller that you could use with this old
OS.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This brings us naturally to the question:  Can you
migrate this software to run under <A HREF="http://www.dosemu.org/">DOSEMU</A> (under
Linux) or to some other operating system that's
been updated within the last half decade or so?
