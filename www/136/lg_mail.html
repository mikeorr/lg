<p>
First off, TWDT is no longer TWDT. If you click on TWDT you find that the 
mailbag has "Thread continues here" links. Could we make TWDT be TWDT?
</p>

<p>
Secondly, we have the answers to last month's geekword. It would be nice to 
have the questions with it, so anyone that wants to admire the subtlety of 
the clues, or pick nits, don't have to flick between windows.

The goal is to move Nmap XML files into a database, with a

Well, there's all kinds of stuff you could do with 'apt-cache' to tell
you where the files are, but in short, they're all under
'/usr/share/doc/lg*'. In fact, '/usr/share/doc' should be the first
place you look for anything on your system that doesn't have built-in
help or a manpage.

<h3>Purpose of some spam messages?</h3>

<b>Kapil Hari Paranjape [kapil at imsc.res.in]</b><br />
<b>Thu, 1 Feb 2007 17:58:37 -0800</b>
</p>

<p>
Hello,
</p>

<p>
I was just wondering if someone has thought about what is the purpose
of SPAM messages which only contain some mish-mash text. The
qualifying criteria are:
<pre>
	1. Only text without attachments.
	2. Text that contains incoherent sentences or disconnected sentences. [*]
	3. Definitely messages from addresses not known to the recipient.
</pre>
(The last is to exclude e-mail messages written by friends who are
not quite sober at the time of writing <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">).
</p>

<p>
Here are some possiblities that occured to me.
</p>

<p>
A. These are messages that are designed to test/mar the efficiency of
the spam detection systems currently employed by servers.
</p>

<p>
B. These messages contain coded messages that are flooded across the
internet in an attempt to disguise their true origin/destination. The
real message could be short one such as "the machine from which this
has been sent has serious security holes".
</p>

<p>
C. This is generated for someone's research project.
</p>

<p>
D. This is the result of some spam generating software/virus which has
   bugs.
</p>

<p>
I don't know if this is worth wondering about ... except ... why is someone
going to some trouble to make (a program which is making) life difficult
for everyone?
</p>

<p>
Pointers to prior discussion welcome.
</p>

<p>
Thanks and regards,
</p>

<p>
Kapil.
[*] Clearly (2) is subjective which makes such spam hard to detect
automatically.

Dear TAG,
I am a regular reader and wanted to first thank you for the great zine. I'll
probably be starting my own site/zine (long story short: 'tis all to keep in 
touch with my friends, who I have known for all my life but will have to 
leave them soon). The zine part won't be linux related(except maybe for one
column every now and then). 
</p>

<p>
I know I talk too much but, my question(s): When LG first started out, how did
you get the readers? How was it publicized? How did you get your very first 
reader? Also any tips (Kat? Ben? team?) ?
</p>

<p>
One more thing: Write more POLOTMs or else I'll have to resort to violent 
methods!

Love that URL in part 2. Freakin' "0xc8.0x2b.0x50.0x74"? You'd
think that anyone dumb enough to just click on URLs in these "bank"

doesn't kill them off, and 2) There's One Born Every Minute. I guess the

Thanks. I have to admit I have not yet taken your
advice, though they sound like good suggestions. I
did, however, find Marcel Gagne's book Moving to Linux
at the library. He mentioned Mandrake. I went to their
site, now Mandriva, and downloaded Mandriva One, a
free release (I'm willing to pay, but my needs are
light...no gaming, just music, video, word
processing.) However, when I try to open it, Microsoft
says it can't find the file to open it, and I get lost
after that. I've had MS Windows for 5 years, which I
installed, and I have downloaded a dozen or two
programs, but I'm still a newbie, I need specific
instructions in some cases. Like this one. Any help
would be most appreciated. The "Blue screen of Death"
is killing me! Thanks. John

Hello Answer Gang,
</p>

<p>
This is my first time posting to you so I hope I get it right.
</p>

<p>
I am having big issues with my WiFi connectivity. Basically everything
seems to be okay but attempting to ping an address results in a network
unreachable message. I've used drakconnect to setup the wireless setup.
The router itself is reporting the card as attached ! And ifconfig shows
a continuous stream of traffic to the card but nothing from it.

The contents of /var/messages looks fine, apart from perhaps the last
line:
