<p>
Hello,
 
I am new one for shell programming.
I want to write a shell script that..
 
1)       Read text file from source folder and past it in to a destination folder
</p>

<p>
2)       Delete previous text file from destination folder (destination folder contain only one text file at a time)
</p>

<p>
3)       And this moving of file happened on weekly basis (after completion of a week new text file copied in destination folder in
weekly basis)
</p>

<p>
4)       Which file will be copied in the destination folder is decided by week. If it is 1st week then  p1.txt, if week 5th then p5.txt will be copied in destination folder.
</p>

<p>
5)       Week will be start from any date decided by us (like 14 December on  Fridays to 22 December Friday is 1st week  and other weeks
will be calculated by 14 December ).
 
Please help me.
</p>


<p>
 
 
Regards,
 
Mudassar Khan

And sending email, by the looks of it.  Plain text only please.  Don't
send HTML email.

These are the same thing to me:  see the mv(1) command.

<p>
See cron, especially the @weekly directive for older dixie cron stuff,
although most modern distros have /etc/cron.d/weekly/ and such for
your use.  You just drop a shell script in there, with the appropriate
permissions.

<p>
You would use date(1) for this.

<p>
Yes I am being vague, but this sounds like homework to me.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
