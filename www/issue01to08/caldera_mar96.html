<P> Here we go with the second part of the Caldera DeskTop review. If
you are joining me late, you can still follow along, but you might want
to read the January issue anyway. (Lots o' good stuff in it) I decided
to change tatics and instead of jumping into the PrintTool and net
configuration, I'm going start off with the 6 menu buttons found on all
layouts. So, without further ado, I will jump right to .....


<H2>The Default Layout</H2>
The layout you have chosen for your default layout contains 6 menu
buttons along the top row. Recall from last month there are three
built-in layouts to choose from.  I happen to favor the 'power user'
layout as I can view any background picture I might want to put there.
I have xfishtank running most of the time.  Too bad there isn't the
sound of the air compressor!  Anyway, "default layout" is talking about
<B>my</B> default layout.

<H3>File</H3> 
This menu button has some sub options whose functions are not obvious at
first glance. These functions are:

<UL>
	<LI><B>Open</B> Clicking here will start up any application on the desktop which 
		has be highlighted.  
	<LI><B>Show</B> Clicking here brings up a file manager window of the directory 
		where the application lives. 
	<LI><B>Print</B> Clicking here will print a text file if you have print services 
		enabled/setup.
	<LI><B>Empty Trash</B> Removes any files marked for deletion. 
	<LI><B>Take off Desktop</B> Any highlighted icons are removed from the desktop.
	<LI><B>Exit Desktop</B> Leaves Desktop and the X window system.  Back to the 
		command line.
</UL>

Whew! A lota gifs for this section!  In case you are wondering, all of
the Caldera articles have been written completly within Linux!  The
graphics, the HTML docs....everything.  I only mention this because I've
been asked just what can be done with an Unix clone.  (Can't be
good...nope, just can't be..) Well, I point out the powerful X window
system, the multitasking/user parts and then refer them to back issues
of the Linux Gazette and Journal.  Well, just like sheep, most people
shake their heads and return to Windoze.  <P>
<I><B>Ciao bella</I></B>
