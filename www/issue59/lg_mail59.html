<BR>Subject: Vines Client for linux

<P> On my notebook I run linux, but at my work the network is Banyan Vines.
Searching the internet, I could not find any linux client for Vines.
Perhaps I didn't look good enough or mayby there is no such thing.I
think it would be nice to read something about that.
The only thing that i found was a private project to write a client for
linux, but that site hasn't been updated for more than a year.
it is

<P> Every year I need to struggle with Windoze again
in order to work out my income taxes.
I heard that there were some web-based systems,
but when I dug into it,
it turned out that it needed to work with an adobe
plugin that didn't work for me.

<P> Hope you can dig up some better solutions
for us Linux folk?

<BR>Subject: Slackware RAID1 problem

<P> HEELP! hehe
I have been trying to find a chatroom (or ICQ or something..just aas long as 
its live and they are available alot.) with some people (or better yet, one 
kind guru with lots of free time) in it that can help me with a slackware 
problem I am having..(specifically installing and configuring a RAID1 
system).
I am VERY new to linux ..have only compiled one kernel in my lifetime and 
don't truly understand what it did or why..hehe

<P> All I need is someone to kinda walk me through step-by-step commands 
starting with CFDISK and going all the way to the end..a bootable raid1 
system.
(I can learn how and why later..but am on a bit of a time schedule at the 
moment.)

<P> If you know of any places I can go or people to contact, please let me know 
as soon as you can.


<P> I already have about 90 pages of printed material and have tried most of 
it, but its not working.
dunno, maybe the the instructions I have (have about 10 different sets form 
different websites) are missing something..

<P> Anyway, I really appreciate any help you might be able to offer..

<BR>Subject: Windows NT Event Log on a Linux Box

<P> I need to consolidate the event log from
several machines and produce some reports and even alerts from the data
collected. I was thinking that using the Linux tools (cron jobs,
scripting languages, and DBMS) could be a good idea, but cannot find how
to do this (read the event log of a Windows box from a Linux box).

<P> The best support I can find was the article
<A HREF="http://www.securityfocus.com/frames/?focus=microsoft&content=/focus/microsoft/nt/log1.html">
http://www.securityfocus.com/frames/?focus=microsoft&content=/focus/microsoft/nt/log1.html</A>.
In it I can find:

<P> "... The Event Log is accessible to remote machines via Remote Procedure
Calls (RPC) via applications that utilize the Event Log API, such as the
Event Viewer."

<P> So I think it's possible to have some application that uses RPC (as
SAMBA does) to connect to the remote Windows box and get a copy of the
event log.

<P> Can you help me? The Windows NT boxes are in an NT Domain,
and the Linux box does have the SAMBA installed and running.

<P> TIA

<P> P.S.: sorry the bad english, I'm a brazilian penguinista.

<BR>Subject: Linux Gazette by e-mail

<P> Here is my 0.02USD tip for all those readers who'd
like to receive the <I>Gazette</I> by e-mail.

<P> Actually it can be done quite easy. All you need to do is
send an e-mail message to bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu with
message body:

<PRE>
open ftp.ssc.com
chdir /pub/lg
binary
get lg-issueXX.tar.gz
quit
</PRE>

<P> and you will receive back an e-mail containing a uuencoded
copy of the requested file. There is plenty of uudecoding 
software so I will not elaborate further.

<P> If you need more detailed HOWTO on the matter
and a list of other ftp-mail servers send
an e-mail message to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu
with message body:

<PRE>
send usenet/news.answers/internet-services/access-via-email
</PRE>

<P> or mailto mailbase@mailbase.ac.uk
with message body:

<PRE>
send lis-iis e-access-inet.txt
</PRE>

<P> or visit <A HREF="http://www.activesol.com/www/drbobfram.htm">http://www.activesol.com/www/drbobfram.htm</A>

<P> There you will also find info on various internet services
available via e-mail.


<H3><EM>Your Editor comments:</EM></H3>

This is certainly easy since it uses standard FTP commands.  Remember to get
<STRONG>lg_base.tar.gz</STRONG> too the first time, and 
<STRONG>lg-base-new.tar.gz</STRONG> each month.  However, note that the 
<A HREF="../ftpfiles.txt">file sizes</A> are large: recent issues have been
750KB - 2.1 MB, and lg-base is currently 837 KB.  Some mail gateways reject
messages which are over a certain size, frequently one megabyte.  If the files
are too large for your gateway, the following suggestion may be more suitable
for you.

<H3><EM>Ralbright &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ralbright5@juno.com">ralbright5@juno.com</A>&gt; recommends:</EM></H3>

<P> Send an email as noted here to any of the  numerous www4 servers.

<PRE>
From: Your  Mail Address Here   
To:  www4mail@ftp.uni-stuttgart.de
Subject: leave blank nothing here

GETSIZE 50000
XUUENCODE 
ftp://ftp.ssc.com/pub/lg/lg-issue58_tar_gz.
</PRE>

<P> 
this results in 24 msg that are numbered  part 01 of 24 and uuencode.
I use uudeview to decode the 24 parts.
I then rename each part to aa----ax. 24  parts;
then I combine the parts exactly like this. must be this way!!

<PRE>
copy /b aa+ab+ac+ad and finally ax
</PRE>

then press return on the line containing the copy instruction
It will ask if you want aa to be overwrote. answer yes and all will now
be in aa
now re name aa to issue58.tgz and proceed with untgz

<P> I have acquired all 58 issues this way through email only. Hope you can
make sense
out of this.

<H3><EM>Your Editor comments:</EM></H3>

That <CODE>copy</CODE> command is for DOS/Windows sysems.  (No, it's not a 
crime to read <I>LG</I> on a Windows machine.)  On Linux/UNIX, you'd
do this instead:

<PRE>
cat aa ab ac ad ... ax &gt;issue58.tgz
</PRE>

This creates <STRONG>issue58.tgz</STRONG>, containing all the other files joined
together one after the other.  I don't see why you need to rename the files to
<EM>aa</EM>, <EM>ab</EM>, etc., since you're just going to use them once and 
then delete them.  Why not just use whatever names <CODE>uudecode</CODE> gives
you?

<H3><EM>Ralbright &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ralbright5@juno.com">ralbright5@juno.com</A>&gt; continues:</EM></H3>

E-mail, like everything else, sometimes goes off into never-never land. If,
after getting the parts of LG, you discover that some parts are missing, send
the following to the www4 server:

<PRE>
GETPART put missing part number here
GETSIZE 50000
XUUENCODE 
ftp://ftp.ssc.com/pub/lg/lg-issue58_tar_gz.
</PRE>

<BR>Subject: Translations

<P> Thanks to everybody who responded to 
last month's request for translators from other languages to English.
Currently we have volunteers for:

<DL COMPACT>
	<DT> <STRONG>ROMANCE</STRONG>
	<DD> Spanish (3), Portuguese (2), French.
	<DT> <STRONG>GERMANIC</STRONG>
	<DD> German, Dutch, Norwegian, Danish, Swedish
	<DT> <STRONG>SLAVIC</STRONG>
	<DD> Russian (from Russian only)
</DL>

<P> We don't get a lot of mail in non-English languages, but we have gotten an
article in French and one in Spanish, and TAG/Mailbag items in Italian, Spanish
and Danish.  I just want to have translators ready in case we need them
someday.

<P> Those who wish to translate from English into their own language should
contact the foreign-language version of interest, or start your own if there
isn't one.  As always, see the <A HREF="../mirrors.html">mirrors page</A>.

<H3><EM>Note to those who work on </EM>LG's<EM> foreign-language editions:</EM></H3>

<P> There is a new mailing list, lg-translators, where I send advance copies of
articles after they have been formatted.  This will give you a chance to get
your hands on the articles a few days early to lessen the delay between when the
English version appears and when your translation is ready.

<P> To subscribe to this list, send a message to 
<A HREF="mailto:majordomo@ssc.com">majordomo@ssc.com</A> with 
"subscribe lg-translators" in the body.  This is a moderated list: only
articles, article revisions, and announcements from <I>LG</I> to the foreign
editions will be sent.

<H3><EM>Musings on the Spanish </EM>LG:</H3>

The Spanish <I>LG</I> 
(<A HREF="http://gaceta.piensa.com">La Gazeta de Linux</A>) could become a
significant force in the next several months.  I have been getting
inquiries about it every month, moreso than I've received for the other
languages.  The Spanish-speaking world in particular seems to have a lot of
unmet demand for a <I>Gazette</I>-like publication.  I suspect that's because
of the economic situation in Latin America (an affordable OS is more of a
necessity than in Europe), because people are less likely to grow up knowing
English, and because there are a whole *lot* of Spanish speakers.

<P> The demand for Spanish <I>LG</I> reminds me of the demand for an affordable
Macintosh that was built up during the late 80s.  When Apple finally released
the MacClassic in 1990, I for one immediately went down and bought one, as did
a lot of other people.  Apple was forced to switch to a 3-shift, 24-hour
production line to churn them out, just to meet the demand.

<P> Note: all non-English versions of <I>Linux Gazette</I> are done as
independent projects without <I>LG</I> sponsorship.  <I>LG</I> does not endorse
specific translations as being official.  However, we gratefully acknowledge all
translations we know about on our 
<A HREF="../mirrors.html">mirrors page</A>.

<BR>Subject: "@" sign confuses <I>LG</I> mirrors

<P> I have no idea when this started because I auto-mirror /pub/lg/www_root
and only usually look at it when a new issue comes out... but here's what
I get with ftp and with lftp:

<PRE>

</PRE>

<P> The two @ that are in there seem to be botching up "mget *.html" type
requests and mirroring (I use lftp's mirror), making the
"search.html" file become "30  2000 search.html" (the 30 and the 2000
coming from the date).

<P> Anyone else report this?  I'm going to grab the .tar.gz files now
and shut off the nightly updates.

<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>
	[Nobody else has reported this.  We get the "@" symbols on the
FTP listings too.  However, </EM>LG<EM> has an rsync server.  Rsync is 
reliable and uses less bandwidth than FTP mirroring.  Jason switched to rsync
and said it's working fine.  Hints for setting up an rsync client for </I>LG<I>
are <A HREF="../faq/index.html#rsync">here</A>.  -Mike.]
