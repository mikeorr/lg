hi, i'm fairly new to linux other than i had red hat successfully
installed and working on another computer before. now i got a new
computer and i decided to try mandrake this time because i heard it's
more user friendly which would work well for trying to convert my
finacee from windows.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
anyways, i installed mandrake on the second of 3 hard drives in a
dual-boot system.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
anyways i ran into a couple big problems. first i installed LILO
graphical boot loader on my seagate 4GB, leaving my main 20GB drive
completely alone but still having the option to boot to windows in lilo,
thankfully because after install i found that if i boot to my 20 GB
drive to get windows my screen types 9A repeatedly for about 6 lines or
so and then goes to a black screen with the message "press a key to
reboot" as i said, thankfully i still can access windows via lilo booted
on my 4GB seagate and i have a rescue mbr and boot record stored on my
6GB.
</STRONG></P>

Sounds like whatever bootloader is in your MBR (I can't tell from your
description if it is LILO or not) is broken.

now when i try to  load linux (my biggest problem really) it does the
initial bios check (ok) and says loading kernel but then my monitor goes
into standby mode as if i shut the computer off.

Did you read the backpages. I remember that I answered a question on this
very subject. Here is the URL:

ok, i let it run for a
while while it reads the hard drive, eventually i let it sit for 30
minutes or so with no change and i end up rebooting and here i am. i did
try to turn the monitor back on manually and it just does it's self test
and says check cable connection. i still haven't been able to get linux
to load successfully even in failsafe and no framebuffer modes. i did
have this same install on my second partition of my 20GB but removed it
after hearing that you can't have windows and linux on the same drive
and expect linux to work,

That is nonsense. You can indeed have Linux and Windows on the same drive,
either by partitioning the free space on that drive for Linux, or by using
the "win4lin" idea, whereby flat files are stored on your windows
partition.

i hoped giving it it's own drive would fix the
problem especially since that was how i had red hat installed and
working on another computer. i don't know why it's not working on this
comp. if anyone out there happens to have a solution for this and !
maybe a reason why the install hashed my mbr on my 20GB i would =
appreciate it.

Sounds like your monitor's modelines are off. I'd be interested to know
whether or not it is FrameBuffer that causes the monitor to bork. Try this
at the LILO prompt:

sorry to sound like an idiot but so you know i'm self taught as far as
computers go and i learned over the years how to do just about anything in
windows, buid a computer, and install and run linux with some intelligence, i
know it doesn't sound like much to the more educated types out there but

Clearly not, since he's managed to do all of that. To me, "idiot" ==
"uneducable", no matter how "intelligent" someone may be in the common
meaning. Not knowing something does not make you an idiot; being
unwilling to learn when you need to would.

There's no way to distinguish EDO and "regular" 72-pin
memory unless says on the chip (good manufacturers) or you've memorized
their numberic codes (which nobody except those who work in the memory
industry do).  Most people who put memory in 72-pin computers just sort
their spare memory chips by what "looks similar" and then experiment to
see which ones work together.  Of course it depends on the motherboard
too.  Most motherboards insist 72-pin memory (SIMM) be installed in
pairs of the same size (megabytes).  But my mom's computer works happily
with three 8 MB SIMMs and one slot empty.

DIMMs (168-pin memory) are designed with notches along the bottom to
distinguish their type.  You don't have to know the types; you just have
to know that if it's the wrong type, the notches won't fit the
protrusions in the slot and it won't go in.

*AHEM!* Yes it will, Mike. You just haven't repaired enough computers to
know better. 
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> I've seen two floppies "go into" a 5.25" floppy drive
before... and DIMMs would be much simpler: you could <em> _easily</em> use a
hammer to drive them into position. I've seen people jam the 30-pin
SIMMS in backwards, completely uncaring that only one corner of it
actually touched the connector instead of the entire strip being solidly
plugged in. It was in there, by gosh, and *that's* what counted.

The manufacturers must have
realized the problem of identical-looking incompatible memory types and
gone to this system to cut down support calls.  Fortunately, there's a
company where I live (CompuCare in Seattle) that sells memory with a
lifetime warranty, and they've been good about exchanging it if anything
goes bad.

<blockQuote>
It's easy to tell whether DIMM memory is the right type,
because if it's not the notches on the bottom won't line up with the slot
and it won't go in.

You think we're not self taught?  Some of us <EM>have</EM> had formal education
in Computer Science and/or as hardware technicians, but I just learned
by trial and error over the years same as you.  I worked in workstation
support and at a small ISP for a few years, and that gave me an
opportunity to learn from more knowledgeable ppl whenever it related to
a task at hand.  I still remember what a big ordeal it was when I
installed my first CD-ROM (pre-IDE) at home, but now it's a snap.

<LI>Create the partition (e.g., /dev/hdc1) and set the type to "Linux swap".  Use one of the *fdisk programs (my favorite is cfdisk) or your distribution's GUI installer.


<LI>Run "mkswap /dev/hdc1" to format it.


<LI>Run "swapon /dev/hdc1" to activate it, and "swapoff" the old partition to deactivate it.


<LI>Add a line in /etc/fstab for the new swap partition; comment out the line for the old partition.  Linux runs "swapon -a" at boot to activate all swap partitions listed in /etc/fstab.


<LI>(Optional) Change the type of your old partition to Linux, and reformat it with your favorite filesystem (ext3, ext2, reiserfs, etc).
