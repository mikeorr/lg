Hi, all -
</p>

<p>
Last night, we went to a little Indian restaurant here in Charleston;
the owner had put on some music that was lots of fun, a sort of an
Indian hip-hop with a little Hinglish rap thrown in, a fast beat and
very dancy. When I tried to ask him what it was, or who it was by, or
even where I could get a CD, he told me that it was "just some Punjabi
music" that he had put together on a tape, and he didn't seem willing to
give up any more details (artist, style, etc.) I've done some cursory
looking around on Youtube, and haven't found what I'm looking for,
although here's some stuff that's similar:
</p>

<p>
# "Gaddi", by Jazzy Bains: kinda close, but a bit too repetitive
<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kjkz4-Zwz2o'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kjkz4-Zwz2o</a>
</p>

<p>
# "Mundian To Bach Ke", too rap-like, not enough singing
<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gef48exMfo'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gef48exMfo</a>
</p>

<p>
It doesn't seem to be Bhangra (although I may be wrong, all the Youtube
hits for 'bhangra rap' or 'bhangra hip-hop' are turning up... well, I
don't have the musical vocabulary to describe it, but not the right
thing, anyway.) Any suggestions on what to look for? I know we have a
lot of Indian readers, so I thought this might be a good place to ask.
</p>

( I hope the food wasn;t too spicy <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">. Off late, I have been on a
couple of trips to Europe and my European colleagues have always
coaxed me/my Indian colleagues to take them to Indian restaurants.
Though they panted due to the nature of the food, they relished it too

In my dark and shady past, I've had Thai and Indonesian friends invite
me to their homes for a meal, generally cooked by the Mom or some auntie
who spoke no English but whose eyes lit up at the prospect of a new
mouth to singe. Indian food is pretty mild by comparison. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> What I love
though, particularly about southern Indian food, is its complexity of
flavor - not how spicy it is. For that, I'll take Indonesian or Korean
any day.
</p>

<p>
The other factor holding down the nuclear-level spiciness these days is
Kat's Japanese-adapted palate (a very, very mild - some might even say
bland - cuisine); if I want to share food with her, which I always do,
then I have to stick with 'medium spicy' at most. So, no - no scorched
tongues yesterday.

Oh, the videos are really amusing. I've always enjoyed Bollywood anyway
(cue "Benny Lava"), but I especially love that whole upbeat hip-hop
thing with the traditional instruments in the background!

Sam, your tastebuds got shot off in the war. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> The one thing that
you've pronounced acceptable, fried fish (which I will admit they do
well in Boston), is my definition of "bland and safe" - something I tend

<p>
(Great guy, this Sam Bisbee-vonKaufmann - but if interesting food is your
thing, he just ain't got that swing. The look of trepidation on his face
when looking at real Taiwanese or Ethiopian food would be enough to move
anyone to pity.)

<p>
Sam? Charleston, SOUTH Carolina is in the, um, SOUTH. Their governor
just got caught having an affair with a Argentinian woman... you know,
<strong>that</strong> South Carolina.
</p>

<p>
Besides, I know how to order food in the North-east just fine: just stay
away from the bland, fried-fish-only places, and it's just like anywhere
else (and sometimes even better.) Knowledge of Chinese, Portuguese,
Swahili, and whatever else you can squeeze in is a major plus.

<p>
If you're anywhere within driving range of Charleston (yes, <strong>that</strong>
Charleston), come on down. I'm sure I could find you a dead fried fish
or something, and laugh at your horrified expression while we munch on
real food you've never heard of. Most of the world's cuisine, that is. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

You seem to have completely forgotten the Ethiopian restaurant that I took us
to and the awesome sea food place in Hull (Jake's); not my fault you ordered
the sea food casserole at Jake's when I got the cedar planked salmon.

Again I refer you to the Ethiopian restaurant suggested to me by my friend

Nope, didn't forget anything - including you poking at the Ethiopian

<p>
I've eaten German food - quite a bit of it, in fact. I used to live by a
tiny German restaurant in Mayo, MD that made the best spaetzle ever, and
would cook German specialty dishes if asked a day ahead of time. I've
also spent some time in Milwaukee, which has lots of German and Austrian
restaurants. German food holds no surprises for me... but I guarantee
you that I could surprise the hell out of you with some Burmese or
Norwegian or Korean dishes.

Sure. We try to stay away from that kind of places; in fact, one of my
definitions of a top-notch place to eat is where the staff speak no, or
barely any English. Lately, we've been hitting the Mexican taco trucks
in this area; the food is fantastic and inexpensive. I'm a big fan of
bahn mi (Vietnamese sandwiches with a French influence) for the same
reason.

&gt; Hi, all -
&gt; 
&gt; Last night, we went to a little Indian restaurant here in Charleston;
&gt; the owner had put on some music that was lots of fun, a sort of an
&gt; Indian hip-hop with a little Hinglish rap thrown in, a fast beat and
&gt; very dancy. When I tried to ask him what it was, or who it was by, or
&gt; even where I could get a CD, he told me that it was "just some Punjabi
&gt; music" that he had put together on a tape, and he didn't seem willing to
&gt; give up any more details (artist, style, etc.) I've done some cursory
&gt; looking around on Youtube, and haven't found what I'm looking for,
&gt; although here's some stuff that's similar:
&gt; 
&gt; # "Gaddi", by Jazzy Bains: kinda close, but a bit too repetitive
&gt; <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kjkz4-Zwz2o'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kjkz4-Zwz2o</a>
&gt; 
&gt; # "Mundian To Bach Ke", too rap-like, not enough singing

Hmm - can you check out Bally Sagoo 
&lt;<a href='http://www.last.fm/music/Bally+Sagoo&gt;'>http://www.last.fm/music/Bally+Sagoo&gt;</a> and jazzy B 
&lt;<a href='http://www.last.fm/music/Jazzy+B&gt;'>http://www.last.fm/music/Jazzy+B&gt;</a>
</p>

<p>
By any chance, did he mention if it was the soundtrack of a hindi movie? 
  In that case, this might be one 
&lt;<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ssZP0lvzU&gt;'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ssZP0lvzU&gt;</a> or this one 
&lt;<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpvNM9kj6d8&gt;'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpvNM9kj6d8&gt;</a> (same movie)
