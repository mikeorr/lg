<h1>Debugging WiFi</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/root.html">Jeff Root</a></b></p>

<h3>It Works For Me</h3>

<p>Don't you hate it when you have a problem, only to be told, "On my
machine, it just works"? I know I do. So when Ben Okopnik wrote in
Linux Gazette #127:</p>

<pre>
 [ I do a lot of travelling, and connect to a wide variety of
   strange WLANs. In my experience, at least, connecting to a
   wireless LAN with Linux is usually just as simple as Edgar
   describes. -- Ben ]
</pre>

<p>This motivated me to solve a long-standing problem: I could not
connect to "open" wifi access points.  I had no trouble at all with
closed access points; someone gives me the ESSID and the WEP key, and
I'm on.  But plop me down at a hotel, airport, or coffee shop, and no
amount of fiddling would get me connected.</p>

<p>So, being determined, I wrote to Ben and offered to write this
article, if The Answer Gang would help me troubleshoot my problem.  Ben
and the Gang held up their end of the bargain, so here is my tale.</p>

<h3>The Approach</h3>

<p>First, a word about my specific configuration, so you'll have a shot at
changing things to suit your particular setup.  I am running on a Dell
C600 laptop, with an unsupported wifi card built in.  I therefore use
a PCMCIA card, a Microsoft MN-520.  The machine boots into Debian
Sarge, with all current updates.</p>

<p>Since I could easily connect to any closed access point (AP), I knew
that the hardware, driver, and networking layers were all working.  My
problem was almost certainly a configuration issue.</p>

<p>The main config file for Debian is the /etc/network/interfaces file.
My work configuration included the ESSID and WEP key, which should not
be needed for an open AP.  So I stripped the config file down to a
minimum:</p>

<pre>
    iface wlan0 inet dhcp
	wireless-mode managed
</pre>	

<p>Now, a trip to the coffee shop, and see what we get in /var/log/messages:</p>

<pre class="code">
localhost dhclient: DHCPDISCOVER on wlan0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 6
localhost dhclient: DHCPDISCOVER on wlan0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 12
localhost dhclient: DHCPDISCOVER on wlan0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 11
localhost dhclient: DHCPDISCOVER on wlan0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 21
localhost dhclient: DHCPDISCOVER on wlan0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 7
localhost dhclient: DHCPDISCOVER on wlan0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 4
localhost dhclient: No DHCPOFFERS received.
localhost dhclient: No working leases in persistent database - sleeping.
</pre>

<p>Not much of use to me here.  A bit of googling shows that my machine
is broadcasting a request for an address, but is not getting any
answers.</p>

<p>In Ben's first email to me, he included a sample of successful IP
address negotiation:</p>

<pre class="code">
Fenrir pumpd[4711]: starting at (uptime 0 days, 2:43:09)
Fenrir pumpd[4711]: PUMP: sending discover
Fenrir pumpd[4711]: got dhcp offer
Fenrir pumpd[4711]: PUMP: sending second discover
Fenrir pumpd[4711]: PUMP: got an offer
Fenrir pumpd[4711]: PUMP: got lease
Fenrir pumpd[4711]: intf: device: wlan0
Fenrir pumpd[4711]: intf: set: 416
Fenrir pumpd[4711]: intf: bootServer: 10.0.0.1
Fenrir pumpd[4711]: intf: reqLease: 43200
Fenrir pumpd[4711]: intf: ip: 10.0.0.219
Fenrir pumpd[4711]: intf: next server: 10.0.0.1
Fenrir pumpd[4711]: intf: netmask: 255.255.255.0
Fenrir pumpd[4711]: intf: gateways[0]: 10.0.0.1
Fenrir pumpd[4711]: intf: numGateways: 1
Fenrir pumpd[4711]: intf: dnsServers[0]: 10.0.0.1
Fenrir pumpd[4711]: intf: numDns: 1
Fenrir pumpd[4711]: intf: broadcast: 10.0.0.255
Fenrir pumpd[4711]: intf: network: 10.0.0.0
Fenrir pumpd[4711]: configured interface wlan0
</pre>

<p>Ben uses "pump" rather than "dhcpd", but you can clearly see his
machine sending a "discover" request, which is answered by the AP with
a "dhcp offer".  This is simply a suggested address, which your
machine is free to reject. (I don't know why you would, though.)</p>

<p class="editorial">[ It might taste a little strange, or smell 
sorta funky. Or perhaps you might already have an interface mapped to
that IP. One never knows. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> -- Ben ]</p>

<h3>When In Doubt, Use Brute Force</h3>

<p>Ken Thompson's aphorism is handy here.  I couldn't get a connection
via the automated tools, so I switched to a manual configuration.  I
knew I needed the ESSID for the AP network, so I started looking for
tools that could discover this without a connection.</p>

<p>First, I tried the <code>iwlist</code> command.  This tool uses the radio in the
WiFi card, and listens for what are known as "beacon" frames.  These
are simply broadcast messages that advertise the presence of an AP.
One problem with <code>iwlist</code> is that it's a one-shot tool; you get a list
of whatever happens to be broadcasting at the moment it listens.
While you can simply repeat the <code>iwlist</code> command, I felt more
comfortable with a tool that listens continuously.</p>

<p>That tool was Kismet.  I used APT to install it, but still had to
edit the config file (/etc/kismet/kismet.conf) to tell it to use my
HostAP-driven card.  Once configured, Kismet showed me a continuously
updated list of APs in my vicinity, and told me which ones were open
and which were masked (usually done simply by not broadcasting the
network ID, known as the SSID or ESSID).  Sure enough, one of the open
APs used the name of the coffee shop as its ESSID.</p>

<p>So, this means my machine can see the shop's AP.  Even the signal
strength looked good.  Why, then, couldn't I get any response to the
DHCPDISCOVER?</p>

<p>This meditation brings enlightenment: wifi is a radio system, and just
because I can hear the AP just fine does not mean that the AP can hear
me.  After all, an AP usually has a strong transmitter, but there's
only so much power a PCMCIA transmitter (like the one in my wifi card)
can send.</p>

<h3>Running Blind</h3>

<p>Since I can't change the power transmitted by my card, I moved closer
to the AP.  Now, I get:</p>

<pre class="code">
localhost pumpd[1275]: PUMP: sending discover 
localhost pumpd[1275]: got dhcp offer 
localhost pumpd[1275]: PUMP: sending second discover
localhost cardmgr[1068]: + Operation failed.
localhost cardmgr[1068]: + Failed to bring up wlan0.
</pre>

<p>(As you can see, I switched from dhcpd3 to pump, based on the Gang's
suggestions.)  This looks promising, since I now get an offer, but
now there's a "second discover" that fails.  What's that all about?</p>

<p>My guess is that the first discover is used to gather the AP
information (ESSID, etc.), which is then used to do the actual IP
address negotiation.</p>

<p>At this point, I was somewhat frustrated by the lack of information
contained in the logs.  But one reason I run Linux is because the
system keeps no secrets; you can always get more information, even if
you have to recompile the kernel.  It was time to stop running blind.</p>

<h3>TCPDUMP To The Rescue</h3>

<p>At this point, The Answer Gang was as starved for information as I
was.  They wanted to see <code>tcpdump</code> traces.  Tcpdump is a very low-level
network tool.  It monitors the underlying physical medium (ethernet,
radio, carrier pigeon, whatever is carrying the actual bits).</p>

<p>Tcpdump is normally run against an existing network interface, but
in my case I not only didn't have one yet, but also couldn't get one.
This was the whole object of my quest.  So the Gang shared the
incantation necessary: <code>tcpdump -vvv -i any</code>.  (You can use
more or fewer 'v' flags, for more or less detail.)</p>

<div class="pullquotes">
<a name="pullquote_135_root_1"></a>
<table border="2">
<tr>
<td align="left" bgcolor="#6EB2F1">
<sup>Category: Free software</sup>
<br />
<strong>
The most obvious benefit is the existence of such groups as The Answer Gang. While there's no guarantee that anyone will help you with your specific problem, it is much more likely to happen than with any proprietary product, even if you pay for a support contract.
</strong>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>So now my sequence was: bring up the machine, start capturing the log
files, start tcpdump and save the output to a file, then insert the
card.</p>

<p>Having captured the failed traffic, I passed it along to the Gang.
(Ben wanted me to be sure and mention that copy and paste is the
preferred method for this; too often they get hand-transcribed data
that was corrupted by a fat finger.)  Since they did such a good job
of walking through the tcpdump data, I'm just going to copy and paste
it right here.</p>

<h3>The Gang Speaks</h3>

<p>The TCPDUMP output is indented by a '&gt;'; Ben Okopnik's explanation follows.</p>

<table summary="quote" border="1" style="background-color: lightgray">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
&gt; 15:08:58.385577 IP 0.0.0.0.bootpc &gt; 255.255.255.255.bootps: BOOTP/DHCP, Request from 00:02:2d:74:4a:fa, length: 300
</pre>

<p>OK, there goes your "all stations" broadcast for DHCP.</p>

<pre>
&gt; 15:08:58.395954 arp who-has 169.254.1.51 tell 169.254.1.1
&gt; 15:08:58.397085 arp who-has 169.254.1.51 tell 169.254.1.1
&gt; 15:08:58.398200 arp who-has 169.254.1.51 tell 169.254.1.1
</pre>

<p>Wait a minute - I've just smelled a rat. 169.254.X.X? That's an IP
that's auto-assigned to an interface that requested a DHCP assignment
but failed; note that it's not assigned by the server but by your kernel
(google for 'APIPA' for more info; this is ridiculously common Windows
behavior, and I should have spotted it earlier.) The ARP request is the
standard "Before I assign this IP to this interface, is anyone else
using it?" check.</p>

<p>In other words, it looks like your system <em>never</em> acknowledges any
communication with the DHCP server other than the ESSID assignment. Even
that's probably being assigned by your own system, based on nothing more
than beacon detection.</p>

<p>Or... OK, this is silly - but could it be that the coffee shop server's
IP is actually set to be 169.254.1.1? In that case, your machine could
just be rejecting that assignment, and properly so: that /16 is a
reserved address range. Not 'reserved' as in '10.x.x.x' or
'192.168.x.x', but as in 'do not use for anything but failed DHCP
requests.'</p>

<p>It's a weird but possible explanation. Let's see if it holds up:</p>

<pre>
&gt; 15:09:02.080455 IP 169.254.1.1.bootps &gt; 255.255.255.255.bootpc: BOOTP/DHCP, Reply, length: 293
</pre>

<p>Well, <strong>something</strong> with an address of 169.254.1.1 actually does reply to you. <em>Tres</em> weird...</p>

<pre>
&gt; 15:09:02.083702 IP 0.0.0.0.bootpc &gt; 255.255.255.255.bootps: BOOTP/DHCP, Request from 00:02:2d:74:4a:fa, length: 548
&gt; 15:09:06.083860 IP 0.0.0.0.bootpc &gt; 255.255.255.255.bootps: BOOTP/DHCP, Request from 00:02:2d:74:4a:fa, length: 548
&gt; 15:09:13.082798 IP 0.0.0.0.bootpc &gt; 255.255.255.255.bootps: BOOTP/DHCP, Request from 00:02:2d:74:4a:fa, length: 548
&gt; 15:09:19.895539 IP 169.254.1.31.53127 &gt; 255.255.255.255.2222: UDP, length: 106
</pre>

<p>...and something with <strong>another</strong> IP in the reserved
range (169.254.1.31) answers. Yeah, it's beginning to look like a
seriously misconfigured network.</p>

<pre>
&gt; 15:09:21.896457 IP 0.0.0.0.bootpc &gt; 255.255.255.255.bootps: BOOTP/DHCP, Request from 00:02:2d:74:4a:fa, length: 548
</pre>

<p>These are all replies from your machine - possibly saying "nope, can't
use that IP. How about something else?" - and that request never gets
honored. I'm not certain of this, but it seems likely.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>I want to thank The Answer Gang for this analysis; I'd have spent
weeks looking up all these packets in the RFCs and other specs.</p>

<h3>Zeroconf</h3>

<p>At this point, it appears that the AP I'm trying to use is
misconfigured.  It is using an IP address range that is not supposed
to be used by anyone.  But stop and think; if this configuration is
invalid, how come other people can use the AP without error.  (I even
had a friend try it with his SUSE laptop and: "On that machine, it
just works".)</p>

<p>We need to dig some more.  At this point, I somehow dropped off the
email list for this issue, so I'll pick up the Gang's deliberations in
progress.  Kapil Hari Paranjape thought my tcpdump was capturing a
"zeroconf" session.  Here's his explanation:</p>

<pre> 
   Under "zeroconf" (RFC 3927) two machines can network if they use
   addresses in the range 169.254.0.0/16. So what may be happening here:

   1. The access point tries to communicate with you, using zeroconf.
   2. Provided you establish a zeroconf link, it then requires
   authentication information.
   3. Upon authentication, it provides a "real" DHCP address.

   So, you should allow DHCP to fail and then establish a zeroconf
   address picked "at random". (The zeroconf package in Debian does
   this.)
</pre>

<p>The bit about "authentication" seems to apply to systems that are not
truly open; airports, for example, often require that you pay for
connectivity via a Web page.  So you'd get a temp IP via zeroconf,
then go anywhere with your browser.  This request is redirected to the
"pay first" page.  Once you've paid, you get a "real" IP address and
are on the Net.</p>

<p>At this point, I started looking at Debian support for Zeroconf.  It
turns out that full zeroconf is only in "unstable", and I prefer not
to use that.  Debian stable includes a "zcip" tool which is supposed
to handle exactly this problem, so I installed that.</p>

<p>But to no avail.  I was able to get a bit further, and had a "real" IP
address, but I was not able to get to the outside world.  So close...</p>

<h3>Worldcon</h3>

<p>At this point, the opinion of the Gang was that this was a seriously
broken coffee shop, and that I should take my trade elsewhere.  Also
at this point, I took a vacation to the World Science Fiction
Convention in Anaheim, California.  My first stop was the Salt Lake
City airport, which has an open wifi network.  You are required to pay
for it, but I thought I could at least test the connectivity portion.</p>

<p>And guess what?  "On my machine, it just worked right out of the box."
I hate that answer.</p>

<p>I tried this experiment again with the hotel wifi network, and it just
worked again.</p>

<p>At this point, I realized that my goal was achieved: I could
connect to open wifi AP's.  True, I could not connect to that lone
coffee shop, but that appeared to be their problem.  Or, perhaps just
incomplete zeroconf support in Debian.</p>

<p>I was also able to enlist the help of a local network engineer, who
took his Linux laptop down to the coffee shop.  When he, too, failed
to connect, I felt confident that this was just a problem with the AP.
While it might be educational to keep after that AP until I figure out
what's going on, that was not my original goal.</p>

<h3>The Proof of the Pudding ...</h3>

<p>... is in the tasting.  My friend the network guy recommended another
coffee shop that he used regularly.  And guess what?  It just worked.</p>

<p>So here are the log file captures showing my final result:</p>

<p>From /var/log/daemon.log:</pre>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>Initially, I had been unable to connect to any of several APs that
I had tried.  Then, the one I picked for a concentrated debug session
turned out to be misconfigured.  But I finally got it all working, and
the next time an open AP fails me, I'll know it's not my fault.  More
important, I'll know how to see what's going on, and have a good
chance of fixing it.</p>

<p>But this does illustrate some things that are unique to the Linux
community and Free Software in general.  The most obvious benefit is
the existence of such groups as The Answer Gang.  While there's no
guarantee that anyone will help you with your specific problem, it is
much more likely to happen than with any proprietary product, even if
you pay for a support contract.</p>

<p>The next important difference is how transparent Linux is.  I could
easily trace the kernel activity from the moment I inserted the PCMCIA
card until I had my real IP address.  I also have confidence that this
level of transparency is always available, since I have the source
code to every bit of software involved.  Access to source might not
help a non-programmer, but simply adding some "kprintf" statements to
a driver is really not that hard a task.  That freedom allows me to
add transparency where none may have existed before.</p>

<p>And last, I think you have to recognize how powerful choice is when
debugging.  At each step, I had several choices of tools to use.  When
<code>iwlist</code> wasn't working for me, I could easily swap in Kismet.</p>

<p>I can't thank The Answer Gang enough for their help.  Robert Heinlein
told people to "pay it forward".  So, I hope the next person with this
sort of trouble will find my article and get the help they need.</p>
