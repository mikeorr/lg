<h2>News in General</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Court upholds FOSS licences and community copyrights</h3>

<p>In a decision with major implications for the validity of FOSS and
community software licences, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit upheld that FOSS licences are enforceable under the US
legal system.</p>

<p>The new ruling reverses a lower court ruling that categorized FOSS
licensing as merely a form of contract, without the enforcements
associated with copyright and patent protections.  A case with
copyright infringement allows for statutory damages and stronger
remedies, including the right to nullify the license.  This is a major
legal event.</p>

<p>The case stemmed from the distribution of Java software for Model
Railroad buffs, where a user clearly violated the terms of a community
license.  The original case was called Jacobsen v. Katzer.</p>

<p>From Linux Foundation Legal posting, August 13, 2008 by Andy Updegrove:</p>

<blockquote>
"The underlying facts, and counsel, were hardly major figures on the
commercial landscape: the open source software at issue had been
developed for model train buffs under an infrequently used free and
open source license, and the attorney was young and inexperienced. But
as often happens, a small case between small parties can have huge
implications. And decisions that may make good strategic sense to the
parties can also have disastrous consequences for those that are not
in the same situation."</blockquote>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Intel details Core i7 Architectures, Multi-core "Larrabee"</h3>

<p>At the August Intel Developer Forum (IDF), Senior VP Pat Gelsinger
detailed the roadmap for Intel's next generation chip architecture,
Nehalem.  Intel will also re-brand its future chips as "Core i7", with high
performance chips slated for both the desktop and server arenas.</p>

<p>The Core i7 micro-architecture features better energy efficiency,
refreshed hyper-threading technology delivering up to 8-threaded
performance capability on 4 cores in the initial versions and
best-in-class memory bandwidth thanks to the newQuickPath Interconnect
technology that puts a memory controller in-chip and delivers up to
three times the memory bandwidth of previous generation Core
architecture chips.</p>

<p>The new Intel Xeon processor X7460 with 6 cores and 16MB L3 cache for
servers launching in September has already broken multiple performance
world records. An 8-socket IBM System x 3950 M2 server became the
first platform to break the 1 million tpmC barrier on the TPC-C
benchmark. New 4-Socket performance records include TPC-C on HP
Proliant DL580 G5, TPC-E on Dell PowerEdge R900, SPECjbb2005 on Sun
Fire X4450 and SPEC-int_rate2006 on Fujitsu-Siemens PRIMERGY RX600 S4.</p>

<p>IDF was also a showcase for new 'ultra mobile PCs' (UMPC) that OEM
partners build around the Intel Atom processor, a simplified X86 chip
core that can readily run Linux.  In a central kiosk, 6 of 8 systems
ran Linux and only two ran Windows Mobile.   A mobile Linux pavilion
had mini-booths from Ubuntu (featuring a slimmed down "Remix"
OS), Xandros, and other Linux providers.</p>

<p>The Atom is very power efficient and also is in a 22 mm square package
rather than the more common 35 mm square package, allowing for smaller and
cooler devices.  Intel also showed off new high-end laptops based on a
mobile version of its quad-core chip that draws only 45 watts.</p>

<a href='http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2008/08/20/intel_mobile_idf/'>http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2008/08/20/intel_mobile_idf/</a></p>


<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">AMD: Ready to Compete</h3>

<p>AMD announced plans for its "Shanghai" next-generation
architecture the week before the IDF conference.   This will be based
on 45 nm circuits and will feature 4-, 6-, and 8-core products.
Follow-on plans for 2010 include 12-core processors using DDR3 memory.</p>

<p>AMD executives told the press that many of the features Intel touted
for its new Nehalem architecture have been already incorporated into
AMD chip architectures.  The L3 cache became standard with the AMD
Phenom line late last year and use of on-chip memory caches was part
of the Opteron chip architecture over 3 years back.</p>

<p>Although AMD will be releasing an integrated CPU and GPU part in 2009,
it will not be as integrated as Intel's Larabee, but it will be
based on current working parts - separate CPU and GPU cores - and
should be free of major errata.</p>

<p>AMD did acknowledge missteps with its quad-core products and that it
was a little late getting to 45 nm parts.   However, AMD expects to be
shipping 45 nm parts before the end of 2008, and to transition to all
45 nm parts in 2009.  AMD also expects to be competitive on price and
performance as well as profitable. AMD and IBM have an on-going
partnership to develop manufacturing processes for 22 nm parts, for
products two generations ahead of current technology.  AMD's current 45
nm process was co-developed with IBM.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Progress on DNS Vulnerabilities, IANA test tool shows gaps</h3>

<p>It's been over a month since the industry-wide patching of DNS name servers began
and much progress has been made. The following links show an animation of
patching progress in the first 3 weeks: <br />

<a href='http://www.doxpara.com/?p=1206'>http://www.doxpara.com/?p=1206</a> and 
<a href='http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=clarifiednetworks&feature=iv'>http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=clarifiednetworks&feature=iv</a></p>

<p>The July work-around patches implement a scheme of port randomization to replace
a more limited scheme of ID randomization currently implemented in the DNS
protocol. The ID transaction field was only 16 bits wide, allowing for easier
exploitation, especially with multiple requests allowed from the same client.
The port scheme will now randomize using 27 to 30 bits.</p>

<p>One criteria for patching shows how general the flaw is: if your DNS system
uses recursion, it needs to be patched. If an attack based on the DNS
vulnerability is successful, an attacker could force any user to arbitrary IP
addresses on the Internet.</p>

<p>ICANN has announced a test page, on the IANA site, to test if a domain is
vulnerable to the Kaminsky DNS source port vulnerability. Click here to go to
the test page: <a href='http://recursive.iana.org/'>http://recursive.iana.org/</a>
</p>

<p>IANA also is providing a FAQ on the bug that has a lot of useful information
without digressing into attack details, as so many other writeups do. This FAQ
is focused on explanation and practical advice for IT. There is good advice in
it, such as pointing out that authoritative name servers should never be
configured also to provide recursive name service. This bug is a perfect example
of why. See: <a href='http://www.iana.org/reports/2008/cross-pollination-faq.html'>http://www.iana.org/reports/2008/cross-pollination-faq.html</a></p>

<p>DNSstuff has also posted a vulnerability test on their page of free DNS tools:
<a href='http://member.dnsstuff.com/pages/tools.php?ptype=free'>http://member.dnsstuff.com/pages/tools.php?ptype=free</a></p>

<p>"We tested a number of leading distro domains and major companies in the linux
space. Most, including sourceforge.org, were not vulnerable to the recusive DNS
bug. But there were notable exceptions, including :<br /> <br />

-- opensuse.org and Novell.com -- most name servers vulnerable <br />
-- CMP publications -- name severs are recursive but with source port randomization <br />
-- For eWeek.com -- NS2.TECHDNS.COM is vulnerable but NS1.TECHDNS.COM is not - Go figure."</p>

<p>With the dust hardly clearing on DNS issues, the ICANN Board has declared that
the U.S. government will not yield the control it now has over changes to the
Internet's DNS root zone file.</p>

<p>Kaminsky has been blogging about progress on the vulnerability and the Black Hat
conference. In his August 8th entry he notes:</p>

<blockquote>"New attacks are already popping up, only a few days in. Ben Laurie just came
out with a harrowing and beautiful advisory against some common OpenID
deployments. I knew about the intersection of DNS and OpenID, and I knew about
the intersection of DNS and Debian's badly generated certs (a problem which, I'd
like to point out, is much harder to patch due to our continuing lack of an
effective certificate revocation infrastructure). But it took Ben Laurie to
attack 'Secure' OpenID providers using Debian Certs via DNS. Fantastic,
excellent work."</blockquote>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Mozilla's Firefox Wins the "Who's the Next Open Source Idol" Crown at LinuxWorld</h3>

<p>Mozilla's Firefox was successful in beating out the other three
contestants, reigning champion "Tux" the Linux kernel penguin,
"Beastie" the BSD demon and the GNU "Gnu" to become the world's
favorite Open Source Idol.  GroundWork Open Source
(<a href='http://www.groundworkopensource.com'>http://www.groundworkopensource.com</a>), announced the results at the end of
Linux World.</p>

<p>During the first ever "Who's the Next Open Source Idol?" contest held
at LinuxWorld 2008 last week, Firefox proved he was the only mascot
capable of bringing down the reigning champion - "Tux" the Linux
penguin.  After a three day neck and neck race of crazy dancing, bull
riding, singing, rapping, and polling LinuxWorld attendees, Firefox
left third place "Tux" out in the cold, winning with 48.5 percent of
the final vote.</p>

<p>Poll Results:<br />
Tux the Linux Penguin - 6.6%<br />
The Mozilla Firefox - 48.5%<br />
Beastie the BSD Demon - 31.6%<br />
The GNU Gnu - 2.3%</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Debian "Lenny" Dev Tree Frozen</h3>

<p>The Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 "Lenny" development tree has been frozen and
the focus of the project has turned to bug fixes and infrastructure
updates prior to the final release scheduled for next month.</p>

<p>Here are some of the new features in "Lenny": The next Debian is based
on the 2.6.25 Linux kernel and supports both KDE 3.5.9 and GNOME 2.20
desktops. It doesn't support KDE 4.1 at this time.</p>

<p>"Lenny" includes recent versions of popular end-user software
applications: Firefox 3.0.1, OpenOffice.org 2.4.1, and Evolution
2.22.3.1.  It also includes developer and server programs and libs
such as glibc 2.7 and Samba 3.2. "Lenny" includes full support for the
IPv6 networking protocol and NFSv4 (Network File System). On the
server side, Lenny will have LFS (Large File Support) which allows
applications access to the largest files supported by the operating
system and file system rather than an application-bound file size
limits.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Freespire will go back to Debian</h3>

<p>Xandros has announced the next version of Freespire will be based on
the Debian "Lenny" release, arriving 4th quarter 2008. Xandros says it plans to
consolidate its various offerings on Debian.  Freespire 5 will be followed by 
Xandros Desktop Professional 5, built on the same open source code base with 
additional commercial elements primarily for enterprise customers.</p>

<p>Xandros acquired Linspire last month and Freespire has been the free
version of Linspire, most recently based on Ubuntu.</p>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif"> Scientific Linux Live CD/DVD 5.2 released for i386 and x86_64</h3>

<p>The principal new feature for this release: changes can be stored
persistently on a removable storage device. Together with the ability to
run the LiveCD from a USB stick, this feature allows you to carry around
your own portable Scientific Linux Live System in your pocket.</p>

<p>For more information see <a href='http://linux.web.psi.ch/livecd/save.html'>http://linux.web.psi.ch/livecd/save.html</a>
and <a href='http://linux.web.psi.ch/livecd/usbdisk.html'>http://linux.web.psi.ch/livecd/usbdisk.html</a></p>

<p>The SLL CD/DVD runs Scientific Linux directly from
CD/DVD without installing. It can be downloaded from:<br />

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">gOS 3 Gadgets announced</h3>

<p>gOS, the Linux distribution that shipped with the famous $199 Wal-Mart
gPCs and notebooks announced its latest version, called gOS 3 Gadgets.
Google Gadgets is launched on boot, giving the user direct access to more
than 100,000 iGoogle and Google gadgets. These Google Gadgets are small,
graphically rich applications that can be added directly to the user's
desktop in seconds over the Internet.</p>

<p>gOS 3 Gadgets will also come pre-loaded with WINE 1.0 for Windows
applications compatibility, and with other Google Linux software to give
the user more options. </p>

<p>David Liu, founder and CEO of gOS, says that "With this version of gOS,
we are delivering a Linux that is ready for consumers -- a Linux for the
rest of us!".</p>

2.16.x.</p>

<p>Download the Web Stack at <a href='http://www.sun.com/webstack'>http://www.sun.com/webstack</a>.</p>

<p>"Sun's release of their Web and Proxy server code with a BSD license
is proof of their involvement and commitment to open source," said Jim
Jagielski, co-founder and director of The Apache Software Foundation
and a core developer on several ASF projects, including the Apache
HTTP Server.</p>

<p>Sun will provide product version control for its supported Web Stack
across multiple operating systems so that applications developed for
one operating system can be deployed on another with minimal changes.
Enterprise support is planned to be available for Solaris in CY08Q3,
Linux LAMP support in CY08Q4 with Windows and other OS support to
follow.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">New Javascript Interpreter to be Launched with Firefox 3.1</h3>

<p>Mozilla announced that they are launching TraceMonkey, a JavaScript
engine that is considered to be the evolution of the old SpiderMonkey
JavaScript engine. By using a Just-in-Time compiler, this new JavaScript
engine boosts JS performance by up to 30 times faster, according to
Mozilla's benchmarks.</p>

<p>While still under heavy development, TraceMonkey already supports the
x86, x86-64, and ARM platforms, meaning it is ready for desktop and mobile
use right out of the box.</p>

<p>More details of TraceMonkey (including several benchmarks) can be found here:
