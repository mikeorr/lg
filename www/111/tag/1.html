a) update vs install
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
In part because I tend to omit a couple of releases instead of just
blindly installing successive releases but also because I used to
install new software into a new partition and play with it for a
while before removing the previous version, in the past I have
always done a clean installation.  With all that entailed, creating
the users again, <TT>/etc/hosts*</TT> (SOHO network) and the like.

When you do a new install a distro (albeit a new one, or an upgrade to a
new point release of one you currently have) you can instruct it not to
touch certain partition (like <TT>/home</TT>).  This means you don't <em>  have  </em> to
worry about loss of data.  You mentioned UIDs.  Backup
<TT>/etc/{passwd</TT>,shadow} beforehand.

Recently I experimented with update.  It worked well, avoided lots
of questions and seemed really neat.  But I had again skipped a
couple of releases and ultimately discovered some problems.

I can't see where the contention is.  An upgrade saves a lot of time,
since all you're doing is upgrading the software, nothing more.

I haven't used SuSE much, but that's the general problem you get when
updating through multiple OS releases.  <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> has special scripts
you're supposed to run to switch releases; they try to automate the
tricky stuff but sometimes they can't foresee what your configuration
has turned into.  And they have to be run in order without skipping.  If
you don't update packages frequently and don't follow the user
forums/newsletters where potential breakages are discussed, I would
stick with the clean install and copy your configuration.  That way you
know everything has the latest recommended configuration, whatever that
is.  It also provides a chance to clear out the cruft that has
accumulated from packages you installed but never used; cruft that may
leave droppings in the filesystem when uninstalled since it wasn't built
by a clueful developer.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Alternatively, back up your entire system onto your second drive and
make sure you can boot into it, <EM>then</EM> update your primary system.  That
way if something breaks you can just blow it away and go back to where
you were.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<TT>/home</TT> isn't a big deal.  If you have it on a separate partition like you
do,  just let the fresh install create its own home directory in the
root partition.  You'll have to do everything as root anyway while
you're installing, so just pretend home doesn't exist.  Then when
everything's settled, delete the bogus home and mount your real <TT>/home</TT>
partition.  Same for <TT>/usr/local</TT> if you store stuff in there.  I keep a
<TT>/mnt/data</TT> partition with my home and local stuff, and use symlinks to
get to them.  That also lets me have multiple OS versions installed, all
sharing the same local data.  And I can unmount the local data when I'm
afraid an upgrade might hurt it.

Under the old version the first user ID was 500 and under 9.2 it is
1000.  That of course caused problems in the above environment:
<TT>/dev/hdb</TT> under a completely new installation got new user IDs,
<TT>/dev/hda</TT> under the update inherited the old ones.  It was fun to
re-boot into <TT>/dev/hdb</TT> <EM>after</EM> I wrote to it having booted from

The easiest way is to recreate the users with the same UIDs and GIDs
they previously had.  You may have to run "useradd" manually to do it.
(Or "adduser" on some systems.)  If your UID overlaps with an existing
UID on the new system, you'll have to compromise somehow.  If you give
each user their own group rather than putting them all into "users",
you'll have to create the group first.  On my Gentoo:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>groupadd -g 1001 foo
useradd -u 1001 -g foo -G wheel,floppy,audio,cdrom,dialout,cdrw foo
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
This is the best way if you want to boot back and forth between OS
versions, you have files with unexpected owners inside the home
directories, or you have programs that refer to users by UID rather than
name.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Alternatively, you can just go with the new UIDs and switch the existing
home directories with "chown -R USER.GROUP <TT>/home/USER</TT>".  (Note that
chown is going through a syntax change from "USER.GROUP" to
"USER:GROUP"; you'll have to see which syntax your version supports.)

Being the tool-using critter that I am, things like this (the word
"manually", specifically) bring a shudder to the spine and a script to
mind.

I suppose you could always put in a line that says
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>((uid+=1000))

This presupposes that the users were added with "adduser" to begin with
(note that UIDs from 1000+ are indicative of this).  But on some
systems, UIDs &gt; 499 are used as a valid starting place for normal user
IDs.

I was walking past a haberdashery and happened to see a nice hat in the
window, so I extracted a '1000' from it. };&gt; The number would have to
come from examining the password file on the current system and adapting
the existing number range to what is available - obviously, there's no
single 'right' answer. Sorry I didn't make that more explicit.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Oh, and the '&lt;N&gt;' in the '<TT>/mnt/hda&lt;N&gt;</TT>' isn't the explicit version
either. :)

As you've noted a clean install requires you to set the whole system up again,
whereas a good update should be seamless. Again as you note, there may be
circumstances where the update leaves the seams showing. A clean install will
normally leave you with a nice consistent system, with any cruft that was in
your configuration cleaned out and everything shiny and sparkly.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Obviously, if you're changing distributions, rather than just changing
versions of the same distribution then a clean install is the way to go.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Personally I incline towards doing a clean install every so often. If you're
only taking every 3rd release or so, then a clean install may be worth the
effort, but if you're putting every release on, then I would alternate
upgrades and clean installs, or even keep the clean installs to every 3rd
release.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
In practice, I tend to have a number of old releases lying around in separate
partitions, so I wipe an old partition and install there, then when I'm happy
I've got it set up the way I like it, I copy <TT>/home</TT> across and change my
default boot. This means I also have a number of old copies of my home
directory left lying around.

b) managing <TT>/home</TT> etc.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have read recommendations about distributing the various
directories but assume that they only apply to environments with
different physical drives (load-balancing).  In this specific
installation there is only one hard drive (at a time) involved.
</STRONG></P>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

This "load balancing" concept is a marketing myth, a band-wagon of
terminology that's thrown around the place which people latch on to.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Neil] 
Generally, I think it's about reliability more than load balancing. The point
being that if some eejit fills up one partition, e.g. <TT>/home</TT>, with junk,
there's still space in the other partitions, e.g. <TT>/var</TT> and <TT>/tmp</TT>, for the
system to go on about it's business until the problem is rectified. If it's
all in one big partition the the whole system is likely to fail.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
In practice that's more applicable to big IT departments than simple home
systems. At home I install everything in one big partition. It keeps things
simple and I've had no problems with reliability, but I wouldn't recommend it
for my work systems.

For ease of use, put everything in one partition.  To guard against disk
I/O errors or stupid admins who don't look before they "rm -rf", put
<TT>/boot</TT>, <TT>/home/</TT> and <TT>/usr</TT> on separate partitions, make <TT>/boot</TT> and <TT>/usr</TT>
readonly, and don't mount <TT>/boot</TT> by default.  The reason is that if a
disk sector goes bad, it may take the entire filesystem with it, but it
won't disturb other partitions.  Likewise, users can't mess with stuff
that's mounted readonly.  The down side is managing the partitions and
predicting how big to make them.  If one gets full but another is mostly
empty, you'll have to repartition or use symlinks.

An update doesn't concern itself with changing critical information such
as that -- the only way {U,G}IDs would be affected is if shadow or login
were updated -- and <EM>even</EM> then, the config files are not touched as a
result.

User IDs (UIDs) are created in <TT>/etc/passwd</TT> according to the existing
entries in <TT>/etc/passwd.</TT>  The smallest unused number is assigned, subject
to a minimum and maximum.  Where <TT>/home</TT> is mounted doesn't matter.  <TT>/home</TT>
doesn't have to be mounted at all if you don't use the -m option
(useradd), which creates the home directory.

OK, I've been wanting to do a completely new installation on

after all.

YaST was so unhappy at being told not to format <TT>/</TT> that I backed
up the one non-system-directory on it and let YaST reformat it.
Other than that and my dictating partitioning, a vanilla install,
basically just accepted whatever was suggested.

Of course it would be unhappy about that. <TT>/etc</TT>, <TT>/lib</TT>, <TT>/bin.</TT> <TT>/sbin</TT> -- are
all directories the installer will need access to.  It's highly
unlikely they're as their own partition (you wouldn't need nor want them
to be so they're under "<TT>/</TT>".

I've never seen a Linux installer that sniffled and sulked if it
couldn't format <EM>something</EM>, but I guess there's always a first.
Usually they have options to let you mount a preformatted partition.

What was really neat is that YaST had absolutely no trouble using
a previously available <TT>/home!</TT>  True, I had to re-create the users,
but that is normal and in the process YaST notes the presence of
corresponding home directories and asks whether they are to be used.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
That pretty much solves that problem, for me at least.  The Germans
have a saying, roughly: trying something out is better than studying
it.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
But I'd still appreciate comments.  Is there a gotcha somewhere?
Hmmm, this SOHO doesn't have many users.  And what about all the
settings in <TT>/etc?</TT>  <TT>/boot?</TT>  Like would it have been possible to copy
<TT>/etc/passwd</TT> and <TT>/etc/shadow</TT> from a backup?  Sounds like <EM>that</EM>
particular ice might be getting a bit thin...

	> [Neil] 
Settings in <TT>/etc</TT> and <TT>/boot</TT> are best created from scratch when doing a clean
install IMO, especially when any of them are maintained by automated tools
like YaST. There's always the possibly of significant changes between
versions and just copying back your old settings can be a bit risky, although
9 times out of 10 you won't have a problem.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
All IMO. Unlike many in the gang, I don't sysadmin, so others may have more
authoritative answers. NOTE: We do not guarantee a consensus ;-)

Copying the user entries from <TT>/etc/passwd</TT> is fine, as long as the
numbers don't overlap.  Just make sure nothing else is editing
<TT>/etc/passwd</TT> simultaneously, or use "vipw" to lock it while you're
editing.   <TT>/etc/shadow</TT> is probably fine too, just be aware that the
other distribution may have a different file location and different
syntax.  If it
doesn't recognize the new password, you may have to restart... something.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
(Actually, the UIDs can overlap if you really want two usernames treated
the same.  Some people use this to have a second root login with a
static shell (<TT>/bin/sash</TT>).  This is useful if you hose your dynamic
libraries; with a static shell you can repair the damage.   Just copy
the root line, leave the UID 0, change the username to something else,
and set the password.)
