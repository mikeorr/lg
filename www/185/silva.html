<h1>Back in the Day: Red Hat Linux 3.0.3 - 4.2, 1996-1997</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/silva.html">Anderson Silva</a></b></p>


<p>December 1996, I had just finished my first
semester of college. For Winter break, I decide to go to my uncle&rsquo;s
house in Long Island, NY. My uncle, a PhD student at Stony Brook University,
hands me a brick-like book that comes with a free operating system called Red
Hat Linux, version 3.0.3.</p>


<p><img height="478" src="misc/silva/image07.jpg" width="640"></p>

<p>The original Red Hat Linux 3.0.3 CD that came
with the book my uncle gave me back in 1996.</p>


<p>February 2011, It&rsquo;s a cold Winter day in
North Carolina, and I am sick with the flu. As I lay around the house trying
to find something to do, I run across the one object arguably responsible for
my entire 15 year academic and profession career. The thought crosses my
mind: &ldquo;I wonder if I could get this CD to install on a virtual
machine?&rdquo;</p>


<p>And that is what this nostalgic article is all
about: a trip down memory lane with Linux. First I tried installing Red Hat
Linux 3.0.3 (Picasso), from 1996, which runs on kernel 1.2.13. The boot
process for installation is pretty involved as the CD back on those days was
not bootable. The installation process involves 3 floppy disks, 1 for the
boot image, and 2 ramdisk images. I was able to load all 3 floppy images, but
the kernel died before the installation began.</p>

<p>Red Hat Linux 3.0.3: failing to
install</p>


<p>Unfortunately, I was not able to get version
3.0.3 running on the virtual machine (as you can see above), but I
wasn&rsquo;t ready to give up quite yet. I then decided to go through the
next version I owned, Red Hat Linux 4.0. The results:</p>


<p>Version 4.0 was the first official version of
Red Hat that was bootable via the CD (that I know of). I was able to boot it
up, and even install the OS, but LILO, the bootloader that used to come with
Linux distributions by default before GRUB came around, wouldn't install...
so, yet again, I decided to move on to the next available version.</p>

<p>Red Hat Linux 4.0 (Colgate,1996).</p>

<p><img height="419" src="misc/silva/image03.png" width="737"></p>

<p>Red Hat Linux 4.0: Got stuck here... oh
well.</p>


<p>Finally, success! The next version available
was Red Hat Linux 4.2 (Biltmore, 1997). The installation was pretty
straightforward except for getting X server running. Once I figured out how
to at least get it running in VGA mode and use the correct mouse protocol,
I was able to have some fun with it. Red Hat Linux uses kernel
2.0.30.</p>

<p><img height="480" src="misc/silva/image12.png" width="642"></p>

<p>Red Hat Linux 4.2, Biltmore. The window
manager name was called: <span class="c6"><a href=

FVWM95</a>.</p>


<p><img height="484" src="misc/silva/image01.png" width="647"></p>

<p>Red Hat Linux 4.2: I had to use the
control-panel to start up eth0 using DHCP, but it worked.</p>


<p><img height="483" src="misc/silva/image00.png" width=
"644">Red Hat Linux 4.2: As you can see there wasn&rsquo;t
many applications available out of the box, but it was still more than
Windows 95 had to offer. :-)</p>


<p><img height="481" src="misc/silva/image09.png" width=
"645">Red Hat Linux 4.2: GUI for RPM package management. It
is worth reminding the reader that 1997 precedes online update tools like
up2date, yum and apt-get.</p>

<p>Red Hat Linux 4.2: Installing an
application.</p>


<p><img height="478" src="misc/silva/image11.png" width="639"></p>

<p>Red Hat Linux 4.2: Arena browser with today's
Google loaded! :-) Back in those days, you had to download Netscape on your
own.</p>


<p><img height="484" src="misc/silva/image05.png" width="641"></p>

<p>Red Hat Linux 4.2: I really wanted to surf the
web with something a bit more advanced than the Arena Browser, after some
searching around I found a binary of Netscape 4.08 for 2.0.x Linux kernel.
Now, be aware that Netscape Communicator 4.08 only came out in November 1998,
which means, by them time Netscape 4.08 came out &nbsp;Red Hat Linux 5.2 was
already out. Anyway, I downloaded and installed it on &nbsp;Red Hat Linux 4.2
(May 1997), and to my surprise, it worked! Now, compare the Netscape look to the
Arena Browser (previous screenshot) to have an idea why Netscape became the
powerhouse it became back in those days.</p>

<p>Red Hat Linux 4.2: Today's Google.com through
the eyes of 1998's Netscape Communicator.</p>


<p>That weekend with the flu this past February
ended up being quite fun as I did not stop after installing Red Hat Linux
4.2. I ended up spending all day installing Red Hat Linux 5.0, 6.1, 7.2, 9
and Fedora Core 1, and I hope to share them with you in future issues of the
Linux Gazette.</p>
