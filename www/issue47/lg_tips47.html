<BR>From: Barry &lt;<A HREF="mailto:BarryJJ@IBM.Net">BarryJJ@IBM.Net&gt;</A>

<P> Discussions of private networks typically point the user at the IP address
ranges - such as 192.168... - reserved for private networks.

<P> But they often also show those networks named something like "...MyHome.Net"
Murphy says that any name you pick will eventually be a real domain to which
you want access.

<P> For a private network, you do *not* have to use a ".net", ".com", ".org"
ending.  I've been happily using an adaption of my street address - i.e.,
something like ".MainSt123" - for some time, yielding nodes such as
Hub.MainSt123 = 192.168.0.1 for a (Linux) gateway, and things like
FamilyRoom.MainSt123 for other machines scattered around the house.

<P> I run things such as DNS (early Bind, now Bind8), Apache, Squid, Samba, etc. on
the hub machine and have had no configuration problems from *not* using a
standard, 3-character ending.

<P> And I sleep easy knowing that I'm *not* using something that may also be a
*real* domain name ... at least not in the foreseeable future :-)

<P> That's what I though the first time I used the program wget. If you
don't know why some port is listening and you are a little bit paranoid
and think that's a backdoor, try first this command: 

<PRE>
fuser -vn <udp or tcp> <listening port>
</PRE>

This will display the program that opened that
port, it's PID and the user who executed it. If you are sure that's a
backdoor and want to close it, type this: 

<PRE>
fuser -kn <tcp or udp> <listening port>
</PRE>

This will close this port till the next reboot (unless
the backdoor program is runned by cron). Check your system to eliminate
the backdoor.

<BR>From: marc &lt;<A HREF="mailto:lowkey@innocent.com">lowkey@innocent.com&gt;</A>

<P> I have a firewall, and the logs show when a packet is deined.  Denied
packets from the internet can be a warning sign.  But i became tired of
searching through the logs for this info, and the ips were not
resolved.  So i wrote some scripts that look through a log file, pull
out the DENY lines, resolve the ip addresses and remove any duplicates.

<P> These scripts are perhaps the height of kludgeyness, but they work.  I
know i like to learn from examples, so maybe this can help others.

<P> the script to run is 
<A HREF=misc/tips/show_denied_packets.sh.txt>show_denied_packets.sh</A>

<P> This script filters out any lines dealing with my local LAN, because I
am only looking for packets from the internet.   You may want to set
LOCAL_LAN to the ip address of your local lan, if you have one.

<P> It then calls <A HREF=misc/tips/strip_log.pl.txt>strip_log.pl</A>

<P> This perl script takes the info from the log and prints out just the ip
addresses and ports involved.  This info is then piped into the
logresolve program.

<P> logresolve is a c program that came with my apache, although not
compiled.  i found it in /var/lib/httpd/support/ .  To compile it i ran
<PRE>
gcc -o logresolve logresolve.c
</PRE>
and then moved the logresolve binary into my bin directory. Its path
needs to be set in the show_denied_packets.sh script.

<P> Finally, I was getting many duplicate entries, so i pipe the info to the
unix sort command to sort it all, and the unix uniq command to take out
all the duplicate entries.

<P> And viola!  you now have a list of all the computers that tried to send
you packets that bounced off your firewall.  To keep an eye on this, i
put an entry in my crontab to have this info mailed to me once a week.
The line looks like this:

<PRE>
# once a week check for denied packets
0 2 * * mon /home/marc/bin/show_denied_packets.sh
</PRE>

<P> Using different scripts together is a strength of unix.  Still, this is
a bit kludgy, and if there is any interest, i could whip all this up
into one program.

<P> Hi -

<P> First thing, I'd like to thank you for putting out the LG; it's 
been a mentor/SuperFAQ/"AHA!" generator ever since I first 
installed Linux, over a year ago. <grin> "What a long, strange
trip it's been". Thanks to LG (as well as a myriad other Linux
sources), I'm now very comfortable (not yet a guru, though) with
it, and learning more every day.

<P> Second - a contribution, if you will. Here's one of the shell scripts
that I've written, <A HREF=misc/tips/bkgr.sh.txt>bkgr</A>; it's been a
really nifty gadget for me, selecting random backgrounds for
my X-Windows. I hope other folx here will find it of as much
use.

<P> Drum roll, please... :)


<P> There is lots of configurable stuff in there - graphics prog,
window manager, etc. - but the comments should make it sorta
simple to adapt. *Hint*: the backgrounds for E-term (this is 
where about half of my pics came from) are rather bright and
wonderful... 


<P> Keep up the good work!

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P> Dear Jim

	<P> Your email did help me to solve the problem with the telnet in
	linux. It works fine now. Thanks a million.....

	<P> I have a small doubt. Let me explain......  My network has a NT
	server, LINUX server and 20 windows 95 clients. I followed your
	instructions and added the address of all the clients into the
	/etc/hosts file on the LINUX machine and voila the telnet worked
	immediately.

	<P> But the NT server was the one who was running a DHCP server and
	dynamically allocating the addresses to the clients. The clients
	were configured to use DHCP and were not statically given and ip
	addresses.  I managed to see the current DHCP allocation for each
	client and add those address into the /etc/hosts file on the LINUX
	server but my doubt is what happens when the DHCP address for the
	client changes? Then again we'll have to change the address in
	the /etc/hosts file right? This seems silly.  Is there anyway to
	make the LINUX hosts file to automatically pick up the DHCP
	address from the NT server?
 
	<P> Also another important thing is I am still unable to ping from the
	NT server to the LINUX server using the name. It works only with
	the IP address. Is there any way to make the NT DHCP to recognize
	the LINUX server?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> 	Well, either you shouldn't use dynamic addressing
	(DHCP) or you should use dynamic DNS.  You could
	also disable TCP Wrappers (edit your /etc/inetd.conf
	to change lines like:

<PRE>
telnet	stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd	in.telnetd
</PRE>

	... to look more like:

<PRE>
telnet	stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/in.telnetd in.telnetd
</PRE>

<P> 	(and comment out all of the services you don't
	need while you're at it).

 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P> Thanks Jim for all your help....you've become my LINUX
	guru.............
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> 	Perhaps you should consider getting a support 
	contract (or joining a local users group).  I may
	not always respond as quickly nor as thoroughly
	as you'd like.

	Sir,
	
	Since my previous letter about Dalnet providers trying to connect to my
	Linux box via telnet port 23, I have found out that they are also trying
	port 1080.  I have instigated a policy of dropping all incoming
	connections via a command run by host.deny:
	
	<PRE>
	/sbin/ipfwadm -I -i deny -S %a
	</PRE>
	
	I hate to do this to my niece, but I don't know of any alternative until
	these dalnet jerks stop this intrusive practice.
	
	Anyway, my niece has moved to other irc providers that don't
	do this kind of thing.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Why should I care if Dalnet is trying to connect to ports 23 and 1080? 
I don't run any services on port 1080 and port 23 is closed via
hosts.deny.  I care because WITH JUST ONE dalnet user, I sometimes have
dozens of syslog messages per day.  I have to go through them and decide
if there is a problem.  I have to run whois, nslookup, traceroute, etc.
on them to see if they are bogus.  And many of the dalnet domain and
IP's ARE bogus. 

<P> I could ignore connect attempts to port 23 and miss that one attempt
that really was important.  I could ignore port 1080... I could turn off
my firewall and let everyone in...

<P> Imagine what a workload I would have if I was an sysadm with 20-30
people on dalnet.

<P> It is simpler to just drop all connect attempts and let my niece use
other irc services that aren't abusive.

<P> Hi Jeff,

<P> after you compile the network card driver, you should place it an a
directory where insmod searches for it. I think /lib/modules/x.y.z/net
would be appropriate, where x.y.z is your current kernel version, e.g.
2.2.10 or 2.0.38.

<P> Altarnatively you can set the MODPATH environment variable to point to
the directory where your module is located. See "man insmod".

<BR>From: Roland &lt;<A HREF="mailto:rsmith@xs4all.nl">rsmith@xs4all.nl&gt;</A>

<P> Erik,

<P> I read your question in issue 46 of the Linux Gazette.

<P> To deny remote logins as root, add the following to the
/etc/login.acess file:

<PRE>
-:root:ALL EXCEPT LOCAL
</PRE>

<P> This means you can only login as root from a local console.

<P> But if I where you I would disable telnet entirely and use ssh (secure
shell). You can disable telnet by adding a "#" in front of the "telnet"
line in /etc/inetd.conf.

<P> If you are not running a server, I would disable inetd entirely. To do
this, comment out the lines that start inetd in the start-up scripts.
For Debian this is /etc/init.d/netbase, for Slackware the /etc/rc?.d
scripts ("?" is your runlevel, look at /etc/inittab for the default
runlevel). I don't know about Red Hat, but you can do a 
"grep inetd /etc/init.d/*" to find it there.

   For security reasons, I would like to make it impossible for anyone
   logging in remotely (via telnet etc.) to log in as root, but so far
   haven't been able to figure out how to do that. Any suggestions?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> This is an easy one, at least under Slackware; other distributions may
differ. The file /etc/securetty has the terminals root can use. It looks
something like:
<PRE>
tty1
tty2
tty3
tty4
tty5
tty6
ttyS0
ttyS1
ttyp0
ttyp1
</PRE>

<P> The tty(number) entries are what you use normally with the PC video card and
keyboard. ttyS(number) entries are serial lines, so for example if you connect
to your Linux box via a modem. ttyp(number) entries are "pseudo terminals" which
you get if you come in via telnet. Delete all the ttyp entries and you can't
telnet in as root.

<P> Yours<BR>

adds:</EM></STRONG>
<P> You don't say what sort of login you have in mind: telnet? FTP? SSH?
rlogin?  I'll try to deal with all of those!

<P> (1) Set the file /etc/securetty to contain only the local console
device(s).  This is actually what is done in most or all well known
Linux installations by default.  It will prevent root login on telnet
connections (or dialin lines, or any tty except the ones listed!).

<P> (2) Make sure root is included in the file /etc/ftpusers.  Again this
is done by default on most or all curent Linux distributions.  This
file lists all users who will be denied FTP login (one user per line),
even if they use the "correct" password for that user.

<P> (3) In /etc/ssh/sshd_config (may be /etc/sshd_config on some
distributions), set PermitRootLogin no.  This prevents users logging
in as root using SSH.

<P> (4) Disable rlogin by commenting it out of /etc/inetd.conf, where it
is referred to as the 'login' service -- in other words, put a # sign
before the line that starts with the word login, and then do
kill -HUP `cat /var/run/inetd.pid` to tell inetd of the change.

<P> You will also need to keep current with security updates for your
distribution, avoid running unnecessary services, and generally be
aware of network security issues, if your computer is connected to the
Internet; reading the Linux Security HOWTO and the more comprehensive
"Linux administrator's Security Guide" at

<P> <A HREF=http://www.securityportal.com/lasg/www.securityportal.com/lasg/></A>

<P> is also worthwhile to learn more about keeping your Linux systems
secure.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    You bet there's a solution. It's not perfect (yet) but it works well
   until XFree86 gets a new server out there. The solution is to use the
   Frame Buffer server.  Details are here: www.0wned.org/~cain/ragefury.htm
   Other than that, the only solution available is to purchase a commercial
   X server.  
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> The answer is correct in this that this is a solution but this is not
the only one nor the best.  A few months ago I found myself in a similar
situation installing Linux for somebody with a Gericom (a German
company) laptop.  Looking around on Internet I found fairly quickly
(don't ask me how as I do not remeber that now, but it was fairly easy :-)
the following web page:<BR>
<A HREF=http://www.fachschaften.uni-bielefeld.de/physik/leute/marc/X/>
www.fachschaften.uni-bielefeld.de/physik/leute/marc/X/</A>

<P> Among other things one can find there binaries of an X server supporting
LT PRO which works very well.  The card is similar to other ATI Rage
cards but different enough to require a special treatment.

<P> You may also want to consult 
<A HREF=http://ruff.cs.jmu.edu/~beetle/ragefury.htm>
ruff.cs.jmu.edu/~beetle/ragefury.htm</A>.

<P> I do not know if LT PRO support found its way in the recent XFree86

<P> Rakesh,

<P> First you need to know what authentification method your ISP uses. This
can be PAP or CHAP or just a plain-text password.

<P> Then you need to tell kppp to use that authentification method. I'm not
familiar with kppp, so look at the documentation. :-)

<P> If kppp doesn't have options to configure PAP or CHAP, you'll have to
create a file called /etc/ppp/pap-secrets or /etc/ppp/chap-secrets
yourself.

<P> These files should contain a line in the following format

<PRE>
# client       server      secret      IP addresses
rsmith         *           foobar
</PRE>

<P> First comes your login name, then a *, then your password. Lines
beginning with "#" are comments.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We call that "losing the lottery."  It always seems to
   happen when you're in a hurry to get the system back up and
   running.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Yup.  Note that even once we have journalling support in ext2, you will
want to occasionally force an fsck over the filesystem just to make sure
there haven't been any errors caused by memory errors, disk errors,
cosmic rays, etc.  

<P> If you need your laptop to reboot quickly just before a demo (and your
laptop doesn't have a hiberate feature or some such), something you can
do is to sync your disks, make sure your system is quiscient (i.e.,
nothing is running), and then force a power cycle and let your system
reboot.  Your system will then fsck all of your disks, and you can then
shutdown your system, confident that the dreaded "maximal mount count"
message won't appear during that critical demo.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 	   If you want to live dangerously you can change the
	   the maximal mount count value on a filesystem 
	   using the 'tune2fs' command's -c option.  You can also
	   manually set the mount value using the -C (upper case)
	   option.  You can see the current values using a command
	   like:

<PRE>
tune2fs -l /dev/hda1
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> If you know that your system is fairly reliable --- you've been running
it for a while and you're not seeing wierd failures due to cheasy cheap
memory or overly long IDE or SCSI cables, etc. it's actually not so
dangerous to set a longer maximal count time.   

<P> One approach if your system is constantly getting shutdown and restarted
is to set the filesystem so it uses the time the filesystem was last
checked as a criteria instead of a maximal count.  For example:

<PRE>
tune2fs -c 100 -i 3m /dev/hda1
</PRE>

<P> This will cause the filesystem to be checked after 100 mounts, or 3
months, whichever comes first.

<P> 	   (It should be safe to change some values when you have a
	   filesystem mounted read-only; though it might be worth asking
	   an expert, so I've copied Ted T'so and Remy Card on this
	   message).

<P> Yes, it's safe these values if the filesystem is mounted read-only.  If
you're ***sure*** that the filesystem is quiscent, and nothing is
changing on the filesystem, you can even get away with changing it while
the filesystem is mounted read-write.  It's not something I'd really
recommend, but if you know what you're doing, you can get away from it.
It really depends on how much you working without a safety net.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	As far as I know there is no way in which this 
	   volume label is currently used.  It seems to be a 
	   wholly optional feature; I guess we can use these
	   to keep track of our removable media or something.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> You can use the volume label in your /etc/fstab if you like:  For
example:

<PRE>
LABEL=temp              /tmp                    ext2    defaults        1 2
</PRE>

<P> or

<PRE>
UUID=3a30d6b4-08a5-11d3-91c3-e1fc5550af17  /usr ext2    defaults        1 2
</PRE>

<P> The advantage of doing this is that the filesystems are specified in a
device independent way.  So for example, if your SCSI chain gets
reordered, the filesystems will get mounted corrected even though the
device names may have changed.

<P> 						- Ted

<A HREF="http://www.searchlinux.com">www.searchlinux.com</A> or dejanews
and you'll see how many hate postings there're on Linux newsgroups.

<P> Anyway, there's one way to stop Netscape crashing as often. Do you
download netscape from their ftp server or from your distro? If you
download from netscape, don't use the link from their http pages. They
only have a links to binaries that's linked to libc5 which crashes very
often on my redhat 6.1 box. On their ftp server, there's another
set of binaries linked to glibc2.0 which is much more stable. Try them
out and see which ones are better.

<P> PS. I always turn java off.

Subject: Re: Mounting a zip disk
</PRE>

	<P> Thanks to all those who replied, particulary Derek Clarkson and
	George Georgakis - the answer was in the fine detail. 

	<P> The important points to note that aren't so clear from the HOW-TO:

	<P> 1) Compile in IDE Floppy support in the kernel - there is no need
	for scsi emulation unless you want auto-eject support. Also remember to
	compile in support for the filesystems you wish to have on your zip
	disks.

	<P> 2) Zip drives actually appear to have two mount points depending on
	the history of the zip disk. If the disk has previously been password
	protected by Iomega's zip tools it needs to be mounted at /dev/hdd1 (or
	what ever the /dev/hd location for your system). Whereas if the drive
	was never password protected it gets mounted at /dev/hdd4.  This is
	where I think I got caught.

	<P> 3) vfat is the filesystem type, but msdos and auto will work fine as
	long as you get the mount point right. 

	<P> 4) ext2 (ie Linux) formatted disks mount at /dev/hdd ie without the
	extra number - whether the disk has been password protected before or
	not.

	<P> 5) Formatting a disk from vfat to ext2 and back to vfat does not
	clear the previous password protection stuff - interesting huh!

<BR>From: Edwin Rikken &lt;<A HREF="mailto:Edwin.Rikken@si.han.nl">Edwin.Rikken@si.han.nl&gt;</A>

<P> Hi Dave,

<P> You seem to have installed Linux with your Cd-Rom in working condition
so it must be ok.
Your cdrom has worked in Winxyz, I presume. My advise is first to check
cabeling and jumper setting.
Let's assume you have one hard disk and one cdrom. /dev/hda will be the
device for communicating with your harddisk ( I am leaving out the
numbers to describe which partition, but you get my drift). Now the
question is where did you put your cdrom?

<P> 1 In case of: slave on primary IDE controler: it should be /dev/hdb, if
so did you jumper the cdrom accordingly?.
2 In case of master on secondary IDE : it should be /dev/hdc ( you think
it is ) you should check the jumpersetting. In the sloppy DOS/Win world
it will work fine with good or bad jumpersettings. Not so in Linux. You
must be sure that you jumpered it master. If you did there remains one
thing to do ( it worked fine for me) at boot time, type at the LILO
boot: hdc=cdrom  The kernel will display at boottime: hdc=cdrom?  which
means it will accept your instruction but does not grok the message.
Your cdrom should work after that. This is a so called boot parameter
and can be inserted in de LILO configuration file.
3. In case of slave on 2nd IDE, check jumpersettings. Cdrom should work
in /dev/hdd and you should at boottime instruct the kernel that
hdd=cdrom.

<P> The reason, I think, is that it is logical ( in the Vulcan sense:-) ) to
put the cdrom in the next empty spot: /dev/hdb ( slave on first IDE). It
will probe at boottime the slave on primary IDE and if it detects zilch
it 'knows' there will be no other devices. So no cdrom on master on IDE2
will be detected. There for if you instruct the kernel with: hdc=cdrom
it will respond with, ok I will accept what you said but I think that's
stupid because it's not loggical...:-).

<P> Good luck...

<P> PS. if this does not work you should check your fstab file in /etc
(?)...

<P> groetjes pari@si.han.nl ( Paul).
