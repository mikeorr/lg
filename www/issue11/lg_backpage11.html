<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Larry Ayers</H4>
Larry Ayers lives on a small farm
in northern Missouri, where he is currently engaged in building a
timber-frame house for his family. He operates a portable band-saw mill,
does general woodworking, plays the fiddle and searches for rare
prairie plants, as well as growing shiitake mushrooms. He is also
struggling with configuring a Usenet news server for his local ISP.

<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Earl Brown</a></H4>
Earl Brown has been involved in the Internet for 4 or 5 years, and got into
Unix when he realized that Unix helped start the Internet and
that it is the future of the Internet, as well. He loves LINUX as an
operating system, because &quot;The fact that it's free doesn't hurt, but the
important thing is that I think it's the best OS out there.&quot;  He is a
computer programmer, an Internet specialist. He has fantasies/dreams
about becoming a writer and a college teacher. For more of his work, see 
http://www.lvinet.com/~gleep/CompKnow/CompIdx.htm. His personal web page
can be found at http://www.enol.com/~gleep/.

<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">John M. Fisk</H4>
John Fisk is most noteworthy as the former editor of the <I>Linux Gazette</I>.
After three years as a General Surgery resident and
Research Fellow at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center,
John decided to &quot;hang up the stethoscope&quot;, and pursue a
career in Medical Information Management. He's currently a full
time student at the Middle Tennessee State University and hopes
to complete a graduate degree in Computer Science before
entering a Medical Informatics Fellowship. In his dwindling
free time he and his wife Faith enjoy hiking and camping in
Tennessee's beautiful Great Smoky Mountains. He has been an avid Linux fan,
since his first Slackware 2.0.0 installation a year and a half
ago.

pages at http://www.csn.net/~mjhammel. You'll find out more
there than you really wanted to know. 

<P>

Thanks to all our authors, not just the ones above, but also those who wrote
giving us their tips and tricks and making suggestions. Thanks also to our
new mirror sites. 
<P> 
Since I've chosen to celebrate Halloween in this issue, I'll include 
a few Halloween and weird links in hopes that they will not disappear on November 1. <BR> 
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT ALT="" SRC="./gx/penguin.gif">
<ul>
<li><A HREF="http://www.cascade.net/yaboo.html">YABOO</A> A YAHOO parody
page with only Halloween links. Some neat links to Halloween history, ghost
stories, etc.
<li><A HREF="http://www.chaco.com/~glenn/jack/">Virtual Jack-0-Lantern</A>
Have fun creating your own virtual jack-o-lantern. Includes a Haunted
Pumpkin Patch for those with Netscape 3.0.
<li><A HREF="http://www.kahunanui.com/hellhaven.html">Virtual Haunted House</A>
Looked interesting, but not open until October 31. Check it out.
<li><A HREF="http://www.best.com/~4forry/">Forest J. Ackerman</A> of
monster and "Sci Fi" movies has a very weird site indeed.
<li><A HREF="http://www.drmoreau.com/">The Island of Dr. Moreau</A> movie
site.
<li><A HREF="http://www.dash.com/netro/fun/hol/hlw.html">Halloween Mystery</A>
Billed as an interactive MUD-like page, this turned out to be a
game that you play following text instructions and story-line to solve a 
mystery.
<li><A HREF="http://www.discworld.imaginary.com:5678/">Discworld</A> is
not exactly Halloween, but is definitely weird and fun. Another MUD game
based on Terry Pratchett's fantasy novels. 
</ul>

If you would like some personal information about me, clicking on my
