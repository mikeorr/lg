Mounting Disks Under Red Hat 4.0
</h3>
<P> <B> 
From: Bigby, Bruce W. <a href="mailto:bbigby@frontiernet.net">bbigby@frontiernet.net</a>

<p>Hi.  The RedHat 4.0 control-panel has an interesting problem.  I have
two entries in my /etc/fstab file for my SCSI Zip Drive--one for
mounting a Win95 Zip removable disk and another for mounting a removable
Linux ext2fs disk--

<pre>/dev/sda4 /mnt/zip   ext2fs rw,noauto 0 0
/dev/sda4 /mnt/zip95 vfat   rw,noauto 0 0</pre>

I do this so that I can easily mount a removable zip disk by supplying
only the appropriate mount point to the mount command--for example, by
supplying

<pre>mount /mnt/zip</pre>

when I want to mount a Linux ext2fs disk, and

<pre>mount /mnt/zip95</pre>

when I want to mount a Windows 95 Zip disk.

</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	Yes, 

	I do this all the time (except that I use the command
	line for all of this -- and vi to edit my fstab).  I also
	add the "user" and a bunch of "nosuid,nodev,..." parameters
	to my options field.  This allows me or my wife (the only 
	two users with console access to the machine) to mount a
	new magneto optical, floppy, or CD without having to 
	'su').
<P><B>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
Unfortunately, the control-panel's mount utility treats the two lines as
duplicates and removes the additional lines that begin with /dev/sda4. 
Consequently, the control panel's mount utility only sees the first
line,
 
<pre>/dev/sda4 /mnt/zip   ext2fs rw,noauto 0 0</pre>

In addition, the utility also modifies my original /etc/fstab.  I do not

desire this behavior.  I prefer that the utility be fairly dumb and not
modify my original /etc/fstab.  Has RedHat fixed this problem in 4.2? 


</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	I don't know.  There are certainly enough other fixes and
	upgrades to be worth installing it (although -- with a .1 
	version coming out every other month -- maybe you want to 
	just download selective fixes and wait for the big 5.0).

<p>	(My current guess -- totally unsubstantiated by even 
	an inside rumor -- is that they'll shoot for integrating
	glibc -- the GNU C library -- into their next release.
	That would be a big enough job to warrant a jump in 
	release numbers).
<P><B>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">

Can I obtain the sources and modify the control-panel's mount utility so
that it does not remove, "so-called," duplicates?


</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	Last I heard the control-panel was all written in Python
	(I think they converted all the TCL to Python by 4.0)
	In any event I pretty sure that it's TCL, Python and Tk
	(with maybe some bash for some parts).  So you already have
	the sources.


<p>	The really important question here is why you aren't asking
	the support team at RedHat (or at least posting to their
	"bugs@" address).  This 'control-panel' is certainly 
	specific to Red Hat's package.

<p>According to the bash man page, bash is supposed to source the .profile,
or .profile_bash, in my home directory.  However, when I login, bash
does not source my .profile.  How can I ensure that bash sources the
.profile of my login account--$HOME/.profile?


</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">


	The man page and the particular configuration (compilation)
	options in your binary might not match.

<p>	You might have an (empty?) ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login
	(the man page looks for these in that order -- with .profile
	being the last -- and only it sources the first of them that 
	it finds).

<p>	You might have something weird in your /etc/profile or
	/etc/bashrc that's preventing your ~/.bash_* or ~/.profile
	from being sourced.

<p>	Finally you might want to double check that you really are 
	running bash as your login shell.  There could be all sorts
	of weird bugs in your configuration that effectively start
	bash and fail to signal to it that this is a "login" shell.

<p>	Normally login exec()'s bash with an "ARG[0]" of "-bash"
	(preceding the name with a dash).  I won't get into the 
	gory details -- but if you were logging in with something that
	failed to do this: bash wouldn't "know" that it was a login
	shell -- and would behave as though it were a "secondary"
	shell (like you invoked it from your editor)).

<p>	If all else fails go over to prep.ai.mit.edu and grab the
	latest version of the GNU bash sources.  Compile them
	yourself.

Weird LILO Problem
</h3>
<P> <B>

<p>Hi Jim. I read your column in the Linux Gazette and I have a question. (If I
should have submitted it some other way I apologize.)
</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

<p><b>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
I've been using Linux casually for the last couple of years and several
months ago I installed RedHat 4.0 on the second IDE drive of a Win95
system. Though I've used System Commander in the past I don't like
using it with Win95 so I had the RedHat install process create a boot
floppy. This has always worked fine, and I made a second backup floppy
using dd) which I also made sure booted fine.


</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	This probably isn't really a "boot" floppy.  It sounds 
	like a "lilo" floppy to me.  The difference is that a 
	boot floppy has a kernel on it -- a "lilo" floppy just has
	the loader on it.

<p>	The confusing thing about Linux is that it can be 
	booted in so many ways.  In a "normal" configuration
	you have Lilo as the master boot program (on the first
	hard drive -- in the first sector of track 0 -- with
	the partition table).  Another common configuration places
	lilo in the "superblock" (logical boot record) of the 
	Linux "root" partition (allowing the DOS boot block,
	or the OS/2 or NT boot manager -- or some third party
	package like System Commander) to process the partition
	table and select the "active" partition -- which *might*
	be the Linux root partition.

<p>	Less common ways of loading Linux:  use LOADLIN.EXE
	(or SYSLINUX.EXE) -- which are DOS programs that can 
	load a Linux kernel (kicking DOS out from under them
	so to speak), put Lilo on a floppy (which is otherwise
	blank) -- or on a none Linux boot block (which sounds
	like your situation).

<p>	Two others:  You can put Lilo on a floppy *with* a 
	Linux kernel -- or you can even write a Linux kernel
	to a floppy with no lilo.  That last option is rarely
	used.

<p>	The point of confusion is this:  LILO loads the Linux
	kernel using BIOS calls.  It offers one the opportunity
	to pass parameters to the kernel (compiled into it's 
	boot image via the "append" directive in /etc/lilo.conf --
	or entered manually at boot time at the lilo prompt).

<p>	Another source of confusion is the concept that LILO 
	is a block of code and data that's written to a point
	that's outside the filesystems on a drive -- /sbin/lilo
	is a program that writes this block of boot code according
	to a set of directives in the /etc/lilo.conf.  It's best
	to think of the program /sbin/lilo as a "compiler" that
	"compiles" a set of boot images according to the
	lilo.conf and writes them to some place outside of your
	filesystem.

<p>	Yet another source of confusion is that the Linux
	kernel has a number of default parameters compiled into
	it.  These can be changed using the 'rdev' command
	(which was originally used to set the "root device"
	flags in a kernel image file).  'rdev' basically 
	patches values into a file.  It can be be used to set
	the "root device," the "initial video mode" and a 
	number of other things.  Some of these settings can
	be over-ridden via the LILO prompt and append lines.
	LOADLIN.EXE can also pass parameters to the kernel that
	it loads.

<p>	There's a big difference between using a kernel image written
	directly on a floppy -- and a LILO that's built to load an 
	image that's located on a floppy filesystem (probably minix 
	or ext2fs).  With LILO the kernel must be located on some
	device that is accessible with straight BIOS calls.  

<p>	This usually prevents one from using LILO to boot off of a 
	third IDE or SCSI disk drive (since most systems require a 
	software driver to allow DOS or other OS' to "see" these 
	devices).  I say "usually" because there are some BIOS' and
	especially some BIOS extensions on some SCSI and EIDE 
	controllers that may allow LILO to access devices other than
	the first two floppies and the first two hard drives.  However,
	those are rare.  Most PC hardware can only "see" two floppy
	drives and two hard drives -- which must be on the same 
	controller -- until an OS loads some sort of drivers.

<p>	In the case where a kernel is directly located on the 
	raw floppy -- and in the case where the kernel is 
	located on the floppy with LILO -- the kernel has the 
	driver code for your root device (and controllers) built
	in.  (There are also complex new options using 'initrd'
	-- an "initial RAM disk" which allows a modular kernel
	to load the drivers for it's root devices.

<p>	Yet another thing that's confusing to the DOS user -- and 
	most transplants from other forms of Unix -- is that the 
	kernel doesn't have to be located on the root device.  In 
	fact LOADLIN.EXE requires that the kernel be located on 
	a DOS filesystem.

<p>	To make matters more complicated you can have multiple
	kernels on any filesystem, any of them might use any
	filesystem as their root device and these relationships
	(between kernel and root device/filesystem can be set
	in several ways -- i.e. by 'rdev' or at compile time,
	vs. via the LOADLIN or LILO command lines).

<p>	I recommend that serious Linux users reserve a small
	(20 or 30 Mb) partition with just a minimal installation
	of the root/base Linux software on it.  This should be
	on a separate device from your main Linux filesystems.

<p>	Using this you have an alternative (hard drive based)
	boot method which is much faster and more convenient than
	digging out the installation boot/root floppies (or having 
	to go to a working machine and build a new set!).   I recommend
	the same thing for most Solaris and FreeBSD installations.
	If you have a DOS filesystem on the box -- at least stash a 
	copy of LOADLIN.EXE and a few copies of your favorite kernels
	in C:\LINUX\ (or wherever).

<p> 	Now that more PC SCSI cards support booting off of CD-ROM's
	(a feature that's been long overdue!) you can get by 
	without heeding my advice -- IF YOU HAVE SUCH A CONTROLLER
	AND A CD TO MATCH. 

<p>		(Incidentally -- I found out quite by 
		accident that the Red Hat 4.1 CD is "bootable"
		on Adaptec 2940 controllers -- if you have the
		Adaptec configured to allow it.  I've also heard
		that the NCR SymBIOS PCI controller supports this
		-- though I haven't tested that yet).

<p>	In any event we should all make "rescue disks" -- 
	unfortunately these are trickier than they should be.
	Look for the Bootdisk HOWTO for real details about this.

<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">

About a week ago I put the Linux floppy in the diskette drive, reset
the machine and waited for the LILO prompt. Everything went fine, but
all I got were the letters LI and everything stopped. I have tried
several times, using the original and the backup diskette, with the
same results.


</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	Did you add a new drive to the system?

<p><b>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">

I have done nothing (that I can think of!) to my machine and I'm at a
loss as to what might be causing this. Just to ensure that the floppy
drive wasn't acting funny, I've booted DOS from it and that went fine.


</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	When you booted DOS where you able to see the drive?

	I'd get out your installation floppy (or floppies --
	I don't remember whether Red Hat 4.0 had a single
	floppy system or not -- 4.1 and 4.2 only require one
	for most hardware).  Boot from that and choose "rescue"
	or switch out of the installation script to a shell
	prompt.  You should then be able to attempt mounting
	your root filesystem.

<p>	If that fails you can try to 'fsck' it.  After that
	it's probably a matter of reinstallation and restoring
	from backups.

Running FileRunner
</h3>
<P> <B> 

David E. Stern <a href="mailto:kotsya@u.washington.edu">kotsya@u.washington.edu</a> 

I wanted to let you know that you were right about relying too heavily
on rpm.  In the distant past, I used file text-based file compression
utilities, so I tried it again and tarballs are actually quite nice.  I
also found that rpm --nodeps will help.  Tarballs are also nice because
not all apps are distributed with rpm. (bonus! :-)  I'm also told that
multiple versions of tcl/tlk can peacably coexist, although rpm won't
allow it by default.  Another ploy with rpm which I didn't see
documented was that to avoid circular dependencies, update multiple rpms
at the same time; i.e.: rpm -Uvh app1.rpm app2.rpm app3.rpm .  Another
thing I learned about was that there are some non-standard (contributed)
libraries that are required for certain apps, like afio and xpm.  Thanks
for the great ideas and encouragement.
  
<p>The end goal: to install FileRunner, I simply MUST have it! 
My intermediate goal is to install Tcl/Tk 7.6/4.2, because FileRunner
needs these to install, and I only have 7.5/4.1 . However, when I try to
upgrade tcl/tlk, other apps rely on older tcl/tk libraries, at least that's
what the messages allude to:
 
<pre>libtcl7.5.so is needed by some-app
libtk4.1.so is needed by some-app</pre>
 
<p>(where some-app is python, expect, blt, ical, tclx, tix, tk, tkstep,...)
 
<p>I have enough experience to know that apps may break if I upgrade the
libraries they depend on. I've tried updating some of those other apps,
but I run into further and circular dependencies--like a cat chasing it's
tail. 
 
<p>In your opinion, what is the preferred method of handling this scenario?
I must have FileRunner, but not at the expense of other apps.

</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	It sounds like you're relying too heavily on RPM's.
 	If you can't afford to risk breaking your current stuff,
 	and you "must" have the upgrade you'll have to do some
 	stuff beyond what the RPM system seems to do.
 
 <p>	One method would be to grab the sources (SRPM or tarball)
 	and manually compile the new TCL and tk into /usr/local
 	(possibly with some changes to their library default 
 	paths, etc).  Now you'll probably need to grab the 
 	FileRunner sources and compile that to force it to use the
 	/usr/local/wish or /usr/local/tclsh (which, in turn, will
 	use the /usr/local/lib/tk if you've compiled it all right).
 
 <p>	Another approach is to set up a separate environment 
 	(separate disk, a large subtree of an existing disk
 	-- into which you chroot, or a separate system entirely)
 	and test the upgrade path where it won't inconvenience you
 	by failing.  A similar approach is to do a backup, test your
 	upgrade plan -- (if the upgrade fails, restore the backup).

Thanks, -david

</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
 
 	You're welcome.
 	This is a big problem in all computing environments (and
 	far worse in DOS, Windows, and NT systems than in most 
 	multi-user operating systems.  At least with Unix you have
 	the option of installing a "playpen" (accessing it with the
 	chroot call -- or by completely rebooting on another partition
 	if you like).  
 
 <p>	Complex interdepencies are unavoidable unless you require that
 	every application be statically linked and completely self-sufficient
 	(without even allowing their configuration files to be separate.
 	So this will remain an aspect of system administration where
 	experience and creativity are called for (and a good backup
 	may be the only thing between you and major inconvenience).

Adding Linux t a DEC XLT-366

From: Alex Pikus <a href="mailto:alex@webexpress.net">alex@webexpress.net</a>

<p>I have a DEC XLT-366 with NTS4.0 and I would like to add Linux to it.  I
have been running Linux on an i386 for a while.

<p>I have created 3 floppies:
<ul>
<li>Linload.exe and MILO (from DEC site)
<li>Linux kernel 2.0.25
<li>RAM disk
</ul>
<p>I have upgrade AlphaBIOS to v5.24 (latest from DEC) and added a Linux
boot option that points to a:\

<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	You have me at a severe disadvantage.   I've never
	run Linux on an Alpha.

	So I'll have to try answering this blind.
<P><B> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
When I load MILO I get the "MILO>" prompt without any problem.  When I
do <pre>show</pre> or <pre>boot ...</pre> at the MILO I get the following result ...

</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	My first instinct is the ask if the autoprobe code in
	Linux (Alpha) is broken.  Can you use a set of command-line
	(MILO) parameters to tell pass information about your 
	SCSI controller to your kernel?  You could also see about
	getting someone else with an Alpha based system to compile
	a kernel for you -- and make sure that it has values in 
	it's scsi.h file that are appropriate to your system -- as
	well as insuring that the corrective drivers are built in.

How can make further progress here?

	It's a tough question.  Another thing I'd look at 
	is to see if the Alpha system allows booting from a
	CD-ROM.  Then I'd check out Red Hat's (or Craftworks')
	Linux for Alpha CD's -- asking each of them if they 
	support this sort of boot.

<p>	(I happened to discover that the Red Hat Linux 4.1 (Intel)
	CD-ROM was bootable when I was working with one system that 
	had an Adaptec 2940 controller where that was set as an 
	option.  This feature is also quite common on other Unix
	platforms such as SPARC and PA-RISC systems -- so it is 
	a rather late addition to the PC world).

Disk Support

<p>Dear Sir,
 
I have a question to ask:	
Does Linux support disks with density
2048bytes/sector?


</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	Apparently not.

	This is a common size for CD-ROM's -- but it not
	at all normal for any other media.
<P><B>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
I have bought a Fujitsu MO drive which support up to 640MB MO disks with
density 2048bytes/sector. The Slackware Linux system does not support
access to disks with this density. Windows 95 and NT support this density
and work very well. Is there any version of Linux which support
2048bytes/sector? If not, is there any project working on that?


</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	
	I believe the drive ships with drivers for DOS, Windows,
	Windows '95 and NT.  The OS' don't "support it"  the manufacturer
	supports these OS'.  

<p>	Linux, other the other hand, does support most hardware 
	(without drivers being supplied by the hardware manufacturers).
	Granted we get some co-operation from many manufacturers.  
	Some even contribute code to the main kernel development.

<p>	We prefer the model where the hardware manufacturer releases
	free code to drive their hardware -- whether that code is 
	written for Linux, FreeBSD or any other OS.  Release it once
	and all OS' can port and benefit by it.

<P><B>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
I hear a lot of praise about Linux. Is Linux superior to Windows NT in all
aspect?


</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	That's controversial question.  Any statement like:

		Is "foo" superior to "bar" in all aspects?

	... is bound to cause endless (and probably acrimonious)
	debate.

<p>	Currently NT has a couple of advantages:  Microsoft is a 
	large company with lots of money to spend on marketing and
	packaging.  They are very aggressive in making "partnerships"
	and building "strategic relationships" with the management of
	large companies.  

<p>	Microsoft has slowly risen to dominance in the core applications 
	markets (word processors, spreadsheets, and databases).  Many 
	industry "insiders" (myself included) view this as being the
	result of "trust"-worthy business practices (a.k.a. "verging
	on monopolistic").  

<p>	In other words may people believe that MS Word isn't the
	dominant word processor because it is technically the superior
	product -- but because MS was able to supply the OS features
	they needed when they wanted (and perhaps able to slip the
	schedules of certain releases during the critical development
	phases of their competitors).  

<p>	The fact that the OS, and the principal programming tools, 
	and the major applications are all from the same source has
	generated a amazing amount of market antagonism towards 
	Microsoft.  (Personally I think it's a bit extreme -- but
	I can understand how many people feel "trapped" and understand
	the frustration of thinking that there's "no choice").

<p>	Linux doesn't have a single dominant applications suite.
	There are several packages out there -- Applixware, StarOffice,
	Caldera's Internet Office Suite.  Hopefully Corel's Java Office
	will also be a useful to Linux, FreeBSD and other users
	(including Windows and NT).

<p>	In addition to these "suites" there are also several individual
	applications like Wingz (a spreadsheet system), Mathematica,
	(the premier symbolic mathematics package), LyX (the free word
	processor -- LaTeX front-end -- that's under development),
	Empress, /rdb (database systems), Flagship and dbMan IV
	(xBase database development packages), Postgres '95, mSQL,
	InfoFlex, Just Logic's SQL, MySQL (database servers) and a 
	many more.  (Browse through the Linux Journal _Buyer's_Guide_
	for a large list -- also waltz around the web a bit).

<p>	Microsoft's SQL Server for NT is getting to be pretty good.
	Also, there are alot of people who program for it -- more 
	than you'll find for InfoFlex, Postgres '95 etc.  A major
	problem with SQL is that the servers are all different enough
	to call for significant differences in the front end applications
	-- which translates to lots of programmer time (and money!)  if 
	you switch from one to another.  MS has been very successful
	getting companies to adopt NT Servers for their "small" SQL projects
	(which has been hurting the big three -- Oracle, Sybase and 
	Informix).  Unfortunately for Linux -- database programmers and
	administrators are very conservative -- they are a "hard sell."

<p>	So Linux -- despite the excellent stability and performance --
	is not likely to make a significant impact as a database server
	for a couple of years at least.  Oracle, Sybase and Informix
	have "strategic relationships" with SCO, Sun, and other Unix
	companies.  

<p>	The established Unix companies viewed Linux as a threat until
	recently. They now seem to see it as a mixed blessing.  On the 
	up side Linux has just about doubled the number of systems
	running Unix-like OS', attracted somewhere between two and
	eight million new converts away from the "Wintel" paradigm,
	and even wedged a little bit of "choice" into the minds of 
	the industry media.  On the down side SCO can no longer charge
	thousands of dollars for the low end of their systems.  This 
	doesn't really affect Sun, DEC, and HP so much -- since they are
	primarily hardware vendors who only got into the OS business to 
	keep their iron moving out the door.  SCO and BSDI have the 
	tough fight since the bulk of their business is OS sales.

<p>	(Note: BSDI is *not* to be confused with the FreeBSD, NetBSD,
	OpenBSD, or 386BSD (Jolix) packages.  They are a company that
	produces a commercial Unix, BSDI/OS.  The whole Free|Net|Open-BSD
	set of programming projects evolved out of the work of 
	Mr. and Mrs. Jolitz -- which was called 386BSD -- and I call
	"Jolix" -- a name with I also spotted in the _Using_C-Kermit_
	book from Digital Press).

<p>	So there don't seem to be any Oracle, SyBase, or Informix 
	servers available for Linux.  The small guys like JustLogic
	and InfoFlex have an opportunity here -- but it's a small
	crack in a heavy door and some of them are likely to get their
	toes broken in the process.

<p>	Meanwhile NT will keep getting market share -- because their
	entry level still a tiny fraction of the price of any of the
	"big guys."

<p>	I've just barely scratched the tip of the iceberg (to thoroughly
	blend those metaphors).  There are so many other aspects of
	comparison it's hard to even list them -- let alone talk about
	who Linux and NT measure up to them.

<p>	It's also important to realize that it's not just NT vs.
	Linux.  There are many forms of Unix -- most of them are 
	quite similar to Linux from a user and even from an 
	administrators point of view.  There are many operating systems
	that are vastly different than either NT (which is supposed to
	be fundamentally based on VMS) and the various Unix variants.

<p>	There are things like Sprite (a Berkeley research project),
	Amoeba and Chorus (distributed network operating systems),
	EROS, and many others.

MetroX Problems

<P> <B> 


From: Allen Atamer <a href="mailto:atamer@ecf.toronto.edu">atamer@ecf.toronto.edu</a>


<p>I am having trouble setting up my XServer.  Whether or not I use MetroX
or Xfree86 to set it up it's still not working.

<p>When I originally chose metrox to install, i got to the setup screen,
chose my card and resolution, saved and exited.  Then i started up the
xwindows, and my screen loaded the Xserver, but the graphics were all
messed up.  I exited, then changed some settings, and now i can't even
load the xserver.  The Xerrors file says it had problems loading the
'core'.

</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	Hmm.  You don't mention what sort of video card you're using
	or what was "messed up."  As I've said many times in my 
	column -- I'm not must of an "Xpert" (or much of a "TeXpert"
	for that matter).

<p>	MetroX and XFree86 each have their own support pages
	on the web -- and there are several X specific newsgroups
	where you'd find people who are much better with X than I.

<p>	Before you go there to post I'd suggest that you type up
	the type of video card and monitor you have in excruciating
	detail -- and make sure you go through the X HOWTO's and
	the Red Hat manual.  Also be sure to check the errata 
	page at Red Hat (http://www.redhat.com/errata.html) --
	this will let you know about any problems that were discovered
	after the release of 4.1.

<p>	One other thing you might try is getting the new version
	(4.2 -- Biltmore) -- and check it's errata sheet.  You can 
	buy a new set of CD's (http://www.cheapbytes.com is one
	inexpensive source) or you can use up a bunch of bandwidth
	by downloading it all.  The middle road is to to download
	just the parts you need.

<p>	I notice (looking at the errata sheets as I type this)
	that XFree86 is up to version 3.3.1 (at least).  This upgrade
	is apparently primarily to fix some buffer overflow (security)
	problems in the X libraries.

By the way, how do I mount what's on the second cd and read it?
(vanderbilt 4.1)


</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	First umount the first CD with a command like:

		umount /cdrom
	
	Remove it. 
	Then 'mount' the other one with a command like:

		mount -t iso9660 -o ro /cdrom /dev/scd0

	... where /cdrom is some (arbitrary but extent) mount point
	and /dev/scd0 is the device node that points to your CD drive
	(that would be the first SCSI CD-ROM on your system -- 
	IDE and various other CD's have different device names).

<p>	To find out the device name for your CD use the mount command
	BEFORE you unmount the other CD.  It will show each mounted
	device and the current mount point.

<p>	Personally I use /mnt/cd as my mount point for most CD's.

	I recommend adding an entry to your /etc/fstab file 
	(the "filesystems table" for Unix/Linux) that looks something 
	like this:
<pre>
# /etc/fstab
/dev/scd0      /mnt/cd            iso9660 noauto,ro,user,nodev,nosuid 0 0
</pre>
<p>	This will allow you to use the mount and umount commands
	as a normal user (without the need to su to 'root').

<p>	I also recommend changing the permissions of the mount
	command to something like:

<pre>-rwsr-x---   1 root     console		26116 Jun  3  1996 /bin/mount
</pre>
	(chgrp console `which mount && chmod 4550 `which mount`)

<p>	... so that only members of the group "console" can use the 
	mount command.  Then add your normal user account to that 
	group.

<p>	The idea of all this is to strike a balance between the 
	convenience and reduced "fumblefingers" exposure of running
	the privileged command as a normal user -- and the potential
	for (as yet undiscovered buffer overflows) to compromise the 
	system by "guest" users.

<p>	(I recommend similar procedures for ALL SUID binaries -- but 
	this is an advanced issue that goes *WAY* beyond the scope of
	this question).

<p>	Allen,

	You really need to get a copy of the "Getting Started"
	guide from the Linux Documentation Project.  This can be 
	downloaded and printed (there's probably a copy on your
	CD's) or you can buy the professionally bound editions from
	any of several publishers -- my favorite being O'Reilly &
	Associates (http://www.ora.com).  

<p>	Remember that the Linux Gazette "Answer Guy" is no 
	substitute for reading the manuals and participating in 
	Linux newsgroups and mailing lists.

Installing Linux
</h3>
<P> <B> 

From: Aryeh Goretsky <a href="mailto:aryeh@tribal.com">aryeh@tribal.com</a><br>

</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

[ Aryeh, I'm copying my Linux Gazette editor on this since I've put in 
  enough explanation to be worth publishing it ]
<P><B>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
.....  why ... don't they just call
it a disk boot sector .  ....

Okay, I've just got to figure out what the problem is, then.  Are
there any utilities like NDD for Linux I can run that will point 
out any errors I made when entering the superblock info?


</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	
	Nothing with a simple, colorful interface.  'fsck' is
	at least as good with ext2 filesystems as NDD is with
	FAT (MS-DOS) partitions.  However 'fsck' (or, more specifically,
	e2fsck) has a major advantage since the ext2fs was designed
	to be robust.  The FAT filesystem was designed to be simple
	enough that the driver code and the rest of the OS could fit
	on a 48K (yes, forty-eight kilobytes) PC (not XT, not AT, and
	not even close to a 386).  So, I'm not knocking NDD when I 
	say that fsck works "at least" as well.

<p>	However, fsck doesn't touch your MBR -- it will
	check your superblock and recommand a command to restore
	the superblock from one of the backups if yours is damaged.
	Normally the newfs (like MS-DOS' FORMAT) or mke2fs
	(basically the same thing) will scatter extra copies of the
	superblock every 8K sectors across the filesystem (or so).
	So there are usually plenty of backups.
	
<p>	So, usually, you'd just run fdisk to check your 
	partitions and /sbin/lilo to write a new MBR (or other
	boot sector).  /sbin/lilo will also update its own 
	"map" file -- and may (optionally) make a backup of 
	your original boot sector or MBR.

<p>		(Note:  There was an amusing incident on
		one of the mailing lists or newsgroups -- in which
		a user complained that Red Hat had "infected his
		system with a virus."  It turns out that lilo had moved 
		the existing (PC/MBR) virus from his MBR to a 
		backup file -- where it was finally discovered.
		So, lilo had actually *cured* his system of the 
		virus).

<p>	Actually when you run /sbin/lilo you're "compiling" the
	information in the /etc/lilo.conf file and writing that
	to the "boot" location -- which you specify in the .conf
	file.

<p>	You can actually call your lilo.conf anything you like --
	and you can put it anywhere you like -- you'd just have to
	call /sbin/lilo with a -C switch and a path/file name.
	/etc/lilo.conf is just the built-in default which the -C
	option over-rides.

<p>	Here's a copy of my lilo.conf (which I don't actually use
	-- since I use LOADLIN.EXE on this system).
	As with many (most?) Unix configuration files the comments
	start with hash (#) signs.
<pre>
boot=/dev/hda
# write the resulting boot block to my first IDE hard drive's MBR.
# if this was /dev/hdb4 (for example) /sbin/lilo would write the 
# resulting block to the logical boot record on the fourth partition
# of my second IDE hard drive.   /dev/sdc would mean to write it to
# the MBR of the third SCSI disk.
# /sbin/lilo will print a warning if the boot location is likely to 
# be inaccessible to most BIOS' (i.e. would require a software driver
# for DOS to access it).

## NOTE:  Throughout this discussion I use /sbin/lilo to refer to the 
## Linux executable binary program and LILO to refer to the resulting
## boot code that's "compiled" and written by /sbin/lilo to whatever
## boot sector your lilo.conf calls for.  I hope this will minimize the
## confusion -- though I've liberally re-iterated this with parenthetical
## comments as well.

# The common case is to put boot=/dev/fd0H1440 to specify that the
# resulting boot code should be written to a floppy in the 1.44Mb
# "A:" drive when /sbin/lilo is run.  Naturally this would require
# that you use this diskette to boot any of the images and "other"
# stanzas listed in the rest of this file.  Note that the floppy
# could be completely blank -- no kernel or files are copied to it
# -- just the boot sector!


map=/boot/map
	# This is where /sbin/lilo will store a copy of the map file --
	# which contains the cylinder/sector/side address of the images
	# and message files  (see below)
	# It's important to re-run /sbin/lilo to regenerate the map
	# file any time you've done anything that might move any of 
	# these image or message files (like defragging the disk,
	# restoring any of these images from a backup -- that sort
	# of thing!).


install=/boot/boot.b
	# This file contains code for LILO (the boot loader) -- this is 
	# an optional directive -- and necessary in this case since it 
	# simply specifies the default location.
	
prompt
	# This instructs the LILO boot code to prompt the user for 
	# input.  Without this directive  LILO would just wait
	# upto "delay" time (default 0 tenths of a second -- none)
	# and boot using the default stanza.
	# if you leave this and the "timeout" directives out --
	# but you put in a delay=X directive -- then LILO won't 
	# prompt the user -- but will wait for X tenths of a second
	# (600 is 10 seconds).  During that delay the user can hit a 
	# shift key, or any of the NumLock, Scroll Lock type keys to 
	# request a LILO prompt.

timeout=50
	# This sets the amount of time LILO (the boot code) will 
	# wait at the prompt before proceeding to the default
	# 0 means 'wait forever'

message=/etc/lilo.message
	# this directive tells /sbin/lilo (the conf. "compiler") to 
	# include the contents of this message in the prompt which LILO
	# (the boot code) displays at boot time.  It is a handy place to
	# put some site specific help/reminder messages about what
	# you call your kernels and where you put your alternative bootable
	# partitions and what you're going to do to people who reboot your 
	# Linux server without a damn good reason.

other=/dev/hda1
	label=dos
	table=/dev/hda
	# This is a "stanza"
	# the keyword "other" means that this is referring to a non-Linux
	# OS -- the location tells LILO (boot code) where to find the 
	# "other" OS' boot code (in the first partition of the first IDE --
	# that's a DOS limitation rather than a Linux constraint).
	# The label directive is an arbitrary but unique name for this stanza
	# to allow one to select this as a boot option from the LILO 
	# (boot code) prompt.

	# Because it is the first stanza it is the the default OS --
	# LILO will boot this partition if it reaches timeout or is 
	# told not to prompt.  You could also over-ride that using a 
	# default=$labelname$ directive up in the "global" section of the
	# file.

image=/vmlinuz
	label=linux
	root=/dev/sda5
	read-only
	# This is my "normal" boot partition and kernel.
	# the "root" directive is a parameter that is passed to the 
	# kernel as it loads -- to tell the kernel where its root filesystem
	# is located.  The "read-only" is a message to the kernel to initially
	# mount the root filesystem read-only -- so the rc (AUTOEXEC.BAT) 
	# scripts can fsck (do filesystem checks -- like CHKDSK) on it.  
	# Those rc scripts will then normally remount the fs in "read/write" 
	# mode.

image=/vmlinuz.old
	label=old
	root=/dev/sda5
	append= single
	read-only
	# This example is the same except that it loads a different kernel
	# (presumably and older one -- duh!).  The append= directive allows
	# me to pass arbitrary directives on to the kernel -- I could use this
	# to tell the kernel where to find my Ethernet card in I/O, IRQ, and 
	# DMA space -- here I'm using it to tell the kernel that I want to come
	# up in "single-user" (fix a problem, don't start all those networking
	# gizmos) mode.

image=/mnt/tmp/vmlinuz
	label=alt
	root=/dev/sdb1
	read-only

	# This last example is the most confusing.  My image is on some other
	# filesystem (at the time that I run /sbin/lilo to "compile" this 
	# stanza). The root fs is on the first partition of the 2nd SCSI drive.
	# It is likely that /dev/sdb1 would be the filesystem mounted under 
	# /mnt/tmp when I would run /sbin/lilo.  However it's not "required"
	# My kernel image file could be on any filesystem that was mounted
	# /sbin/lilo will warn me if the image is likely to be inaccessible
	# by the BIOS -- it's can't say for sure since there are a lot of 
	# BIOS' out there -- some of the newer SCSI BIOS' will boot off of a 
	# CD-ROM!
</pre>

<p>I hope that helps.  The lilo.conf man page (in section 5) gives
*lots* more options -- like the one I just saw while writing this
that allows you to have a password for each of your images -- or 
for the whole set.  Also there are a number of kernel options
described in the BootPrompt-HOWTO.  One of the intriguing ones is
panic= -- which allows you to tell the Linux kernel how long to 
sit there displaying a kernel panic.  The default is "forever" --
but you can use the append= line in your lilo.conf to pass a 
panic= parameter to your kernel -- telling it how many seconds to 
wait before attempting to reboot.

<p>In the years that I've used Linux I've only seen a couple (like 
two or three) kernel panics (that could be identified as such).  Perhaps
a dozen times I've had a Linux system freeze or go comatose enough that 
I hard reset it.  (Most of those involve very bad hardware IRQ conflicts).
Once I've even tricked my kernel into scribbling garbage all over one of 
my filesystems (don't play with linear and membase in your XConfig file --
and, in particular don't specify a video memory base address that's 
inside of your system's RAM address space).  

<p>So I'm not sure if setting a panic= switch would help much.  I'd be 
much more inclined to get a hardware watchdog timer card and enable
the existing support for that in the kernel.  Linux is the only PC
OS that I know of that comes with this support "built-in"

<p>For those that aren't familiar with them a watchdog timer card is 
a card (typically taking an ISA slot) that implements a simple count-down
and reset (strobing the reset line on the system bus) feature.  This is 
activated by a driver (which could be a DOS device driver, a Netware
Loadable Module, or a little chunk of code in the Linux kernel.  Once 
started the card must be updated periodically (the period is set as
part of the activation/update).  So -- if the software hangs -- the
card *will* strobe the reset line.

<p>(Note: this isn't completely fool-proof.  Some hardware states might
require a complete power cycle and some sorts of critical server failures
will render the systems services unavailable without killing the 
timer driver software.  However it is a damn sight better than just
hanging).

<p>These cards cost about $100 (U.S.) -- which is a pity since there's
only about $5 worth of hardware there.  I think most Sun workstations
have this feature designed into the motherboard -- which is what 
PC manufacturers should scramble to do.

This is getting depressing.

Someone wanna explain this whole superblock concept to me?  Use
small words....


</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	Aryeh,

	Remember master boot records (MBR's)?  Remember "logical"
	boot records -- for volume boot records?

<p>	A superblock is the Unix term for a logical boot record.
	Linux uses normal partitions that are compatible with the
	DOS, OS/2, NT (et al) hard disk partitioning scheme.  

<p>	To boot Linux you can use LILO (the Linux loader) which can
	be written to your MBR (most common), to your "superblock"
	or to the "superblock" of a floppy.  This little chunk of code
	contains a reference (or "map") to the device and logical sector
	of one or more Linux kernels or DOS (or OS/2) bootable partitions.

<p>	There is a program called "lilo" which "compiles" a lilo.conf
	(configuration file) into this LILO "boot block" and puts it
	onto the MBR, superblock or floppy boot block for you.  This is 
	the source of most of the confusion about LILO.  I can create a 
	boot floppy with nothing put this boot block on it -- no 
	kernel, no filesystems, nothing.  LILO doesn't care where I put
	any of my linux kernels -- so long as it can get to it using 
	BIOS calls (which usually limits you to putting the kernel on 
	the one of the first two drives connected to the first drive
	controller on your system).

<p>	Another approach is to use LOADLIN.EXE -- this is a DOS 
	program that loads a Linux (or FreeBSD) kernel.  The advantage
	of this is that you can have as many kernel files as you like, 
	and they can be located on any DOS accessible device (even if you
	had to load various weird device drivers to be able to see that
	device.

<p>	LOADLIN.EXE is used by some CD-ROM based installation packages
	-- avoiding the necessity of using a boot floppy.

<p>	The disadvantages of LOADLIN include the fact that you may have
	loaded some device drivers and memory managers that have re-mapped
	(hooked into) critical BIOS interrupt vectors.  LOADLIN often needs
	a "boot time hardware vector table"  (which it usually writes as
	C:\REALBIOS.INT -- a small hidden/system file).  Creating this file
	involves booting from a "stub" floppy (which saves the table) and 
	rebooting/restarting the LOADLIN configuration to tell it to 
	copy the table from the floppy to your HD.  This must be done whenever
	you change video cards, add any controller with a BIOS extension
	(a ROM) or otherwise play with the innards of your machine.

<p>	Call me and we can go over your configuration to narrow down the
	discussion.  If you like you can point your web browser at 
	www.ssc.com/lg and look for articles by "The Answer Guy" there.
	I've described this a greater length in some of my articles there.

	... (I'm using fvwm syntax here -- I'll trust you to translate
	to TNL format).

	Try that -- it should fix you right up.

<p>	Also -- when you think your X session is locked up --
	try the Ctrl-Alt-Fx key (where Fx is the function key
	that corresponds to one of your virtual consoles).
	This should switch you out of GUI mode and into your 
	normal console environment.  You might also try Alt-SysReq
	(Print-Screen on most keyboards) followed by a digit from
	the alphanumeric portion of you keyboard (i.e. NOT from the
	numeric keypad).  This is an alternative binding for VC
	switching that might be enabled on a few systems.

	If all of that fails you can try Ctrl-Alt-Backspace. This 
	should (normally) signal the X server to shutdown.

<p>	Mostly I doubt that your server actually hung.  I suspect
	that you confused it a bit by running a non-X program 
	not "backgrounded" (you DO need those trailing ampersands)
	and failing to supply it with communications channel back to
	X (an xterm).

<p>	Please remember that my knowlege of X is very weak.  I 
	hardly ever use and almost never administer/customize it.
	So you'll want to look at the L.U.S.T. mailing list, or
	the comp.windows.x or (maybe) the comp.os.linux.x (although
	there is nothing to these questions which is Linux specific).

	I looked extensively for information about TheNextLevel
	on the web (in Yahoo! and Alta Vista).  Unfortunately
	the one page that almost all of the references pointed
	to was down

<p>	The FVWM home page is at: 
<a href="http://www3.hmc.edu/~tkelly/docs/proj/fvwm.html">http://www3.hmc.edu/~tkelly/docs/proj/fvwm.html</a>

<p>Greetings, this question is intended for the Answer Guy associated with
the Linux Gazette..

<p>I've recently discovered and enjoyed your column in the Linux Gazette,
I'm hoping you might have news about a linux port of sun's skip ip
encryption protocol.

<p>Here's the blurb from skip.incog.com:

  SKIP secures the network at the IP packet level. Any networked
  application gains the benefits of encryption, without requiring
  modification. SKIP is unique in that an Internet host can send an
  encrypted packet to another host without requiring a prior message
  exchange to set up a secure channel. SKIP is particularly well-suited
  to IP networks, as both are stateless protocols. Some of the
  advantages of SKIP include:
<ul>
    <li> No connection setup overhead
    <li> High availability - encryption gateways that fail can reboot and
      resume decrypting packets instantly, without having to
      renegotiate (potentially thousands) of existing connections
    <li> Allows uni-directional IP (for example, IP broadcast via
      satellite or cable)
    <li> Scalable multicast key distribution
    <li> SKIP gateways can be configured in parallel to perform
      instant-failover                                               
</ul>
</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	I heard a bit about SKIP while I was at a recent IETF
	conference.  However I must admit that it got lost in
	the crowd of other security protocols and issues.

<p>	So far I've paid a bit more attention to the Free S/WAN
	project that's being promoted by John Gilmore of the 
	EFF.

	I finally got ahold of a friend of mine (Hugh Daniel --
	one of the architects of Sun's NeWS project -- and 
	well-known cypherpunk and computer security professional)

<p>	He explained that SKIP is the "Secure Key Interchange Protocol"
	-- that is is a key management protocol (incorporated in
	ISAKMP/Oakley).  

<p>	For secure communications you need:
<ul>
<li>		Key management (which -- between strangers 
		 requires some sort of RSA (Public Key) or 
		 Diffie-Hellman key exchange or even some
		 variant of elliptic curve -- from what
		 I've heard).  

<li>		Encrypted Link (which will be built into
		 IPv6 and will be available as IPSec extensions
		 to IPv4 -- using tunnelled interfaces from 
		 what I gather).

<li>		Secure-DNS (this is related to the key management
		 problem -- we need a trustworthy source of 
		 public key information -- Verisign and Thawte
		 offer commercial "Certification Authority" 
		 services -- but the 'net needs something a 
		 bit more open and standards based).

</ul>

My employer is primarily an NT shop (with sun servers), but since I
develop in Java, I'm able to do my work in linux.  I am one of about a
dozen telecommuters in our organization, and we use on-demand ISDN to
dial in directly to the office modem bank, in many cases a long distance
call.


</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	I'm finally working on configuring my dial-on-demand ISDN
	line here at my place.  I've had diald (dial-on-demand over
	a 28.8 modem) running for about a month now.  I just want to
	cut down on that dial time.

<P><B>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">


We're considering switching to public Internet connections, using skip
to maintain security.  Skip binaries are available for a few platforms
(windows, freebsd, sunos), but not linux.  Fortunately the source is
available (http://skip.incog.com/source.html) but it's freebsd, and I
don't know nearly enough deep linux to get it compiled (I tried making
source modifications).

</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">


	If I understand it correctly SKIP is only a small part of 
	the solution.

<p>	Hopefully FreeS/WAN will be available soon.  You can 
	do quite a bit with ssh (and I've heard of people 
	who are experimenting with routing through some 
	custom made tunnelled interface).  FreeBSD and Linux 
	both support IP tunneling now.

<p>	For information on using ssh and IP tunnels to build a 
	custom VPN (virtual private network) look in this
	month's issue of Sys Admin Magazine (July '97).

	(Shameless plug: I have an article about C-Kermit appearing 
	in the same issue).

<p>	Another method might be to get NetCrypto.  Currently the
	package isn't available for Linux -- however McAfee  is 
	working on a port.  Look at http://www.mcafee.com 

<P><B>

After much time with several search engines, the best I could come up
with was another fellow also looking for a linux version of skip :)

ActiveX for Linux      
</h3>
<P> <B> 

From: Gerald Hewes <a href="mailto:hewes@OpenMarket.com">hewes@OpenMarket.com</a>

<p>Jim,

I read your response on ActiveX in the Linux Gazette. 
At <a href="../issue18/lg_answer18.html#active">http://linuxgazette.net/issue18/lg_answer18.html#active</a>

<p>Software AG is porting the non GUI portions of ActiveX called DCOM
to Linux. Their US site where it should be hosted appears down
as I write this e-mail message
but there is a link of their home page on a Linux DCOM beta:

<a href="http://www.softwareag.com/">http:/www.sotwareag.com</a>

</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
 
	I beleive the link ought to be 

<a href="http://www.sagus.com/prod-i~1/net-comp/dcom/index.htm">http://www.sagus.com/prod-i~1/net-comp/dcom/index.htm</a>

<P><B>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">

As for DCOM, its main value for the Linux community is in making
Microsoft Distributed Object Technology available to the Linux
community. Microsoft is trying to push DCOM over CORBA.


</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	I know that MS is "trying to push DCOM over CORBA"
	(and OpenDOC, and now, JavaBeans).  I'm also aware that
	DCOM stands for "distributed component object model" and
	CORBA is the "common object request broker" and SOM is 
	IBM's "system object model" (OS/2).

<p>	The media "newshounds" have dragged these little bones
	around and gnawed on them until we've all seen them.
	Nonetheless I don't see its "main value to the Linux
	community."

<p>	These "components" or "reusable objects" will not make
	any difference so long as significant portions of their
	functionality are tied to specific OS (GUI) semantics.
	However, this coupling between specific OS' has been a 
	key feature of each of these technologies.  

	<p>It's Apple's OpenDoc, IBM's DSOM, and Microsoft's DSOM!

<p>	While I'm sure that each as their merits from the programmer's
	point of view (and I'm in no position to comment on their
	relative technical pros or cons) -- I have yet to see any *benefit*
	from a user or administrative point of view.

<p>	So I suppose the question here becomes:


	<p>	Is there any ActiveX (DCOM) control (component)
		that delivers any real benefit to any Linux user?

		Do any of the ActiveX controls not have a GUI component
		to them?

		What does it mean to make the "non-GUI portions" of
		DCOM available?

		Is there any new network protocol that this gives
		us?  If so, what is that protocol good for?
	
<p>For more information, checkout <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/oledev/">http://www.microsoft.com/oledev</a>

<p>	While I encourage people to browse around -- I think 
	I'll wait until someone can point out one DCOM component,
	one JavaBean, one CORBA object, or one whatever-buzzword-
	you-want-to-call-it-today and can explain in simple "Duh!
	I'm a user!" terms what the *benefit* is.

<p>	Some time ago -- in another venue -- I provided the net
	with an extensive commentary on the difference between
	"benefits" and "features."  The short form is this:

<p>		I benefit is relevant to your customer.  To
		offer a benefit requires that you understand
		your customer.  "Features" bear no relation to
		a customers needs.  However mass marketing 
		necessitates the promotion of features -- since
		the *mass* marketer can't address individual and 
		niche needs.

<p>	Example:  Microsoft operating systems offer a "easy to use 
	graphical interfaces" -- first "easy to use" is highly subjective.
	In this case it means that there are options listed on menus
	and buttons and the user can guess at which ones apply to 
	their need and experiment until something works.  That is a feature
	-- one I personally loathe.  To me "easy to use" means having
	documentation that includes examples that are close to what
	I'm trying to do -- so I can "fill in the blanks"  Next there is
	the ubiquitously touted "GUI."  That's another *feature*.  To 
	me it's of no benefit -- I spend 8 to 16 hours a day looking at 
	my screen.  Text mode screens are far easier on the eyes than
	any monitor in graphical mode.  

<p>	To some people, such as the blind GUI's are a giant step 
	backward in accessibility.  The GUI literally threatens to cut 
	these people off from vital employment resources.

<p>	I'm not saying that the majority of the world should abandon
	GUI's just because of a small minority of people who can't 
	use them and a smaller, crotchety contingent of people like
	me that just don't like them.  I'm merely trying to point
	out the difference between a "feature" and a "benefit."

<p>	The "writing wizards" offered by MS Word are another feature
	that I eschew.  My writing isn't perfect and I make my share
	of typos, as well as spelling and grammatical errors.  However
	Most of what I write goes straight from my fingers to the 
	recipient -- no proofreading and no editing.  When I've 
	experimented with spell checkers and "fog indexes" I've consistently
	found that my discourse is beyond their capabilities -- much too
	specialized and involving far too much technical terminology.
	So I have to over-ride more than 90% of the "recommendations of 
	these tools.

<p>	Although my examples have highlighted Microsoft products we
	can turn this around and talk about Linux' famed "32-bit 
	power" and "robust stability."  These, too are *features*.
	Stability is a benefit to someone who manages a server -- 
	particularly a co-located server at a remote location.  However
	the average desktop applications user could care less about
	stability.  So long as their application manage to autosave
	the last three versions of his/her documents the occasional
	reboot is just a good excuse to go get a cup of coffee.

<p>	Multi-user is a feature.  Most users don't consider this to 
	be a benefit -- and the idea of sharing "their" system with
	others is thoroughly repugnant to most modern computer users.
	On top of that the network services features which implement
	multi-user access to Linux (and other Unix systems) and NT are
	gaping security problems so far as most IS users are concerned.
	So having a multi-user system is not a benefit to must of us.
	This is particularly true of the shell access that most people
	identify as *the* multi-user feature of Unix (as opposed to the
	file sharing and multiple user profiles, accounts and passwords
	that passes for "multi-user" under Windows for Workgroups and 
	NT).

<p>	So, getting back to ActiveX/DCOM -- I've heard of all sorts
	of features.  I'd like to hear about some benefits.  Keep in
	mind that any feature may be a benefit to someone -- so 
	benefits generally have to be expressed in terms of *who*
	is the beneficiary.   

<p>	Allegedly programmers are the beneficiary of all these
	competing component and object schema.  "Use our model
	and you'll be able to impress your boss with glitzy results
	in a fraction of the time it would take to do any programming"
	(that seems to be the siren song to seduce people to any of these).

<p>	So, who else benefits?

<p>Oddly enough -- while it is easy to redirect the standard error

an easy portable way to explicitly generate message or redirect

is to use the /proc/ filesystem (process table) like so:

Blinking Underline Cursor
</h3>
<P> <B> 


From: Joseph Hartmann <a href="mailto:joeh@arakis.sugar-river.net">joeh@arakis.sugar-river.net</a>

<p>I know an IBM compatible PC is "capable" of having a blinking
underline cursor, or a blinking block cursor.  

<p>My linux system "came" with a blinking underline, which is very
difficult to see.  But I have not been able (for the past several
hours) to make *any* headway about finding out how to change the
cursor to a blinking block.  

</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">


	You got me there.  I used to know about five lines of 
	x86 assembly language to call the BIOS routine that sets
	the size of your cursor.  Of course that wouldn't work under
	Linux since the BIOS is mapped out of existence during the 
	trip into protected mode.

<p>	I had a friend who worked with me back at Peter Norton
	Computing -- he wrote a toy program that provided an
	animated cursor -- and had several need animated sequences
	to show with it -- a "steaming coffee cup," a "running man,"
	and a "spinning galaxy" are the ones I remember.

<p>	If you wanted to do some kernel hacking it looks like
	you'd change the value of the "currcons" structure in
	one of the /usr/src/linux/drivers/char/ files -- 
	maybe it would be "vga.c"

<p>	On the assumption that you are not interested in that 
	approach (I don't blame you) I've copied the author of 
	SVGATextMode (a utility for providing text console mode
	access to the advanced features of most VGA video cards)

<p>	Hopefully <a href="mailto:koen.gadeyne@barco.com"> Koen</a> doesn't mind the
	imposition.  Perhaps he can help.

<p>	I've also copied Eugene Crosser and Andries Brouwer 
	the authors of the 'setfont' and 'mapscrn' programs 
	(which don't seem to do cursors -- but do some cool 
	console VGA stuff).  'setfont' lets you pick your
	text mode console font.

<p>	Finally I've copied Thomas Koenig who maintains the 
	Kernel "WishList" in the hopes that he'll add this as
	a possible entry to that.

<p>
Any hints?
Best Regards,


</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	Joe,

	As you can see I don't feel stumped very often -- and
	now that I think about it -- I think this would be a neat
	feature for the Linux console.  This is especially true since
	the people who are most likely to stay away from X Windows are
	laptop users -- and those are precisely the people who are 
	most likely to need this feature.

File Permissions
</h3>
<P> <B> 

From: John Gotschall <a href="mailto:johng@frugal.com">johng@frugal.com</a>
 
<p>Hi!

I was wondering if anyone there knew how I might actually change the 
file permissions on one of my linux box's DOS partition.

<p>I have Netscape running on one box on our local network, but it can't
write to another linux box's MSDOS filesystem, when that filesystem
is NFS mounted.  It can write to various Linux directories that have
proper permissions, but the MSDOS directory won't keep a permissions
setting, it keeps it stuck as owned by, read by and execute by root.

</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	What you're bumping into is two different issues.  

	The default permissions under which a DOS FAT filesystem 
	is mounted (which is "root.root 755"  that is: owned by
	user root, group root, rwx for owner, r-x for group and
	other).

<p>	You can change that with options to the mount (8) command.
	Specifically you want to use something like:

<pre>mount -t msdos -o uid=??,gid=??,umask=775</pre>

<p>	... where you pick suitable values for the UID and GID from
	your /etc/passwd and /etc/group files (respectively).

<p>	The other culprit in this is the default behavior of NFS.
	For your own protection NFS defaults to using a feature called
	"root squash" (which is not a part of a vegetable).  This
	prevents someone who has root access to some other system
	(as allowed by your /etc/exports file) from accessing your
	files with the same permissions as you're own local root account.

<p>	If you pick a better set of mount options (and put them in your
	/etc/fstab in the fourth field) then you won't have to worry 
	about this feature.  I DO NOT recommend that you over-ride that
	setting with the NFS no_root_squash option in the /etc/exports
	file (see 'man 5 exports' for details).  I personally would 
	*never* use that option with any export that was mounted
	read-only -- not even in my own home between two systems that
	have no live connection to the net!  (I do use the no_root_squash
	option with the read-only option -- but that's a minor risk
	in my case).
<P><B>
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">

Is there a way to change the MS-DOS permissions somehow?


</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	Yes.  See the mount(8) options for uid=, gid=, and umask=.
	I think you can also use the umsdos filesytem type 
	and effectively change the permissions on your FAT based
	filesystem mount points.

<p>	This was a source of some confusion for me and I've never
	really gotten it straight to my satisfaction.  Luckily I find
	that I hardly ever use my DOS partitions any more.
