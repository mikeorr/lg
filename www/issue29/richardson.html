In May, Sun Microsystems joined Linux International. In a
year where Netscape has released their source and many companies have
announced that their products will be supporting Linux, I felt Sun's move
was an interesting enough development to want to know more. Therefore, I
did a short e-mail interview with Charles Andres, a Group Manager in
Market Development Engineering at Sun Microsystems. Here's what he told me.
<p>
<i>
<b>Margie</b>:Why has Sun made the decision to join Linux International?
</i><p>
<b>Charles</b>: Sun Microsystems is responding to renewed interest in
running Linux on its UltraSPARC products, such as the Ultra 5.
SPARC products have always been designed to run UNIX extremely well.
Linux runs well on UltraSPARC platforms.
<p>
	It is important to note that this move in no way diminishes Sun's support
for Solaris, a proven reliable scalable operating system. The Solaris environment
will still be provided with all SPARC systems and is considered by us to be
the best operating system for enterprise and network computing.
<p>
<i>
<b>Margie</b>: Is Sun planning to have Linux support for all its products?
</i><p>
<b>Charles</b>: Sun Microsystems is not planning on selling any products that are bundled
with Linux. Sun bundles Solaris with every workstation and server
it currently ships. There are also no plans to provide support for
Linux directly. However, there are a number of Linux vendors that
support a variety of platforms. We are working to ensure that these
vendors include UltraSPARC platform support for their Linux products.
<p>
<i>
<b>Margie</b>: Does this move represent a shift in policy for Sun? Last year, we
asked for a picture of a SunSPARC workstation to use on our cover, and
were refused because ``Linux is a competitor.'' (We used a Ross SPARCplug instead.)
</i><p>
<b>Charles</b>: Sun Microsystems has never had an official policy regarding Linux up to now.
As stated above, Sun Microsystems has gone from having no policy regarding
Linux, to helping to ensure that Linux runs on SPARC by assisting companies who
sell supported versions of Linux.
<p>
<i>
<b>Margie</b>: How does Sun feel about the ``Open
Source'' movement? (Prominent in the news, because of Netscape
source release.)
</i><p>
<b>Charles</b>: Sun Microsystems has a long tradition of supporting open standards,
typically through standardized interfaces, many of which Sun has invented. Providing
source code may be appropriate in some specific instances, but typically works
well only in situations where trademarks associated with the source code are licensed.
Compatibility, consistency, reliability and upgrades require a
business model that can finance the effort required to provide them.
<p>
	Users who want the freedom of Open Source take on the responsibility of
maintaining their own source code, but cannot guarantee consistent results
with other variants. This could become a problem for Netscape source variants if
they are not uniquely identified. This is why we feel brand protection
through licensing
is so important.
<p>
<i>
<b>Margie</b>: Some people feel that Java should be made Open
Source. Any chance of that happening?
</i><p>
<b>Charles</b>: Source for the Java language is available to anyone who signs the Java
license which is free for non-commercial use. This is done to allow
Java to run anywhere, and to avoid problems that could occur when
source is modified to produce variants that are not consistent with
the Java language specification.
<p>
<i>
<b>Margie</b>: Anything else you'd like to add?
</i><p>
<b>Charles</b>: We look forward to working with you and the Linux community
to promote the advantages of UNIX and Linux on SPARC in the future.
<p>
<i>
<b>Margie</b>:Thank you for your time.
