<h3><img alt="[lightning bolt]" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Away with the keyboards and mice!</h3>

<p>
TAG member Jimmy O'Regan sent in this news item, quoting from 
<a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/fatalexception/archives/2008/10/microsofts_touc.html">
http://weblog.infoworld.com/fatalexception/archives/2008/10/microsofts_touc.html</a>
<blockquote>
"Most recently, Iron Man's Tony Stark designed CAD models for an
entire suit of high-tech combat armor using only his bare hands. So
how come we're all still using keyboards and ordinary old mice?
InfoWorld's ace reporter Paul Krill was the first to spot a new
project from Micr0s0ft Office Labs and Micr0s0ft developer Mike
Wasserman that could bring those next-generation UIs one step closer."
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
The code is released under the MS-PL, which is open source and
GPL-compatible:<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/touchless">http://www.codeplex.com/touchless</a> 
It's C#, so it should work with Mono (and if it doesn't, it's only a
matter of time before some Mono person makes it work)
</p>

<p>
The article also mentions this project:
<a href="http://www.hitl.washington.edu/artoolkit/">http://www.hitl.washington.edu/artoolkit/</a> which is GPL and already
works on Linux.

<h3><img alt="[lightning bolt]" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Which came first, the 3-D printer or the 3-D printer it made?</h3>

<p>
Jimmy O'Regan sent in another fantastic tidbit, this one about a
self-replicating open source 3-D printer. "RepRap" stands for Replicating
Rapid-prototyper, and it's simply too cool to explain briefly here.
Code and specification are available under the GPL. "Not counting nuts
and bolts RepRap can make 60% of its parts; the other parts are
designed to be cheaply available everywhere."
They use Art of Illusion ( <a href="http://www.artofillusion.org/)">http://www.artofillusion.org/</a> ) to design models.
</p>

<p>
Version 2.0 is being designed, with a goal of being able to reproduce
its own electronics, too. They've also had success with plywood

<h3><img alt="[lightning bolt]" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Ubuntu 7.04 End of Support on October 19th</h3>

<p>On October 19th, Ubuntu 7.04 reaches the end of its support life.
Supported for 18 months, from April 19th 2007 to October 19th 2008, this
version of the Ubuntu distribution will now stop receiving new security
patches and updates.</p>

<p>The only direct update path for users of Ubuntu 7.04 is upgrading
to Ubuntu 7.10. Details of the process can be found here: <a
href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GutsyUpgrades">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GutsyUpgrades</a>.</p>

<h3><img alt="[lightning bolt]" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Red Hat High Performance Computing (HPC) Solution Launched</h3>

<p>Red Hat announced the launch of Red-Hat's HPC Solution, a package of
tools, including the operating system, cluster-creation and management
tools, and development tools, aimed at creation of an HPC cluster in
a single, easy to install package. </p>

<p>Backed up by Red Hat support services, the solution brings 
creation of such services to a new level. According to Red Hat, "With
the Red Hat HPC Solution, making changes to the cluster is a snap. With
its elegant and powerful node group and repository manager, you can
deploy new updates, patches, and software packaged as kits, or re-image
new nodes in minutes with no interruption in uptime. Managing four
hundred nodes requires as little effort as managing four nodes".</p>

<h3><img alt="[lightning bolt]" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Flash Player 10 Launched</h3>

<p>Adobe launched Flash Player 10, with several updates and new
features.  This update, unlike Flash Player 9, was released on the same
day for several platforms, including Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.</p>

<p>While the release does not seem too important for Flash development on
Linux (one of the main new features, the ability to use custom filters
and effects, can only be achieved on Windows and Mac OS, as it requires
the Adobe Pixel Bender toolkit, that runs only on those platforms), for
those who want only to be able to watch Flash clips on Linux, this is
still a release worthy of note.</p>
