I was interested to see the discussion in this article on passive ethernet
"hubs" etc. Other maybe interested in this passive 3 port ethernet hub
design...

I've not actually built it yet, but plan to do so soon.

Pretty nifty idea for a project, that. A note of caution, though: given
the operating frequencies for today's networks, you might want to think
about the RF side of things. I.e., keep the wire runs as short as
possible, and consider using twisted pair connections from the board to
the Ethernet connectors. If I was going to build something like that,
I'd probably attach the board to the center connector - or even attach
all three connectors to the board (tiny as it is) and pot the whole
thing in epoxy instead of using a case.

When I was working at Hughes Aircraft (a.k.a. "Huge Airscrap"), we all
got a bit /blase/ about the distinction between high and low frequency;
we worked with circuits that usually ran at double-digit gigahertz (D
band, etc.), so stuff like FM radio and the oscillating frequency of
hydrogen ions was beneath our notice. Much of that attitude suddenly
went away after a certain project engineer wasted a day trying to get a
power reading out of a receiver's IF section by connecting it to the
power meter with a couple of feet of 18-gauge wire... the lab boss had
left a message on the lab whiteboard, in large script, that said "400
MHz is <em>NOT</em> DC!!!"
</p>

<p>
(We checked out that wire later, by the way; ~20dBm loss at 400MHz,
meaning that he was losing ~99% of the signal.)
