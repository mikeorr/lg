Google brought me to you. You might be interested in this new resource for
experimenting with crontab commands.
</p>

<p>
For most of us, setting up a new cron job is not something we do every day.
So we can easily forget the details.
</p>

<p>
Cron Sandbox at HxPI offers an opportunity to play with the crontab
scheduling commands in safety.
</p>

<p>
Type in the 'm h D M Dw' parameters and see a calendar of job execution
times/dates.

That is true, and one should use always use caution when using cron an
improperly set up crontab can cause problems.

That is a neat little tool for people that are uncertain of the possible
results of their crontab syntax. Thanks for the link.

Unfortunately, your page doesn't perform any validation or parsing of
the arguments, or show when the specified entry would run; the one
referred to by the OP does. I don't mean to knock your effort, but it's
not the same category of thing at all.

<p>
'crontab', as Joey showed in his article, is a fairly complex beast, and
checking its syntax is a good idea for those who aren't yet comfortable
with it, is a good idea.

Nah, just throw things into crontab without bothering to check them.
It'll be a valuable and fun learning experience!
</p>

<p>
The only way you can have even more fun than that is to jam poorly
debugged scripts into /etc/inittab lines with the "respawn" keyword.
Preferably on a production server.  That's Heap Big Fun!  Try it _today_!

Now, yes.
</p>

<p>
You used to be able to see a subset of the glory that was
<a href="http://www.forum3000.org/">http://www.forum3000.org/</a> at the Internet Archive / Wayback Machine, but
I see that the snapshots of the former site are no longer available
there.  Pity:  It was inspired.  
</p>

<p>
This site implements the same concept, but I don't find the writing
nearly as good:  <a href="http://forum2010.org/">http://forum2010.org/</a>
</p>

<p>
A <em>few</em> of the Forum3000 dialogues are here, but even those are missing
most of the images of the "simulated personalities" who participate:
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060629055124/aardvarko.snappyanswers.com/mirrors/xalton.forum2000.org/matrix/forum_hof_questions.html">http://web.archive.org/web/20060629055124/aardvarko.snappyanswers.com/mirrors/xalton.forum2000.org/matrix/forum_hof_questions.html</a>
