<p>
Dear list,
</p>

<p>
I am using debian with devfs. I have a usb based removable microsd drive.
I have no problem to access the drive through usb but the problem is with
non-static device node. Like I have checked through log that the devfs has
assigned node /dev/sda1 for that device.
</p>

<p>
so I have added in my /etc/fstab
</p>

<pre>
/dev/sda1       /media/microsd      vfat    rw,user,auto    0       0
</pre>
and I have no problem to work with it. but next time when I again plug
in the device it has a device node called /dev/sdb1  and then I have to
modify the corresponding entry in fstab. So is there any way to assign
static device node in devfs.
</p>

<p>
thanks
</p>

Hello Gang
</p>

<p>
I'd like to know if there's some kind of "reference guide" for Linux 
console-based applications, or perhaps a web site / community of people who 
enjoy doing everything via command line and ncurses-based apps, without 
setting up graphical desktop environments.
</p>

<p>
I've already encountered several apps, e.g., for working with e-mails 
(Mutt), browsing the web (Elinks), playing music (Moc), chatting over MSN 
(Pebrot), and so on, but I'd like to try more options on each of those 
activities, and do other things such as recording and playing CDs and DVDs, 
sharing files over p2p, resizing partitions, reading PDFs and word documents 
or converting them to text, chatting over VoIP, reading RRS feeds, editing 
audio, etc etc.
</p>

<p>
Thank you very much and congratulations for your work on Linux Gazette, my 
favourite magazine.
</p>

</p>

<p>
I was looking at some tablature programs today, and found that there's
an extension to MIDI called "Rich MIDI Tablature Format" to represent
some guitar specific things. A few Windows programs support it, but
none of the open source programs do.
</p>

<p>
I was wondering how to even go about finding out the differences
between this format and regular MIDI (without having to find out too
much about MIDI), when Perl (or, more specifically, Perl's MIDI
module) came to the rescue: it has an option to dump everything as a
series of events.
</p>

<p>
Take this short piece of Lilypond:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
\header {
  title = "Flowers"
  dedication = "Ona wie"
  subtitle = "1 January 2005"
}
 
\new TabStaff {
  \repeat volta 2 {
  d'4\4 b'8\3 d'\4 a'4.\3
  e'8\4 e'\4 fis'\4 g'\4 e'\4 fis'\4 g'\4 a'4\3
  d'4\4 b'8\3 d'\4 a'4.\3
  e'8\4 a'\3 g'\4 fis'\4 e'\4 d'2\4
  }
 
  \repeat volta 2 {
  a4\5 e'8\4 fis'\4 g'4.\4
  e'8\4 e'\4 fis'\4 g'\4 e'\4 fis'\4 g'\4 a'4\3
  a4\5 e'8\4 fis'\4 g'4.\4
  e'8\4 g'\4 fis'\4 e'\4 b'\3 a'2\3
  }
 
  \repeat volta 2 {
  a8\4 d\4 fis\4 g\4
  e\5 a,\5 cis\5 d\5
  d\5 cis\5 b,\6 a,\6
  a,\6 cis\5 e\5 g\4
  a8\4 d\4 fis\4 g\4
  e\5 a,\5 cis\5 d\5
  d\5 cis\5 b,\6 a,\6
  a,2\6
  }
}
</pre>
I recreated the first 4 bars in one of the Windows tablature programs,
and with this command:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
$ perl -MMIDI -e 'my
$o=MIDI::Opus-&gt;new({"from_file"=&gt;$ARGV[0]});$o-&gt;dump({"dump_tracks"=&gt;1});'
flowers-rtmf.mid
</pre>
I got this output:

Hey all,
</p>

<p>
I'm fairly new to C programming but am familiar with most programming
principles from Java and Perl. I understand what pointers are in C,
but I have lots of problems knowing when best to use them, since many,
if not all tasks, can be obtained just from passing parameters into
function directly.
</p>

<p>
Are there any good tips for knowing when or when not to use pointers?

Hi Everyone,
</p>

<p>
Does anyone remember how Fedora Core 4 let the user specify trusted devices (e.g. eth0, sit0,
nlv0) through the system-config-securitylevel tool?  That feature seems to have gone away with
Core 5.  I always liked that feature because it let me open up just the nlv0 device for VPN.  With
that feature gone, I have to open up a lot more it seems.
</p>

<p>
Does anyone know of a workaround?  Or did the feature just get moved somewhere else?  Thanks in
advance.  Oh, and I did find the ASCI version of the tool, system-config-securitylevel-tui - it
knows  that eth0 can be set as a trusted device, but that's it.  Even when nlv0 is up (as
confirmed by ifconfig), system-config-securitylevel-tui only lists eth0 as a device that can be
set as trusted.

<h3>Switching VT Remotely?</h3>

<b>Fri, 04 May 2007 15:34:39 -0600</b>
</p>

<p>
Is there a way to switch the VT of a linux box remotely?
</p>

<p>
Specifically, I have X running on my desktop, and have trained my wife 
to click the KDE "switch user" to log in herself (and get her email), 
which allocates another VT for her.
</p>

<p>
This works really well -- I can leave myself logged in on VT7, and she 
can use VT8.  Unfortunately, she doesn't know how to switch it back to 
VT7 when she's done (Ctrl-Alt-F7).
</p>

<p>
I have a VNC server installed as an X module, that allows me to remotely 
VNC to my X session (on VT7), but due to X quirks, I can only VNC to it 
if VT7 is "selected" -- ie, if she's left the machine sitting on VT8, I 
can't VNC in.
</p>

<p>
So, I would like to know if there is a way for me to switch which VT is 
"selected" remotely (ie, SSH in, su to root, and do something to switch 
VTs).
</p>

<p>
Thanks in advance! ;-)
</p>

</p>

<p>
I deleted most of this thread from my mailbox.  Please could you get this 
email to the right place in the thread?
</p>

<p>
I just noticed you have posted our long discussion of lpr and user in the 
April edition.  There is one piece missing.  Karolis found the solution to 
the eznet problem.  Eznet (which our little linux uses as a front end for 
pppd) changes file permissions while it is being used, which is why the 
devices needed to dial kept reverting to not being user-accessible.  So in 
order to dial as user, one would need to use pppd directly without eznet.
</p>

<p>
I am trying to keep things simple, and eznet is very simple to set up.
I am totally incapable of rewriting eznet to behave properly.
</p>

<p>
Would it make a big difference in security if the user dialed as root, 
then logged in and did everything else online as user?
</p>



<p>
I can now print as root (and hopefully as user) with gs 8.54, which I 
compiled with default device deskjet, at default resolution 300 dpi, on 
default letter size paper:
</p>

<pre>
gs -sOutputFile=/dev/lp0 filename.pdf
</pre>
I put together a package with a bit of documentation.  Init files are 
compiled into the executable, and it works without added fonts.  I 
included only the older deskjet and laserjet printers and devices needed 
to view with an svgalib viewer and to convert ps &lt; &gt; pdf.  2.7MB 
standalone executable.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://keesan.freeshell.org/bl/gs-8.54-HP-noX.tgz">http://keesan.freeshell.org/bl/gs-8.54-HP-noX.tgz</a> (glibc 2.2.5)
Compiled without x11 (use svgalib 1.9.25 and svp to view, also posted at 
my site as packages).
</p>

<p>
Since it does not require x11, it should work with libc5 BL3.50 (whose X 
is not compatible with glibc X) as well as later linuxes.
</p>

<p>
There is now a basiclinux BL3.50 with a nicer wm that does not require a 
mouse, and a more complete menu that makes life easier for beginners.
It still uses eznet.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://distro.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/distributions/baslinux">http://distro.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/distributions/baslinux</a>
</p>

<p>
Added to the 5MB of BL3.50, along with a few extra libraries, Opera 8, and 
Abiword (each about 12MB), this gs should make for a nice 50MB linux that 
browses, does word processing and prints, works with some cameras, and 
might run off a flash drive if you first boot from a 1-floppy USB-capable 
linux and chroot to the flash drive.  (I did something similar with 
camera-linux, 8MB of files needed to download photos from my camera and 
display them on any computer with a floppy drive and USB 1.0 port, in a 
loop file in a DOS directory on the camera memory card).

<p>
Hi tag,
</p>


<p>
I'm trying to write a perl progam to automatically record internet
radio. The current setup uses at to start a recording process which
checks the radios webpage, filters the proper straming adress and wget
it for wget'able streams -- otherwise mplayer is used to dump the
stream. 
</p>

<p>
My increasing problem is, that the recording process exits prematurely.
What I currently do in perl is a main routine which does all the
webfetching and then forks out two processes:
</p>

<p>
* the recorder
* the killer -- waiting and then killing the recorder after preprogrammed time
</p>

<p>
main program exits. This protects mplayer from any input on stdin as
this immediately kills mplayer (a problem if perl program is started
by atd as I had to find out).
</p>


<p>
Now I tried to setup a signal handler for SIGCHLD in the main part  and
then let the main go to sleep instead of exiting. On receiving a
SIGCHLD it checks if this was because of the killer (time up, killer
exited) or if the time is not yet up and the recorder exited too early.
In the latter case I restart the recorder, kill and restart the killer
for the new recorder-pid  and then I want back in main, set the
sighandler and go to sleep as before.... but I seem unable to get out
of the sighandler. So this restarted recording exactly once -- but not
again. 
</p>

<p>
Is something like the above possible? Or do I have to switch to a
loop in main checking regularly on the status and react actively
without the use of sighandler to get any number of restarts? 
</p>

<p>
I'm not too worried of too fast forking as wget/mplayer takes a while
till they decide to fail -- but just in case a small delay and restart
counter (or count/time) could be calculated and watched in case network
is down and wget/mplayer are exiting to quick. 
</p>

<p>
Since I would very much like to learn how the sighandlers are supposed
to work and how to use them I would find the first strategy more
interesting.....  
</p>

<p>
As reading material I've the perl CD bookshelf including Programming
perl and the cookbook (Advanced Perl Programming doesn't have much on
forking and signal handlers). Both are not too deep into what's to do
once the sighandler was activated and I don't just want to terminate
after some cleaning up.

Hi folks, regarding the multi-head linux system build-
</p>

<p>
I'm wondering if the mouse and keyboard entries will work the same if 
i'm using one or more PS2 to USB adapters? The ones I found online 
convert both ps/2 mouse and keyboard to a single USB input. (Such as: 
<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16812107701">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16812107701</a>)
</p>

<p>
Would these cause any problems with differentiating/using the inputs for 
each head?
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
Cubbs

Actually, the mirrors - barring a mirracle - will not pick it up at all;
typically, they just pull down the latest issue as a tarball and add it
to their structure. However, I went ahead and made the change anyway.
</p>

<p>
This particular bit of parameter expansion stays at the top of my mind
for an odd reason: I tend to fire up Midnight Commander in most of my
xterms, and since MC uses '%' as a designator for special entities
(e.g., '%s' is the current or selected filename, '%d' is the current
directory, etc.), I have to remember to double any percent signs that I
want to use literally. Therefore, "shortest match" for me <strong>is</strong>
${variable%%pattern} - and "longest match" is ${variable%%%%pattern}. It
also makes life interesting when I'm firing off a Perl one-liner
containing hashes (which, of course, use '%' for a sigil.)

<p>
Hello!
</p>

<p>
On Apr 26, 2007 at 1329 -0700, S. Banerian appeared and said:
</p>

<pre>
&gt; [...]
&gt; I read through the two articles on use of setkey/racoon in
&gt; linuxgazette/2006.
&gt; The second article describes racoon configuration, but really only in
&gt; terms of two private nets behind gateways.  My goal is to just connect a
&gt; cluster of boxes together, on whatever subnets.
</pre>

<p>
You can only use IPsec for creating an encrypted tunnel between two
points in the network. If you wish to connect multiple hosts you need to
create tunnels from one hosts to the others or use gateways that route
through VPN tunnels.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; &gt;From what I get out of the article, I might be able to just modify the
&gt; sainfo block, using the two endpoints for each connection; however that
&gt; does not "seem' to work; tcpdump tells me nothing appears encrypted.
&gt; I've not found online any good peer-to-peer x509 description.
</pre>

<p>
Can you tell me something more about your configuration? Maybe you can
send an anonymised config file, so that I can see the relations between
the IP addresses. I don't need to know your real IPs, just mark them in
order to indicate private and public IP ranges.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Do you have any recommendations for an A-B-C peer connection with x509 ?
</pre>

<p>
One way would be to use static routes through multiple VPN tunnels.
Another way would be to use a star topology and have one machine act as
a VPN server where all the others connect to. This saves you some
tunnels between indidivual hosts and requires the VPN server in the
middle to reroute all the traffic. Yet another way is to try a mesh.
tinc (<a href="http://www.tinc-vpn.org/">http://www.tinc-vpn.org/</a>) is used by the German Chaos Computer
Club to link multiple sites with a kind of mesh topology. It doesn't
seem to support X.509 though.
</p>

<p>
Best wishes,
Ren&eacute;.

<h3>Recording ALSA PCM output as RAW data</h3>

<p>
Hi Gang...
</p>

<p>
I'd like to write a short tip here. Sometimes, you may want to record 
the PCM output stream, maybe for further sound analysis and such. How to 
do it?
</p>

<p>
You need to modify your ALSA setting e.g in /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf 
and add below lines:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
pcm.default {
        @args [ SLAVE FILE FORMAT ]
        @args.SLAVE {
                type string
                default "hw:0,0"
        }
        @args.FILE {
                type string
                default "/mnt/linux/midi/test.raw"
        }
        @args.FORMAT {
                type string
                default raw
        }
        type file
        slave.pcm $SLAVE
        file $FILE
        format $FORMAT
}
</pre>
The declaration is quite self explanatory. Pay attention to $FILE 
definition (where you want to put the RAW file). It is defined as 44100 
HZ, 2 channel, signed linear sample data.
</p>

<p>
Later, you can convert this file into another audio format, such as WAV:
<pre>
$ sox -V -w -c  2 -s -r 44100 ./copy.raw ./copy.wav
</pre>
Notice that the above ALSA PCM definition is default definition, so it 
affects any ALSA based application that use default definition too. If 
you want, you can name it something like "pcm.tee" and later to use this 
definition, tell your application to do so, e.g:
<pre>
aplay -D tee song.wav
</pre>
NB: I read about this tip during my experiments with Linux Audio. There 
might be mistakes here, so please CMIIW.
</p>

<p>
regards,
</p>

<p>
Mulyadi

<h1>Creating an Unkillable Process</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/brownss.html">Silas Brown</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<p>Annoying as unkillable processes can be,
there are some circumstances where you might
legitimately want to create one. For example, if
I run an audit tool, or if I want to write a
program that makes sure I go to bed on time even
when I'm really stuck into something, then I
might not want even the root user to be able to
stop it from running.</p>

<p>One approach would be to simply disallow any
root access to the system, or at least disallow
it at critical times, but that can get very
complex if you still need to be able to
administrate the system and/or cannot tell with
certainty which times will not be critical.  So
I wanted an approach that did not rely on
disallowing root access altogether.</p>

<p>As root can do anything (including writing
batches of commands which when run will likely
out-pace any periodic integrity checks), and
even modifying all of root's tools does not
preclude the installation of new ones, the only
way to really make a process unkillable is to
modify the kernel.  But if possible I wanted a
solution that didn't involve delving into the
kernel, for reasons of portability and keeping
it simple.</p>

<p>So I had to settle for the lesser goal of
"create a process that, if killed, will start
again immediately".  That's not too difficult:
edit /etc/inittab and get init(8) to restart the
process whenever it dies.  But the root user can
change /etc/inittab, and can also change the
executable file on disk, which could forestall
the process from properly starting again after
it's killed.</p>

<h3>Read-only filesystem</h3>

<p>To prevent such changes, both the executable
and /etc/inittab will have to go on a read-only
filesystem.  But it's not sufficient to take
just any filesystem and mount it read-only,
because root can simply remount it read/write.
You can however make an ISO image and mount that
as a loop device; this mount can't possibly be
remounted read/write, and changing the
underlying ISO file shouldn't affect the mounted
filesystem.  But you'd still have to stop root
from unmounting it and mounting something else
in its place (or unmounting/remounting it after
changing the ISO file).</p>

<p>You can stop a filesystem from being
unmounted by making sure that it's always busy,
i.e. there are processes whose current directory
is inside it.  But that doesn't stop the use of
"umount -l" (lazy unmount) which detaches the
filesystem from the hierarchy and postpones the
actual unmounting until it's no longer busy;
root can do a lazy unmount and mount something
else, and all new processes will see the new
version.</p>

<p>Actually that's not quite true: If root does
use "umount -l", then any currently-running
processes whose current working directory is in
the old mount can continue to see the files from
the old mount, and so can their child processes,
provided that they always refer to them from the
current working directory and not via an
absolute path.  If they use an absolute path
then they'll see the new mount.</p>

<p>So if we can get init(8) to run with the
mounted ISO as its current working directory,
and to execute our program from the current
directory instead of from an absolute path, then
it should not be possible to change the contents
of that ISO as far as init(8) is concerned, at
least not without rebooting or cracking the
kernel.</p>

<p>This can be done by moving /sbin/init to
/sbin/init.orig, and creating a new /sbin/init,
a shell script:</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash
mount /sbin/init.iso /init-mnt -o loop
cd /init-mnt
exec /sbin/init.orig $@
</pre>

<p>You will also need to ensure that future
package upgrades do not overwrite your
/sbin/init script with the original binary.</p>

<p>Then chmod +x that script, make the /init-mnt
directory, and use mkisofs to make the
/sbin/init.iso file containing any binaries you
want to run.  You can run scripts, but make sure
the interpreter binaries are in the ISO and that
/etc/inittab calls them from the current
directory, for example:</p>

<pre>AA:23:respawn:./python myscript.py</pre>

<p>(In the case of python you might also want to
ensure that it's reading its standard libraries
from the ISO rather than from anywhere else,
otherwise there could be a back door that
way.)</p>

<h3>Patching init</h3>

<p>Although it should now be impossible for root
to change your script without rebooting, it is
still possible for root to change /etc/inittab
and tell init to re-read it.  On most systems,
init is hard-coded to load /etc/inittab by
absolute path, which means you can't get around
this without patching init, either to make it
load inittab from the current working directory
or to prevent it from ever re-reading inittab
during its run.</p>

<p>You could hex-edit the init binary and change
the string, but the resulting system probably
won't boot.  It's better to download your
distribution's source package for "sysvinit" (or
whatever your distribution calls it), change
into its "src" directory, edit paths.h and
change "/etc/inittab" to "inittab", then type
"make" and move the resulting init binary to
where you want it.  Remember to put an inittab
file inside the ISO image: this is the inittab
file that will be used (not /etc/inittab), and
the only way to change it is to change the
underlying ISO file and reboot.</p>

<p>There is still another problem, however.  If
your process is killed too often, init will
refuse to restart it for a while.  You could
make it more aggressive whenever it restarts
(e.g. terminate all root shells and disable the
root account for a time to stop it from being
killed again too soon), but if root launches a
script that repeatedly scans the current
processes and kills yours, and that script's
loop is small and fast, then your process is not
likely to be able to get as far as stopping
it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the easiest way around this is to
treat the "respawning too fast" condition more
seriously.  For example, search the init source
for the part that prints the "respawning too
fast" message (in version 2.86 it's in init.c)
and add "exit(1);" after the statement's closing
semicolon.  This means, if any process respawns
too fast (for example because root is running an
aggressive script to stop your process from
running), init will exit, which will result in a
kernel panic and an unusable system.  Note
however that this also means the system will
crash if any inittab task respawns too fast due
to a typo, so be careful.</p>

<h3>Closing remarks</h3>

<p>In this article we have put together a way of
preventing even the root user from getting rid
of a certain process without rebooting.
However, there is still the issue of rebooting
itself.  You can't really stop root from
changing /sbin/init or /sbin/init.iso and
rebooting the system, especially if it's done
quickly without a proper shutdown, so reboots
had better be very noticeable.  If you want to
make things more difficult, though, you could
get your program to frequently check the stat()
of /sbin/init* for changes, taking care to do so
from the main thread (remember that if your
program goes multi-threaded then it may be
possible to kill some of the threads while
preserving others).  It would still be possible
to do things by booting from a rescue disk
however, and perhaps even without booting from a
rescue disk in some circumstances, so this is
not completely flawless.</p>

endeavor is tied to the filesystem layer. Projects such as <a

<h1>dotProject</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/jordan.html">Lee Jordan</a></b></p>

</p>

<p>

<h3>What is dotProject?</h3>

<p>
dotProject enables you to create, track, and maintain your projects online.
It provides enterprise-level project management tools that include contact
management, an email notification system, and an online system to create
and manage projects. The intuitive color codes indicate if you are headed
for hot water. It is created, maintained, and developed by volunteers like
you and me.</p>

<p>
dotProject is free to use. The software license is BSD, GNU General Public
License (GPL), which means it is free software provided as is with no
warranty. The full license should be available in the [filename path] where
your installation of dotProject resides. You can learn more about this type
of license at <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
When a user first logs in, they will see a personalized view of dotProject.
The screen will display the events and tasks they are members of, including
a full list of specific projects and tasks they are assigned to. The user
can navigate to different areas as specified on the navigation bar, which
will be displayed on the top or the left side of the screen. </p> 
<p>
<img width="569" height="400" src="misc/jordan/image1.jpg">
</p>
<p>
dotProject is an online project management application. You will need a
browser and either intranet or Internet access. dotProject is surprisingly
versatile. A few of the many things you can do in dotProject are: 
<ul>
<li> Set up a project and its tasks</li>
<li>  Communicate with everyone on the project team from within dotProject.</li>
<li> See projects as Gantt charts</li>
<li> Check task progress quickly with Calendar and Events</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
dotProject has great features for communicating with your contacts and
resources. Even so, it is not intended as a groupware tool. Groupware is
generally used to describe desktop or web-based applications that enable
users to work collaboratively. There are often forum, chat environments,
wikis, or email tools which are all-purpose in nature. Choosing a groupware
over a focused application could be compared to offering a guest a wide
variety of pies, cakes, and cookies for dessert when you know they have a
deep and abiding love for cheesecake with raspberry and chocolate sauce. 
</p>
<p>
dotProject is focused specifically on project management instead of being a
generic groupware application. It does contain forums, calendar, and email
functionality that are often associated with groupware tools, so that users
can collaborate for the purpose of project management. The phrase, "for the
purpose of project management" is the key difference between dotProject and
groupware. The narrow focus on the needs of those involved in managing
projects makes dotProject more useful to users than a generic tool. No
project is too large or too small, whether you are trying to get the band
back together or developing enterprise software projects. </p>

<p>
dotProject is useful in many ways. There are features of dotProject that
make using it a much more pleasant experience like user specific to-do
lists and events: when a user logs in, they immediately see what project
events they are involved in and what tasks are assigned to them. 
</p>

<h3>What are the Core Features of dotProject?</h3>

<p>
The answer will actually depend on what your company uses dotProject for. A
user with admin access has a great deal of control over what modules are
active, displayed, or hidden, and who can use them. If a particular set of
modules are not needed, they can be deactivated. There are 10 key features
that make up the core of dotProject. These are central to the dotProject
philosophy of creating an environment for users:
<ul>
<li> User Management</li>
<li> Email-based Trouble Ticket System (dotProject incorporates voxel dot net's Ticketsmith system</li>
<li> Client/Company Management</li>
<li> Project Listings</li>
<li> Hierarchical Task List</li>

<li> File Repository</li>
<li> Contact List </li>
<li> Calendar</li>
<li> Discussion Forum</li>
<li> Resource Based Permissions</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4> Core Features in Detail</h4>

<p>
<b> User Management: </b> A simple feature, for tracking user activity,
adding users, and managing users. User sessions showing date last logged in
as well as other information is available.</p>

<p>
<b> Email based Trouble Ticket System (Integrated voxel dot net's
Ticketsmith):</b> A ticket tracking system. Some use dotProject as a
helpdesk or combination CRM (Customer Resource Management) tool.</p>

<p>
<b> Email notification for assignees: </b>This feature is on by default
whenever a new task is created. User assignees will receive information
about the task they were assigned to unless you choose not to have the
notification sent.</p>

<p>
<b> Client/Company Management: </b>A digital rolodex of contact information
that can be used to identify projects that directly affect customers or
external clients. Basic default classifications and categories are already
set up in the Companies module. A tabbed interface allows users to quickly
see how many vendors, suppliers, and other types of companies are on the
list.</p>

<p>
<img width="600" height="394" src="misc/jordan/image2.jpg">
</p>

<p>
<b>Project listings: </b>Lists of projects are broken down by what state
they are in, such as all projects, proposed, planning, in progress, on
hold, complete, template, archived, not defined. You can quickly move from
tab to tab to view the state of the projects. The number of projects listed
in each state is in parenthesis on each tab.</p>

<p>
<img width="600" height="330" src="misc/jordan/image3.jpg">
</p>

<p>
<b>Layered project and task details: </b> The minimum amount you need to
know is displayed. Text links allow the user to drill down into the project
or task for more information if required. Tasks can also be organized by
precedence, dependencies, and time.</p>

<p>
<b>Hierarchical Task List:</b> Tasks are organized in a hierarchy, not just
arbitrarily listed. This is a very useful feature. Tasks can be dependent
on other tasks. </p>

<p>
<b>Instant Color Coded Progress:</b> Instantly see if your project is in
danger with intuitive color codes. If your task is highlighted with dark
pink or red, it is past due.</p>

<p>
<img width="600" height="253" src="misc/jordan/image4.jpg">
</p>

<p>
<b>File Repository:</b> The file repository is a central place to store
project documents. They can be viewed from the central repository or from
the project they are stored under. Files can be uploaded without being
associated with a specific project. They will appear under the All Projects
heading in the repository. I have found this feature invaluable for when I
wanted to make sure all stakeholders would be able to view key files or
code in case something happened. The file system strictly controls how
files are downloaded and uploaded. All files can be assigned a version
number. The check-in and check-out process can be confusing. We will spend
some quality time covering it in Chapter 3, where I will help you avoid the
embarrassing mistakes I have made using this feature.</p>

<p>
<b>Contact List:</b> The contact list can be used intuitively within
project listings themselves. This is a feature I am thankful for every time
I have to edit or create a new task.</p>

<p>
<b>Calendar:</b> The calendar has several display options, including a
three month mini calendar view, a day view, week view, and a comprehensive
month view. A full screen version of the calendar is only a click away on
the navigation bar. There you can see a holistic view of all the projects
and tasks. There is also a three month mini-calendar that displays on the
Today screen. </p>

<p>
<b>Discussion Forum:</b> The forum module can be used to share
project-specific news and information. It is integrated into dotProject.
Everyone can view what is said in the forum. Threaded discussion forums can
be created to discuss particular projects. All forums must be associated
with projects. Forums can be moderated, and follow a standard post topic,
reply, add new topic format. </p>

<p>
<b>Resource Based Permissions:</b> The permissions system in versions 2.0
and above is role based. It is granular, meaning there are many variations
that can be used to specify access to the areas you want and prevent
access. Users can have read-only access to certain modules by role.
Role-based permissions are intuitive. If most of the people using
dotProject will be project managers, a project manager role can be created,
and then individual users can be added to the system. Roles must be in
place before a user is added. Think of it as a job. A job must be created,
and then a person hired to fill the job position. This is a very important
feature. </p>

<p>
<b>User specific to-do lists and events:</b> When a user logs in, they
immediately see what project events they are involved in and what tasks are
assigned to them.</p>

<h3>Why dotProject is the Right PMA for You</h3>

<p>
So far we have examined what project management applications are, what they
should do, and taken a high level look at what features dotProject has to
offer. Determining what project management tool best suits an organization
calls for awareness of which features are critical and which are
negotiable.</p>

<p>
dotProject is the right choice for organizations that need a project
management application that has no fees, has a generous license agreement,
is stable, works on all the major browsers, has a supportive community, has
permissions that are granular, and is scalable. It is open source, not a
commercial application. There are no license fees, maintenance fees, or
purchasing fees. For organizations on a tight budget, the price is right. </p>

<p>
It has a history of integration with other popular open-source projects
such as PostNuke. It's modular. Use only the modules you need. Don't want
to use the Forums module? Disable it. It shares many advantages of other
open-source, developer maintained applications in that, it is relatively
lightweight, can be customized by users or by contracting with its
developers.</p>

<p>
dotProject does have limitations. Its focused approach may turn off those
looking for an all-in-one project development suite. There is no module for
creating diagrams, for example. The ability of dotProject to integrate with
other applications as part of a larger, customized group is a potential
solution.</p>

<h1>Installing Perl Modules as a Non-Root User</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/okopnik.html">Ben Okopnik</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
If you use Perl for anything more complex than the traditional (and boring)
generation of "Hello, World", then it's also likely that you're familiar
with those wonderful work-saving devices - Perl modules. Furthermore,
chances are that you're also familiar with CPAN, the <a
href="http://cpan.org/">Comprehensive Perl Archive Network</a>, and the
easy interface to it that is provided by the CPAN module. That all works
just great - assuming that you a) run a sensible modern OS like Linux, and
b) have root access to the machine you're using (or have a friendly and
cooperative sysadmin). But what if those assumptions don't hold true? What
if, for example, you have a shell account on a machine run by some
mega-corporation that doesn't feel like installing the
Foo::Bar::Zotz::Blagger-0.01 module in their /usr/lib/perl? I, for one,
can't blame them; a system-wide installation could open them up to unknown
bugs galore. When your interests and theirs conflict, you lose every time -
since they own the system.
</p>

<p>
So, what can we do if we really, really need that module but can't get it
installed on a system-wide basis? The answer is to install it elsewhere -
in some directory where you have write permissions.
</p>

<h3>Configuring the Environment</h3>

<p>
Clearly, if you're not root, you're not going to be able to save the files
to their default locations under '/usr/' - which is where they would
normally go.  Therefore, we need to tell Perl where to find the modules
that we'll install. Fortunately, this is the easy part: just decide on the
location where you'll install the modules, create that directory if it
doesn't already exist, append '/lib' to its name, and set the PERL5LIB
variable to that string. E.g., if you're using Bash, then edit your
~/.bash_profile and add the following:
</p>

<pre>
if [ -z "$PERL5LIB" ]
then
	# If PERL5LIB wasn't previously defined, set it...
	PERL5LIB=~/myperl/lib
else
	# ...otherwise, extend it.
	PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:~/myperl/lib
fi

MANPATH=$MANPATH:~/myperl/man

export PERL5LIB MANPATH
</pre>

<p>
Now, create the three necessary directories:
</p>

<pre>
mkdir -p ~/myperl/lib
mkdir -p ~/myperl/man/man{1,3}
</pre>

<p>
After you've logged out and back in, Perl will treat that location as a
part of @INC (the list of directories to search for libraries and modules.)
If you want to confirm that it's actually happened, just execute the
following and use your directory name as the argument to 'grep':
</p>

<pre>
perl -wle'print for grep /myperl/, @INC'
</pre>

<h3>Installing the Modules</h3>

<pre>
perl -MCPAN -we 'shell'
</pre>

<p>
First, you'll need to configure the CPAN module. If you've never done this,
it's really simple; just execute the above at your command line, and you're
on your way. Some people have referred to it as a "pecking chicken" install
(that is, if you set a chicken over the 'Enter' key and it then keeps
pecking at the key, it'll get through the installation successfully). For
our purposes, however, we need to make two small modifications to the
standard procedure: when the script asks you for any extra arguments for
Makefile.PL, you need to supply it with the following list (assuming that
you chose '~/myperl' as your private lib directory):
</p>  

<pre>
LIB=~/myperl/lib INSTALLSITEMAN1DIR=~/myperl/man/man1 INSTALLSITEMAN3DIR=~/myperl/man/man3
</pre>

<p>
You also need to make sure that the UNINST parameter is turned off; you can
do this by setting 'UNINST=0' when that question comes up during the
installation. (This is the default behavior unless you set it, but you
might as well make sure.)
</p>

<p>
If you had already configured the CPAN shell at some point in the past, you
simply need to modify the configuration. Again, start the shell as above,
and issue the following commands at the "cpan&gt; " prompt:
</p>

<p>
``
o conf makepl_arg "LIB=~/myperl/lib INSTALLSITEMAN1DIR=~/myperl/man/man1 INSTALLSITEMAN3DIR=~/myperl/man/man3"
o conf make_install_arg UNINST=0
o conf commit
''
</p>

<p>
and you're done. From this point forward, using the CPAN shell (or any of
the other CPAN functions and methods) should work just like usual:
</p>

<pre>
# Invoke the shell
perl -MCPAN -we shell

# Install the Net::FTP module
perl -MCPAN -we 'install "Net::FTP"'

# Update all outdated modules on this system
perl -MCPAN -we 'CPAN::Shell-&gt;install(CPAN::Shell-&gt;r)'
</pre>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
Both the CPAN module and its documentation - which are, incidentally,
included as part of the standard Perl installation - have always been good,
but they've become even better in the recent years. If you have not taken
the time to become familiar with them, you should do so, since the end result
will be a great savings in time and effort. The CPAN itself should also be
your first stop before you embark on any complex project - I've wasted many
an hour trying to accomplish some task only to find out later (or part-way
through the project, if I was lucky) that a module to perform that task
already exists. Give it a shot - and happy hacking!

<h1>Writing PostgreSQL Functions in C</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/peterson.html">Ron Peterson</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<h3 id="prereq">Introduction</h3>

<p>PostgreSQL is a powerhouse in its own right, but it is also
extensible.  You have a lot of options when it comes to extending
PostgreSQL.  You can use SQL, PL/pgSQL, PL/Tcl, PL/Perl, PL/Python, and
more.  Each option has its advantages.  C has the advantage of speed, of
course.  Because PostgreSQL itself is written in C, writing C code also
allows you to leverage some of PostgreSQL's own internal code.  Your C
code can also readily leverage any number of other programming
libraries.  C functions are also a stepping stone toward defining your
own new PostgreSQL base types. Ready to get started?  Great!  Because 
instead of trying to butter you up with a witty preamble, I'm going to 
take you straight to work.</p>

<hr><h3 id="prereq">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>You'll need a fairly recent version of PostgreSQL to follow along.
I'm not going to discuss PostgreSQL's older Version 0 calling
convention.  I'm also using the PGXS build system, which was introduced
in PostgreSQL version 8.0.  The packaged version of PostgreSQL included
with Debian Sarge or Redhat AS4 is older than that.  I have compiled and
used the code below on Debian Etch's packaged version, Fedora Core 6's
packaged version, and on my own compiled from source installation of
PostgreSQL 8.2.4.</p>

<p>If you are using your distribution's packaged version of the
PostgreSQL server, rather than rolling your own; you need to make sure
that you install the corresponding development package, for example:</p>

<pre>
Debian Etch:
  apt-get install postgresql-server-dev-8.1 postgresql-8.1
Fedora Core 6:
  yum install postgresql-server postgresql-devel
</pre>

<p>I'm going to assume you know the basics of how to configure and run
PostgreSQL.  If not, there are plenty of <a
href="#resources">resources</a> to help you get going. I also included
an example build script at the end of this article.</p>

<p>Obviously you'll also need a C compiler.  Make also comes in handy.
Unless, like Alan Cox, you are able to directly manipulate the bits
inside of your computer with your mind, you will also appreciate the use
of a keyboard and monitor.  I think we're ready now.</p>

<hr><h3 id="hello">Hello, World!</h3>

<p>This month I'll present a simple example, and follow-up with some
explanations.  We're going to write a function that takes a single text
argument, and appends it to the the string 'Hello, '.</p>

<p><pre>
prompt&gt; select hello( 'World!' );
     hello
---------------
 Hello, World!
</pre></p>

<p>Using your favorite editor (**cough**<a
href="#emacs">emacs</a>**cough**), create a file called example.c as
follows:</p>

<p><pre>
#include "postgres.h"
#include "fmgr.h"
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

#ifdef PG_MODULE_MAGIC
PG_MODULE_MAGIC;
#endif

Datum hello( PG_FUNCTION_ARGS );

PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1( hello );
Datum
hello( PG_FUNCTION_ARGS )
{
   // variable declarations
   char greet[] = "Hello, ";
   text *towhom;
   int greetlen;
   int towhomlen;
   text *greeting;

   // Get arguments.  If we declare our function as STRICT, then
   // this check is superfluous.
   if( PG_ARGISNULL(0) ) {
      PG_RETURN_NULL();
   }
   towhom = PG_GETARG_TEXT_P(0);

   // Calculate string sizes.
   greetlen = strlen(greet);
   towhomlen = VARSIZE(towhom) - VARHDRSZ;

   // Allocate memory and set data structure size.
   greeting = (text *)palloc( greetlen + towhomlen );
   VARATT_SIZEP( greeting ) = greetlen + towhomlen  + VARHDRSZ;

   // Construct greeting string.
   strncpy( VARDATA(greeting), greet, greetlen );
   strncpy( VARDATA(greeting) + greetlen,
            VARDATA(towhom),
            towhomlen );

   PG_RETURN_TEXT_P( greeting );
}
</pre></p>

<p>Now let's build this program, install it, and use it.  <a
href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/static/xfunc-c.html#DFUNC">Section
33.9.6</a> of the official PostgreSQL documentation explains the
details.  Unless you're doing something complicated, the
PostgreSQL Extension Building Infrastructure, aka PGXS, will probably
suffice.  Create the following Makefile in the same directory as your
code:</p>

<p><pre>
MODULES = example
PGXS := $(shell pg_config --pgxs)
include $(PGXS)
</p></pre>

<p>Run 'make' and then 'make install' as a user with permission to write
the example.so file you just made to the PostgreSQL server's lib
directory.</p>

<p>With the module in place, all that's left to do is to bind our
'hello' function inside of our example.so module to a SQL function that
we can use inside our database.  The following SQL will do the trick.
Put the following text in a file called 'example.sql'.</p>

<p><pre>
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION
  hello( TEXT )
RETURNS
  TEXT
AS
  'example.so', 'hello'
LANGUAGE
  C
STRICT
IMMUTABLE;
</p></pre>

<p>Open a database with the PostgreSQL interactive command line editor
'psql' as a user with permission to create new functions
(i.e. superuser).  Create your new 'hello' function by loading the
example.sql code above.  For example:

<p><pre>
prompt&gt; \i example.sql
CREATE FUNCTION

=&gt; CREATE TEMP TABLE test( name ) AS
-&gt; VALUES ('Xavier'), ('Yari'), ('Zack');

=&gt; SELECT hello( name ) FROM test;
    hello     
--------------
 Hello, Xavier
 Hello, Yari
 Hello, Zack
(3 rows)
</pre></p>

<hr><h3 id="review">What We Did</h3>

<p>What could possibly be cooler than that?!  Now let's review what we
did.</p>

<p>I'll begin by noting that there are actually two PostgreSQL C
language calling conventions: an older 'Version 0' convention and the
newer 'Version 1' convention.  I'm focusing exclusively on the Version 1
convention.</p>

<p>We begin by including postgres.h and fmgr.h.  There are other
PostgreSQL header files that you will need if you begin developing more
complicated code, but you can pretty much expect that you'll always need
at least these two.  The include statements are followed by a "magic
block".  This block is required as of PostgreSQL version 8.2.  This
statement ensures that the database doesn't load improperly
versioned object files.  The magic block is followed by our C function
declaration.  We can have as many functions in a single object file as
we like.  In this example, we only declare and define one function,
called 'hello'.  I like to put forward declarations of all my C
functions at the beginning of my code to avoid annoying compiler
warnings.  A quiet compiler is a happy compiler.  The
PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1 macro is required for all dynamically loaded Version
1 functions.  I actually have no idea what it does, but I know what
happens when you leave it out: nothing good.</p>

<p>And now at the beginning of our actual function
definition, we can see in the variable declarations that we're using a
PostgreSQL defined type: 'text'.  Of course there are other PostgreSQL
types worth knowing about as well.  <a
href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/static/xfunc-c.html#XFUNC-C-TYPE-TABLE">Table
33-1</a> in the official PostgreSQL documentation enumerates the C types
corresponding to built-in SQL types.  You should use PG_GETARG_xxx() and
PG_RETURN_xxx() functions to retrieve and return these values from your
function.  A few examples:</p>

<p><pre>
int32    PG_GETARG_INT32(0)     PG_RETURN_INT32(arg)
bytea *  PG_GETARG_BYTEA_P(0)   PG_RETURN_BYTEA_P(arg)
text *   PG_GETARG_TEXT_P(0)    PG_RETURN_TEXT_P(arg)
</pre></p>

<p>The argument to the GETARG functions indicates the position of the
argument in the function call.  The argument to the RETURN functions is
a variable containing data to be returned.  The _P suffix means
'pointer'.  Let's get our input.  Again, the GETARG arguments indicate
position.  So PG_ARGISNULL(0) refers to our first (and only) argument.
If that argument is NULL, we return NULL, and we're done.  Later, when
we look at the SQL we use to import our function, we'll see that
declaring our SQL function STRICT makes this NULL check superfluous, but
I like to include it anyway.  If our argument is not NULL, then we drop
through and use the PG_GETARG_TEXT_P macro to assign the first argument
(they are zero indexed) to our 'towhom' variable.</p>

<p>Variable length types such as bytea or text are always passed by
reference.  We then use macros to set and retrieve the data within our
variable length data types.  Let's take a quick look at the 'varlena'
data structure used internally by PostgreSQL to represent variable
length data structures.  This will help us understand how some of the
other macros we use operate.  (As an aside, the name of this structure
is where A. Elain Mustain <a
href="http://www.varlena.com/GeneralBits/68.php">got the name</a> for
her online PostgreSQL newsletter.)</p>

<p><pre>
struct varlena
{
  int32 vl_len;
  char  vl_dat[1];
};
</pre></p>

<p>The value vl_len member of this structure indicates how much data the
structure is holding.  The vl_dat member holds the data.  Pretty simple,
huh?  However, there's no reason to go poking at this structure
directly.  In fact, we should not assume that this structure even
exists.  Instead, we get and set variable length data with macros.  The
VARSIZE macro tells us the total size of our 'towhom' text.  The
VARHDRSZ macro is a constant, and represents the overhead consumed by
the vl_len member of our varlena structure.  So VARSIZE(towhom) -
VARHDRSZ gives us the number of octets in our text string.  We use the
VARATT_SIZEP macro to set the vl_len member of our 'greeting' text equal
to the size of the text string it's going to store.  Note that
PostgreSQL text strings are not null terminated.  The varlena data
structure obviates the need for an end of string delimiter.  The VARDATA
macro returns a pointer to the data member of our 'greeting' string.</p>

<p>Again: while it's educational to understand what's happening under
the hood, don't go poking around at PostgreSQL internals when you don't
have to.  Use the provided macros instead.</p>

<p>One last note about our C code.  Use 'palloc', not 'malloc'.
PostgreSQL's memory allocation function automatically takes care of
certain cleanup operations that would otherwise be impossible.  How
would you free the memory pointed to by a pointer that's returned from
our function, for example?  PostgreSQL takes care of this for us.
That's not to say we shouldn't free memory when we can.  Use the palloc
function's corresponding 'pfree' function to free memory when it's no
longer needed.</p>

<hr><h3 id="sql">Our SQL Function Definition</h3>

<p>Our CREATE FUNCTION call maps our C function to a corresponding SQL
function, which we will also call 'hello'.  Our SQL function is defined
to take a single TEXT argument, and to return a TEXT result.  We can
include more than one function inside a single object file, but for
today, our example.so file only includes our single 'hello'
function.</p>

<p>Our function is declared to be STRICT, meaning that it will return
NULL on NULL input.  This saves processing overhead (and makes our
functions's NULL checking superfluous, as already mentioned).  Our
function is also declared IMMUTABLE, which means that our function does
not modify the database, and that for any given input, the function will
always return the same output.</p>

<p>See the PostgreSQL documentation for <a
href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/static/sql-createfunction.html">CREATE
FUNCTION</a> for more details about this statement.</p>

<hr><h3 id="summary">Wrapping Up</h3>

<p>In my next article, I'll expand on this introduction to PostgreSQL C
programming.  I'll show how to use PGXS when you want to link against
external libraries, and I'll explain how to process tuple arguments.
I'll also show how to use the 'ereport' function to provide diagnostic
output while debugging C code that's running inside of a database.</p>

<p>Until then, you might want to take a look in the PostgreSQL
distribution's 'contrib' directory for more examples.  Even if you don't
understand all the code there, you'll almost certainly find something
you can use.  There's a lot of really excellent work in there.</p>

<hr><h3 id="install">Hasty PostgreSQL Installation HOWTO</h3>

<p>Here's the script I use to build PostgreSQL.  You'll need to make
sure you have the development versions of required libraries
installed, e.g. on Debian Sarge you'll need libpam-dev, libperl-dev,
etc.</p>

I like to symlink my versioned installation to /local/apps/postgresql
(so I can quickly change between minor version numbers by changing a
single symlink); then I symlink the binaries in /local/apps/postgresql
to a bin directory on my search path, somewhere where
ldconfig will find them (see /etc/ld.so.conf), and so on.

Create a PostgreSQL superuser and group (Typically 'postgres' &amp;
'postgres').  Create a directory for log files and for the database
which are owned by this user, and give that user write permission.

Here's a simple init script.  Use the 'init' function to create an empty
database.

<p><pre>
#!/bin/sh

VER=8.2
PGACCOUNT=postgres
POSTBIN=/local/bin
PGCTL=${POSTBIN}/pg_ctl
INITDB=${POSTBIN}/initdb
DATADIR=/db/postgres/${VER}
LOGFILE=/var/log/postgres/pg_ctl.log
ENCODING="SQL_ASCII"

# Set postgresql options in postgresql.conf

[ -f ${PGCTL} ] || exit 0

init () {
    echo -n "Initializing PostgreSQL database"
    echo
    su - postgres -c "${INITDB} -D ${DATADIR} -E $ENCODING"
    echo
}

start () {
    echo -n "Starting PostgreSQL..."
    echo
    su - postgres -c "${PGCTL} start -D ${DATADIR} -l ${LOGFILE}"
    echo
}

stop () {
    echo -n "Stopping PostgreSQL..."
    echo
    su - postgres -c "${PGCTL} stop -D ${DATADIR} -m smart"
    echo
}

restart () {
    echo -n "Restarting PostgreSQL..."
    echo
    stop
    sleep 5
    start
}

reload () {
    echo -n "Reloading PostgreSQL configuration..."
    echo
    su - postgres -c "${PGCTL} reload -D ${DATADIR}"
    echo
}

status () {
    echo -n "Checking PostgreSQL status..."
    echo
    su - postgres -c "${PGCTL} status -D ${DATADIR}"
}

case "$1" in
  init)
    init
    ;;
  start)
    start
    ;;
  stop)
    stop
    ;;
  restart)
    restart
    ;;
  reload)
    reload
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Usage: $0 {init|start|stop|restart|reload|status}"
    exit 1
esac

exit 0
</pre></p>

<p>I also like to give myself and root, ident authorization to run as the
'postgres' superuser (i.e. I like to be able to run 'psql -U postgres'
when I'm doing development work so I can get into the database quickly).
Append something like the following to
${your_db_directory}/pg_ident.conf:</p>

<p><pre>
amap          myusername          iddb
amap          myusername          myusername
amap          myusername          postgres
amap          postgres            postgres
amap          root                postgres
</pre></p>

<p>This presumes you have enabled ident authentication in pg_hba.conf,
like so:</p>

<p><pre>
local all all ident amap
</pre></p>

<p>That's a pretty hasty PostgreSQL installation HOWTO.  It's a little
off-topic, but I thought it might help jump start a potential proselyte
or two.</p>

<hr><h3 id="emacs">Emacs Errata</h3>

<p>I'm a big fan of SQL Mode for Emacs (see <a
href="#resources">Resources</a> below).  I run split windows, and use
keyboard shortcuts to run bits of the SQL I'm editing in my *SQL*
buffer.  However, I've always found that sql.el needs a little tweak.
The problem is that when you run 'M-x sql-postgres', it won't prompt you
for a user name.  Unless you always want to connect to the database as
your shell account username, or unless you exclusively use ident
authentication, you'll want to fix this.  Find sql.el on your system,
and edit the PostgreSQL section as follows:</p>

<p><pre>
< (sql-get-login 'database 'server)
> (sql-get-login 'database 'user 'server)

> (if (not (string= "" sql-user))
>   (setq params (append (list "-U" sql-user) params)))
</pre></p>

<p>Run 'byte-compile-file' to create sql.elc.  If you enter nothing at
the 'User:' prompt, you will connect as the current user.  If you want
to use PostgreSQL's ident authentication (assuming you have this
configured in PostgreSQL's pg_hba.conf and pg_ident.conf), leave the
'Server:' prompt blank.  Enter a server name and a password if you are
doing host based authentication.</p>

<em>
<p>
Samuel Kotel Bisbee-vonKaufmann was born ('87) and raised in the Boston, MA
area. His interest in all things electronics was established early as his
father was an electrician. Teaching himself HTML and web design at the age
of 10, Sam has spiraled deeper into the confusion that is computer science
and the FOSS community, running his first distro, Red Hat, when he was
approximately 13 years old. Entering boarding high school in 2002,
Northfield Mount Hermon, he found his way into the school's computer club,
GEECS for Electronics, Engineering, Computers, and Science (a recursive
acronym), which would allow him to share in and teach the Linux experience
to future generations. Also during high school Sam was abducted into the
Open and Free Technology Community (<a
href="http://www.oftc.org">http://www.oftc.org</a>), had his first article
published, and became more involved in various communities and projects.
</p>

<p>
Sam is currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Boston University and
continues to be involved in the FOSS community. Other hobbies include martial
arts, writing, buildering, working, chess, and crossword puzzles.  Then there
is something about Linux, algorithms, programing, etc., but who makes money
doing that?
</p>

<p>
Sam prefers programming in C++ and Bash, is fluent in Java and PHP, and while
he can work in Perl, he hates it. If you would like to know more then feel free
to ask.

Anybody who knows me knows how inappropriate this is.  What would I do
with a car, put it in my living room?  Note the terms: you pay a fee
and $10,000 deposit, we "promise" to return the deposit if your car(s)
don't win the auction.  "We cannot put prospective business partner
funds in our bank account,that's why we will be using e-gold payment
only."
</p>

<p>
This does count as the first time I've heard of anybody actually using
e-gold for anything.

&gt; Quoting the most recent press release on the VA $WHATEVER Web site:
&gt; 
&gt;   VA Software Corporation (Nasdaq: LNUX), the online media, software, 
&gt;   and e-commence leader in community-driven Open Source innovation, 
&gt;   today announced that Scott E. Howe has joined the company's Board 
&gt;   of Directors effective March 7, 2007. Howe brings more than eight
&gt;   years of experience in the areas of internet media, technology, and
&gt;   advertising.
&gt;   [...]
&gt;   Howe is President for DRIVE Performance Media, a division of
&gt;   aQuantive, Inc. aQuantive is a global digital marketing company and the
&gt;   parent company of interactive agencies, performance media and behavioral
&gt;   targeting businesses, and providers of integrated digital marketing
&gt;   technologies throughout the world. [...]
&gt; [...] 
&gt; In other words, one of the many firms quietly making money off
&gt; "metrics", i.e., spying on the user, data-mining / data sales,
&gt; consequent targeted advertising, etc., "integrated digital marketing
&gt; technologies" being one of the standard corporate euphemisms for spying.
</pre>

<p>
Apparently, Microsoft Corporation badly, badly wanted a ride on the same
bus, because they just acquired qQuantive for SIX GIGABUCKS (US $6 x 10^9).
</p>

<p>
US readers can be excused if they've become blase about huge dollar
figures after years of underwriting BushCo Federal budgets, but some
context may help:  Microsoft's _total equity_ is $34.9 x 10^9.  So, they
just sunk 1/6 of the full net value of their firm into this purchase.
</p>

<p>
(MSFT common stock took a $1 hit to $30.6, but is still near 7-year highs.)
</p>

<p>
Hmm, sudden, massive market diversification immediately following the
firm's annual Be Very Afraid Tour?[1]  Maybe a sign that those
unspecified patents are mostly crap, and that they fear increasing
danger to the monopoly gravy-train?

Western kind of 419 scam.  Note the empty addressee name.
</p>

<p>
---------- Forwarded message ----------
</p>

<p>
Dear,
</p>



<p>
My name is Grace Smith, I am 24 years old, from London - England,
where I school and work as a fashion designer for part time job I do
after my school. I am the only daughter of my parents my father died
on a fatal auto accident on his way to see my sick mother at the
hospital where she was admitted for Cancer treatments, she also die
when she heard about the death of my father in same day and hospital.
</p>



<p>
Before the death of my father, he had Willed part of his Real Estate
Business, Gas Stations and a total sum of =A350,700,000.00(Fifty
Million, Seven Hundred Thousand Pounds Sterling) to me. Now at his
death, and because things has become very hard for me paying my school
fees, putting food on the table and taking care of my other needs
which my fashion designer work I do as a part time work after my
school can't help, I went to the bank where my late father deposited
the funds on my behalf to with draw money to take care of my self and
pay for my school fees and other bills.
</p>



<p>
I was shocked when the Bank Manager explained to me that I will  not
be able to draw from the deposited money, because my father had
putting a clause on the Will, which he used in depositing the funds
with them, saying that before I will be given access to the money, I
will either have to be 30 years old or I will be given access to the
money, if I get married before the age of 30 , in which case, my
husband will be legible to collect the money on my behalf by standing
in as my late fathers next of kin to claim the deposited funds on my
behalf.
</p>



<p>
Today I am only 24 years old. And I have no access to the money till
I'm 30 years. So, I'm contacting you to stand in as my husband to
claim this fund on my behalf if you are married already, you can still
help me by standing in as my late fathers next of kin to the deposited
funds. So, please get back to me as to know how you will be
remunerated as I will part with 40% of the total sum =A350,700, 000.00
(Fifty Million, Seven Hundred Thousand Pounds Sterling) ,while 10%
will be mapped out for any expenses that we're to use to receive the
money from the deposited Bank.
</p>



<p>
Please remember that I am writing you this email purely on the ground
of trust so we can achieve this deal together. This transaction will
last for two weeks after you get back to me on how serious you are to
claim these funds on my behalf.
</p>




<p>
Yours Truly,
Grace Smith
