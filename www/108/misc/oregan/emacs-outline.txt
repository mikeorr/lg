Emacs outline mode

* Emacs has a built in outliner
http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki?OutlineMode

** Like Vim Outliner:

Simple text format
Can be used from the CLI
Can fold sub branches
HTML converter available

** Unlike Vim Outliner:

Simpler format (Leading asterisks for headings!)
Built in?? (At least it is on my system)

** Usage:

M-x outline-mode

C-c C-a show all
C-c C-t show only the headings
C-c C-s show subtree at cursor location
C-c C-d hide subtree at cursor location

* Completely unrelated

And smart. And a clever writer."
