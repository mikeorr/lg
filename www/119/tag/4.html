Thanks for the link. I am also grateful to both Thomas and Mike Orr to
let me/us know about their valuable experience about different WMs as
well as  their positive as well as negative ( I should use less feature)
sides. specially Mike's reply makes me sentimental for going back to
KDE -:))) . but at the same time I have a question in my mind ( may be
a common question ) that we generally, I repeat generally don't go for
a H/W up-gradation frequently. I used my first self-assembled PC for
roughly 10 years. KDE  becomes gradually more hungry as a result fatty
too -:) . so it may happen that KDE makes your 2/3 years old H/W ( cpu,
RAM) obsolete . and then you may fell switching over to other small and
fast WM to continue with your existing H/W. only KDE themselves allow you
to continue with KDE by providing fast and a little fatty code.

Well, yes.  My own opinion is that you shouldn't have to upgrade your
PC from a few years ago, to satisfy the working of KDE (or some other
application.)  If it is programmed well, then it ought to handle
lower-end system just fine.  I suspect it's a trade-off though between
users wanting more features, and the fact that the developers of KDE
themselves have a lot of new shiny hardware, such that they're not
aware of the slowness issues on older hardware.

definitely they have latest H/W , so they don't bother about the older
-:(. but the term <EM>latest</EM> depends on time factor. those who have <EM>latest</EM>
H/W have no problem to run KDE. and soon their H/W become older with respect
of KDE . so if KDE doesn't control its intention to become more hungry and
fatty , it gets new users who own <EM>latest</EM> H/W at the same time loose its
users who had <EM>latest</EM> H/W once with respect to KDE and are not able to do
frequent up-gradation for KDE.

"The trend in desktops, across all operating systems has been to
continuously add features and graphics with each new release.
Unfortunately, cool icons, animation and complicated multi-paned
desktops have usually required increasingly capable machinery. For
various reasons, Linux desktops seemed to have suffered less from this
performance crunching bloat than other packages, such as Windows XP.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
KDE 3.1 has actually reversed the trend. To prove my point, I loaded it
on an antique 133 Mhz. Pentium desktop machine. The box had 128 MB of
RAM, 256K of L2 cache, a 2.5 GB disk and <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>. Even though KDE took
about two and 1/2 minutes to load, most of the programs, menus, icons
and animations seemed to appear almost instantly and ran without a hitch."

Of course it runs faster -- it's a WM and not a DE.  That, and DEs tend
(not always, but in the case of KDE it does) load up core libs that are
needed to run a small part of KDE (or sometimes a large one) that you
might never use.  Then there's konqueror -- the libs for that are much
the same.  So you can see how the memory factor escalates as time
increases.  You want to know how I got on the "straight and narrow",
eh?  Well, read on:

This was the first ever distro I used. I has absolutely no idea what I
was doing, but I do remember being able to get XFree 3.x up and
running, having spent a few months prior to that using the console, as
I really didn't know any better.

When X started, up popped twm. Coming from a Windows background at the
time, I thought that maybe I had broken my computer. Whilst something
had obviously loaded, it was not what I was expecting. The menus were
not very well defined, and for me to see them, I had to click and hold
the mouse button. Hardly user-friendly...

... or so I thought. But at the time, I just assumed twm was all there
was. I got to know it, and tweak things about it. Surprisingly enough,
twm is more customisable than people tend to realise. Ok, so I know the
default look-and-feel of it is enough to make anyone vomit (the green
really does remind me of the sea), but if one goes digging about
~/.twmrc, it becomes obvious of the things one can change about twm. I
started off by changing the colour, to a deep red. Since the foreground
colours were white, the contrast this gave was pleasing to me.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Twm also has an icon manager. I didn't know this was the name of it,
and why should I? Whenever I iconified a window, it just appeared on
the root window as a text label almost. But even that's customisable...
The end result, was that although very primitive, it functioned, and I
was happy with it.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I ended up staying with twm for about a year. I didn't know any
different, and it was only after leaving Slackware, for this then new
distribution RedHat, that things changed slightly...

Anyone reading this that knows me, will laugh at the thought of me ever
trying KDE, let alone using it. But it's true, one might say, almost
unavoidable that I would use it at some point. Of course, I'm referring
to KDE 1.x the version of KDE that actually worked. My main PC (up
until very recently) was a P166. KDE 1.x actually ran on it at a not
unreasonable speed, all things considered. KDE was still in its infancy
compared to the over-weighted and monsterous beast it has become
today).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
But (and you can quote me on this) I liked KDE 1.x. I liked its style,
and speed, even on a P166 and that matters when that machine was old,
even when I was using it. Compared to the twm jail-house I had been in
previously, this thing was immense.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Sure, I had a few issues with it. I remember distinctly that the icons
on the desktop were tempermental. One moment they'd work, and the next
moment, they wouldn't, or they'd disappear completely, etc. But I
didn't let this bother me too much. It was useable. It worked very much
like windows, which meant I didn't have to think about what I was doing
-- KDE made all the choices for me.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I then switched distros a lot thereafter.  I tried <A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</A>, and various
other WMs, before settling on FVWM -- actually, this was on RH4 using
their 'AnotherLevel' package.  (The Lesstif theme)

It is more common now than it used to be.  For years RH (through
releases 4-6) pushed FVWM into the forefront.  Indeed, the classic
"desktop" competition that RH held in 1996 spawned the (in my eyes)
infamous AnotherLevel theme.  How I loved it.  It was only very
recently (say RH 8 onwards) that used KDE as the de facto upon
installation.  Although now that GNOME is the GNU desktop, that has
seen its way to the top on some distros (Ubuntu is noticeable for
this.)

The first

computer lab replaced its h19 terminals with X-terminals.  I thought
it was a ridiculous waste of money at the time.  The terminals came
with a built-in window manager (Motif) and a menu to telnet into the
frequently-used hosts.

Nice bit of history you've detailed there, Mike.  I'd really love to
see an article of how Unix was used in the past.  Now, with PCs so
cheap and popular, it's all the same method.  You don't often hear of
people saying they're using a dumb-terminal (unless they have an XDMCP
server running.)

The tradeoff was it
took more CPU time on the host, so after eight hours you got nice'd
and things slowed way down.  That was late 1990.  Most of what is
now blogs and chatting and eBay was done on Usenet.  I'd go down
Friday evening to read news and get home Saturday afternon.  We
didn't really use the GUI at all except to set the background
image and run a clock.

The speed issue is largely dependant on a number of things, Joydeep.
Typically, it could be that you're running extraneous applications
along with the window manager you're loading, or it might be that the
WM itself is loading them, providing you with the default theme it
ships with (Englightenment used to do this -- no wonder I hated it.)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Indeed, I often get asked this question about FVWM -- and why that's so
slow.  Typically in FVWM's case, it can usually be attributed to the
over use of colorsets.  Colorsets (in FVWM parlance) are a means of
specifying (in a lot of detail) the colours that can be assigned to
various parts of a window (and all aspects thereof) as well as
background colours.  Colorsets can be told to use gradient colours, and
the like, that, on lower-end systems take up a lot of memory.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Also, colorsets when used with transparency can cause a slow-down, due
to the way the Xserver handles it  (remember that colour management is
the responsibility of the Xserver.)  You can tell colorsets to buffer
the transparent images as well -- this can be slow.  Where colorsets
use pixmaps (and other graphics colours as opposed to single block
colour) then more memory is used.  Indeed, when specifying colorsets in
FVWM the numbering is important.  If one were to use:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>Colorset 100 fg white, bg blue
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Then in memory, there would be allocated space for <EM>101</EM> colorsets,
irrespective of whether they've been defined or not -- so keeping the
numbers low,  in their definition is often important.  (I'll be
discussing colorsets in FVWM properly in an article.)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
But I digress.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
There are of course, some general things one can try to reduce
slowness.  It's not so much of a problem on 2.6 kernels (as the
scheduler is much better), but the Xserver used to be reniced when it
was running so that it was more responsive -- but such things waere
only ever negligable at best -- and renicing a process is NOT a general
ideal to making things run faster -- but for really low-end systems, it
<EM>might</EM>.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Going back to the subject of colour, running one's Xserver with a low
colour-depth is advisable, something like:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>startx -- -bpp 16
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Which can reduce memory consumption.  Note that colour-handling in FVWM
(and colour limiting, where it is applicable) is now done automatically
in FVWM where those applications try and steal the entire
colour-pallette (netcape 4 used to be notorious for this.)

I suppose you mean where the window has a different palette than the
window manager, so everything around the window turns psychedelic colors
when you move the mouse into the window.

colour palette (of a window) and that of the overall Xserver.  :)

That was cool too.  We used to
do it on purpose just to watch the colors change.  (Stop snickering,
Ben.)  It wasn't just Netscape.  I think xloadimage (an image viewer
that comes with X) did it too.  It's not "stealing" the palette.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

Indeed not.  Where a palette is "stolen" what tends to happen is that
the application defaults to black and white.

<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

It's
just a fact of life that if the image has a different palette than the
environment, one of them will have the wrong colors.  The program
rightly assumes that if the mouse is in its window, you want to see that
image properly.  Of course, now that everybody's video card has enough
memory for 16 million colors, palettes don't matter anymore.

I'd agree, except for the fact that palettes <EM>do</EM> matter, as they're
ultimately affected by the overall colour-depth the Xserver runs in.  I
don't run mine in so-called "true-colour".  Mine's in 16 bit (sometimes
eight.)  But then I don't have a great graphics card... :)

That's a fair comparison.  Mind you, when you wrote it, what was you
thinking when categorising by speed?

The delay between when you initiate an action and it happens.  KDE
opens and closes windows noticeably slower than FVWM.

Ah, I see.  That <EM>might</EM> be to do with how the windows are decorated in
KDE.  But I can't say for sure  (typically what happens is that the WM
will grab the window before it is mapped <em>  visibly  </em> onto the screen --
and then apply the decorations.  The details of which I am not about to
delve into.  :P)

You'll notice a direct tradeoff between speed and features, and between
using xlib directly vs a widget library.  But xlib programs also look
like crap and have idiosyncratic input behavior (whether you can tab
between fields or press Enter for OK, whether you can replace text by
selecting it, etc), so there's another tradeoff.
</blockQuote>

Umm, yes, but the speed of the window manager (at the root level)
depends how it is implemented.  Most WMs have to be written in Xlib if
they have any chance of running smoothly.  But the speed of the WM
doesn't care for what widget set the application was written in.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Well, let's see.  Most of the x* apps that are bundled with the XFree86
release are written using the Xt widget set (one level of abstraction
up from pure Xlib.)  Yes, they might look ugly, but there's some things
you can do to "tart" them up.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
X apps should (where they've been programmed properly) respond to
resource settings.  These are values held on the Xserver that makes
customisation of the application's widgets available to other uses of
the program.  When the Xserver loads, it will often process the files
stored in:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
... the program responsible for that is 'xrdb'.  Indeed, like any
command one can customise it for theirselves.  Whereas most commands
when they load look for a config file in $HOME to use instead of the
global-wide one, xrdb doesn't since one can use multiple files for
different programs.  Instead, one can use a ~/.Xresources file or a
~/.Xdefaults file (they're the same file -- one is often a symlink to
the other.)  As to what they can contain, let's take an example.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
xclock.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
That's a simple application.  If we wanted to, say, tell it to use a
red background, then to our ~/.Xresource file, we could add:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>xclock*background: red
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
... and note that the syntax.  The "*" matches anything after xclock in
the resource name, whereas, I could have used:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>xclock.background: red
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
... which would have stopped the matching at the full word 'xclock'.
The colours are looked up via the RGB.txt file, so as long as the
colour names are listed there, things will be fine.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Note that it's traditional amongst resource names to be lower case.
Indeed, the resource name can be ascertained via the 'xprop' command
(or FvwmIdent module, should you use FVWM.)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Going back to the xrdb file though -- save it.  In order for those
values to be applied to the server, we have to tell xrdb to load the
file.  The command that <EM>should</EM> be used is:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
... indeed, that does what you think it does.  If you were to use:
"xrdb -load ~/.Xdefaults" --- that would work, but you'd overwrite the
global definitions stored in <TT>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults</TT> -- so
-merge is always the best one to use.  I also add this to my
~/.xsession file.

Another question is memory.  Your computer (1.5 GHz, 256 MB) is passable
for KDE, but another 256 MB would be more comfortable.

I tried wm2 and
other minimal window managers, assuming they would use less memory than
FVWM, but they didn't.  So FVWM is amazingly efficient given its wide
configurability.

It's fast because a lot of the more "niftier" features aren't part of
the core FVWM -- they're modules.  All that's in the FVWM core is
enough to get FVWM useable, without bloating it out.

And the speed it pops up windows and restores them is
about as snappy as you can get without losing the "overlapping windows"
paradigm.

There's lots you can do about that.  Overlapping windows can be a thing
of the past, depending on the window placement policy in use.  In FVWM
parlance:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>style * MinOverLapPlacement
</pre></blockquote>

Windows 1.0 had only tiled windows,
meaning a window could never cover another, and they all covered 100% of
the screen so there was never a background peeking through.

Not quite. It was the default for each application to use the full screen,
but it was possible (if damn near unworkable) to have multiple programs
overlapping.

larswm returns to this as a way to maximize productive space and performance,
although it also allows some windows to "float".  Normally you'd use tiled
windows for xterms, editors, your clock/biff/meter panel, etc, and floating
windows for graphical applications like Firefox and the GIMP.

That sounds like an interesting way of working, actually.  Was that the
default way of working under larswm?  (I'll try it under FVWM and see
if I like it.  I currently use 'MinOverLapPlacement', and although I
have 9 pages avilable, they almost all look too cluttered, and feel it
in operation.)

<blockQuote>

... tries to achieve that.  That will try and place windows in a linear
fashion filling up as much screen as it can, as in:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>[window1     ][window2]
[window3][window4][win5]
[         window6      ]
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
... one can set placement penalties -- to place windows away from
others, based on the edge of them and such like -- I don't want to go
into too much detail as it can get boring.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Other placement policies one can use is:  "TileCascadePlacement", that
works like MinOverLapPlacement, but will start tiling window, when all
of the available screen space has been used.  There's countless
others...

I'm mostly satisfied with KDE.  Of course, everybody wishes it started
up faster and opened windows faster.  But the features, themability, and
integration is a good tradeoff.  As the KDE developers have pointed out,
KDE is "bloated" only in the sense that it has more features.

You haven't spent years struggling to get programs to input and display
non-English characters.   Every program did it differently, you needed
special fonts, and some programs didn't do it well at all.

considerably easier, I'm sure.)

Now with KDE
you just click the keymapper icon in the bottom right and the keyboard
changes language.  I don't use that feature -- I got so burned out that
I do everything in ASCII now -- but it's nice that it's there without
having to dig through a HOWTO and configure a bunch of programs.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

But the
features are implemented efficiently, compared to running equivalent
programs standalone.  konsole with one session uses more memory than
xterm, but konsole with two or three sessions uses less memory than two
or three xterms, and it has convenient tabs and font selection.
FVWM can't be beaten for manual window placement (why doesn't KDE have
that?), and it's more intelligent about not giving new background
windows the focus when you don't want it to.  On the other hand, it only
has one flat list of windows per desktop, whereas KDE groups them by
application.  The latter is important when you have fifty GIMP windows
open, a couple konsole sessions and a few Firefox windows.  And FVWM can
show windows without decorations -- e.g., biff and transparent oclock --
and you can use the root menu to move them or kill them.  But you have
to set up the menus yourself (unless you're using Debian, which has a
WM-independent menu configuration).  But I like KDE's panel and klipper
and grouped window list, so that usually clinches it for me.

But speed isn't the only criterion.   If speed is the only thing you
care about, try one of the minimalistic window managers like larswm
(<A HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~lab1701/larswm"
