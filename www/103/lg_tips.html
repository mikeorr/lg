<P>
I am a little bit concerned the people here (especially those that are
more established) don't fully understand what constitutes a 2c-tip. A
2c-tip is just that -- something that is short and easy and can be done
in a few steps. Asking whether it is appropriate (Neil!) just causes us
more grief to wade through meta questions!
</P>
<P>
This might be in the form of a configuration tweak, or a minuture
program that performs a given task, etc. Often though, larger tips are
turned into TAG column entries -- and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
Often what would be flagged by Heather and I as a TAG entry might well
form off-shoots to 2c-tips if the quality of the thread in question is
not worthy.
</P>
<P>
But we will publish anything not only explicitly marked as a 2c-tip, but
also what we deem appropriate to be one. We certainly don't filter out
sent in tips -- only vary rarely. The only thing I will say to you is
that don't always expect to submit one and see it in the next
release of LG. Heather and I decide which tips get published when.
</P>
<P>
Send them in.... you know you want to.

Between these two lists, I figured my problem out.  My TZ87 tape drive
works perfectly under Linux.  I found a product called vmsbackup that
allows unix users to extract plain-text files from a VMS backup tape.
If anyone else is interested in such a piece of arcana, it can be
downloaded from <A HREF="http://vms.process.com/ftp/vms-freeware/FREE-VMS"
	>http://vms.process.com/ftp/vms-freeware/FREE-VMS</A>.  I
had to hack the code (can't use any other word than that, as I'm not a C
coder at <EM>all</EM>) to eliminate certain files from being attempted.  Once I
did all that, every came off the tape nice and clean.

<br>Answered By  Kapil Hari Paranjape, Jim Dennis

<P><STRONG>
Well, my problem is a little bit different. I'm building up a network at home and I want all computers with Windows 2000 and also Linux. Every computer is working ok with both operating systems, but the server. The two operating systems are installed already but, linux is not showing up. You go to the cmos setup and see Linus there in its own partition. But when the computer is booting, it doesn't show up and no way to boot from Linux. Now, even Windows is not showing up. After a few steps, [ counting memory, detecting drivesetc, it gets stuck ]
Could you give me a hint to solve this?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Kapil] 
I sense some serious confusion. How can the CMOS show you partitions,
let alone Linus (I presume you mean Linux)? Even the BIOS setup doesn't
know anything about the operating systems.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. Try to use a rescue floppy (your created one at install time didn't
you?!) to boot your system. If you don't have any such alternate method
to boot the existing system you may have no choice but to re-install.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
2. When you run a server, it doesn't really make sense to run two
different O/Ses on it. How would the clients/users know before
connecting what they could expect from the server?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[JimD]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Your question doesn't quite make sense.  You can't see partitions or
OS installations from your CMOS Setup.  You can see drives.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So when you say things like: "linux is not showing up" and that you
"see Linus[sic] there" and "it doesn't how up" it's not clear what
you're looking at, where you're expecting to see it.  You say that
"you go to the cmos setup" but as I've said a normal BIOS setup
doesn't display partitions and doesn't provide a list of installed
or available OS' or other boot options.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So you must be looking at a bootloader (LILO, GRUB, System Commander,
ChOS, NT's "Boot Manager" or something else.  So, figure out which
bootloader you're trying to use.  You could also try booting from a
rescue disk like Knoppix, Tom's Root/Boot, the LNX-BBC or whatever and
using that to install a different boot loader like LILO.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It sounds like you'll need help with that, too. Without more details
about which distribution you installed, the order in which you
installed Linux and Win2K etc. (Hint: install Microsoft products first,
then let Linux work around their settings).

Hi everyone,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Multiple people using the same machine configuration and it's programs is a
wonderfull thing. Especially when the other people want to be at their own
machine and not install linux on their machine. There Exceed starts to be
very effective. So far so good.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Now the problem. I updated my pc from Mandrake 8 to 9.1(standard kernel). I
had XDCMP Xclients working on MDK 8 before. That worked perfectly. Now I have
xdm partially configured and I am able to login at the remote PC graphically,
but then the server seems to be giving the client one screen/window for the
desktop, one for each program and so on. I used to get one integrated thing
completely filling the client PC's physical screen as if using Linux in stead
of Windows with Exceed.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Anyone knowing what I have to change(or where to look) to get things identical
to the "local" behaviour?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Does anyone know some place to find some good backgrounds on Xserver, Xfs and
X in general?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks for your time,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Kapil] 
Let A be the client program (the "Xserver" which can be full screen or smaller)
which in your case is Exceed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Let B be the server system with which A is communicating which in your
case is a GNU/Linux Mandrake machine.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
B makes requests to A to create and destroy Xobjects; the actual
placement, rendering and so on of these objects is a matter for A to
decide.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So I do not think the problem you have given has to do with the Mandrake
Server (B). Instead look at the configuration of the Exceed software (A).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Also have a look at the XWindow-Overview-HOWTO.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><STRONG>
The very strange thing is I never changed the config of B. And after I did now
the situation did not much improve(no improvement actually). Any more hints?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Because there's more than just xdm I also tried gdm, kdm and kde (editing
<TT>/etc/sysconfig/desktop</TT>)
Turning to kde or kdm has a strange extra effect logged in <TT>/var/log/messages:</TT>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Chris] 
It's been a while.  I used Exceed Version 7 for grins.  If I recall, in the
configuration options (I think it was screen), I had a choice between
multiple windows or a single window.  With multiple windows, you get the
wonderful Microsoft background with a new window popping up with each
application.  With the single window choice, you see what you would if
you were running X on the Linux machine.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For example, I set up Exceed to run in passive mode listening on port 6000.
I then telnet into the Linux machine, set my DISPLAY name to refer to
the appropriate host with window 0 (for example "export DISPLAY=nitro:0"),
and might (from the telnet session) type "icewm &amp;".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
That's the way I do it.  Hmmm.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I'm guessing that you might wanna see the graphical login, so, I am hoping
that all you have to do is the single window selection thing, and things
will work.  I hope.

[blink] Joydeep... how do you do that if you're not familiar with even
the very basics of finding information under Linux? I really don't envy
your students the quality of information they're receiving. The above
may sound harsh, but given the questions you've posted to this list over
time - including this one - and the skills required for teaching
(considered independently from the actual content), I find the above
statement highly incongruous with your level of knowledge.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
ReiserFS isn't what I'd call "new". You can find out about the various
filesystems by looking at the relevant HOWTOs - the Filesystems-HOWTO,
the ext3-(mini,usage)-HOWTOs - and the kernel documentation, usually
available (if you have the kernel sources installed) in
"<TT>/usr/src/kernel-source-&lt;version&gt;/Documentation/filesystems</TT>, with each
type of supported FS having its own explanatory file.

well -- whatever mechanical desktop is, if  its a win only application
you'll need windows.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If it's not very hardware intensive you might get away in an emulator
(e.g. wine). Then there is (commercial) vmware which runs a virtual PC inside
linux (which can run windows). Or you change to a dual boot system Linux/win.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Dual boot system are best set up right from the beginning. Messing around
with partitions after everything is installed is always risky. You can try
(commercial) PartitionMagic to repartition.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
What partition layout would be useful (or possible) depends on how it is now
and what you want. Usually I would put firs the win partition and then only
the Linux partitions (note plural), often in an extended partition. If you've
one huge Linux partition now I don't know if you can free the beginning -- it
might be restricted to free the top end.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well -- messing around (successfully) with partitions takes at least some
knowledge of partitions on PC systems. This is not (very) specific to Linux,
but of course all the Linux tool behave a little different from the old DOS
tools (like fdisk, format,...).

<br>Answered By  Thomas Adam

<P><STRONG>
Hello,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Originally it started as a non-Linux problem. I had to interconnect two
Windows95 machines via a serial link using the Direct Cable Link function.
However those machined refused to connect (of course, what else could I
expect from M$ products...). After several hours of unsuccessful experiments
I finally booted Linux on one of these machines and after five minutes of
playing with pppd I had the Windows95 and Linux up-and-connected perfectly.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
However, the serial link was too slow because of an old UART, so I thought
of using a parallel cable instead, with Win95 at one side of the link and
Linux at the another. But here I have a bigger problem. The Direct Cable
Link in Windows always uses PPP protocol, no matter what type of cable it is
used over. However, as it seems, the pppd daemon under Linux supports serial
ports only. I could not force it into using the parallel port, neither lp0
nor parport0. This is the only answer I got from it:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
Aug  2 14:20:44 gericom pppd[11246]: pppd 2.4.1 started by root, uid 0

Aug  2 14:20:45 gericom pppd[11246]: Exit.
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I did my Google homework but I couldn't find any clues how to use PPP
protocol over parallel port under Linux and there is no mention of anything
similar in the pppd documentation or source files.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Is it possible at all to run PPP over parallel cable under Linux? If yes,
how should it be done?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I know there is PLIP but it won't work. Win95 <EM>really</EM> uses PPP even over
parallel cable.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks in forward.

Regards,
<BR>Peter

<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Thomas] 
That's because you cannot. Alas, as your observations and in-depth
research show, you can only use pppd over serial (in Linux anyhow).

I use PLIP all the time, although I have never had the need to use it to
connect to windows, but that doesn't mean I don't know of a few things to

PPTP, actually.  The Microsoft Approved VPN -- which means don't use it
unless you have to.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If this is for a business application, you might want to consider buying
boxes -- the SnapGear's do both PPTP and IPSec, the other alternative, and
they run Linux, which might make your life easier if you're a linux guy; I
am, we resell them, and they Just Work.  They start at about $250 a side,
which is probably less than you'll pay yourself to set up IPSec on a pair of
linux boxes, not to mention the time you'll spend tightening those two Linux
boxen to be safe directly connected to the net.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you really want to do it yourself, PPTP and IPSec are the two things to
Google for.

frox, a transparent ftp proxy
</P>
<P>
This is the homepage of frox. It is a transparent ftp proxy which is released under
the GPL. It optionally supports caching (either through an external http cache (eg.
[1]squid), or by maintaining a cache locally), and/or running a virus scanner, on
downloaded files. It is written with security in mind, and in the default setup it
runs as a non root user in a chroot jail.

Cool, I like this! As I am resident on the Squid-Users mailing list, I
have word that they developers do plan to allow FTP access at some point
through Squid, but they're not sure when.

will tell you two things -- a) that the subject line of this e-mail is
dismal, and b) you should send your e-mails to this list in PLAIN TEXT
only and not HTML. If you look below betweeen the "---annoyance---"
marker, that is a sample of how your e-mail has reached us. Hardly
distinguishable.
</P>
<P>
However, to answer your question...
</P>
<P>
"Swap" refers to the term by which disk-space can be used as memory. Under
Windows (Note Bene -- it is not a windows XP specific concept, but is
generic over all windows'), this is represented by a file.
</P>
<P>
In Linux, however, this is represented by a partition (an area of disk
that is "housed" by itself). This is then mounted at boot-time in
<TT>/etc/fstab</TT> (assuming you have the correct entry). You can make a swap
partition by doing...
</P>

<blockquote><pre>mkswap /dev/hdxx &amp;&amp; swapon
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
where <TT>/dev/hdxx</TT> is the device that you want to use for your swap.
</P>
<P>
It is also possible to share your windows swapfile with Linux. The
following howto will help you with that:

although I wouldn't recommend it. Instead, I would go with a native swap
partition.

I'm running <A HREF="http://www.slackware.org/">Slackware</A> 3.0 on a 486sx with 4MB of ram, and I want to install
some tar archives.
Here's my question:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
After I have untared a file is there a way I can
"undo" the changes that tar made?
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I looked on freshmeat.net and could not find any "Install trackers."
Perhaps I should download that RPM thing from <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> and just use that.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
Yep; fairly basic, in fact.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>rm `tar tf tarfile.tar`
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This, of course, assumes that the tar file is still in the same
directory from which you untarred it, your UID and the directory/file
permissions haven't been changed, etc. That is, if you just untarred it
with:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>tar xf tarfile.tar
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
then the above will get rid of the newly-created files.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&lt;smile&gt; Searching for specific software often requires more than just
trying a single query and giving up, particularly when the phrasing of
the query is not definitive. You should also take a look at
"checkinstall" and "stow" for relevant solutions which you may find
necessary later in the installation cycle - this assumes that you're
installing a non-Slack tarball. I also suggest reading my "Installing
Software from Source" article in LG#74; it deals with several important
parts of this process.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you're using Slackware, its default package manager (IIRC) is based
on gzipped tar files. You <EM>really</EM> don't want to start messing with
alternate package schemes until you're comfortable with the native one.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I just caught a hidden assumption in what I wrote, above - I was
presuming that no existing files were overwritten by the untarring
process. If you were to, e.g.,  untar a file that replaced your
"<TT>/etc/passwd</TT>" and then "rm"ed the contents list as above, your system
would become, erm, slightly less useful than formerly.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The standard solution is "don't do that, then." As I described in my
article, you should untar into a directory reserved or created for the
purpose, then make the decision about what gets installed vs. deleted,
etc. Again, this is in regard to a "random" (meaning that it is not a
part of your distribution) tarball; as with any piece of software you
install on your system, you need to vet it carefully - something that is
normally done for you in the distro packages. This strongly implies the
above procedure; when you untar a file as root, particularly in '<TT>/</TT>',
you're exposing your system to <EM>anything</EM> that the tarball author wants
to do - including complete system takeover or erasure. <TT>/Caveat</TT> emptor/.

<P>
Hi all,
</P>
<P>
Recently there had been discussion on the method of switching off the UTF-8
LANG setting that is appearing in recent RedHat (and maybe other) distros.
</P>
<P>
The best way of turning this off for the whole system is by editing the file
/etc/sysconfig/i18n
</P>
<P>
For setting it up for a particular user, create a file ~/.i18n and put the
setting there.
</P>
