<P> This document provides the least amount of information
needed to get an ATAPI CDR running under Linux.

<H2>1. Introduction</H2>

<P>   The documentation for getting a CDR up and running under
Linux is an excellent piece of work, however, if all you
want to do is burn a few MP3's the documentation can be
overwhelming.  I'm going to attempt to boil installing
and configuring a CDR  down to as few steps as necessary
to get the job done.  I will be focusing only on ATAPI
drives as SCSI drives work well with out too many problems.
The information here was culled from 4 hours of trial and
error as well as the <A HREF="http://www.ssc.com/mirrors/LDP/HOWTO/CD-Writing-HOWTO.html">CD-Writing-HOWTO</A>.


<H2>2. Installing the Hardware</H2>

<P>   The first thing to do, even before you buy the drive is
to check the hardware compatibility list.  Things will go
easier for you if your drive is listed.  If it is not,
don't despair, my Iomega ZIPCD is not on the list, but
still works fine.  Any ATAPI CDR "should" work, should
being the key word here.

<P> I'm not going into much detail about installing the
hardware, if you don't know how to install your drive or
you don't understand what I'm talking about, please get
some one to help you.  I have found I get the best results
by jumpering the drive to slave and connecting it to the
same IDE cable as your CDROM.  Make sure your BIOS
recognizes the new drive and when the system boots make
sure it is recognized as an ATAPI drive, if it is not,
this will never work.  After the system boots up, check
your kernel messages to see if the drive is properly
recognized by typing "dmesg | grep ATAPI" at the command
line, you should see something like this;

<PRE>
  hdc: FX162N, ATAPI CDROM drive
  hdd: ZIPCD 4x650, ATAPI CDROM drive
  hdc: ATAPI 16X CD-ROM drive, 128kB Cache
  scsi0 : SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices
</PRE>

<P>  Make note of the device name Linux gives your drive,
my ZIPCD is recognized as hdd by the kernel, this becomes
important later.


<H2>3. Loading the drivers</H2>

<P>   Before getting started, you must be able to log into the
system as root to preform these steps.  Make sure cdrecord
and mkisofs are installed on the system, to do this type
"rpm -q cdrecord mkisofs", this will tell you if the
packages are installed or not, if they are not, you will
need to install them.  Also make sure the ide-scsi module
is present, to verify this, type "ls -lR /lib | grep ide-scsi".
If the module is not present you will need to recompile
the kernel, which is beyond the scope of this document.
We now need to get the proper drivers installed and
loading at boot time.  Open /etc/rc.d/rc.local and add
the following line, to the end of the file, then save
and exit the file.

<PRE>
  /sbin/insmod ide-scsi
</PRE>

<P>   Next we need to configure the drivers so they work
properly Open /etc/conf.modules and add the following
lines at the bottom;

<PRE>
  alias scd0 srmod
  alias scsi_hostadapter ide-scsi
  options ide-cd ignore=hdd
</PRE>

<P> On the final line, notice I placed the device name of
my ZIPCD, replace hdd with the device name of your CDR.
Save the file and exit.  To associate the driver with the
proper drive, open /etc/lilo.conf, add the following line,
right before or right after the "root=" line;

<PRE>
  append="hdd=ide-scsi" 
</PRE>

<P>  Save the file and exit, rerun lilo by typing "/sbin/lilo"
at the command line.  Now reboot the system.  Once it has
come back up type "dmesg" at the command line, if all went
well the last few lines should look similar to this;

<PRE>
  scsi0 : SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices
  scsi : 1 host.
    Vendor: IOMEGA    Model: ZIPCD 4x650       Rev: 1.04
    Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
  Detected scsi CD-ROM sr0 at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
  sr0: scsi3-mmc drive: 24x/24x writer cd/rw xa/form2 cdda tray
  VFS: Disk change detected on device ide1(22,0)
</PRE>

<P>  You should now be able to use cdrecord, to test this, type
"cdrecord -scanbus" at the command line, output should look
something like this;

<PRE>
Cdrecord release 1.8a29 Copyright (C) 1995-1999 Jorg Schilling
scsibus0:
   0,0,0       0) 'IOMEGA  ' 'ZIPCD 4x650     ' '1.04' Removable CD-ROM
   0,1,0       1) *
   0,2,0       2) *
   0,3,0       3) *
   0,4,0       4) *
   0,5,0       5) *
   0,6,0       6) *
   0,7,0       7) *
</PRE>

<P>  Please note the three numbers separated by commas to
the left of where your drive is listed.  These numbers
will be used in cdrecord's command line.  If you get an
error message, try going over the steps again and make
sure you have the correct device name for the CDR.  Read
the CD-Writing-HOWTO, there are a
few tricks to try listed in this file.  If it still does
not work it is possible your drive is incompatible.


<H2>4. Quick and dirty Burn</H2>

<P>  To burn a CD you will need to log in as root, if you want
any user to be able to burn CD's type the following command,
"chmod +s /usr/bin/cdrecord".  Burning a CD in Linux is a
two step process, first you must make the image, this is
done with mkisofs.  The syntax for mkisofs is;

<PRE>
  mkisofs -r -o image.img /folder/to/burn/
</PRE>

<P>  Make a new directory and copy all the files you want to
burn into this directory. As an example I make a directory
in my home directory called mp3, I then copied about 600MB
worth of MP3's into the folder.  To make my image I typed
the following;

<PRE>
  mkisofs -r -o mp3_cd.img /home/chris/mp3/
</PRE>

<P>  After a few moments I have a 600MB CD image named
mp3_cd.img.  The second step is burning the image to the
CD.  This is done with cdrecord To burn my image I type
the following;

<PRE>
  cdrecord -v speed=4 dev=0,0,0 -data mp3_cd.img
</PRE>

<P>  The speed option should be set to the highest speed
your drive will take, mine is a 4x burner, older drives
may only be 1x or 2x, newer drives can be up to 8x or even
12x.  The dev option can be had from "cdrecord -scanbus",
which we ran earlier, my drive appeared next to 0,0,0  you
should use whatever your drive appears next to.  Again
several minutes later I had a newly burned CD.  For further
information on mkisofs and cdrecord and their many options,
please read the documentation.


<H2>5. Final Note</H2>

<P>  To use the drive as a normal cdrom, you must keep in mind
the system now thinks your drive is a SCSI device, the device
name is no longer hdd, it is now scd0.  Go into the /dev
directory and make a link, type "ln -s scd0 cdr", then go to
/mnt and type "mkdir cdr". Move to the /etc directory and
open fstab and add the following line right under the entry
for the cdrom;

<PRE>
  /dev/cdr     /mnt/cdr     iso9660 noauto,owner,ro 0 0
</PRE>

<P>  Now you can mount the drive the same way you mount the
cdrom, something like "mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdr /mnt/cdr".
