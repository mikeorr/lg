Hey, all.
I've recently downloaded a bunch of HTML files, and wanted to name
them by their title.  I remembered the scripts in the Perl One-Liner
of the Month: The Adventure of the Misnamed Files (LG 84), and thought
that they would be useful, as they seemed to be what I needed.
</p>

<p>
I first tried the one-liner, and instead of the zero, I got 258
(which, btw, is the number of files in the directory I was in)  So I
copied the "expanded" version of the script, and saved it as
../script1.pl.  Ran it, it came up with 0 as output (which, according
to the story, is a Good Thing), so I then tried the second one liner.
Laptop thought for a second, then gave me a command line again.  So, I
run ls, and lo and behold!  No changes.  Tried it with the expanded
version, saved as ../script2.pl.  Same result.
</p>

<p>
I was wondering if you might know of an updated version that I could
try to use?  I'm not well enough versed in Perl to figure it out all
on my own, and I'm not usre what (or where) I should be looking...
</p>

<p>
Also, for reference, the files are all html, and about half named with
an html extension, and the other half have no extension.
</p>

<p>
Thanks in advance.  I'd hate to have to do the task manually.
</p>

Whoops. There's a reason for the warning that I've put at the top of a
lot of those articles: one-liners should not be used for production
code; they're just a way to learn to <em>read</em> code, and maybe have a
little fun along the way.
</p>

<p>
However, in looking at the code in that particular article, I'd say that
it should indeed work; there's nothing particularly edgy in it, and no
deprecated features.

<p>
Since that one liner simply counts the number of files and subtracts
those that have titles, this would imply that none of your HTML files
had titles - at least not in the layout that the script presumes, which
is
</p>

<pre>
&lt;title&gt;Title Goes Here&lt;/title&gt;
</pre>
You may have something like this, instead:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;title&gt;
Title Goes Here
&lt;/title&gt;
</pre>
which is fine for HTML purposes but won't work with that one-liner
unless it's modified a bit. Something like this should work:
</p>

<pre>
perl -0 -wne'END{print"$n\n"}eof&amp;&amp;$n++;/&lt;title&gt;\s*[^&lt;]+/i&amp;&amp;$n--' *
</pre>

<pre>
&gt; So I
&gt; copied the "expanded" version of the script, and saved it as
&gt; ../script1.pl.  Ran it, it came up with 0 as output (which, according
&gt; to the story, is a Good Thing), so I then tried the second one liner.
&gt; Laptop thought for a second, then gave me a command line again.  So, I
&gt; run ls, and lo and behold!  No changes.  Tried it with the expanded
&gt; version, saved as ../script2.pl.  Same result.
</pre>

<p>
Same problem, I would think.
</p>

<pre>
perl -0 -wne'/&lt;title&gt;\s*([^&lt;\n]+)\s*/i&amp;&amp;rename$ARGV,"$1.html"' *
</pre>
The script you'd want to do this kind of job on a regular basis would do
both, and look something like this:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
# Created by Ben Okopnik on Thu Jan 24 13:39:27 EST 2008
 
die "Usage: ", $0 =~ /([^\/]+)$/, " &lt;html_file[s]_to_rename&gt;\n" unless @ARGV;
 
for (@ARGV){
	open F, $_ or die "$_: $!\n";
	{
		local $/;
		($title) = &lt;F&gt; =~ /&lt;title&gt;\s*([^&lt;\n]+)/i;
	}
	close F;
 
	die "$_ does not have a title; aborting\n"
		unless $title;
	die "'$title' already exists in this directory; aborting\n"
		if -f $title;
 
	rename $_, "$title.html";
}
</pre>

<pre>
&gt; Also, for reference, the files are all html, and about half named with
&gt; an html extension, and the other half have no extension.
</pre>

<p>
The above should take care of all that, since it renames the files to
whatever is in their titles plus an HTML extension.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; Thanks in advance.  I'd hate to have to do the task manually.
</pre>

<p>
I figure that it's a useful gadget, especially for people who like to
keep archives of interesting pages they've found on the Net. It can be a
little tough to look things up in those archives if you don't know which
of several hundred files is relevant. Enjoy!

You're close. I looked, it's acutally :

&lt;title&gt;
Title Goes Here&lt;/title&gt;

But I digress...

Well, then, I guess it's a good thing Woomert was lucky enough to run
into a bunch of mean files which follow styling standards <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

It works :D  Thanks!

<p>
Desktop searching apps like beagle come in handy for that, but the
files hadn't been indexed, and besides, it's much easier to see what
the pages are before I open them now.  Oh, and don't worry, I will
enjoy.
