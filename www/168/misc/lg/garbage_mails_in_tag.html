<p>
There is tooooo many garbage mails/spam mails in the TAG mailing list.
Can no one take some action ? Please filter out all garbage. Otherwise
people will stop reading or answering TAG mails.

<p>
Thank you,

Y'know, I think we're reached the break-over point on this issue. Rick
has brought this up again and again, and I've reached the limit of my
problem/spam tolerance - and I seem to have lost track of why it was so
important to allow non-members to post here anyway.
</p>

<p>
I've just flipped an option in Mailman, and TAG is now an "only members
may post" list. Anyone who wants to ask questions here will just have to
suffer the horrible, arduous privations of going through a 10-second
subscription process.
</p>

<p>
I'll be watching the list closely to see if any problems arise as a
result of this change; hopefully, result #1 will be a sharp drop in
the amount of spam.

Wise decision, Ben! IMO that's the only way to go to really bash those
spams. After all, is it hard to spend just few seconds (ok, maybe up
to minutes) to subscribe? <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Ok I'm not too sure what the setup is but...

<p>
Below (see the sig) people are asked to send all replies to 
tag@lists.linuxgazette.net so presumably follow ups will bounce unless they 
have signed up to the list.

How is this meant to work for people with one off queries?

I'm assuming you mean the standard list footer:

<pre>
&gt;&gt; +-+--------------------------------------------------------------------+-+
&gt;&gt; You've asked a question of The Answer Gang, so you've been sent the reply
&gt;&gt; directly as a courtesy.  The TAG list has also been copied.  Please send
&gt;&gt; all replies to tag@lists.linuxgazette.net, so that we can help our other
&gt;&gt; readers by publishing the exchange in our monthly Web magazine:
&gt;&gt;              Linux Gazette (<a href='http://linuxgazette.net/'>http://linuxgazette.net/</a>)
&gt;&gt; +-+--------------------------------------------------------------------+-+
</pre>

<p>
Since they must (now) be signed up to post their original queston in the
first place, there won't be any bounces. The message still makes sense
as a reminder, though: it essentially says "*don't* reply just to the
person answering your question, reply to the list."

So, big +1 on this from me; my mobile device hasn't been buzzing nearly as
much. However, I do like the low barrier to entry to TAG and our fair community
that an open mailing list allowed. I agree with everyone who has posted that
sign up is trivial, but my experience is that even trivial things turn users
away (see low attention span). Especially when creating a username and password
are involved.
</p>

<p>
Going to float an idea: set up a form with a captcha on the site that allows
users to send e-mails to the mailing list. They would need to provide an e-mail
to receive answers, or leave out the e-mail and read their answers in the mail
bag - we would need to setup a noreply or AnonymousCoward e-mail for the
envelope. 
</p>

<p>
If people like this idea, then I would have no problem volunteering my time to
whip this code together - should be easy lifting. I'll just need my current LG
rate to be doubled ($0 x 2).

Yah... that would be the "reason" that TAG has stuck with a 1980s list
model. However, given that
</p>

<p>
a) Rick's commitments keep him too busy to tweak the list as he used to,

   the users otherwise is a trivial one, and
</p>

<p>
c) this is what every single list out there requires these days,
</p>

<p>
it appears that the whole premise is a weak one, and has been kept in
existence far longer than it should have been. Much thanks to Rick for
his effort and patience, and to everyone who has been putting up with
the spam flood for their tolerance, but that phase is now done. If we
lose some querents as a result... well, you know that rule about posting
to lists, where you're supposed to show the effort you've put in before
asking for help? We don't want the other kind - and the sign-up
procedure should act as a weak but positive filter.

I hear what you're saying, Sam, but the annoyance factor of dealing with
a CAPTCHA isn't much different from that of signing up for a mailing
list. Besides, you can do the latter from a phone - but not the former.

<p>
Oddly enough it is different (I say "odd", because in engineering terms those
flows are basically the same thing). Signing up for something has a huge dark
cloud because of its connection with magazine subscriptions and the fact that
you have to <em>remember</em> something (see the motivations behind the underwhelming
OpenID). While people are still [somewhat] annoyed with CAPTCHAs, they're
mostly annoyed by ones that they can't read. I don't think we need to use
Re-CAPTCHA or any of those other impossible-to-read-but-are-still-popular
options; I'd be happy with any image or "type tux in this box" style question.
</p>

<p>
Also, I'm not sure where the mobile device part came in - mine has no problem
displaying images.
</p>

<p>
I'm not bent on getting this put through; I'd hazard a blind, half educated
guess that between 20% and 50% of users with questions won't create an account.
I don't know if the number of users that that actually translates into is worth
deploying and maintaining a simple contact form, but I'm still willing to do
it.

<p>
w0000, gettin' paid!

<p>
p.s. Does removing public posting negate the need to CC replies to members?
(Assuming the contact form doesn't go through.)

<p>
I may be one of the last original members of The Answer Gang. I subscribed
to the list when I felt like a real newbie, and thought I could find lots of
answers. I'm pretty sure that I was here before either Ben or Rick. (On
TAG, of course -- they've both got many more years than me...)
</p>

<p>
It turned out that in those days I could answer lots of questions. The favorite
was "Why can't I telnet into my new Linux box?"
</p>

<p>
We got very good at answering that question, and better as the months
went on at explaining why you didn't want telnetd to be enabled by
default.
</p>

<p>
There were lots of 'root password' questions, too.
</p>

<p>
I think Ben and Rick are right - we don't have the supply of the real
newbies that once made 'subscribers only' the default. Asking for a
subscription is a good move now.

&gt; Wise decision, Ben! IMO that's the only way to go to really bash those
&gt; spams. After all, is it hard to spend just few seconds (ok, maybe up
&gt; to minutes) to subscribe? <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</pre>

<p>
It's not necessary to subscribe.  Postings from non-subscribed addresses 
will merely be held for listadmin approval -- and the claimed sender will
receive a notice saying so.  Any listadmin who approves a particular
held post can also optionally hit a checkbox saying (paraphrased) "Any
<em>additional</em> postings from this claimed sender should be allowed through
without being delayed in the held-postings queue."
</p>

<p>
The antispam capabilities of my MTA have been limited since an emergency
rebuild I was obliged to do in April, on account of sudden hardware
failure (power spike during a lightning storm) and just before I
underwent major surgery.  Since then, I've been reluctant to do any
major reworkings because it is now, you see, a production system that I
cannot afford to have downtime or aberrant behaviour on.

I suspect you changed this (on

<p>
If I understand correctly the change you made to be the one described
above, that would have silently autodiscarded all feedback mail from
readers trying to reach TAG -- which is a rather more hardcore remedy
than is required address the problem.  A "hold" setting for mail from
non-subscribed addresses has been the standard for mailing lists
worldwide for at least a decade, and is what I've repeatedly, over and
over, urged for TAG in the past.

My apologies for being late to this discussion, but I have been out of
town for the past week.

I guess I misunderstood the above to mean "reject with notification"
rather than "silently send to /dev/null". Thanks for correcting it.

<p>
OK.  But, also, even rejecting (as opposed to silently discarding) is an
unnecessarily harsh remedy, that would have needlessly cut off TAG
from <em>LG's</em> public.  Setting that configuration item to "Hold" (rather
than either Reject or Discard) restores our ability to interact with our
readership -- with the only disadvantage being that posts from
non-subscribed addresses will get delayed in the admin queue until a
listadmin approves them.
</p>

<p>
And, actually, there's a related improvement to the scheme that it's
just occurred to me to implement.  On admin screen
<a href='http://lists.linuxgazette.net/mailman/admin/tag/general'>http://lists.linuxgazette.net/mailman/admin/tag/general</a>, this question
</p>

<pre>
    Send mail to poster when their posting is held for approval?

<p>
is better set to 
</p>

<pre>
    Send mail to poster when their posting is held for approval? 
    ( ) Yes (o) No
</pre>

<p>
That way, non-subscribed <em>LG</em> readers who write to TAG won't get "Your
post to mailing list TAG has been held for moderator approval" notices
every time they write in.
</p>

<p>
I've just now made that change.
