First, let me state that the _only_ sane reason to keep your hardware
clock in local time is if you sometimes run Windows on the machine.
Windows isn't capable of using a hardware clock in any other format.
Unfortunately, local time is Hwclock's default and the default that
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> and I believe other major distritbutions ship.

I certainly appreciate it; I'm sure that a number of
our readers do as well. One of your tips in here - the persistence of "UTC"
- has already let me figure out why my localtime was "backwards" (i.e., 5
hours earlier instead of later) if I set the hardware clock to UTC. I don't
use Windows, but I do travel quite a lot, which means I have to keep
changing time zones; do you have any advice or pertinent info for doing
this

First of all, of course, keep your hardware clock in UTC format.
Whenever you enter a new timezone, do a quick 'ln' command to link
<TT>/etc/localtime</TT> to the descriptor for your new timezone.

Odd. The entire "tz*" suite (tzselect, tzconfig, etc.) uses the "America"
version. &lt;looking at the contents of 'US'&gt; Ah. OK, that seems to make sense
- at least you'd be setting the timezone by name (

minutes hopscotching through "tzselect", back and forth, back and forth, to
figure out which cities it used for which zones.) So, here's an updated
version of "chzone" - this one actually covers a wider range but keeps the
choice list down to the actual zones rather than the (possibly confusing)
list of cities:

The C library (GNU libc 2) looks at <TT>/etc/localtime</TT> for the description
of the local timezone.  That can be a symlink to the relevant timezone
descriptor in <TT>/usr/share/zoneinfo.</TT>  (I use US Pacific
Standard/Daylight time, so I link to <TT>/usr/share/zoneinfo/US/Pacific</TT>).
If you don't have descriptors for every timezone known to man in
<TT>/usr/share/zoneinfo</TT> (5 MB of them come with glibc -- having them all
installed appears to be "normal"), you'll have to install them per
your distribution.  Sometimes they are in <TT>/usr/lib/zoneinfo.</TT>

Note that changing timezones doesn't cause any time discontinuity.

... (hopefully, without screwing up "<TT>/etc/timeadj</TT>") other than setting the

You change your hardware clock to UTC by adding the --utc option to
any clock-setting 'hwclock' command.  You only have to do it once,
because your choice gets saved in <TT>/etc/adjtime</TT> and becomes your default
in the future.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The major practical drawback to keeping your hardware clock in local
time is that in most locales, local time jumps an hour twice a year.
The hardware clock is incapable of implementing that.  So you have to
explicitly reset the hardware clock twice a year.  Windows does that
automatically.  In Linux, you can do it with a startup script and/or
cron job, but I'm not aware of any Linux distribution that does it out
of the box.  If you're running both Linux and Windows, though, I think
both would make the adjustment!

He said it's near the equator, and he didn't say he can't do timezones
the normal way (in fact, he probably does).  He just pointed out that
it isn't as advantageous to him as it is to most the world to keep his
hardware clock in UTC format, because one of the advantages of UTC
format is that you don't have to reset your hardware clock for DST
changes.

Also,
the Linux based distributed network I'm setting up, at this time is all
contained within one time zone.  Thus, I haven't felt compelled to leave
my hw clock set for utc.  I did try it once on my personal laptop, (sans
the --utc option though - I probably used hwclock to set the time, but
can't remember all the details) but didn't like the fact the timestamps on
my files (ls) were not in agreement with the time as displayed by the
'date' command

The hardware clock format doesn't affect ls and date displays --
unless there's a bug in the system, of course.  I do often see people
configure their machines for the wrong time zone and then keep the
hardware clock set to the wrong time to compensate.  This causes some
displays to be correct, but always causes something else to be broken.

I've never done that or even considered doing it, as I can see where it
could really distort parts of the system and create havoc.  What I'm
trying to say here is that, well let me give an example:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
<UL>
<LI> Local time is 1pm
<LI> I create a file
<LI> I do an ls, which shows the file with a date-stamp that's skewed e.g., 6 hrs from local time.
</UL>
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thus I constantly have to do mental arithmetic to figure relate these
times to my frame of reference, which is local time.  It's particularly
undesirable when those 6 hrs spans midnight, so the date-stamp shows a
different day.
</STRONG></P>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> 
And every once in a while you see a program that chooses to display
times in UTC (because it's easy).  If you lie to your system about
what time it is, you can trick that program into displaying local
time!  But that breaks other programs.  If you then lie about what
time zone you're in, those other programs start appearing to work, but
still other things break.  It usually falls apart as soon as you try
to communicate to the rest of the world, for example email timestamps.

If we're still talking about the hardware clock internal format (UTC
vs local time), I don't think the issues change when you expand into
multiple time zones.  Using local time shouldn't be any worse than
with one time zone, since Hwclock does all the work of converting
between Unix standard format and hardware clock format.

fit together.

But the LANs are a heterogeneous mixture of W9x and Linux clients
with a Linux server providing application sharing and Internet gateway
services.  I wish to use samba for W9x file sharing and login <TT>/</TT> user
profile control, as well as run a batch file to sync the clocks on the w9x
clients to the server clock.  In short, I want to have all clocks more or
less synchronized.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I don't quite follow you here - "displayed times"? .. what about syslogd?
My concern is mostly with file date-stamps, and system logs.  Lets say I'm
examining a system log of a remote system located in a different time
zone.  I would like to avoid confusion about when specific events may have
happened in relation to my local time - and this would be my principal
motivation for using UTC.  For example, I will have a "master server"
which will be doing telephone dialup to remote hosts to exchange mail,
collect system logs, etc.  I would like to have the master server log
timestamps of the dialup session agree with those of the remote system
logs, rather than all be skewed one or two hours.  Same with file creation
&amp; modification timestamps.  I will likely have a Perl or bash script run
via cron on remote systems to collect all files of interest having a
date-stamp falling within a certain time period.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
My understanding prior to the test I did at least a year ago when I set my
hw clock to UTC, was that such date-stamps would be shown (e.g., via ls)
as local time, but UTC would allow for a standard that would put all
systems using it on an equal level, and would help to eliminate confusion
regarding date-stamps on files between different systems.  But that didn't
seem to be the case - it simply added more confusion.
</STRONG></P>
<blockQuote>

The usual way to do that is with an ntp network (run ntpd on all the
systems.  Have a master ntp time server that gets time from some
higher authority and distributes it down to everyone else).  Don't use
Hwclock at all (I mean it -- if you set the hardware clock manually
even once, the system won't maintain it automatically after that).

That's what I have been thinking - sync the "master server" clock via NTP
(ADSL has just recently been introduced here, so now a full time Internet
connection is possible); then use a system util such as ntpdate or rdate
(samba logon batch files for the other OS) to sync all other clocks to the
master.  Since my "WAN" will be mostly dialup, using the NTP daemon an all
servers is not possible or practical.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I still have questions about UTC re: W9x and other flavors under VMWare.
I guess a little experimentation is in order.

Regardless of in what format you keep your hardware clock, the display
of the time by 'date', 'ls', etc. is controlled by the time zone
settings as defined by the C library (e.g. the "localtime" function).
Remember, the time does not change each Spring and Fall -- only what
we call the time changes.  Properly configured, the C library routines
generate daylight savings time in Summer and standard time in Winter.
The underlying clock is oblivious.

The original querent was having trouble with Ls displaying times in

time zone problems (There was a totally different way of doing time

I'm a bit fuzzy on this issue too.  What is the expected <TT>/</TT> intended system
behavior in this regard?  If I set my clock to UTC, and specify hwclock's
--utc parm as you have suggested, then the system should compensate in
such a way that the ls command would show timestamps reflected as *local
time* - or UTC?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I suppose that the system always stamps the files in accordance with the
Unix standard format, and it is up to the various parts of the system (ls,
tar, and the like) to do conversions in relation to either UTC or local
time.  What I interpret you as saying is that there have been instances
where these various progs are not in agreement concerning the method with
which these conversions are done.  Am I Correct?  I guess it's time for
another try at setting one of my boxes to UTC to find out what.
