<h2>News in General</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Debian Kernel Vulnerabilities Being Patched</h3>

<p>Several long term kernel security vulnerabilities affecting Debian 
distros, including Ubuntu, are being addressed after receiving several 
CVE citations.  The vulnerabilities are in the more recent Debian 
distros, including Lenny, Etch, and Squeeze.  They also cover the 
following Ubuntu releases:</p>
<ul>
<li> Ubuntu 6.06 LTS;<br />
<li> Ubuntu 8.04 LTS;<br />
<li> Ubuntu 8.10;<br />
<li> Ubuntu 9.04;<br />
<li> Ubuntu 9.10.
</ul>

<p>The vulnerabilities involve Denial of Service attacks and, in at least 
one case, privilege escalation.  One CVE involves an attacker 
accessing a VM guest doing a DOS attack on the host machine.   The CVE 
numbers involved are:   CVE-2010-0307, CVE-2010-0309, CVE-2010-0410, 
CVE-2010-0415, CVE-2010-0622 and CVE-2010-0623.</p>

<p>More details are here: <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/USN-914-1/">http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/USN-914-1/</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/">CVE</a> is a list of information security vulnerabilities and exposures 
that aims to provide common names for publicly known problems. The 
goal of CVE is to make it easier to share data across separate 
vulnerability capabilities (tools, repositories, and services) with 
this "common enumeration".</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Metrics Reveal "Most Powerful Voices in Open Source"</h3>

<p>In March, MindTouch, an open source alternative to Microsoft 
SharePoint, announced the publication of the "Most Powerful Voices in 
Open Source" (MPV) ranking. The list presents the top 50 most vocal, 
followed, and repeated/re-posted open source commentators, representing 
several spheres of influence, including media, vendors, OSS projects, 
standards bodies, community management, and more.</p>

<p>Created by MindTouch, the MPV ranking draws from the wide array of 
metrics available through Web and Enterprise 2.0 channels, including 
Twitter, Google News alerts, unique online visitor counts and analysis 
of the related "buzz" of vendor/project affiliations. This compilation 
was created using the MindTouch platform, federating these data 
sources, applying varied weighting, and processing it for delivery of 
the ranking. The list, which includes members worldwide from 
organizations such as Ars Technica, Canonical, Google, and 
SpringSource, is available in its entirety here: 
<a href="http://www.mindtouch.com/blog">http://www.mindtouch.com/blog</a>.</p>

<p>The top 5 MPVs are:</p> 
<ul>
<li> Tim O'Reilly, founder and CEO of O'Reilly Media;<br />
<li> Linus Torvalds, founder of Linux, open source advocate;<br />
<li> Chris Messina, open Web advocate, Google;<br />
<li> Miguel de Icaza, founder, Mono and Gnome projects;<br />
<li> Jonathan Schwartz, former CEO of Sun Microsystems.
</ul>

<p>"It's about time someone has put together a metrics-based ranking of 
open source influencers," said Larry Augustin, CEO of SugarCRM. 
"Community advocacy is the major thrust of the spirit of open source, 
and communities have leaders. This list does a great job of 
identifying those leading voices."</p>

<p>"You'll see that this ranking is no popularity contest, there are a 
number of surprises outside of the 'usual suspects' often seen on this 
type of list," said Aaron Fulkerson, CEO of MindTouch. "This is 
because we let the numbers do the talking, instead of an 
emotions-based market perception that too frequently comes into play."</p>

<p>MindTouch is a leading provider of enterprise collaboration solutions 
in a market where more companies are operating under "lite" IT 
budgets.  The purpose of MindTouch is to provide wiki-like ease of 
collaboration between humans and machines. For more information,

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Linux Foundation to Host MeeGo Project</h3>
<p>The Linux Foundation will be hosting the MeeGo project, an open source
software platform for mobile computing devices. MeeGo combines Intel's
Moblin and Nokia's Maemo projects into one common Linux-based platform.</p>

<p>MeeGo, announced in February by Intel and Nokia, will be deployed 
across many computing device types - including mobile computers, media 
phones, connected TVs, and in-vehicle infotainment systems. MeeGo is 
designed from the ground up for a new class of interactive computing 
devices.</p>

<p>MeeGo will be hosted by the Linux Foundation as an open source project 
in line with the best practices of the open source development model. 
MeeGo is working with existing upstream projects such as the Linux 
kernel, ofono, connman, X.org, D-BUS, tracker, GStreamer, Pulseaudio, 
and others. The companies and projects associated with MeeGo will 
continue to support those upstream projects.</p>

<p>As an open source software platform, MeeGo will help to reduce market 
fragmentation and complexity. Along with MeeGo, the Linux Foundation 
is working with companies and projects to  optimize best practices for 
Linux-based development and lower costs for companies using 
Linux-based mobile operating systems. More information can be found at 
<a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/embedded/">http://www.linuxfoundation.org/embedded/</a>.</p>

<p>MeeGo and other Linux embedded issues will be discussed at the 
upcoming Linux Foundation Collaboration Summit in San Francisco. More 
information on the meeting can be found at 
<a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/">http://events.linuxfoundation.org/</a>.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">IBM Launches Development &amp; Test Cloud Utilizing Red Hat Technology</h3>

<p>IBM has selected Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization as a platform in 
its new cloud computing  service for development and test.   This 
means that the  Red Hat Enterprise KVM Hypervisor Technology is a 
major part of the IBM Cloud.</p>

<blockquote>"Our decade-long partnership with Red Hat has always been focused on 
customer value and innovation.  Today, we are extending this 
partnership to include cloud computing..." said Maria Azua, vice 
president of Cloud Computing Enablement at IBM.  "Red Hat Enterprise 
Virtualization is an optimal hypervisor technology for the 
infrastructure offerings on the IBM cloud."</blockquote>

<p>Red Hat first announced plans to deliver Red Hat Enterprise 
Virtualization in February 2009.  In November 2009, Red Hat Enterprise 
Virtualization for Servers was released, providing its customers with 
a cost-effective choice in the virtualization market. Red Hat 
Enterprise Virtualization offers very recent technology for the 
deployment of open cloud computing infrastructures.</p>

<blockquote>Scott Crenshaw, vice president and general manager, Cloud Business 
Unit at Red Hat said, "Together, Red Hat and IBM aim to break down 
barriers to virtualization and cloud adoption by providing customers 
with a stable and robust environment to meet their enterprise 
applications requirements. We believe that combining Red Hat 
Enterprise Virtualization software with IBM's server, storage and 
network hardware, plus IBM's well-known enterprise support and 
services, as the foundational components of IBM's cloud infrastructure 
offers a compelling application environment for customers".</blockquote>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Latest Oracle Lite Synchronizes  with Open Source SQLite</h3>

<p>With the new version of Oracle Database Lite, mobile users gain 
continuous access to enterprise data even in the absence of a network 
connection. New in this release of Oracle Database Lite is the ability 
to bi-directionally synchronize data between the open source SQLite 
database and the Oracle Database.</p>

<p>This release also provides centralized user and device provisioning 
and management of SQLite-based mobile applications, allowing 
disconnected users to have an experience virtually identical to users 
who are connected.</p>

<p>Oracle Database Lite consists of Oracle Database Lite Client, a
small-footprint SQL database that runs on many devices and platforms and
can be bi-directionally synchronized with an Oracle Database server and
Oracle Database Lite Mobile Server, which enables mobile users and devices
to operate in occasionally connected environments, periodically
synchronizing with a back-end database server.</p>

<p>The Oracle Database Lite Mobile Server can also be used to provision 
SQLite-based applications, devices on which these applications run, 
and users of these applications. User authentication on client devices 
can use a Common Access Card.</p>

<blockquote>"Oracle Database Lite's Mobile Server is a great tool for data 
synchronization in large scale enterprises," said Zdravko Mandic, 
manager Research and Development, Infoart d.o.o. "Our implementation, 
which consists of more than 1500 client devices, would have hardly 
been possible without it. Oracle Database Lite works silently, in the 
background, synchronizing huge amounts of data to our central Oracle 
Database and vice versa. This automatic synchronization, combined with 
great device management, is essential to keeping such large 
deployments healthy and helps enable enterprises to stay up and 
running all the time."</blockquote>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Oracle Releases Updated Berkeley DB with Android  Support</h3>

<p>Oracle has released Oracle Berkeley DB, the small-footprint, open 
source embeddable database engine for mission-critical 'edge' 
applications.  This new version introduces a new SQL API, based on 
SQLite, which is familiar to a large developer community and helps 
simplify application development.</p>

<p>New features include support for JDBC and ODBC connections to Oracle
Berkeley DB.  In addition, Oracle Berkeley DB 11g Release 2 introduces
support for the Android platform, allowing developers to develop and deploy
a wide range of applications on mobile devices.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional stand-alone databases, Berkeley DB runs directly in 
the application that uses it, enabling applications to execute faster 
in embedded environments such as handsets and mobile devices.</p>

<p>Key new features and benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li> New SQL API;<br />
<li> SQLite Tools Integration making it easier to develop, deploy, and 
manage Berkeley DB applications;<br />
<li> Flexible configuration including the library, cache size, database 
location and transactions under the control of embedding application;<br />
<li> Improved SQL concurrency using the Berkeley DB fine-grained locking 
mechanism and write-ahead logging;<br />
<li> Simplified Data Synchronization using the Oracle Database Lite 
Mobile Server.
</ul>
 
<p>"Oracle Berkeley DB's new SQLite-compatible SQL API offers powerful 
features for its users and the SQLite community at large.  The 
combination of the two technologies provides developers with 
tremendous flexibility in that a single SQL/API can now be used across 
a broad spectrum of applications.  Oracle has done a fantastic job of 
not only integrating the technologies, but also being an exemplary 
participant in the open source community by contributing time, 
expertise and resources to the SQLite project," said Mike Owens, 
author of "The Definitive Guide to SQLite."</p>

<p>Oracle Berkeley DB 11g Release 2 was available for download on March 
31, 2010.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Red Hat Extends Its SOA Platform For Cloud Adoption</h3>

<p>At EclipseCon in March, Red Hat announced JBoss Enterprise SOA 
Platform 5.0, a major update to its JBoss Enterprise Middleware 
portfolio. JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.0 is an IDE that integrates 
applications, services, transactions, and business process components 
into an architecture for automating business and IT processes.</p>

<p>JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.0 includes an updated enterprise 
services bus with enhanced protocol listeners, Web services 
integration, and a new rules engine that can be managed by JBoss 
Enterprise BRMS (business rules management system). </p>

<p>Also expanding Red Hat's middleware portfolio is JBoss Developer 
Studio 3.0. This platform now includes support for all of the JBoss 
Enterprise Platforms; JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, SOA, 
Portal and Data Services platforms. Additionally, the toolset is built 
on the latest major release of Eclipse 3.5, and includes new 
development capabilities for building SOA services and data 
transformation tools for developing enhanced integration services.</p>

<p>To expand the use of cloud-based applications and services, the JBoss 
Enterprise SOA Platform   integrates applications and services in 
cloud and on-premise deployments. Cloud-based IT has the potential to 
further increase business process automation.</p>

<blockquote>"Application development within the SOA-equipped enterprise has 
evolved significantly over the past two years, demanding a more 
eclectic and flexible arsenal of expertise and matching tools," said 
Brad Shimmin, Principal Analyst Application Infrastructure at Current 
Analysis. "Services and their underlying data must be considered 
together, as do cloud and premise deployments, as do rich internet 
applications and complex integrated services. JBoss Developer Studio 
3.0 melds these disparate concerns using the agility of the Eclipse 
3.5 platform and a broad quiver of supported frameworks that includes 
RichFaces, Seam, Spring, Struts and GWT."</blockquote>

<p>Red Hat featured both JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.0 and JBoss at 
Eclipsecon 2010 in Santa Clara, CA. For additional information on 
JBoss Developer Studio 3.0 and to download an evaluation copy, visit
