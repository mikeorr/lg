<h2>News in General</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Google Gives Web $120 Million Gift</h3>

<p>At its third Google I/O developer conference, Google announced that it 
was releasing the VP8 video codec as free open-source software. The 
VP8 video codec was originally developed by On2, a company that Google 
acquired in 2009, and is valued at $120 million.  </p>

<p>Google has joined with a broad array of companies (Mozilla, 
Brightcove, Skype, Opera and others) and web community members to 
support WebM, an open web media format project, which will use VP8.  
Several partners expressed strong support for the codec, which will be 
royalty free, including Mozilla's VP of engineering Mike Shaver. </p> 

<p>WebM provides an open and standard video codec which can compete with 
the H.264 proprietary codec that Apple and Microsoft are supporting. 
H.264 is not currently open-source and patent licensing and/or 
royalties may be required.  </p>

<p>The WebM open web media format is comprised of:<br />
* VP8, a high-quality video codec;<br />
* Vorbis, an already open source and broadly implemented audio codec;<br />
* a container format based on a subset of the Matroska media container.</p>

<p>According to Google, VP8 results in more efficient bandwidth usage 
(lower costs for publishers) and high-quality video for end users. A 
developer preview is available at <a href="http://www.webmproject.org">http://www.webmproject.org</a>.
See the WebM FAQ at:
<a href="http://www.webmproject.org/about/faq/1999">http://www.webmproject.org/about/faq/1999</a>.</p>

<p>In other conference announcements, Google released its Wave wiki
application to the public (anyone can now sign up) and also announced a
business version of its App Engine Platform-as-a-Service.  New App Engine
capabilities include managing all the apps in an organization from one
place, simple pricing based on users and applications, premium developer
support, a 99.9% uptime service level agreement, and coming later this
year, access to premium features like cloud-based SQL and SSL. The
SpringSource Tool Suite and Google Web Toolkit are being integrated to
support Java apps on the business App Engine.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Citrix XenClient Delivers Isolated Virtual Desktops "To Go"</h3>

<p>At its Synergy 2010 conference on virtualization and cloud computing, 
Citrix Systems announced the first public release of Citrix XenClient, 
a new client-side virtualization solution.  Developed in collaboration 
with Intel, it allows centrally managed virtual desktops to run 
directly on corporate laptops and PCs, even when they are disconnected 
from the network.</p>

<p>A major milestone in the industry, XenClient provides high levels of 
performance, security, and isolation through its bare metal 
architecture and integration with Intel vPro hardware virtualization 
technologies. XenClient Express, a free trial and evaluation kit that 
lets IT professionals begin experiencing the benefits of desktop 
virtualization for their mobile users, is available for immediate 
download.</p>

<p>This development comes at a time when parts of the Open Source 
community are edging away from XEN as a hypervisor as KVM gains 
support. Integration of the Xen Dom0 code with the Linux kernel has 
fallen behind schedule while Citrix has been offering more enterprise 
class products and support under the XenServer banner and has been 
tweaking up its broad partner infrastructure. </p>

<p>Extending virtual desktops to mobile laptop users requires a portable 
local VM-based desktop solution that delivers the benefits of 
centralized management and security while fulfilling the great user 
experience, mobility and flexibility that users expect from a laptop 
device. This approach also allows customers to run more than one 
virtual desktop on the same laptop - ideal for companies that want to 
maintain a secure corporate desktop for each user, while still giving 
employees the freedom to run their own personal desktop and 
applications on the same device. Current client-side technologies that 
run virtual desktops on top of an existing operating system have not 
been able to match these requirements. XenClient, a bare metal 
hypervisor which is built on the same virtualization technology as 
Citrix XenServer, can offer the control and security that IT demands.</p>

<p>Citrix XenClient was demonstrated in the opening day keynote with 
Citrix CEO Mark Templeton as well as in the hands-on learning labs and 
show floor at Citrix Synergy 2010 in May.</p>

<p>Note that XenClient needs an Intel i5 or i7 chip, not a Core Duo or an 
i3; it requires the new vPRO implementation. However, Citrix execs hint 
that other chip architectures will be added slowly, perhaps in 2011.</p>

<p>Key Facts and Highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li> XenClient Bare Metal Hypervisor - Based on Citrix XenServer 
technology, and leveraging Intel virtualization technology, 
XenClient enables each virtual machine to run side-by-side 
directly on the hardware, rather than hosted within the installed 
operating system. IT can deliver secure, locked down corporate 
environments while giving users the flexibility to install 
personal applications in a separate virtual machine without 
compromising the security of either desktop.</li>
<li> Receiver for XenClient - Citrix Receiver for XenClient is a 
lightweight client that lets users create and manage their own 
local virtual desktops, or access centrally managed corporate 
virtual desktops.</li>
<li> Synchronizer for XenClient - Laptops with XenClient can connect 
to Synchronizer to download centrally-managed virtual desktops. 
Synchronizer enables user data to be backed up automatically 
through a secure connection over the internet. With Synchronizer, 
IT can define security policies for managed laptops, disable lost 
or stolen XenClient laptops and restore a user's virtual desktop 
on any XenClient based laptop.</li>
<li> Availability - XenClient Express, which includes the XenClient 
bare metal hypervisor, Citrix Receiver for XenClient and 
Synchronizer for XenClient, is freely available for public 
download. XenClient express is intended for organizations to trial 
small deployments within their organization at no charge. 
XenClient is expected to become generally available with the next 
release of Citrix XenDesktop later in 2010.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Distro News</h2>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Fedora 13 released with 3D Graphics Drivers</h3>

<p>The Fedora Linux distribution is now at version 13, codenamed Goddard. 
It brings important platform enhancements and several new desktop 
applications plus new open source graphics drivers.</p>

<p>Fedora 12 included experimental 3D support for newer ATI cards in the 
free and open source Radeon driver, and now experimental 3D support 
has been extended in Fedora 13 to the Nouveau driver for a range of 
NVIDIA video cards. Simply install the mesa-dri-drivers-experimental 
package to take advantage of this new feature. Support for 3D 
acceleration using the radeon driver is no longer considered 
experimental with version 13.</p>

<p>Fedora 13 ships with GNOME 2.30, the latest stable version of the 
GNOME desktop environment. The new version of GNOME adds a few 
noteworthy improvements, such as support for a split-pane view in the 
Nautilus file manager and support for Facebook chat in the Empathy 
instant messaging client.</p>

<p>Simple Scan is the default scanning utility for Fedora 13. Simple Scan 
is an easy-to-use application, designed to let users connect their 
scanner and import the image or document in an appropriate format. </p>

<p>The user interface of Anaconda, the Fedora installer, has changed to 
handle storage devices and partitioning in an easy and streamlined 
manner, with helpful hints in the right places for newbies and 
experienced users. </p>

<p>The user account tool has been completely redesigned, and the 
accountsdialog and accountsservice test packages are available to make 
it easy to configure personal information, make a personal profile 
picture or icon, generate a strong passphrase, and set up login 
options for your Fedora system.</p>

<p>PolicyKitOne replaces the old deprecated PolicyKit and gives KDE users 
a better experience of their applications and desktop in general. The 
Fedora 12 KDE Desktop Edition used Gnome Authentication Agent. 
PolicyKitOne makes it possible to utilize the native KDE 
authentication agent, KAuth in Fedora 13.</p>

<p>Fedora continues its leadership in virtualization technologies with 
improvements to KVM such as Stable PCI Addresses and Virt Shared 
Network Interface technologies. Having stable PCI addresses will 
enable virtual guests to retain PCI addresses' space on a host 
machine. The shared network interface technology enables virtual 
machines to use the same physical network interface cards (NICs) as 
the host operating system. Fedora 13 also enhances performance of 
virtualization via VHostNet acceleration of KVM networking.</p>

<p>Fedora now offers the latest version 4 NFS protocol for better 
performance, and, in conjunction with recent kernel modifications, 
includes IPv6 support for NFS as well. Also new,  NetworkManager adds 
mobile broadband enhancements to show signal strength; support for 
old-style dial-up networking (DUN) over Bluetooth; and command line 
support in addition to the improved graphical user interface.  Python 
3 with enhanced Python gdb debugging support is also included.</p>

<p>Fedora <em>spins</em> are alternate version of Fedora tailored for various 
types of users via hand-picked application set or customizations. 
Fedora 13 includes four completely new spins in addition to the 
several already available, including Fedora Security Lab, Design 
Suite, Sugar on a Stick, and Moblin spin.</p>

<p>Download versions of Fedora 13 from:

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Lucid Puppy 5.0 out of the kennel</h3>
<p>A major new version of Puppy Linux, Puppy 5.0, was released in May.</p>

<p>Puppy 5.0, code named "Lupu" and also referred to as "Lucid Puppy" is 
built from Ubuntu Lucid Lynx binary packages. It is typically Puppy, 
lean and fast, friendly and fun, with some new features. Puppy 5.0 
features Quickpet, with many Linux productivity and entertainment 
programs, configured and tested, available with one-click. Puppy 5 
also introduces choice in browsers: pick one or all and choose the 
default.</p>

<p>Lupu boots directly to the desktop and has tools to personalize Puppy. 
Language and Locale are easy to set. Kauler's Simple Network Setup is 
another of those easy config tools. Updating to keep up with bugfixes 
is another one-click wonder. Previous Puppies were all prepared 
primarily by Kauler but Puppy 5.0 was a product of the Puppy community 
with Mick Amadio, chief developer, and Larry Short, coordinator.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Opera 10.53 for Linux Now in Beta</h3>

<p>The Opera 10.53 beta for Linux and FreeBSD is now available for 
download. In this beta release, Opera has designed a faster, more 
feature-rich browser that is tailored for the Linux-platform. </p>

<p>"Linux has always been a priority at Opera, as many people within our 
own walls are devoted users," said Jon von Tetzchner, co-founder, 
Opera Software. "It was important for us in this release to make 
alterations to our terms of usage, in order to make Opera even easier 
to distribute on Linux."</p>

<p>The new Carakan JavaScript engine and Vega graphics library make Opera 
10.5x more than 8 times faster than Opera 10.10 on tests like 
Sunspider.</p>

<p>Private browsing offers windows and tabs that eliminate their browsing 
history when closed, ensuring your privacy.</p>

<p>Zooming in and out of Web pages is easier with a new zoom slider and 
view controls accessible from the status bar. Widgets are now 
installed as normal applications on your computer and can work 
separately from the browser.</p>

<p>The user interface for Linux has been reworked, and the new "O" menu 
allows access to all features previously available in the menu bar. 
The menu bar can be easily reinstated.
No more Qt dependence. Opera's user interface now integrates with 
either GNOME/GTK or KDE libraries, depending on the users' 
installation.</p>

<p>Better integration with KDE and Gnome desktops and full support for 
skinning gives Opera 10.53 for Linux a seamless integration on a wide 
variety of different Linux distributions.</p>

<p>New End User License agreement for Opera 10.53 beta for Linux: Opera 
10.53 beta is now available for inclusion in software distribution 
repositories for wide distribution on Linux and FreeBSD operating 
systems. Additionally, all browsers (Desktop, Mini and Mobile) can be 
installed in organizations. For example a systems administrator at a 
school can install Opera on all the school's PCs.</p>

<p>Download Opera for Linux and FreeBSD at 
<a href="http://www.opera.com/browser/next/">http://www.opera.com/browser/next/</a>.</p>
