<h1>Right To Your Own Devices</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/kapil.html">Kapil Hari Paranjape</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Linux 2.4.x had the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) and other
multi-disk/multi-partition block device constructs. These have been
enhanced by the Device Mapper in Linux 2.6.x. Here is a one line
summary:</p>

<blockquote>You can choose any sequence of blocks on a sequence of
block devices and create a new block device <em>some</em> of whose
blocks are identified with the blocks you chose
earlier.</blockquote>
That'll take a while to chew on. Meanwhile here are some ways you
can use the device mapper:

<ul>
<li>What files will this program create? Get it to write them on a
COW!</li>

<li>Let the file-system not go on holiday while you take
snapshots.</li>

<li>Dice it, slice it, and resize it - but don't reboot.</li>

<li>If your data is more valuable than the hard disk - encrypt
it.</li>
</ul>
There <em>is</em> a catch, of course. To do all this with the
<em>root</em> device, some changes need to be made at boot time.
Rather than get diverted, we will concentrate on learning how to
use the device mapper - to do this we will use &ldquo;dummy&rdquo;
loop devices instead of &ldquo;real&rdquo; disks. After you have
gained some confidence, you can move on to real disks and perhaps
even the root device.

<h3>How To Fake It With A Loop</h3>

<p>In Unix, everything is a file. Even a block device like
<code>/dev/hda2</code> which is meant to be read in
&ldquo;chunks&rdquo; called <em>blocks</em>, can be read
byte-by-byte like a file. The loop device allows us to reverse this
asymmetry and treat any file like a block device. Activate loop
devices for your Linux with <code>modprobe loop</code> (as root) if
necessary.</p>

<p>To demonstrate this without risking serious damage to useful
files, we will only use empty files. First of all, create an empty
file like so:</p>

<pre>
    dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/store1 bs=1024 seek=2047 count=1
</pre>
This creates a file full of nothing and 2 Megabytes in size. Now we
make it into a block device:

<pre>
    losetup /dev/loop1 /tmp/store1
</pre>
We then operate with this block device just as we would with any
other block device:

<ol type="1">
<li>Check its size in 512-byte blocks

<pre>
        blockdev --getsize /dev/loop1
</pre></li>

<li>Make a file system on it

<pre>
        mke2fs /dev/loop1
</pre></li>

<li>Mount this file system somewhere

<pre>
        mount /dev/loop1 /mnt
</pre></li>
</ol>
After this you can use <code>/mnt</code> just as you would any
other file-system - the changes will be written to
<code>/tmp/store1</code>. When you get tired of playing with the
loop blocks, you put them away with commands like <code>losetup -d
/dev/loop1</code>.

<p>We will use loop devices like <code>/dev/loop1</code>,
<code>/dev/loop2</code> and so on as the building block devices in
what follows.</p>

<h3>Step Into My Parlor...</h3>

<p>...said the device mapper to the block device. If it is not
already activated, load the device mapper for your Linux with
<code>modprobe dm-mod</code> (as root.) The device mapper can take
any block device under its wing with a command like</p>

<pre>
    echo 0 $(blockdev --getsize /dev/loop1) linear /dev/loop1 0 | \
        dmsetup create new
</pre>
This creates a &ldquo;new&rdquo; block device
<code>/dev/mapper/new</code>; but this is not really new data.
Reading from this block device returns <em>exactly</em> the same
result as reading directly from <code>/dev/loop1</code>; similarly
with writing to this block device. Looks a lot like the same old
blah in a new block device! So you could get rid of this block
device by <code>dmsetup remove new</code>.

<p>Of course, you can do things differently. For example, you can
take only half of <code>/dev/loop1</code> as your block device:</p>

<pre class="code">
    SIZE1=$(blockdev --getsize /dev/loop1)
    echo 0 $(($SIZE1 / 2)) linear /dev/loop1 0 | \
        dmsetup create half
</pre>
The remaining half (which could be the bigger &ldquo;half&rdquo; if
<code>/dev/loop1</code> is odd-sized!) is then also available for
use. You could use it in combination with <code>/dev/loop2</code>
to create another block device:

<pre class="code">
    REST1=$((SIZE1 - $SIZE1 / 2))
    echo 0 $REST1 linear /dev/loop1 $((SIZE1 / 2))  &gt; /tmp/table1
    echo $REST1 $(blockdev --getsize /dev/loop2) \
        linear /dev/loop2 0 &gt;&gt; /tmp/table1
    dmsetup create onenahalf /tmp/table1
</pre>
Let us try to understand this example and what each of the three
numbers on each line of <code>/tmp/table</code> mean. The first
number is the starting sector of the map described, the second
number is the number of sectors in the map. The word
<code>linear</code> is followed by the name of the original device
that the map refers to; this is followed by the sector number of
the first sector (of this original device) which is assigned by
this map. Read that again!

<p>So you can slice and splice your disks as you like - but there
<em>is</em> a small cost, of course. All operations to these new
block devices go through the device mapper rather than directly to
the underlying hardware. With efficient table management in the
kernel, this overhead should not slow down things perceptibly.</p>

<p>Notice how I slipped in (clever me!) the use of
&ldquo;tables&rdquo; that contain the mapped device descriptions.
If you are planning to use mapped devices a lot and don't want to
forget your settings, such tables are the way to go. Don't worry -
you can always get the table of any device like
<code>/dev/mapper/new</code> by</p>

<pre>
    dmsetup table new
</pre>
In the output, the original block device will appear as
<code>major:minor</code>, so you will have to figure out what the
device is actually called if you need the table in human readable
form. (Hint: Try

<pre>
    ls -l /dev | grep "$major, *$minor"
</pre>
or something very like it.) Don't forget to run

<pre>
    dmsetup remove half
    dmsetup remove onenahalf
</pre>
when you are through.

<p>Perhaps you are one of those people who own multiple disks
configured so that reading <em>n</em> bytes from one of them is
<em>slower</em> than reading <em>n</em>/2 bytes from two of them;
this may happen because your disk controller is capable of
multi-disk operations in parallel or because you have multiple disk
controllers. The device mapper can help you to speed up your
operations.</p>

<pre class="code">
    SIZE=$(( $(blockdev --getsize /dev/loop1) + \
         $(blockdev --getsize /dev/loop2) ))
    echo 0 $SIZE striped 2 16 /dev/loop1 0 /dev/loop2 0 | \
        dmsetup create tiger
</pre>
Now reads/writes from <code>/dev/mapper/tiger</code> will alternate
(in 16 sector chunks) between the two devices; you will also have
combined the disks into one as in the <code>linear</code> case.

<h3>Snapshots and COWs</h3>

<p>There may be a number of reasons why you may want to stop all
writes to your block device but not want the system to come to a
grinding halt.</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><b>Regular backups</b>
</dt>

<dd>&ldquo;Classically&rdquo; machines were put in single-user mode
to take backups. Backing-up a &ldquo;live&rdquo; system has the
risk of incomplete or corrupted files and erroneous time
stamps.</dd>

<dt><b>Security</b>
</dt>

<dd>This jazzy new screen saver you want to install - what changes
is it going to make to your file-system? You want to find out.</dd>

<dt><b>CDROMs</b>
</dt>

<dd>...or other read-only physical devices. Say you want to set up
your system on a CDROM but still want to allow local
&ldquo;ephemeral&rdquo; changes that are discarded when the system
reboots.</dd>
</dl>
The solution is re-direction. Effectively you tell the processes,
&ldquo;Look behind you!&rdquo; and in-a-snap put a layer between
the process and the device. Activate the snapshot feature of the
device mapper with <code>modprobe dm-snapshot</code> if necessary.

<p>Let us start then with a device which is managed by the device
mapper. For example it could be created by</p>

<pre class="code">
    SIZE1=$(blockdev --getsize /dev/loop1)
    SIZE2=$(blockdev --getsize /dev/loop2)
    cat &gt; /tmp/table2 &lt;&lt;EOF
    0 $SIZE1 linear /dev/loop1 0
    $SIZE1 $SIZE2 linear /dev/loop2 0
    EOF
    dmsetup create base /tmp/table2
</pre>
Now assume that you have put a file system on this device with a
command like <code>mke2fs /dev/mapper/base</code>; and suppose you
have begun using this file system at <code>/mnt</code> with the
command <code>mount /dev/mapper/base /mnt</code>.

<p>We will now take a &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo; of this file-system -
in slow motion! The following steps have to be run quite quickly
(say with a script) on a running system where this file-system is
being changed actively.</p>

<p>First of all you create a duplicate of this device. This is not
just for safety - we will be changing the meaning of
<code>/dev/mapper/base</code> without telling the file-system!</p>

<pre>
    dmsetup table base | dmsetup create basedup
</pre>
Next we prepare our COW (copy-on-write) block device by making sure
the first 8 (or whatever you decide is your chunk size) sectors are
zeroed.

<pre>
    CHUNK=8
    dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/loop3 bs=512 count=$CHUNK
</pre>
Now we suspend all I/O (reads/writes) to the <code>base</code>
device. This is the critical step for a running system. The kernel
will have to put to sleep all processes that attempt to read from
or write to this device; so we want to be sure we can resume soon.

<pre>
    dmsetup suspend base &amp;&amp; TIME=$(date)
</pre>
The next step is to use the COW to clone the device:

<pre class="code">
    echo 0 $(blockdev --getsize /dev/mapper/basedup) \
        snapshot /dev/mapper/basedup /dev/loop3 p 8 | \
        dmsetup create top
</pre>
What this says is that from now on reading from
<code>/dev/mapper/top</code> will return the data from
<code>/dev/mapper/basedup</code> <em>unless</em> you write
&ldquo;on top&rdquo; of the original data. Writes to
<code>top</code> will actually be written on
<code>/dev/loop3</code> in chunks of size 8 sectors. If you have
used multiple transparent plastic sheets one on top of the other
(or &ldquo;Layers&rdquo; in GIMP) the effect is similar - what is
written on top obscures what is below but wherever nothing is
written on top you see clearly what is written on the lower layer.

<p>In particular, we can now make sure that all changes to the
underlying block devices are &ldquo;volatile.&rdquo; If we execute
the following commands (we'll bookmark this as <a name="point_A"
id="point_A">'<strong>Point A</strong>'</a> for later use) -</p>

<pre>
    dmsetup table top | dmsetup load base
    dmsetup resume base
</pre>
we will have replaced the file-system under <code>/mnt</code> with
another one where all changes actually go to
<code>/dev/loop3</code>. When we dismantle this setup,
<code>/dev/loop1</code> and <code>/dev/loop2</code> will be in
<em>exactly</em> the state that they were in at time
<code>$TIME</code>.

<p>If <code>/dev/loop1</code> and <code>/dev/loop2</code> are on
non-writable physical media (such as a CDROM), whereas
<code>/dev/loop3</code> is on a writable one (such as RAM or hard
disk), then we have created a writable file-system out of a
read-only one!</p>

<p>This solves the last problem in our list above - but what about
the first two? To tackle the second problem we must have some way
of comparing the new file-system with the older one. If you try to
mount <code>/dev/mapper/basedup</code> somewhere in order to this,
you will find that Linux (the kernel!) refuses to let you do this.
Instead we can create yet another device:</p>

<pre class="code">
    echo 0 $(blockdev --getsize /dev/mapper/basedup) \
        snapshot-origin /dev/mapper/basedup | \
        dmsetup create origin
</pre>
You can now mount <code>/dev/mapper/origin</code> somewhere (say
<code>/tmp/orig</code>) and compare the original file system with
the current one with a command like

<pre>
    diff -qur /tmp/orig /mnt
</pre>
What happens if you write to <code>/tmp/orig</code>? Check it out
and you'll be mystified for a moment.

<p>The analogy of plastic sheets breaks down here! All writes to
<code>/tmp/orig</code> go directly to the underlying device
<code>basedup</code> but are <em>negated</em> on
<code>/dev/loop3</code> so as to become invisible to reads from
<code>/mnt</code>. Similarly, reads from <code>/tmp/orig</code>
ignore whatever changes were made by writing to <code>/mnt</code>.
In other words the original file system has been <em>forked</em>
(and orthogonally at that!) and <code>/dev/loop3</code> actually
stores both negative and positive data in order to achieve this. No
plastic sheet can be made to work like this!</p>

<p>To see why this is useful, let us see how it solves the problem
of backups. What we want is to get a &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo; view of
the file-system but we want to continue using the <em>original</em>
system. So in this case we should <em>not</em> run the commands at
<a href="#point_A">point A</a> above. Instead we run the commands
here, at <a name="point_B" id="point_B"><strong>point
B</strong></a>:</p>

<pre>
    dmsetup table origin | dmsetup load base
    dmsetup resume base
</pre>
Now all writes to <code>/mnt</code> will go onto the original
device, but these changes are negated on
<code>/dev/mapper/top</code>. So if we mount the latter device at
(say) <code>/tmp/snap</code>, then we can read a snapshot of the
files at time <code>$TIME</code> from this directory. A command
like

<pre class="code">
    cd /tmp/snap
    find . -xdev | cpio -o -H new &gt; "backup-at-$TIME"
</pre>
will provide a snapshot backup of the file-system at time
<code>$TIME</code>.

<p>We could also have taken such a snapshot at <a href=
"#point_A">Point A</a> with the commands</p>

<pre class="code">
    cd /tmp/orig
    find . -xdev | cpio -o -H new &gt; "backup-at-$TIME"
</pre>
The main difference is that the changes to
<code>/dev/mapper/top</code> are volatile! There is no way to
easily dismantle the structure created under (A) without losing all
the changes made. In the backup context you <em>want</em> to retain
the changes; at <a href="#point_B">Point B</a> you run

<pre>
    dmsetup suspend base
    dmsetup remove top
    dmsetup remove origin
    dmsetup table basedup | dmsetup load base
    dmsetup resume base
</pre>
and you are back to business as usual. If you were to run this at
<a href="#point_A">Point A</a> the results would be quite
unpredictable! What would be the status of all those open files on
<code>/dev/mapper/top</code>? A number of hung processes would be
the most likely outcome - even some kernel threads could hang - and
then perhaps break!

<h3>For Your Eyes Only</h3>

<p>Say you have a laptop or CD which carries some valuable data -
valuable not just to you but to anyone who has it. (When, Oh! When
will <em>I</em> ever get my hands on such data). In this case
backups are no good. What you want is to protect this data from
theft. Assuming you believe in the strength of current encryption
techniques you could protect it by encrypting the relevant file.
This approach has some serious problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>The file must be de/re-encrypted every time you want to use
it.</li>

<li>The encrypted file is pin-pointed, thus narrowing down the
search for anyone wanting to steal your stuff.</li>

<li>You may not know precisely which files contain secret stuff.
For example you prepare a secret report and send it to the printer.
Unbeknownst to you a temporary PDF file was created for this purpose
and you didn't encrypt that.</li>
</ul>
For these and a possible host of other reasons you may want to
encrypt the entire block device. The device mapper offers a way to
do this. Activate the encryption service of the device mapper with
<code>modprobe dm-crypt</code> if necessary. Also activate some
encryption and hashing mechanism by commands like <code>modprobe
md5</code> and <code>modprobe aes</code> if necessary.

<p>First of all you need to generate and store your secret key. If
you use AES as indicated above then you can use a key of length
up to 32 bytes which can be generated by a command like</p>

<pre class="code">
    dd if=/dev/random bs=16 count=1 | \
      od --width=16 -t x2 | head -1 | \
      cut -f2- -d' ' | tr -d ' ' &gt; /tmp/my_secret_key
</pre>
Of course, you should probably not output your secret key to such a
file - there <em>are</em> safer ways of storing it:

<ul>
<li>Output it directly to the screen and memorize it! It's only 32
characters after all!</li>

<li>Write it to a USB stick or some such device which
<em>never</em> leaves your pocket.</li>

<li>Encrypt it using <code>gpg</code> or <code>openssl</code> and
then store it on a the USB stick or a device that never leaves
you.</li>
</ul>
If you use the third option you will need to use a passphrase - you
must remember this passphrase as well. One way to do that is to use
this passphrase often - use it... or lose it!

<p>You can now setup the encrypted device</p>

<pre class="code">
    echo 0 $(blockdev --getsize /dev/loop1) \
      crypt aes-plain $(cat /tmp/my_secret_key) 0 /dev/loop1 0 | \
      dmsetup create mydata
</pre>
You can then make a file-system <code>mke2fs
/dev/mapper/mydata</code> on this block device and store data on it
after mounting it somewhere with <code>mount /dev/mapper/mydata
/mnt</code>. All the data written to <code>/mnt</code> will then be
transparently encrypted before storing it in
<code>/dev/loop1</code>. When you are through you unmount the
device and dismantle it as before:

<pre>
    umount /mnt
    dmsetup remove mydata
</pre>
The next time you want to use the device you can set it up with the
same command as above (providing you supply the secret key in
<code>/tmp/my_secret_key</code>). Of course, you shouldn't rune
<code>mke2fs</code> on the device a second time unless you want to
erase all that valuable data!

<h3>Getting To The Root Of The Problem</h3>

<p>All the steps given above can be carried out on any block
device(s) in place of the loop devices that were used. However,
when the block device is the root device then life gets a little
more complex. (Roots generally <em>are</em> complex).</p>

<p>First of all we need to put the root device under the control of
the device mapper; this is best done with an initial RAM disk (or
<code>initrd</code>). Even after this is done, we need to be
careful if we are trying to run some of the above commands for the
root file system on a &ldquo;live&rdquo; system. In particular, it
is not advisable to suspend I/O on the root file system without
deep introspection! After all this means that all processes that
make a read/write call to the root file system will be put to
sleep.</p>

<p>Here is one way around the problem. Create a temporary file
system</p>

<pre>
    mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /mnt
</pre>
To this file system copy all the files that are necessary in order
to perform the changes - in particular, you need
<code>/sbin/dmsetup</code>, <code>/bin/sh</code>, the
<code>/dev</code> files and all shared libraries that these
programs depend on. Then you run <code>chroot /mnt</code>. After
this you <em>can</em> run a script or (if you type quickly and
without errors!) a sequence of commands that will suspend the root
device map and make relevant changes to it - for example, to take a
snapshot. Don't forget to resume the root device before exiting the
<code>chroot</code>.

<h3>After word</h3>

<p>Given the complexity of the various operations, it is probably
best to produce a shell script or even a C program that carries out
the tasks. Luckily, the latter has already been implemented - the
<a href="http://sourceware.org/lvm2/">Linux Logical Volume Manager
version 2</a> does carry out most of the tasks described above
quite &ldquo;automagically.&rdquo; Setup and use of encryption is
greatly simplified by the <a href=
"http://www.saout.de/misc/dm-crypt/"><tt>cryptsetup</tt></a>
program. Why then did I write this article?</p>

<p>I originally came upon <a href=
"ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/dm/"><tt>dmsetup</tt></a> while
trying to create a read-only root file system for a
&ldquo;live&rdquo; CDROM. Unfortunately, the LVM2 tools are not
useful as they only look at the use of snapshots for backups -
clearly they don't care for COWs! The only resource that I found
for this was the <a href=
"https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2004-July/msg00071.html">RedHat
Mailing list</a> archives. There are now tools which come with live
CD's that make use of <code>dmsetup</code>; for example I came
across <a href=
"http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/LiveCDPersistence">this link</a>
which explains how UBuntu does it.</p>

<p>Of course, using <code>dmsetup</code> allowed me to get as
&ldquo;close to the metal&rdquo; as is possible without writing
real programs...</p>
