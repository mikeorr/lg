Dear list,
</p>

<p>
here is the actual situation which I like to share with you.
I have a Suse10 box with 2 lan card.  I also have a 10 port
HUB.
Now I like to dial my ISP with one lan card and another lan
will be connected with the HUB. hence the other PCs can
share the net connection from the HUB.  I like to implement
this. Could any one suggest any tutorial or suggest me to do
this ??
</p>

<p>
thanks for your support.
</p>

<p>
Assuming you configured your two interfaces. 
</p>

<p>
In SuSE 9.1 you go yast and security-&gt;firewall, reconfigure, next, next
and check [x] forward traffic and do masquerading
</p>

<p>
You should do this on the internal interface I think....

Dear Karl-Heinz,
</p>

<p>
I have done this but no positive result yet. let me allow to
tell you everything which I have done step by step.
</p>

<p>
1] the card called eth0 is used to dial up my isp. here is
the configuration
<pre>
             isp 10.10.96.56
             mask 255.0.0.0
             gateway 10.10.0.1
</pre>
I have no problem to dial up my isp using eth0 by the linc
client.  and getting the net here.  fine..
</p>

<p>
2] now my 2nd lan called eth1 has the setting
<pre>
     ip 192.168.0.2
     mask 255.255.255.0
</pre>
3] I have a linksys RV042 load balancing router which have 2
uplink port.
     I have configured one uplink with ip 192.168.0.114  and
 mask 255.255.255.0
     and connect this port with eth1
</p>

<p>
4]     now I executed these command
<pre>
   #Clears if any old iptable rules/ policies are there.
              iptables --flush -t nat
</p>

<p>
 # Now we will do Masquerading ie. we are doing NAT.
           iptables --table nat --append POSTROUTING
--out-interface ppp0 -j MASQUERADE
           iptables --append FORWARD --in-interface eth0 -j
ACCEPT
</p>

<p>
 # Enabling packet forwarding.
          echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward 
</pre>
but not getting any connection from client machine.
</p>

<p>
even I tried to ping from the linux server like
     ping 192.168.0.114  ( the uplink of router)  but
destination was not reacable.
</p>

<p>
Please suggest how can I solve the problem. pointing out any
tutorial is also welcome.
thanks
</p>

What is a load balancing router doing <strong>inside</strong> the LAN? I think you
should be using a HUB/switch. Here is a little diagram
<pre>
	-----[ eth0: Linux nat box : eth1]----[ Hub/switch ]---[LAN]
</pre>
Is this not what you want? Perhaps I understood your question wrong.

</pre>
DHCP enable. bcoz the load balancing router has DHCP server
inbuilt gateway ---&gt; 192.168.1.2
  
 
here is the script I use in my suse 10
  
iptables --flush -t nat
iptables --table nat --append POSTROUTING --out-interface
eth0 -j MASQUERADE
iptables --append FORWARD --in-interface eth1 -j ACCEPT
echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
</pre>
after executing the script I have tried from the clients pc
with out success.
Could any one kindly point out my mistake ?
please note I am getting the internet from the linux pc
which dialup isp1

I still think that putting the router in the middle is needless
source of confusion in your network. You <strong>can</strong> use it as a DHCP
server even if you link eth1 directly to the hub and use just one
port of your router also connected to the hub. 
</p>

<p>
Still, the network layout as you gave it, <strong>can</strong> work if configured
properly.

<p>
What is the Linux box to do when it has a packet which is destined
for 192.168.1.x?
</p>

<p>
As far as I can make out from your description that packet is
destined for eth0!
</p>

<p>
Thus you need to have a route on your Linux box
<pre>
	route add -net 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0 gateway 192.168.0.144
</pre>
(where 192.168.0.144 is the address of your router port which is
connect to the box). Now, if your wan router is configured to do this
it will send the packets to the correct machine.
</p>

<p>

Please note ( as I mentioned in my previous mail) that  the 
only reason using the linux box with 2 lan is eth0 is used
to
dial up the 24online isp and then eth1 is used to redirect
the connection 
into the wan port of the router.
the utility of this router, it is a load balancing router
with 2 wan port.
one wan port is connected with data one BSNL connection
and the other port I am trying to connect with 24online
hence 
I'll get a load balancing setup. but I can't take out the
24online from the linux box due to configuration problem <img src="../gx/frown.png" alt=":-(">

I think most people on this list have politely been trying to point out
to you that they don't think that the config of your linux server is
causing the problems here.
I think that the router which is between your lan and your linux server
is causing the problems.
</p>

<p>
A simple way to test this is:
</p>

<p>
1. Leave the server as is.
</p>

<p>
2. Remove the router, plug the cable from the linux server straight into
the hub/switch
</p>

<p>
3. Configure one client with the same ip-address as before but assign it
statically (by hand) instead of with dhcp.
</p>

<p>
4. Test if you can reach your linux-server.
</p>

<p>
5. Test if you can reach an IPADDRESS on the internet (f.e. ping
194.109.21.51 )
</p>

<p>
If the above steps work, your router is at fault.
If they do not, your router MAY STILL BE the faulty part in the setup,
but your linux server isn't setup correctly AS WELL !
</p>

<p>
After you get the server working correctly, it's much easier to setup
the router.
Debugging one component at a time works better than debugging two.

<p>
and now I have to confogure the router so that it can be a
load balancing one
with 2 isp. the wan2 port which is attached with the linux
box is
</p>

<pre>
wan2 configuration
----------------------------------
ip ----&gt; 192.168.0.114
mask ----&gt; 255.255.255.0
gateway ----&gt; 192.168.0.2 (ip of the linux lan card)
dns ------&gt; 192.168.0.2
</pre>
I think here I have to verify.
</p>

<p>
thanks to all responders to atleast fell some success.
</p>

&gt; &gt; Please note ( as I mentioned in my previous mail) that 
&gt; &gt; the  only reason using the linux box with 2 lan is eth0
&gt; &gt; is used to
&gt; &gt; dial up the 24online isp and then eth1 is used to
&gt; &gt; redirect the connection 
&gt; &gt; into the wan port of the router.
&gt; &gt; the utility of this router, it is a load balancing
&gt; &gt; router with 2 wan port.
&gt; &gt; one wan port is connected with data one BSNL connection
&gt; &gt; and the other port I am trying to connect with 24online
&gt; &gt; hence 
&gt; &gt; I'll get a load balancing setup. but I can't take out
&gt; &gt; the 24online from the linux box due to configuration
&gt; &gt;   problem <img src="../gx/frown.png" alt=":-("> 
&gt; I think most people on this list have politely been trying
&gt; to point out to you that they don't think that the config
&gt; of your linux server is causing the problems here.
&gt; I think that the router which is between your lan and your
&gt; linux server is causing the problems.
&gt; 
&gt; A simple way to test this is:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Leave the server as is.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Remove the router, plug the cable from the linux server
&gt; straight into the hub/switch
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Configure one client with the same ip-address as before
&gt; but assign it statically (by hand) instead of with dhcp.
&gt; 
&gt; 4. Test if you can reach your linux-server.
&gt; 
&gt; 5. Test if you can reach an IPADDRESS on the internet
&gt; (f.e. ping 194.109.21.51 )
&gt; 
&gt; If the above steps work, your router is at fault.
&gt; If they do not, your router MAY STILL BE the faulty part
&gt; in the setup, but your linux server isn't setup correctly
&gt; AS WELL !
&gt; 
&gt; After you get the server working correctly, it's much
&gt; easier to setup the router.
&gt; Debugging one component at a time works better than
&gt; debugging two.
&gt;

Finally SUCCESS !! I have configured the router wan2 port as
[obtain ip automatically] and every thing is working great.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to the list for its valuable guidance and baring with
me with the problem.
thanks and honour to the list.

Nice to hear it worked.
</p>

<p>
Just curious, you are aware that linux can do the routers task without
any problems ?
You are also aware that in case of a breakage of one of your internet
lines will most likely result in some loss of traffic with any
load-balancing setup ?
</p>

<p>
In nearly all cases renewal of the request will succeed afterwards due
to the loadbalancing.
But if you are building this for a system with a transactional nature
this is something you should be aware of.
