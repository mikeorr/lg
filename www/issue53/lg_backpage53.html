<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Paulo Henrique Baptista de Oliveira</H4>
I am 23 years old.  I have been using computers since age 15, from MSX Hotbit
to Linux GNU/Debian 2.2. I currently work at Linux Solutions at Brazil. We
mantain a site OLinux 
(<A HREF="http://www.olinux.com.br">www.olinux.com.br</A>) with a Introduction,
Programming, Programs, Games, Security and Interviews sections and news about
Linux everyday of the week. We have gotten a lot of positive feedback from
Brazilian Linux users. We have already published more than 100 articles and 500
news items in about 4 months.


<P>

<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Shane Collinge</H4>
Part computer programmer, part cartoonist, part Mars Bar. At night, he runs
around in a pair of colorful tights fighting criminals. During the day... well,
he just runs around.  He eats when he's hungry and sleeps when he's sleepy.                                           

<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Fernando Correa</H4>
Fernando is a computer analyst just about to finish his 
graduation at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Now, he has built
with his staff the best 
<A HREF="http://www.olinux.com.br">Linux portal</A> in Brazil and have further 
plans to improve services and content for their Internet users.



<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Pat Eyler</H4>
"Pate" is a linux/unix/networking geek who enjoys playing on the
command line.  When he's not puttering with or writing about computers
and networks he likes to play with his kids, cook, and read.  Talk to
him at <a href=mailto:pate@gnu.org>pate@gnu.org</a>.

<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Sean Lamb</H4>
I'm currently working on completing my BS degree in Computer Science at Lakeland
College (begun earlier at the University of California, Riverside). I've been
involved in computer support for the past 6 years, via phone, fax, and email,
and I have created documentation for use by end users (some articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base) and other support staff (published in-house as either
individual documents or on the support intranet), and I contributed some
chapters to "Special Edition Using KDE" from Que publishing (now in print). I
have done some application development on MS-DOS platforms and have begun
developing a pair of applications for my Linux box. I am currently employed as
a software developer working in C++ with Informix on a mix of Linux and AIX
servers. When I'm not playing with or writing about Linux, I can usually be
found working on my model railroad.



<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Ben Okopnik</H4>
A cyberjack-of-all-trades, Ben wanders the world in his 38' sailboat, building
networks and hacking on hardware and software whenever he runs out of cruising
money. He's been playing and working with computers since the Elder Days
(anybody remember the Elf II?), and isn't about to stop any time soon.



<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Juraj Sipos</H4>
I live and work in Bratislava, Slovakia as a library
information worker, translator and research reader at the Institute for
Child Psychology.  I published some of my poetry here and in USA, I
translated some books from English (e.g., Zen Flesh, Zen Bones by Paul
Reps). You can see some of my stories and poetry at
<A HREF="http://www.crosswinds.net/~aproximetri/index.htm">
http://www.crosswinds.net/~aproximetri/index.htm</A>.
Computers are my hobby.



<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Robert Stagner</H4>
Robert has been programming in Perl on the Win32 and Mac
platforms for the past three years. He's been using Linux for the last year,
and simply loves it.  When he is not programming in Perl or creating shell
scripts, he spends time with his lovely wife.


<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Alan Ward</H4>
Alan teaches CS in Andorra at highschool and university levels. He's
back to Unix this year after an 8-year forced interlude since he
graduated -- it makes networking so much easier. His hobbies include
science photography (both digital and traditional), trekking, rock and
processor collecting.

<!-- *** BEGIN Not Linux *** --->

<P> Last month I said <EM>Linux Gazette</EM> would have a new Editor.
The announcement turned out to be premature, so I am remaining the Editor
for the time being.

<P> Thanks to SOFCOM for offering the <EM>Gazette's</EM> first
<A HREF="http://www.sfcom.com/"><STRONG>Japanese translation</STRONG></A>.
You've been added to the <A HREF="../mirrors.html">mirrors page</A>.
I'll have to take our readers' word for it that the site is displaying
correctly, since my browser doesn't do Japanese characters.

<P> This issue features four articles from the OLinux site in Brazil (<A
HREF="http://www.olinux.com.br">http://www.olinux.com.br</A> -- Portuguese).
Fernando Correa and Paulo Baptista have been very cooperative with 
<EM>LG</EM>, translating their interviews with Linux personalities for us
and the like.  We at <EM>Linux Gazette</EM> like to see the growth of Linux in
non-English- speaking countries, and we're happy for the work OLinux is doing
with their Brazilian portal.  Latin America has experienced tremendous growth
in Linux use over the past year, as Mexican schools have adopted it as a
low-cost alternative to Windows, and Conectiva has released native Spanish and
Portuguese Linux distributions.  We'd like to cover more such endeavors in
other parts of the world, if readers would be willing to send in reports from
their country or translate some of their articles into English for us.

<P> This issue marks the debut of a new <EM>Linux Gazette</EM> logo and
navigation buttons.  As you know, some readers have said it's time for 
something new, so we're giving it to them.  The blue-silver chrome color was
chosen for its "industrial" look, to represent that <EM>Linux Gazette</EM> is
about putting Linux to work, getting it to do what you need.  Of course, it's
still about making Linux just a little more fun, too!  

<P> After all, if your work is chosen carefully, so that it furthers your
personal goals (whatever they are), then the work will be fun.  For instance, I
enjoy Python and Zope, so I'm happy that my work gives me the chance to learn
stuff I'd want to learn anyway.
