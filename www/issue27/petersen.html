<I>Web Security Sourcebook</I> claims to be "a serious security
source book for Web Professionals and users."
Each chapter
covers one aspect of security, ranging from basic browser security to
firewall design.
<P>
The material covered in <I>Web Security Sourcebook</I> is fairly
simple--I would expect that
any Linux user could easily understand everything
presented in the book.
The target audience for <I>Web Security Sourcebook</I>
is anyone with some computer experience but with little knowledge
of computer security. It is mostly a summary of beginning, and some
intermediate, topics.
<P>
<H4>Chapter Summary</H4> 
<P>
The first chapter, "Caught in Our Own Web", is the introduction to
the book.  The authors present a quick history of the Web split
into four stages: the beginning, HTTP, server-side scripts and
client-side scripts. Security features (authentication,
confidentiality, etc.) are quickly outlined.
<P>
Chapter two, "Basic Browser Security", outlines
the features of Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer. The
authors cover all of the preferences that deal with security and
comment on how they should be configured.
A section on Internet Explorer's Content
Advisor (basically a Web "ratings" system) is included.
<P>
The next chapter is mostly about user privacy. There is a
section that describes certificates, mostly describing their flaws,
a very brief section on passwords and a good description of cookies.
Then the authors turn to privacy and anonymity. Simple proxies, Chaum
mixes and anonymous remailers are also described.
<P>
Chapters four and five address the security concerns of client-
and server-side scripts. Security issues of Java, Javascript and
ActiveX are outlined. The section on server-side security covers system
security as well as web-server security. It is mostly aimed at
Unix users.
<P>
The next chapter, "Advanced Server-Side Security" 
consists mainly of CGI scripts and server-side includes. Information about
code signing and auditing tools is also provided.
<P>
"Creating Secure CGI Scripts" is the name of chapter seven. 
It informs the reader of a few common security holes in
CGI scripts. It also outlines Perl, Tcl and Python as three capable
CGI scripting languages.
<P>
Chapter eight is an introduction to firewalls. The authors
describe what firewalls can do and how they interact with various
protocols. The placement of the firewall is explained in the second
part of the chapter.
<P>
Chapters nine and ten outline transactions on the Web. IPSEC is
discussed in detail. Secure HTTP, SSL and PCT are explained. The
authors then explain several "digital money" standards. A good
comparison is done between six of the competing standards.
<P>
The final chapter outlines the future of security on the Web. It
explains the problem of building in security "after-the-fact". The authors
point out some issues that often affect security, although they aren't
always thought of in that sense (such as "deliberate
incompatibility").
The chapter ends with a section titled "What we need in the
future".
<P>
The book includes two appendices. The first one is a brief
description of encryption, hash functions, digital signatures and so on.
The second one is a list of all the books and URLs that the authors
mentioned in the book.
<P>
<H4>Conclusion</H4> 
<P>
<I>Web Security Sourcebook</I>
is fairly light reading and can be finished quickly. The writing is
adequate, although there are places where I found the descriptions lacking
or imprecise.
<P>
One thing that I often find annoying about security-related writings
is the use of scare tactics.
<I>Web Security Sourcebook</I> does have its share of scare tactics, but
for the most part uses realistic stories that honestly try to
inform the reader.
<P>
The information that <I>Web Security Sourcebook</I> presents is useful although
a bit shallow. The book tries to cover a lot of ground and is only
350 pages. If the book had been devoted solely to practical security fixes,
it might have impressed me. However, it included only a few specifics and
then went on to describe firewalls and transaction standards (which would
also have been interesting in more detail).
<P>
If you want an introduction to Web security and you have very little
experience with any sort of computer security, you might be interested in
<I>Web Security Sourcebook</I>. If you know much about encryption, or have
studied firewalls, or know about quite a few Web client and/or server
security holes, you will probably be disappointed by this book.
<P>
If you want to learn everything that was covered
in this book and you have the money, I would suggest getting a specific
book on each of the three or four concepts that <I>Web Security
Sourcebook</I> covers.
