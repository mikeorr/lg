Hi Answer Gang,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Which method is more efficient;
Running a command in () or running it in a seperate shell?
Can the answer include differences in how the processes
are spawned? (i.e. fork exec etc)
</STRONG></P>

OK. This is usually application/situation dependant. If you have something
like:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>#!/bin/bash

echo $(whereis xterm)
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
What you are doing there is forcing the command "whereis xterm" to run in
a subshell (denoted between ()'s). A "subshell" is just another instance
of the command-line interpreter, running your program. Thus, a "subshell"
in this instance means that the main shell script is its parent, i.e.
assume that we called the script above "parent.sh" then when the subshell
executed you'd get:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>|-parent.sh
  |-----subshell
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
This is also known as forking -- i.e. where the process breaks off from
the main caller, to form another.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<TT>"exec()</TT>"'ing a process however, means that the currently running process
is replaced by the program that is to be exec'ed. Thus unlike above
where-by the subshell ran under a new instance, the following script
exec's itself:
</blockQuote>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="../misc/tag/exec-anything.bash.txt">exec-anything.bash.txt</a></tt></p>
<blockQuote>
What this is doing is it will echo the first two lines, sleep for a second
and then re-spawn itself. What you'll see is the same message above. The
echo line will NEVER show, because it is after the program ($0 denotes the
program's name) that is being (re)exec'ed.

My question is how are invoking a program in a <TT> subshell()</TT> and
invoking it in a seperate shell different, as regards fork &amp; exec. I am asking
this as the environment inherited by both is different. I started thinking
of this really because I remembered reading somewhere sometime that invoking
it in () is more efficient than in a seperate shell. But as far as I can see,
both processes should need fork and exec.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Only difference is in (), both the
local and global environment variables are initialised, and in a seperate shell,
only global environment variables are initialised. By that logic actually, the
seperate process should be more efficient than the one in ()!

Those variables that are exported are "global" anyway, so you don't need
to describe them in this way.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
It depends. A subshell can be efficient if you want to ensure that a task
running under another shell script is carried out to completion before the
next one is executed (a good example of this would be tarring files over
ssh on a pipe).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Of course, invoking a subshell program means that if the parent dies or is
kill -9'ed, whatever, then the child process is also killed along with it.
That is something you might want to consider.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Normally, when you write a shell script, and you want to end the script
by calling another one then you would "exec" the program name, since
there is no need for the shell process to <TT> fork()</TT>.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If you need two independant processes to communicate concurrently then
using a <TT> fork()</TT> would be best.
