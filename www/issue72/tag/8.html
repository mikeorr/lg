I would place the least importance on the rotational speed - it would be
the factor least likely to be noticeable in the overall system
performance.  On the negative side, it would contribute considerably to
the amount of heat to dissipate inside the box.  Many of these types of
drives require extra cooling - added fans bringing air into the case;
naturally this also contributes to the noise factor - from the fans and
the drive(s).  I myself prefer a bit slower rotational speed (5k or 7.5k)
to avoid the noise and extra heat.

Is your CD burner SCSI as well?  This could make a difference.  My desktop
system uses SCSI for the system drive and I use a Yamaha 4x4x16 CD
re-writer.  I can't speak for the currently available devices which are
capable of burning at speeds of up to 20x, but my 4x works well, allowing
me to do other things while the burning a CD.

SCSI handles parallel operations better.  Thus, two SCSI devices can
perform I/O independently at the same time.  To achieve this with IDE,
each device has to be on a separate controller.  If you try to access
two devices on the same IDE controller simultaneously, one will wait
until the other is finished.

SCSI disk controllers offload the system board, as they have instruction
queues which buffer several instructions at a time to send to the disk as
it is ready to accept them.  In other words, it's a more intelligent type
of controller.

SCSI drives have traditionally been faster (and bigger) than IDE drives,
but advances in IDE technology has narrowed the gap.  The current EIDE
(Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics) technology and the Linux IDE
driver have actually borrowed ideas from SCSI.

I recently bought a 40GB Quantum ATA-100 drive.  I wasn't so much
interested in the data band width (bw) as much as the large capacity.  In
perusing the Quantum Internet site for the specs on the drive, I
discovered that although the drive electronics has the ATA-100 interface,
the physical design of the platter and spindle mechanism doesn't provide
100 MB/s bw anyway.  I suspect that there many drives out there with
similar aspects.  IOW, just because the drive has an ATA-100 interface
doesn't guarantee that the drive fully supports the spec.

SCSI is also more expandable since that you can connect several devices
(6-15) on one controller, where as IDE is limited to two.

Additionally, SCSI devices port nicely between different machines.  For
example, my CD burner is an external device.  I also have a tape drive,
and Iomega Jaz and Zip drives all of which are external SCSI devices.  I
can connect these to a desktop machine as well as a laptop, in various
combinations.  Although they are now offering USB versions of the Iomega
devices, USB is slower, and requires a driver for each device, which in
many cases are not available for Linux.  With SCSI, the commands are more
or less standard; one only needs the driver loaded for the controller.
With Linux, the pkg which provides the set of commands for tape drives
works for IDE as well as SCSI tape devices, AFAIK.

SCSI multi-tasks much better than IDE, and in a server environment, this
can make a big difference, and in many cases is mandatory because the
difference can be critical.

for general use, IDE is plenty adequate.  I use only IDE.  Performance
is acceptable if I put each hard drive on a separate controller (and put
infrequently-used devices such as CD-ROMs as a slave on either
controller).  IDE drives and controllers are cheaper than their SCSI
counterparts.  SCSI is anal about its configuration: if you don't
terminate the SCSI chain properly or the controller doesn't like your
cables' electrical properties for some reason, it goes into fits.

Agreed - for many single user situations IDE is adequate, especially with
the faster interfaces such as ATA-66 and ATA-100.

There are several SCSI technologies with buzzwords like "fast", "wide",
etc.  I'll let somebody else say which currently has the best
performance (and how much you'd pay for the drive + controller + cables
compared with an ordinary IDE drive).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>

"Fast" doesn't really mean much, as it's been used in a couple of
different SCSI implementations - there was Fast SCSI I, and FAST SCSI-II.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
"Wide" means 16-bit bus, which translates to 68 pins or more.  AFAIK, the
50 pin interfaces are 8 bit bus devices.  It really isn't important except
in hdd devices.  For CD's and tapes, and slower devices such as Zip
drives, the 8 bit is adequate, as the bw exceeds that of the device.
Other things being equal, it doubles the i/o bw.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
"Ultra" doubles the clock speed of the SCSI bus.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
A general rule of thumb would be something like this:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
Fast SCSI-II: 10 MB/s
</BLOCKQuote>
<blockQuote>
Wide SCSI: 20 MB/s
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Ultra SCSI: 20 MB/s
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Ultra-wide SCSI: 40 MB/s
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
68 <TT>/</TT> 80 pin LVD SCSI: 160 MB/s.  AFAIK, 320 MB/s devices are now becoming
available.
</blockQuote></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
It is important to note though, that the PCI bus (most mobo's run them at
33 MHz) maxes out at around 40 MB/s -
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Allow me to correct myself;  although the original PCI bus spec (and AFAIK most
machines still adhere to this, and most PCI cards are designed for 33Mhz
operation) called for a 33Mhz clock, PCI is a 32 bit bus.  Thus it can
handle up to 4 bytes per cycle, making theoretical maximum bw 33M/s x 4B =
132MB/s.  But the reality remains that actual performance is far below
this.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
There is a way to test this on a Linux system:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><CODE>
hdparm -t /dev/diskdev
</CODE></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
where diskdev is hda, sda, hdb, sdb depending on your systems disk cfg.
For most people it would be hda, assuming a single IDE hdd.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
On my Asus P5A 500Mhz mobo with a Tekram ultra-wide SCSI controller (40
MB/s), the above test shows 15MB/s which is 37% (about 1/3) of the rated
40MB/s.  This type of situation seems to be very common - i.e., actual
performance specs are only a fraction of the rated spec.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
So the devices which deliver a bw exceeding the local system, are really
only advantageous in RAID configurations, where the data is transferred
between the drives (or other devices) which are directly connected to the
controller at higher speeds.  Any data bound for the mobo is still limited.
This means that for anything but RAID, the LVD drives really don't offer
an advantage, and you are wasting your $$.  So one can buy a 40 MB/s
controller (I've been using the TekRAM 390U with good results - can be
bought for &lt; $100 ) and drive Ultra-Wide drive which will make maximal use
of the PCI bus, giving essentially the same performance as a much more
expensive LVD system, in a non-RAID configuration.

By "LAN" do you mean just being a client on the LAN?  Or is it a
high-demand server too?  If you plan to do intensive network serving,
CD burning and game playing simultaneously, I would consider separate
computers, especially since network serving affects others on the
network and not just you.  (After all, if your CD burning slows down
you game, too bad.  But if it slows down other people too, they may
resent it.)
