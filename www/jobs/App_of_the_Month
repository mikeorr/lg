Need a volunteer to install, explore, and write up new applications for a
monthly "Favorite App of the Month" column.

Time commitment:
	Depends on the complexity of application, any problems encountered in
	the installation, descriptive ability, etc. Estimate (assuming a
	skilled Linux user with good writing skills):

	2-4 hours per month
