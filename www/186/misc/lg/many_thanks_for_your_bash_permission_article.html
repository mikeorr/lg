Hi, Long -

&gt; Hello Ben Okopnik,
&gt; 
&gt; Yesterday I bumped into a su (substitute user) permission error similar
&gt; to your Apr. 2000 article, "Cannot execute /bin/bash: Permission denied".
&gt; I was attempting to run an expect script in non-root user mode on Fedora 8:
&gt; 
&gt;   su netter -c "expect try.exp"
&gt; 
&gt; and it failed:
&gt; 
&gt;   couldn't read file "try.exp": permission denied
&gt; 
&gt; No problem if I run:
&gt;   su root -c "expect try.exp"
&gt;   expect try.exp
&gt; 
&gt; I pored over permission related avenues for the whole day and failed.
&gt; It was around midnight when I googled upon your article that my hope was
&gt; rekindled.
&gt; 
&gt; So the first thing coming into work today...
&gt; Using your approach (especially strace), I found the execution bit for others
&gt; for /root
&gt; was not set.  After setting it, my non-root mode command string started to
&gt; work!
</pre>

<p>
That's actually not a good solution; the correct permissions for 
/root are 0700. Setting it to 0701, as you have, allows other users to
enter that directory - a really bad idea!
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
ben@Jotunheim:~$ ls -ld /root
drwx------ 11 root root 4096 2011-03-10 21:14 /root
ben@Jotunheim:~$ head -n 1 /root/.bashrc
head: cannot open `/root/.bashrc' for reading: Permission denied
</pre>

<p>
OK, this is what's supposed to happen. But here's what happens when I
change the permissions as you specified:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
ben@Jotunheim:~$ sudo chmod 0701 /root
[sudo] password for ben: 
ben@Jotunheim:~$ head -n 1 /root/.bashrc
# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
</pre>

<p>
Whoops...
</p>

<p>
I suspect that the right solution for you would be to put 'try.exp'
somewhere other than /root; then you won't have to do anything with
those permissions (other than hopefully set them back as quickly as
possible.)
</p>

&gt; Hi Ben,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for pointing out the security concern.
&gt; 
&gt; It is a development host used only by me for cross compiling ARM based
&gt; embedded system target.
&gt; We are still in the "stone age" and have not migrated out of root account to
&gt; non-root.
</pre>

<p>
Hmm, it looked like you were using the 'netter' account instead of root,
which is why you were having the problem. But operating as root by
default isn't just a security concern - it's also a good way to
accidentally destroy your system with a single typing mistake.
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
# rm -rf /tmp/foo           # No problem
# rm -rf / tmp/foo          # BIG problem!
</pre>

<p>
...and many, many other easy ways to do lots of damage.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; Again I am very grateful for your bash permission article.
</pre>

<p>
You're certainly welcome - glad you found it of use!
