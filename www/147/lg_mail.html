Hi, all -
</p>

<p>
We've got somebody that just volunteered to translate bits and pieces of
LG into Arabic. Since he's working by himself, and is not a native
speaker (and since I can't read Arabic myself), does anyone here have
the ability to vet the stuff? It's at '<a href="http://arlinux.110mb.com/lgazet/">http://arlinux.110mb.com/lgazet/</a>'.

<p>
I've had a badly configured Debian on a Core2 Duo system for a while and I am 
starting again from scratch. The area where I am having trouble finding 
guidance is support for 32 bit programs and plugins on the AMD64 
architecture. 
</p>

<p>
I have found various recipes for getting specific programs working. Many of 
them appear to involve maintaining a separate i386 architecture installation 
in addition to the main AMD64 installation. 
</p>

<p>
I am not keen on on maintaining 2 installations, nor am I keen on piecemeal 
solutions for each 32 bit program I may need to run. Can anybody point me to 
a good guide on the issues involved and/or a general solution to the problem 
of running 32 bit code on AMD64 debian?

<p>
Hi Tags's,
</p>

<p>
at work we are suffering from the ever increasing amount of data. 
This is a Medical Physics Group working with MRI (magnetic resonance
imaging) data. In worst case scenarios we can produce something like
20GB of data in an hour scantime. Luckily we are not scanning all the
time .-) Data access safety is mostly taken care of by firewalls and
access control outside our responsibility. But storing and backups
<strong>are</strong> our responsibility. 
</p>


<p>
Currently we have about 4-6 TB distributed over two
"fileservers" (hardware raid5 systems) and two systems are making daily
backups of the most essential part of these data (home, original
measurement data). The backup machines are taking more than a full
night by now and can't handle anything while backuppc is still sorting
out the new data.  The machine the backup is from is fine by morning. 
</p>

<p>
We will have a total of three number crunching machines over the year
and at least these should have speedy access to these data. Approx. 20
hosts are accessing the data as well. 
</p>


<p>
Now we got 10k EU (~15k $US) for new backup/file storage and are
thinking about our options:
</p>

<pre>
* Raid system with iSCSI connected to the two (optimally all three)
  number crunchers which are exporting the data to the other hosts via
  NFS. (eSATA any good?)
 
* an actual machine (2-4 cores, 2-4GB RAM) with hardware raid (~24*1TB)
  serving the files AND doing the backup (e.g. one raid onto another
  raid on these disks) 
 
* A storage solution using fibre-channel to the two number crunchers.
  But who does the backup then? The oldest number cruncher might be
  able to handle this nightly along with some computing all day. But it hasn't
  got the disk space right now. 
</pre>
The surrounding systems are all ubuntu desktops, the number crunchers
will run ubuntu 64bit and the data sharing would be done by NFS --
mostly because I do not know of a better/faster production solution. 
</p>

<p>
The occasional Win-access can be provided via samba-over-nfs on one of
the machines (like it does now).
</p>


<p>
Now I've no experience with iSCSI or fibre channel under Linux. Will
these work without too much of trouble setting things up? Any specific
controllers to get/not to get? Would the simultaneous iSCSI access from
two machines to the same raid actually work? 
</p>

<p>
I also assume all of the boxes have 2x 1Gbit ethernet so we might be
able to set up load balancing -- but the IP and load balancing
would also have been tought to our switches I guess -- And these are
"outside our control", but we can talk to them. Is a new multi core
system (8-16 cores, plenty RAM) able to saturate the 2xGbit? Will
something else max out (hypertransport, ... )? 
</p>


<p>
Any ideas -- especially ones I did not yet think of --  or experiences
with any of the exotic hardware is very much welcome....
</p>

Subject: Re: [svlug] recommended percentage swap on 400G drive
</pre>
Quoting Darlene Wallach (freepalestin@dslextreme.com):
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Is there a percentage of the disk size I should calculate for
&gt; swap?
</pre>

<p>
The amount of desirable swap on your system, and its placement, really
isn't directly related to disk size (except in the "you have to have X
amount of space in order for allocating Y from it to be reasonable"
sense):  It's more related to total system physical RAM than anything
else, and secondarily to your usage patterns with that RAM (number of
active apps, RAM footprint of each of those).
</p>

<p>
The rule of thumb on all *ixes that you'll see quoted ad nauseam is that
total swap space should <em>generally</em> be somewhere from 1.5x to 2 or 3x
total physical RAM.[1]  If your system has multiple physical hard
drives, all of which are roughly similar in overall speediness, then
ideally you want to put some swap on each physical drive -- max no. being
32 ;-&gt;  --  so that the (fairly intelligent) swapper process can split
the necessary seeking[2] activity between them, for best performance
through parallelism.  By contrast, if any of the drives is markedly
slower[3], it's still worth putting some swap on it, but you'd want to
specify a lower swap priority to the swapper process.  (See "man 2
fstab" or "man 8 swapon" for details.)
</p>

<p>
Ideally, you would also want to physically place the swap partitions
between other partitions in a manner calculated to (you hope) reduce
average seek time by keeping the heads in the general vicinity more
often than not.
</p>

<p>
As if all this detail wasn't enough to contend with, it turns out that
Linux swap <em>files</em> (as opposed to partitions) are a contender again.
They were common in very early Linux days, but fell out of favour when
it emerged that swap partitions yielded much better performance.
However, it turns out that, with the 2.6.x kernel series, swap files
once again have competitive performance, and might be worth using. See:
<a href="http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/29/3">http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/29/3</a>
</p>


<p>
[1] This is an OK rough heuristic, but obviously doesn't fit all usage
models.  In general terms, you want enough swap so that you're very
unlikely to get tasks killed by the out-of-memory killer for lack of
virtual memory, even when your system is heavily loaded.  Too much swap
really only wastes disk space, which is relatively cheap and plentiful,
so most people are wise to err slightly on the side of overallocation.
</p>

<p>
Theoretically, if you had huge gobs of RAM, e.g., 64GB RAM, in relation
to your usage, some would argue that you should have <em>no</em> swap (and
certainly not 128GB of it!), since you're basically never going to need
to swap out files or processes at all.  But actually, memory pages managed
in virtual memory don't always back files at all, as Martin Pool points
out in the page you cited
(<a href="http://sourcefrog.net/weblog/software/linux-kernel/swap.html">http://sourcefrog.net/weblog/software/linux-kernel/swap.html</a>).

Hey Everyone,
  While surfing the web I found this following site 
(<a href="http://robertogaloppini.net/2007/12/02/open-source-licensing-sugarcrms-original-way-to-abide-the-gpl/">http://robertogaloppini.net/2007/12/02/open-source-licensing-sugarcrms-original-way-to-abide-the-gpl/</a>) 
by Roberto Galoppini where he talks about how the SugarCRM has managed 
to keep almost the same licensing requirements as before even after they 
started using the GPLv3 license.
</p>

<p>
  Now I am not an expert by any stretch of imagination but from what I 
understood by reading this page and what I remember from the 
discussions/postings on TAG it looks like Roberto is making sense... Is 
that so or am I reading it incorrectly or missing something?
</p>

<p>
  If thats the case then how does the GPLv3 prevent Badgeware programs 
from claiming to be open source if they use the attribution clause to 
force users to display their badges?

Anybody tried the ASUS eee PC (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eee_pc">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eee_pc</a>) ?
I'm thinking about getting the 8GB model which costs $500.  It's a 2
lb subnotebook with 1 GB RAM, 8 GB flash "memory", and Xandros (based
on Debian/Corel), and compatible with the Debian repository.  I
haven't seen one and they seem hard to find even mail order, though
some Best Buys have the 4 GB model.  My main concerns are the small
keyboard, 800x600 screen, and one-button touchpad.  But as a second
computer for running Python, Firefox, Kopete, gvim, and maybe the Gimp
when traveling, I think it might do OK.
</p>

<p>
Any opinions on the other Linux (sub)notebooks which have begun
appearling?  I thought about the Zonbu but it has a nonstandard
version of Gentoo tied to their subscription plan.

If I run that again a few weeks or so later will it copy all

&gt; &gt; speaker (and since I can't read Arabic myself), does anyone here have
&gt; &gt; the ability to vet the stuff? It's at '<a href="http://arlinux.110mb.com/lgazet/">http://arlinux.110mb.com/lgazet/</a>'.
&gt; 
&gt; Hi,
&gt; I'm a native Arabic speaker. I can go through the translated text and
&gt; check it but I'm terrible at actually typing Arabic and I'm not that
&gt; good at it anyway. 
</pre>

<p>
A week or two ago, I hacked up a cute little Latin-Russian (UTF8)
converter (faking a few bits along the way, since the Russian alphabet
is longer than the English one), so I thought "heck, I'll just adjust it
so it can do Arabic - that'll give MNZ an easy way to do it." [laugh] I
knew that it was written right-to-left - I could handle that bit - but
having looked at the character set, as well as the whole
initial/medial/final/isolated thing, I've concluded that I'd be crazy to
even try.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I'll help with the translation as much as I can. I'll
&gt; start in a few days though because I have some exams right now.
</pre>

<p>
That's great - just contact the project coordinator, and let me know if
you guys need any help. Other than converters, of course. ;)
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; PS: Is anyone doing an Esperanto translation? just wondering.....
</pre>

<p>
LG's former editor, Mike Orr, is a one-man walking advert for the
language - although he's not translating LG into it, AFAIK. You could
always poke him about spreading the idea among his friends.

<p>
Hi all,
</p>

<p>
I want to cross-compile a ARM Linux kernel (2.6.21.1) using gcc-4.1 on
Ubuntu 7.04(i686)  (2.6.20.15-generic). This will require a
'arm-linux-gcc' cross-compiler. Hence, to build the 'gcc-4.1' I
started to build gcc for 'arm' target :
</p>

<pre>
1. ./configure --target=arm
2. make  [the dump is attached]
</pre>
The build process stops giving:
</p>

<p>
<strong>*</strong> Configuration arm-unknown-none not supported
</p>


<p>
How do I proceed beyond this?
</p>


<p>
Regards &amp; Thanks,
Amit

A promising solution to the exact problem discussed earlier -- put together
by my friend Joey Hess.  See:  <a href="http://kitenet.net/~joey/code/etckeeper/">http://kitenet.net/~joey/code/etckeeper/</a>
One key ingredient is David H?rdeman's "metastore"
(<a href="http://david.hardeman.nu/software.php">http://david.hardeman.nu/software.php</a>), used to capture metadata that
git would otherwise ignore.

For those who are running Debian or debian-derived distributions, there is a
relatively new package, etckeeper, which I have found rather useful: it
maintains a revision history of /etc in a Git repository, including file
permissions and other metadata not normally tracked by Git.
</p>

<p>
It is also invoked by Apt, using standard Apt mechanisms, to commit changes
introduced into /etc when packages are installed or removed.
</p>

<p>
I don't know whether there exist any similar tools for non-Debian
distributions.

<p>
A little while back I bought a cheap HP desktop and today I decided to put a 
2nd hard disk in. This is when I found that, although the spec sheet tells 
you you have a spare 3.5 in hard disk bay, it doesn't tell you that there are 
only 2 SATA connectors on the board and they are both in use! The PCB has 
spaces for 4 SATA connectors, but only 2 have been connected up, although 
bizarrely they have put in an IDE connector and a floppy connector.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, I have a spare SATA controller, so I can still get the disk in. 
Unfortunately, when I boot Debian the disk order gets swapped, so GRUB sees 
the original disk as disk 1, but Debian sees it as disk 2. The upshot is that 
it refuses to boot, as it can not mount the root partition. Interestingly 
Knoppix still sees them in the expected order.
</p>

<p>
Using partition labels in /etc/fstab isn't a solution because it can't 
actually find /etc/fstab.
</p>

<p>
I have a temporary workaround, as I have swapped the DVD SATA connection to 
the second hard disk, so both are connected from the motherboard. This has 
the advantage that they are mounted in a predictable order, but the 
disadvantage is that I no longer have the option of booting from CDROM, 
without swapping the cables back.
</p>

<p>
Does anyone know how the disk order is determined and is there any way to 
force Debian to put the disks connected from the Motherboard ahead of those 
connected from the additional SATA controller?

I have been following "Serving Your Home Network on a Silver Platter
with Ubuntu" which is an August article.  Just what I needed <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
One problem is that I cannot access the Internet from a client.  Not
sure why and do not know where to look.  Any ideas please?
There are two NIC's, eth0 which connects only to the router and eth1
which is the local network connected to a hub.
This is the route from the server and it appears to work - I can ping
and download

cannot reach the Internet.

 This is the hosts file on the server

This is the hosts file on the client (at present I need to switch the cable
to get the Internet which is why there are two entries for spider)
<pre>

And this is a trace from the client
<pre>

<p>
I have got a subversion repository running on  /svn
</p>

<p>
Under that there are different directories /svn/a/aa ,/svn/b/bb like that.
</p>

<p>
I would like to send a mail to a group of ppl when the checkin happens in only /svn/a/aa this directory and sub dirs
</p>

<p>
I used post-commit script hook supplied with svn.
</p>

<p>
in that I added a line like
</p>

<pre>
$REPOS/hooks/commit-email.pl "$REPOS" "$REV"  -m "*aa*" britto@yahoo.com  --diff "n" --from "ppl@mycom.com"
</pre>
this is not working.
</p>

<p>
-m makes the support to multiple project and it accepts regex as an argument.
</p>

<p>
whatever i have provided any thing wrong.........

It's one of the inexpensive cameras that does a fair job of

with gphoto2 / gtkam in linux.

Hey, Pythoneers -
</p>

<p>
I've just installed the "unicode" package after finding out about it
from Ren&lt;a9&gt;; it sounds like a very cool gadget, something I can really
use... but it appears to be broken:
</p>

<pre>
ben@Tyr:~$ unicode
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/unicode", line 159, in ?
    out( "Making directory %s\n" % (HomeDir) )
  File "/usr/bin/unicode", line 33, in out
    sys.stdout.write(i.encode(options.iocharset, 'replace'))
NameError: global name 'options' is not defined
</pre>
Line 570 says
</p>

<pre>
(options, args) = parser.parse_args()
</pre>
but even if I give it an arg like "-h", it still gives me the same
error. Any suggestions for fixing it before I turn it in to the Ubuntu
maintainers?
