<H2>The conference</H2>
There is a strange background roar which permeates airplanes when they
are in full flight. That's the roar which I hear, and feel, right
now. I'm on American flight 736, on my way back to LaGuardia, from
Dallas, where <a href="http://www.sc2000.org">Super Computing 2000</a>
just finished. It's been over a year since I last wrote up a
conference, talk or composed an editorial for the Internet, largely
because I've been really busy with my day job at Brookhaven Lab. The
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (or RHIC, see <a
href="http://www.phenix.bnl.gov">www.phenix.bnl.gov</a>) came on line
over the summer and that basically meant 80 hour weeks starting this
past February. After our first collisions were recorded and a long
summer of data taking, I got rather burnt out. Well, I think I've
recovered now... and after attending Super Computing 2000, I hope to
be able to get something written up about it. At least the next 3
hours I'll spend on this airplane will give me a chance to get
started.
<p>
I attended last years Super Computing conference in Portland Oregon,
(Nader country), which was quite delightful. The bit which I liked
most was the presence of industry, academia and the national labs,
all showing off what kind of super computing they are selling or what
they are doing with their super computer toys. Both the technical
sessions and the show floor were entertaining in the content they
presented. This was pretty much the same with this years conference.
Unfortunately, there was some overlap from what I saw last year with this
year so the, "Wow, this is soooo coool" feeling wasn't quite there, as it
was last year. Be that as it may, there was some cool stuff which
I want to pass on to those of you who don't have the money, time or
both to get yourselves down to Dallas to attend the conference. (The
conference fee is $700, which is quite on the steep side for the kind
of conferences I attend. Although you end up paying at least twice to
go to the full COMDEX conference and you get about a 10 times more
information out of the Super Computing conference then you get out of
the more main stream COMDEX shows.)
<p>
The show lasted 4 days, and I don't want to give you a full detailed
account of what I saw, you'll quickly be off surfing to other sites
if I did. What I'll do is focus on what I considered to be the highlights
of the conference. And as you all now, I'm a bit of a
Linux/Open Source/Free Software enthusiast, (Maybe I should rephrase that
"Free Software/Open Source/Linux enthusiast (FSOSLE)", to give proper
credit to Richard Stallman) and thus I'll tend to concentrate on those
topics.

Linux was everywhere. These guys had a nice stuffed Tux keeping an eye
on things.

First of all, the bit which I find most exciting was that Linux showed
a major presence at the show. This is a direct fallout of Donald
Becker's work on the Beowulf clustering software he and others helped
create. Super Computers on the cheap was quite pervasive and most of
the major computer vendors had some kind of Linux box or other. These
include SGI, IBM, Compaq, and a boat load of smaller
vendors. Noticeably absent was VA Linux, although there was at least
one rack of VA Linux PC's on the show floor. There were several Open
Source oriented talks as well. Most notably was Dr. Sterling's lecture
on COTS (Commercial Off the Shelf) super computers, (I believe he's
Donald Becker's professor who seems to be the guy to give the COTS
Super Computer talks,) and the Open Source panel discussion which
occurred on the last day of the meeting. More on that later. It was
really neat to walk up and down the show floor and see all the stuffed
penguin dolls siting on top of booths, nestled between racks of 1U 1GHz
AMD PC's, and all the GNOME and KDE desktops which adorned many flat
panel LCD consoles at the conference. One notable exception was Sun. No
Linux there. I looked around their booth but didn't find any. But I
did find some console displays boasting a nice movie animation of
F14's or something of that sort. The application used to display the
movie was Xanim though. This wasn't the conference for them to be
showing off Star Office, so I didn't bother trying to get one of the
Sun guys to demo it.
<br clear=left>
<p>
The opening day of the conference was Tuesday, Nov 7th. Yup, voting
day. The key note speaker was Steven Wallach, the guy who helped
design the Data General 32-bit Eclipse MV superminicomputer, and is
now with Center Point venture capital firm. His talk was titled
"Petaflops in the Year 2009" and dealt with how he would envision the
Petaflop computers of the future. The main point of his talk was that
the basic core of the future Petaflop computer is being built right
now to service the backbone of the Internet. I must say, Steve Wallach
did convince me of his arguments. The basic problem right now is that
the chip manufactures or CPU designers or whatever you call these
folk, are starting to reach physical boundaries imposed by Mother
Nature and her laws of physics which govern our universe.  Moore's law
only goes so far and there is a barrier which is the speed of
light. It could be that some time in the future, one will be able to
use takions in some kind of semiconductor to operate transistors which
effectively switch faster than the seed of light, (Think about it,
with one of them in your PC, when you surf the Internet, you just
don't click from one hyper link to the next, you get to surf through
space-time.  Click here to go to a chat room 2 days from now... Click
here to see the price of your stock 10 minutes from now...) Because of
these limitations, the bottle necks which are forming are the ones
which limit the speed at which you can get data into and out of your
CPU. This is where the work being done by Lucent and others comes into
play. Lucent is trying to get terabytes of data per second through a
routing node. One has to do this by being able to guide the different
wavelengths of light from one input port on the router to an output
port on the router without slowing down the data rate. This
architecture of data in, data out and very high speeds is basically
the inner core of the processor design needed for future super
computer systems. Remember, super computer systems will never be made
up of one big, really fast CPU. They will be made up of many small
nodes, interconnected through some kind of data mesh. Therefore Steve
Wallach emphasizes that in order to break the last bottle neck in
current CPU designs, one needs to push the data around between CPU's
optically and not try to push it in and out electrically. The guys
building the backbone of the Internet are doing this, and thus the
guys building the next generation CPU's should be talking to the guys
over at Lucent. By the way, Steve mumbled something about how Linux
would be running on this Petaflop computer. Look for the announcement
on Slashdot sometime in the year 2009....
<br clear=right>
<p>
The next session after the keynote which I attended was the "Who
wants to be a Billionaire" panel discussion. That's a stupid question,
of course I want to be a billionaire. The panel discussion was headed
up by the same guy who gave the key note, Steve Wallach. There were
three guys on the panel. They were Scott Grout of Chorum, Matt Blanton
of Startech and Jackie Kimzey of Sevin Rosen Funds.  Scott Grout
read his introductory comments and didn't say much else. Basically, he
worked for some telecommunications company which went through the
venture capital funding round and got itself established. Matt Blanton
and Jackie Kimzey gave their remarks which again, I can't quite
remember the details of. I'm too lazy to check my notes right now.

The bit which I want to impress upon you is the venture capital feeling
I got from the panel discussion. This feeling is a bit hard to
describe, but I'm going to give it a try. The talk started off
basically with a bunch of comments from Steve and his panel. They
wanted to get across to the audience what the venture capital process
is all about. "I got this great idea you see, and I want to run with
it. What do I do?" is the question they were trying to answer. Their
answer was something like this. Write up your idea, get in touch with
your local incubator, get a prototype going, then go to your local VC,
show off your prototype to him, he'll give you money, and off you go,
onto your IPO. After you IPO, you build up your product a bit more,
and finally you get bought out by a major company like Microsoft, Red
Hat or Cicso. (They never mentioned Red Hat, but hey, they have been
going around buying up companies right and left...). I was sitting there
just absorbing this information, typing into my laptop as much of this
as I could. (Yes, I really do want to be a billionaire). Then it
started to hit me. These guys are the real thing. Jackie Kimzey of
Sevin Rosen Funds has just raised 850 Million bucks of venture capital
to fund companies which could be the next Yahoo or AOL. And they
have to spend all that money. The investors didn't give him the money
so that he could buy 30 year bonds with it. These guy's kept talking
about the 16th floor. It dawned on me that the "16th floor" is a floor
in some high rise building down town where the Dallas high
tech VC boys hang out. Steve Wallach and Jackie Kimzey being two of these high
tech VC boys. (Actually, Steve Wallach is from Brooklyn and his accent
doesn't quite fit in with the Texas good ol' boy drawl, but you get my
point...) And as all things Texas, they got Dollars (yup, capital D
Dollars, as in capital D Dallas) to spend (ehhmmm I meant to say
invest...) Jackie said flat out, don't bother to cold call them. "We
prefer referrals, like from our pal Matt of Startech". They review
hundreds of proposals which I'm sure end up in the trash. And if you are
lucky enough to be considered for 1st round funding, you are rewarded
with a review of your proposal. In other words, get ready to be
grilled by the boys on the 16th floor. I'm sure they grill you and if they
don't see you sweat, they'll grill you even harder. I think that VC
feeling hit me when Steve Wallach said something to the effect that
they hire Nobel Laureates to come in and review your proposal. That
coupled to 850 million dollars ready to invest made me realize that
these guys mean business. They kept saying this throughout the
presentation. It just took some time for me to really get a feeling
for what they were saying. "Look, don't put a management team together
made up of your cousin the accountant as the CFO, your best friend
the hacker as the CTO etc." said Steve W. The first thing we look at
is the quality of your team. "We want to make you rich, and in doing
so we will make ourselves rich." This was another Steve Wallach
statement. This is business, high tech, high stakes business, sort of like
a really bad poker game, with 850 Million in the pot. Every hand is
taken seriously. Think big swinging d.ck as in the boys from Goldman
Sachs.
<p>
This concept is so foreign to government research. At least in the
government laboratory environment which I work in. Our time is
basically worthless and is seldom taken into account when we work on
projects. A statement like "the quality of your team" rings rather
hollow around here. I think we, as scientists, tend to devalue our
time, because of the tight job market for positions where one can
freely do research with particle colliders. Thus you put up with the
fact that you, Dr. so and so, who just received her Ph.D. in High
Energy Physics, has to break out the RJ45 clamp and start cutting CAT-5
cable so that she can wire up the crate controllers for her
experiment. That along with having to install and maintain her Linux
cluster so that she can store and analyze her data. And forget that
trip to XYZ conference, overtime has to be paid to the electricians
because if not, her experiment wouldn't be ready on day one when the
accelerator turns on and delivers her beam. And believe me, the
unionized electricians only work on her experiment if she pays
overtime. And then comes the kicker. "Sorry, you spent too much time
developing software and hardware and not enough time doing
science. Look at your publication record, it stinks! No tenure for
you. Go find a job somewhere else...." Don't think I'm kidding, this
is why its so hard to attract new talent into High Energy and Nuclear
physics.
<p>
Then we have the other side of the spectrum, the VC side. Some
president of some start-up at this panel discussion, got up and
recounted an anecdote regarding a board meeting he attend. He told
the board that he managed to save 300,000 bucks or so because he was
able to postpone hiring some people. He was expecting some
congratulatory remarks and instead he was scolded. "You have a plan to
execute, therefore spend the $300K and execute the plan!" he was told.
What I got away from this panel discussion is that when serious money
is on the line, (850 Million bucks is serious money) you don't f..k
around. You make sure the plan is right, hire the best of the best
to verify this, (i.e. hire Nobel laureates to review your circuit
design and software flow charts) and make sure the guys to which you
are giving the money, can stand up to a brutal review. If they can't,
the VC's will be throwing their money away on that proposal. The
upside of all this is that if you do get your 1st round of funding,
then they will be with you to make sure your plan goes right. And,
don't expect to retain full ownership of your company, their
commission is measured as a percentage ownership of the company you
are building. If you don't like it, go down to your local savings and
loan and pitch your idea to them, these VC's have another 300 business
plans to choose from. You know, this may sound crazy, but after what
I've been put through working for the government, I would give my left
nut to work in that kind of environment....

Dr. Monty Denneau of IBM. He's helping design IBM's Petaflopper called
Blue Gene. And yes, he did so standing right there with no visual
aids. He just stood there and talked about out it for 45 minutes. No
notes, no power point, no nut'in...

The next talk worth mentioning was given by Monty Denneau of IBM on
their <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/news/detail/bluegene.html">
Blue Gene</a> machine. Blue Gene is IBM's next Petaflop computer. Its cost?
Monty gave the figure of $100 Million bucks. "All big IBM computers cost
$100 million." It's sort of the canonical cost for the next generation
computer IBM builds. There are a few key concepts of Blue Gene which I
picked up on.
<p>
First of all, the Blue Gene research team started out by
designing a RISC instruction set from scratch. They wanted to use something
like the PPC but its instruction set just got too large. This was due
to too many people coming and going from the PPC design team and all
instructions had to be kept in order to keep backward
compatibility. Thus the "typical" RISC architecture had 250 to 300
instructions of which only 50 were really used and some were never
used. There were even other instructions, that if used, would break
the performance of the chip, and so the instruction had to be turned
off by the compiler. After that explanation, it was clear to me that
it was a good idea to start the CPU design by tossing out the
instruction set and starting from scratch.
<p>
The next key concept was to build many small CPU's on one fabrication
die. The idea being that one "CPU chip" would have hundreds of CPU's,
with floating point units scattered throughout the die along with
secondary cache units. Coupled with this idea was the concept that if
one of the CPU's didn't work, the OS would detect this and not use
it. Therefore, if you have a large die or silicon from which you're
going to build your "processor chip", a defect in the fabrication in
the sequencer unit or instruction set memory or whatever would not
cause you to throw out the chip. This is a big problem with today's
current CPU manufacturing. 100 microns of bad silicon in the wrong
spot and you had to throw out the CPU. Monty couldn't give exact
figures, but he said that because of this ability of having the OS
turn off just the bad CPUs then the production yields went from very
low to very high. This is very much the same concept as bad blocks on a
hard disk drive.
<br clear=left>
<p>
The next concept was that of a water cooled system. The amount of air
flow needed to cool a Petaflop machine would require a couple of jet
turbo engines providing hurricane equivalent wind forces. Therefore,
one had to resort to using water to cool the system. As it turns out,
there was great resistance to this idea, but Monty prevailed.
<p>
The final idea which I remember was how they were going to connect this
Petaflop machine together. The idea was to build cubes of processors
and then connect the cubes together with some kind of cabling. The
problem being that there was a lot of cable to hook up and it needed
to be done right. <a href="http://www.osha.gov">OSHA</a> got in the way
because if you build something which humans must traverse, like a
hallway, or a conduit under IBM's Blue Gene, you needed to provide
space for a guy, 7 feet tall, to be able to run out of in case there is
a fire. No getting around this requirement. So they built Blue Gene
over a special floor which was broken up into a grid. Each grid
element could be raised and lowered. So you have to imagine this. A
large floor area where you see hundreds of CPU cubes. The operator
has to check the connector on one of the CPU cubes. He goes and
clicks on some Java thing or other on his console and grid point XY
raises up to arm level. He then goes out there, checks the cable, and
when done, goes back and clicks on his Java interface and the cpu cube
is lowered back into the grid. Definitely Space Odyssey 2001 stuff.
<p>
I believe IBM is on the right track. With this design, they will get
their Petaflop computer, at about $100 Million, give or take a factor
of 2 or 3. But what really impressed me about Monty's talk is that he
didn't bother to prepare a power point presentation like the rest of
the speakers did. He just got out there in front of the audience and
started talking away. I'm not sure if this is a good or bad thing, but
impressive in the least. Sort of like watching a no hitter.
<p>
The speaker after Monty was Keiji Tani speaking about the 40Teraflop
machine which Japan is building. The bit which struck me about his
talk was that for about $500 Million bucks, Japan is building a 40
Teraflopper which will be housed in a building the size of a large
basketball stadium and will have about 20,000 Kilometers of
cabling. The speaker before him described a petaflopper which will be
housed in a large auditorium for about $100 million bucks. The two
will be ready in about 2 or 3 years. You do the math, but if I were
reviewing the Japanese project, it would be hard for me to justify
the cost..... My guess is that the Japanese need to build this
machine to show the rest of the world that they are players in the HPC
game. Just like the US spends hundreds of millions on their Giga and
Tera floppers in the national labs scattered about the country. Forget
about what's housed in the NSA research labs.

Dr. David Anderson is pictured above, who is the director of the
seti@home project. He was able to harvest 20 Teraflops of computing
power from the Internet to help analyze SETI data recorded at
Arecibo for about $800K. Now that's creativity.

The next speaker worth mentioning was David Anderson, the director of
the seti@home project. (You can view photos of his presentation
<a href="http://ssadler.phy.bnl.gov/adler/sc2k/setiathome.html">here</a>.)
I'm a real fan of this project
because it shows what can be done with creativity. Actually, one can
argue that if it wasn't for the financial constraints which the
project underwent, the seti@home concept wouldn't have been
created. Necessity is the mother of invention is the rule which can be
seen at work in this project. Basically David gave an overview of the
SETI project. SETI funding dried up in 1993.  In order to continue
their research efforts they required two things. One was to find a way
to keep taking data and the other was to find the computing resources
to find the SETI signal in the data they collected. This is a compute
intensive task if there ever was one. The first job, that of recording
data was solved by becoming a parasitic experiment at
<a href="http://www.naic.edu/">Arecibo</a>, the radio telescope in Puerto
Rico. The way they did this is the following.
<br clear=left>
<p>
The telescope is basically fixed, and the ability to point it, is
restricted to the positioning of the receiver which sits above the
dish of the observatory, and the sweeping of space as the earth
turns. Therefore there is a rather elaborate mechanism to move around
the receiver above the dish which gives Arecibo its pointing
ability. In order to make this movement of the receiver work, there is
a counter balance which is needed to stabilize the main receiver. So
the SETI people were able to install a second receiver on the counter
balance. This made them the parasitic experiment. Those researchers
who paid for prime time on the facility got to point the telescope in
what ever direction they wished, the SETI people would then pick up
what ever signal they could get from where ever their secondary
receiver ended up pointing. Sort of like if the guys paying for time
on the observatory were looking left, SETI was forced to look
right. In the end, this situation worked out OK for them. The SETI
researches were able to scan the sky in a random walk, determined by
the other experiments running at the time. David explained that they
effectively covered the sky in about 6 months time.
<p>
With that they solved their data collection
problem. Next they needed to solve their number crunching problem and
with that they thought up of the seti@home project. What really
surprised them was the willingness of people to donate their idle
computer time to the project. They were hoping for about 100k people
to help out. When they posted their announcement to the Internet, they
got over 400K people signing up to their mailing list. When they went
online for the first time, they got over 200K users requesting data to
be analyzed. They were so overwhelmed by the system overload by
having 200K users requesting data to analyze, that it took them 8
months to e-mail out an announcement to the original 400K who signed up
to their e-mail list.  Basically they were totally swamped and had to
work very hard to deal with their success. David talked a bit about the
setup of their system which reminded me of the many data acquisition
talks I've given and heard. One of the interesting details of the
seti@home project I found was that they got a lot of funding from
private, non-science institutions like Paramount Pictures. If I
remember correctly, of the $700K they got in funding $200K was from
these private sources. Paramount was interested in this project
because they wanted to get Captain Picard to throw some big power
switch which would start the whole experiment. That never happened,
but the check did clear. Sun Microsystems donated lots of hardware.
David was very grateful of this contribution and spent some time
plugging them.
<br clear=left>
<p>
They had problems with making sure the data which was returned was
actually processed by their client code. Since seti@home has been made
a bit of a game with respect to processing the data, a lot of people
have faked results so that they can climb up the "who has analyzed the
most data" ladder. He also spoke about the Open Source controversy. As
it turned out, there were some people "out there" in the Open Source
community which were very angry that the client code was not Open
Source'ed. At some point, there were some web sites which wanted to
boycott the project because of this and others wanted to launch some
kind of attack against the server unless they open source'ed their
client code. I was quite ashamed to hear this. He went on to talk
about how some users were also angry that the client code was not
optimized for their particular hardware which the code was running
on. For example, AMD CPU's have some instruction sets which will help
speed up FFTs as does the Intel Pentiums with the MMX instructions. In
order to make the code portable, the seti@home guys didn't pay much
attention to these issues. So there were some users out there which
disassembled the client code, found the portions which did the FFT and
they replaced that section of the code with their own optimized FFT
routines, optimized for their particular CPU instruction set. Now that
is hacking. After the talk, I asked David if he realized that if he
open sourced his client code, then people would have provided the
optimization code for him instead of forcing the users disassemble the
code. He told me that he worried about the integrity of the code and
that he couldn't trust the scientific code put into the client. I
understood where he was coming from. If I were to do something
similar, start a phenix@home project, then I would have to provide a
way of verifying the results of the computations every time someone
added in some code. This verification process could break the @home
usefulness of the project. Also, you would have to somehow guarantee
that the code, once complied, was really that same code and not some
rogue client which someone put together in order to fake fast data
processing time. As it stands now, seti@home has accumulated about
450,000 years of computing time or an instantaneous computing rate of
20 Teraflops. This is half the size of the computer the Japanese are
building which essentially cost the SETI research team $40K/Teraflop
instead of $12,500K/Teraflop for which the Japanese can build HPC
systems. Also, half of the data out of the Berkeley domain belongs to
the seti@home project. That's a cool factoid.

The final session I want to cover is the open source panel discussion
which took place at the very end of the conference.  The topic being,
how can the high performance computing (HPC) field take advantage of
the open source movement and how should the government funding agencies
deal with this matter. As it turns out, there is a committee out there
titled the "President's Information Technology Advisory Committee",
or PITAC, and they were charged with investigating the matter for the
HPC field. The result was the publication of a document titled
<a href="http://www.itrd.gov/ac/#pres-11sep00">
"Developing Open source Software to Advance High End Computing"</a>.
The members of the PITAC who worked on this report were present on the
panel. The first panel member, Susan Graham of UC Berkeley, basically
gave a report on the report. The short side of it was that they
recognized the potential of open source software and that the
government should take advantage of it and do so now. The government
should not take its time on this issue. The next panelist to speak was
Todd Needham from Microsoft. This was unique to me, the first time I
get to hear a bona fide Microsofter speak about open source
software. His general attitude was that Open Source was not pixie dust
which you could sprinkle over software and suddenly make it all that
more powerful. Which is to say that in general, he was rather negative
toward the movement. He had a rather angry and defensive attitude
throughout the panel discussion which put me off. I guess it's the
fallout of the antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft.
<p>
From my notes I was able to get the following from his
introduction. He argued that Open Source is not a development
methodology. In fact, he claimed that many projects are more cathedral
than bazaar. (He gave the Linux kernel development as an example, with
Linus sitting at the top.) He claimed that it is not a security
model. Many eyeballs are not a replacement for a formal design and
review process. (It's interesting to hear that coming from a guy who
works for a company who just had a major break-in which made headlines
around the world...) Open Source does not mean open standards. He also
emphasized that open source license does not mean that you don't have
access to the source code. He did like the idea of managed source
code.

<p>
In one of his transparencies he alluded to open source as a way
of giving away your intellectual property rights and thus diluting the
monetary value of your work. After the introductory talks, there was a
question regarding this and he was quite adamant about how bad it was
to open source your code and thus lose the dollar value you put into
the code. He stated that Microsoft is a company which makes its money
off of intellectual property and thus the open source model just doesn't
work for them. (If Todd said otherwise, it would be a Slashdot
headline for sure....) It must have been interesting to see how the
report got out, which recommended the use and adoption of open source
software with Todd from Microsoft as one of the committee members.
<p>
The next guy who talked was Jose Munoz from DOE. He did a Dave
Letterman by going through the top 10 reason why Open Source software
is bad in reverse order. The last one being, or rather item #1, the
question "Would you want to fly in an airplane whose complete flight
system was developed using Open Source by the lowest bidder?",
followed by a bullet reading "Whom do you sue when the thing goes
wrong?  (assuming you're a survivor)". It's unfortunate that the guy
who works for the same government agency which provides my paycheck
gave such a negative perspective to this issue. It was good to listen
to one of the members of the audience make a statement, at the end of
the session, that if given a choice between the plane running open
source software or something running under a Microsoft OS, he would
much prefer the open source one, given the track record of Microsoft
software. There were a couple of chuckles in the audience and a
blushed smile from Todd of Microsoft.

The last panelist to speak was from Sandia National Laboratories. His
talk was basically in favor of the Open Source software license model.
I asked two questions of the panelists, first I pointed out to them
that the Linux and the Linux distributions have fostered a new
generation of companies selling super computers. I told them that if
you walk around the show floor, you see many small companies selling
racks of Linux machines. I personally didn't see any companies selling
racks of Windows NT/2000 machines. They responded that the big
companies would sell you a rack of either a Linux or windows NT PC and
that there was one demonstration booth which had a rack of windows NT
PC's running Beowulf applications. Personally I believe they missed
the point I was trying to make, which was that Linux was fostering a
new industry made up of young start-ups. The second question that I asked
them, it was actually more of a statement than a question, was that
they should consider the Internet when they discuss issues relating to
open source. "Who owns the Internet? The Internet wouldn't exist if
it were owned by anyone."  I remember a smile coming across Susan
Graham from Berkeley once I finished my statement. Todd from Microsoft
decided to answer my question. What I remember of his answer was that
he though AOL did a "damn good job" of hiding all that stuff from the
user in creating the front end which their user community uses.
Again, I believe he missed my point. To me, AOL was useless until they
connected themselves to the Internet. First by providing e-mail and
then when they provided you with a ppp connection.
<p>
My "consider the Internet" statement was the last one given before the
panel discussion ended. Of course I could have gone on a rant about my
"consider the Internet" statement and kept the panel going for at least
another 15 minutes by addressing some of the comments the panelists
said, but it was the end of 4 days of conferencing and I had to catch
my plane back to New York. Besides, no one wants to hear someone rant
on and on and turn a discussion personal. Who knows, I can write up a
rant, post that on my web site, and get many orders of magnitude more
people to read my rant than the few dozen which were in the conference
session at the time....
<p>
There were many many more talks and events which happened at the
conference, but it would take much to much time to write about the
whole thing. I tried to touch upon the items which I thought were the
most important. Other talks which were of interest were Dr. Sterlins
talk on Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) super computers, Eugene
Spafford's talk on security issues on the Internet, and all the stuff
which I saw on the show floor. That's left as a page full of

That's me with my one big winning hand playing poker. This photo was taken
at the SGI party. They gave you 2 grand worth of chips and you got to
gamble it away. The chips didn't have any real value, it was basically
fake money. It hurts not a bit to loose fake money, but its fun none
the less.

One final note. The photographs you find on this web page, in the 
<a href="http://ssadler.phy.bnl.gov/adler/sc2k/sc2k.html">
original article</a> and in the
<a href="http://ssadler.phy.bnl.gov/adler/sc2k/sc2kpg0.html">photo gallery</a> are only a small portion of
what I took at the conference. Specifically, I took photos of most of
the slides shown at the seti@home talk, Dr. Sterling's talk on COTS
super computers, Dr. Spafford's talk on computer security, and the
slides shown at the Open Source panel on the last day. If you are
interested in seeing these photos, <a href="mailto:adler@bnl.gov">
e-mail me</a> and I'll see what I can do about getting them to you.
