<h3> Introduction </h3>

<p>
Let me start with pointers to the two most valuable (in my personal view)
resources that I constantly referred to prior to deciding which PCI
wireless card would be the best fit for my home system running Fedora Core
5.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://madwifi.org/wiki/Compatibility/Netgear">URL A: Madwifi Compatible Cards from Netgear</a><br>
<a href="http://linux-wless.passys.nl/query_alles.php?">URL B: Comprehensive List of cards from all vendors</a>
</p>

<p>
Buying a USB-based wireless card, however, was not on my list; after much
deliberation, I decided to buy NETGEAR's WG311 card. In hindsight, I do
agree that I should have been careful to check (at the above URLs) whether
this model/product from NETGEAR had the necessary drivers for the GNU/Linux
space. Since it didn't, I ended up having to make it work by using
"ndiswrapper". 
</p>

<h3>What is ndiswrapper?</h3>

<p>
From the project page, <a href="http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/">http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net</a>:

<blockquote>
"Many vendors do not release specifications of the hardware or provide a
Linux driver for their wireless network cards. This project implements
Windows kernel API and NDIS API within Linux. A Windows driver for wireless
network card is then linked to this implementation so that the driver runs
natively, as though it is in Windows, without binary emulation." 
</blockquote>

<h4>Why did I buy PCI wireless card? Why not USB? </h4>

<p>
Nothing against USB wireless cards... but I needed to hook my
<em>desktop</em> system to the broadband. Given the physical distance
separating the desktop and the broadband tap provided by the local ISP, I
did not want to spoil the beauty of our home with internal wiring exposed
all over the place. Who would want to do that? 
</p>

<h3>Mad about wifi</h3>

<h4>What is madwifi? And why madwifi?</h4>

<p>
From the project page of madwifi, <a href="http://www.madwifi.org/">http://www.madwifi.org</a>:

<blockquote>
madwifi.org is [...] a team of volunteer developers working on Linux Kernel
drivers for Wireless LAN devices with Atheros chipsets. We currently
provide two drivers, MadWifi and ath5k. 
</blockquote>

<p>
Well, that's direct - and I should have realized that madwifi drivers
support Atheros chipsets but not the chipsets (from Marvell) that come with
NETGEAR's WG311 PCI wireless card. It did occur to me - as soon as I
started having trouble while configuring the wireless card.
</p>

<p>
As soon as I got the PCI wireless card, I started with configuration tasks
after ensuring it was physically installed in the PCI slot.  

<p>
Starting from <a href="http://madwifi.org">http://madwifi.org</a>, I
downloaded the sources of 0.9.4 (latest version as of this article) and
followed the steps available at the <a
href="http://madwifi.org/wiki/UserDocs/FirstTimeHowTo">Madwifi Newbie
Doc</a>. The first part was typical of installing software from sources:

<pre class="code">
[root@thinnai /tmp/madwifi]# ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install  
[root@thinnai /tmp/madwifi]# modprobe ath_pci 
</pre>

<p>
Then, I proceeded to create the interface - and this is where things
started turning ugly (to be correct, where there was careless blunder on my
part). 

<pre class="code">
[root@thinnai ~]# wlanconfig ath0 create wlandev wifi0 wlanmode sta
wlanconfig: ioctl: No such device
</pre>

<p>
At this point, I referred back to the URLs mentioned at the beginning of
this article.  Both had clearly indicated that the PCI wireless card, WG311
from NETGEAR, is supported by "ndiswrapper" - <em>but not "madwifi"</em>.
</p>

<p>
I knew of only one remaining way of configuring my PCI wireless card -
i.e., by using ndiswrapper. After reading through the basic documentation
available at the <a
href="http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/joomla/index.php?/component/option,com_openwiki/Itemid,33/">ndiswrapper
wiki</a>, I understood that this is done as a two-step process: 
</p>

<p>
First, install <code>ndiswrapper</code> from its sources. Then, download
and install the appropriate Windows driver. 
</p>

<p>
How did I decide which Windows driver to download? Simple - I identified
the revision of the chipset available on the PCI wireless card, then just
followed these steps listed below:
</p>

<ul type="roman">
<li> Using the "lspci" command, I figured out the card identifier; 
in this case, it was "01:07.0" as shown below (first column).

<li> Using "lspci -n" and this card identifier as a reference, I
figured out the PCI ID of the card (the third column in the command output).

<li> As the WG311 card was from NETGEAR, I chose section 'M-N' from this
URL:<br>

<a href="http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/joomla/index.php?/component/option,com_openwiki/Itemid,33/id,list/">List M-N</a>

<li> Once I was at that list page, I found that the matching PCI ID was
listed in item 4; from there, I verified the matching PCI IDs, chipset
revision, and could now choose the right <a
href="http://www.encore-usa.com/download/driver/ENLWI-G_Driver_Utility_98SE-ME-2000-XP.zip">Windows
driver</a> for my card.

</ul>

<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Prior to configuring and installing the PCI wireless
card in GNU/Linux, I had installed the drivers in Win2k and found them to
be working perfectly.

<p>
Here is the <a
href="http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/joomla/index.php?/component/option,com_openwiki/Itemid,33/id,installation/">Wiki
page</a> detailing the steps for installing <code>ndiswrapper</code> from
sources, including the Windows driver amongst other things. 
</p>

<p>
In these installation steps, it is mentioned that one should try the WinXP
driver in preference to the Win2k drivers; under another section ("Install
Windows driver"), it is also mentioned that if the Windows driver provided
by the vendor worked, that specific driver files can be re-used. These
statements had driven me to download the Windows driver from the URL given
earlier rather than re-use the driver files from the existing Windows
installation.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@thinnai:~]#/sbin/lspci|grep -i wireless
01:07.0 Ethernet controller: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 88w8335 [Libertas] 802.11b/g Wireless (rev 03)
[root@thinnai ~]# lspci -n|grep 01:07
01:07.0 0200: 11ab:1faa (rev 03)
</pre>

<h3>On the right path</h3>

<h4>Installing ndiswrapper</h4>

<p>
From the ndiswrapper project Wiki, I downloaded the tarball of the latest
release. As it had been my regular practice, prior to installation, I read
through the documentation carefully (at least the initial sections of the
INSTALL file.) In this case, the initial steps to compile the sources and
install the binaries were quite straightforward. 
</p>

<p>
With current working dir as /root/ndiswrapper-1.20, I executed the following commands:
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@thinnai ndiswrapper-1.20]# make &amp;&amp; make install 
[...]
*** WARNING:  Kernel is compiled with 4K stack size option (CONFIG_4KSTACKS); many Windows drivers will not 
work with this option enabled. Disable CONFIG_4KSTACKS option, recompile and install kernel 
[...]
</pre>

<p>
If you happen to see warnings at the end of "make" similar to the above,
you can safely ignore them.  This warning has not affected the
functionality of the wireless card, at least for the PCI wireless card with
the chipset revision shown above. 
</p>

<p>
As discussed previously, I downloaded the Windows driver and religiously followed the 
instructions in the "Install Windows driver" section of the INSTALL file. After extracting the 
Windows driver to another directory, I went through the following steps: 
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@thinnai ndiswrapper-1.20]# ls ../ENLWI-G_Driver_Utility_98SE-ME-2000-XP/V1.10/DRIVER/Windows\ XP/
Mrv8000c.cat  Mrv8000c.inf  Mrv8000c.sys

[root@thinnai ndiswrapper-1.20]# cp ../ENLWI*/*{inf.sys} .		<strong># Copy the drivers into the current dir</strong>

[root@thinnai ndiswrapper-1.20]# ndiswrapper -i Mrv8000c.inf	<strong># Install them</strong>
Installing mrv8000c
Forcing parameter AdhocGMode|1 to AdhocGMode|0
Forcing parameter AdhocGMode|1 to AdhocGMode|0

[root@thinnai ndiswrapper-1.20]# ls /etc/ndiswrapper/			<strong># Confirmed the installation</strong>
mrv8000c
[root@thinnai ndiswrapper-1.20]# ls /etc/ndiswrapper/mrv8000c/
11AB:1FAA.5.conf  11AB:1FAB.5.conf  mrv8000c.inf  mrv8000c.sys
[root@thinnai lnx_data]# ndiswrapper -l
Installed drivers:
mrv8000c                driver installed, hardware present
</pre>

<p>
The next step is to configure the wireless interface, scan for access points,
and attach to one. Prior to these steps, though, I checked the version of
wireless tools: 
</p>
 
<pre class="code">
[root@thinnai ~]# rpm -qa | grep -i wireless
wireless-tools-28-0.pre13.5.1

[root@thinnai ~]# iwconfig --version
iwconfig  Wireless-Tools version 28
          Compatible with Wireless Extension v11 to v19.

Kernel    Currently compiled with Wireless Extension v19.

wlan0     Recommend Wireless Extension v18 or later,
          Currently compiled with Wireless Extension v19.
</pre>


<h3>Final Lap</h3>

<p>
After the confirmation, I wrapped the following commands up in a shell
script to ease the wireless card driver installation and activation after
every system boot (as a step forward, I could have re-written the script so
that the wireless interface is activated from /etc/init.d):
</p>
 
<pre class="code">
echo "Activating wireless interface on your computer ..."
modprobe ndiswrapper
echo "===================================================================="
echo "Status of your ethernet interfaces ... "
/sbin/ifconfig
echo "===================================================================="
echo "Activating the wireless interface ... "
/sbin/ifconfig wlan0 up
echo "===================================================================="
echo "Status of your wireless interfaces ... "
/sbin/iwconfig
echo "===================================================================="
echo "Scanning your wireless networks, joining available n/w also ..."
iwlist wlan0 scan
/sbin/iwconfig wlan0 essid default
/sbin/iwconfig wlan0
echo "===================================================================="
echo "Acquiring IP address for the wireless interface ... "
dhclient wlan0
</pre>

<p>
Below, I have listed the commands that I used to verify the status of the
PCI wireless interface with ndiswrapper installed and activated. I did this
via the "dhclient" command:
<p>

<pre class="code">
Acquiring IP address for the wireless interface ...
Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Client V3.0.3-RedHat
[...]
Listening on LPF/wlan0/00:1e:2a:35:2a:79

DHCPACK from 192.168.0.1
bound to 192.168.0.147 -- renewal in 39 seconds.
</pre>

<p>
Results of simple check to validate the connectivity:
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
Patiently and carefully read through the wireless support URLs (listed in
the Intro section of this article) prior to deciding which card to buy. If
you have to set up and configure a PCI/USB wireless card in a GNU/Linux
environment that isn't supported by madwifi, don't feel let down;
ndiswrapper is there to help you out of the quagmire.
</p>

<p>
I would be happy to hear from the community if there are better and proven
ways to set up and configure PCI wireless cards under GNU/Linux!
