<p><strong>Answer guy:
</strong></p>

<p><strong>In several questions, I see people asking about booting large disks
with older machines.  A while ago I built up a machine like this,
and had a reasonable solution.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>While I can understand that the problem is often interference with the
"other" operating systems, in the case I used, I had an older '486
motherboard which given the requirements for windoze was a bit out of
date, but quite reasonable for Linux.  In attempting a "normal"
installation on the larger disk, the first (root) partition was quite a
bit over the 540 MB BIOS limitation.  It took me a few attempts at
running LILO and understanding its error messages (I even tried the
"linear" option) to understand the problem (I hadn't used a disk that
large before).  When I remembered the "540MB" problem, the solution that
I explained above seemed the "easiest" to implement, and with the least
amount of "hassle".  It only took a few symbolic links/copies and I was
done.  The "basic" root partition was still intact, and nobody really
worried about the difference.  I feel that if I wanted to, I could have
made a "small" partition and installed the "root" files there, but most
installations want a larger partition to get "the whole works"
installed.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sure this gets around the "1024 cylinder" problem, but usually that is
all that is needed.  Linux, once it has started the kernel, supplies the
drivers for further operation.  The small partition is only used to
accomidate the BIOS, whose ONLY function is to load the kernel anyway.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>I suppose an altrenative is to use "loadlin" under dos, but you still
need to boot DOS, and the 1024 cylinder problem comes up again.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>I'm trying to get a solution that involves "minimum impact".

<blockquote><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)" height="28" width="50" align="bottom">All true enough.  My point is that my answers are not
simply intended to show what works for me or what is 
minimum impact for one situation (usually a situation 
about which I'm given very little information).  My
answers try to cover a large number of likely situations
and to suggest things that no one seems to have tried before
(like the auto-rescue configuration I was babbling about).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>I've frequently suggested small partitions, LOADLIN,
alternate root partitions, even floppy drive kernels.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Another problem --- the source of this whole thread
has to do with support for these Ultra-DMA drives that are
over 8Gb.  I guess that the most recent kernels (2.0.35 and
later?) have support for a different IDE driver that can
handle these.  I thought I'd seen reports of problems with
them.  I commented on this in the hopes that someone would
give me the scoop on <em>those</em>.
