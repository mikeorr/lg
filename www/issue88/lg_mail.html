<P>
Hello!
</P>
<P>
I just switched from Gnome 2.0 to <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> 3.1 and I notice that the settings
for the devices created by devfsd aren't save between reboots. So I read
through the docs and I saw that I have to create some dev-state dir.
Well, I already have that dir in <TT>/lib</TT> and devfsd is set to save the
settings (in <TT>/etc/devfsd.conf</TT>). And if I change the permissions on some
devices (<TT>/dev/dsp</TT> for example), the change is also visible in
<TT>/lib/dev-state</TT> directory. However, after I reboot, the same problem. I
don't have permissions. And this is really annoying me.
</P>
<P>
So any suggestions are greatly appreciated!
</P>
<P>
P.S. I am using Mandrake 9.0 with the default kernel.
</P>
<P>
Thanks!
</P>
<P>
Regards,
<br>Stelian I.

<P>
Hi!
</P>
<P>
I've got my home LAN behind a cable modem, masqueraded
to the outside world. The masquerading machine runs
RedHat 7.3. What I'm trying to achieve is equally
share the bandwidth between the machines (about 7)
following this algorithm: if only one host is making a
connection at a given time, it gets the whole
bandwidth; when a second connection from a second
masqueraded machine arrives at the gateway, the
bandwidth is equally divided between the two machines;
if a third machine makes a connection, the bandwidth
is split in three equal shares and so on. Now if one
of the machines that has already opened a connection,
makes a second one, I would want this connection to be
allocated inside the machine's share, not as a
separate member participating in the bandwidth
division. Following this idea, if someone has 4 open
downloads, someone else 7 and a third machine only 1,
then bandwidth should be divided only by three and not
12.
</P>
<P>
I've already read about SFQ, qdiscs and tc filter from
the 'Advanced routing HOW-TO' but I couldn't find any
info on how to shape/police traffic dynamically and
based on ip source addresses. I do not want to split
the bandwidth into seven slices from the beginning
since not everybody is online all the time and this
would waste available bandwidth for the others. I'd
rather have the traffic shaped depending on how many
internal hosts wish to access the internet at a given
time.
</P>
<P>
I'm not really interested in providing differentiated
traffic based on content (interactive, bulk, etc.)
just a fair sharing of bandwidth, ignorant of how many
download managers/ftp's each and everyone is running,
and not allowing anyone to suffocate the shared
internet connection with his/her requests.
</P>
<P>
Thank you very much in advance for the time taken to
<BR>answer this,
</P>

<P>
Hi everyone.
</P>
<P>
When Linux shutsdown with halt -p, my pc will turn off,
but Linux won't switch off the power to my PS/2 port. It is
turned on when X starts, but when X shuts down, or the PC
is shut down, the port remains on - and my Optical Mouse
stays on. Light remains glowing, etc.
</P>
<P>
.... However, Windows 98SE will shut this down properly
every time. I have kernel 2.4.20 and have tried enabling ACPI
and APM. And of course I have an ATX PSU, and nothing weird
enabled either in cmos or jumpered.
</P>
<P>
I know that some boards just have power going through PS/2
ports after soft shutdown as a feature/bug, but Win98SE manages
to shut down this one ok.
</P>
<P>
If someone knows how to fix this, I would really appreciate your
help.
</P>
<P>
Thanks in advance.
<BR>D.Radel.

PS. Sorry for mentioning that <EM>other</EM> OS in this email.

Greetings.I installed <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> Linux 8.0 on my desktop
computer.  I used my PS/2 keboard and mouse to install
the software from CD images downloaded from Red Hat.
After software installation completed my computer
rebooted to the <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> login screen.  My PS/2 keyboard
and mouse does not work.  Only a USB keyboard and
mouse work.  When I boot my system into run level 3 my
PS/2 keyboard works.  How do I configure my system so
that I can use my PS/2 mouse and keyboard with KDE?

Any information is appreciated.  Thanks.

<P><STRONG>
Dear Mike,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
After my 
<A HREF="../issue87/bint.html">first article</A> was published, about thirty
people downloaded my console interface library. In the few days since you
published my second, over ninety people have come for it. If only ten percent
of those try to write an editor like I described, you will have turned my dream
into a reality.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
When I cycled into the city to log on at the daycentre this morning, I had
been in the countryside for a week. I had no idea I had been published
because I expected it would be in the March edition. I agreed with your
comments about C++ not being the universal language I made it out to be
and was going to rewrite it with your suggestions in mind.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Unless the author says he plans to do a revision, I assume the article is
finished when I receive it.  -- Mike

Now I realise it's gone out and I've seen the response, I don't care how

Mike,

<P><STRONG>
Thank you for pointing out that I gave the misleading
impression, that C++ is the first language of all Linux
users in my article, The Ultimate Editor (LG#87). Obviously
Linux users vary widely in their choice of first language.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
It would be a boon to the users of any language, especially
beginners, to have an editor which is extensible in their
own language. C++ users seem to be the only group who do not
have one yet.

<BR>Question by Peter (pfheiss from philonline.com)

<P><STRONG>
Dear Editor,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I can not fully understand the article "The Ultimate Editor" in Feb. LG.
Having migrated from DOS to Linux without passing MSWindooze I have to ask
what is wrong with the Linux text editors such as joe, xedit, gedit, gxedit,
xeditplus, kedit, kwrite, kate, vim, gvim, cooledit, any more?, yes I am
sure.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have seen the text editor in Windooze and thought it a joke compared with
some of the Linux text editors mentioned.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
May be Stephen Bint should try them all first before picking up more
cigarette butts in the gutter thus damaging his lungs and consequently
his brain.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Regards
<BR>Peter Heiss
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Well, I can understand the article.  I can also disagree with it, but
first I have to understand it.  The title seems destined to invite
flames (perhaps he's asking for a light for those soggy gutter butts).
</P>
<P>
He doesn't like the Linux text/console editors he's tried.  He doesn't
bother to lay out the criteria against which he's rating them.  Other
than that it's simply an announcement of a library which is built over
the top of SLang which, of course is built over the top of ncurses.
</P>
<P>
It would be easy to cast aspersions, even to question my fellow editors
on the merits of including this article.  However, I'll just let the
article speak for itself.  I'll ask, why doesn't xemacs support mouse
on the console or within some form of xterm (xemacs does support ncurses
color, and menus)?  How about vim?
</P>
<P>
Personally I mostly use vim or xemacs in viper (vi emulation) mode.
There are about 100 other text editors for Linux and UNIX text mode
(and more for X --- nedit being the one I suggest for new users who
don't want to learn vi --- or who decide they hate it even after they
learn it).
</P>
<P>
-- Jim Dennis
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">I hope that Stephen's comment in the previous portion clarifies what he
was really thinking.  On the cigarette analogy, he has roll-your-own
papers in his pocket, of a C++ variety, but needs someone to share loose
tobacco.  Then everyone sharing this particular vice can enjoy having a
smoke together... downwind of folk who already like their text-editors :D
Yes, folk who are used to seeing their brand down at the liquor store
are likely to think making your own cigarettes is either quaint or
nutty.   But it's a big world out here, and the open source world is
built by folk who like to roll their own...
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color="green">Let's remember that when Stephen complains,
he doesn't just whine and expect others to do things his way.  Rather, he takes
it upon himself to 
contribute code that does whatever it is he's complaining about.  See
<A HREF="../issue86/bint.html">I Broke the Console Barrier</A> in issue 86.
That was the main reason I published 
<A HREF="../issue87/bint.html">The Ultimate Editor</A>, even though I strongly
objected to his assumptions that (1) C/C++ are the only worthwhile
languages and (2) emacs should be flogged over the head for not using menus
and keystrokes &agrave; la DOS <TT>edit</TT>.  The first bothered me enough to insert
an Editor's note saying there are other issues involved.  The second didn't bother me quite
as much, so I sent the author a private e-mail listing the C/C++ objections and
asked him to consider a follow-up article or Mailbag letter that took them into
account.  And it worked: we had a great discussion between Stephen and the
Editors' list about C/C++ vs scripting languages, and that led to some excellent
article ideas.  

<P> Also remember that Stephen is homeless, and his Internet access
is limited to an hour here, an hour there on public-access terminals.  A far cry
from simply sitting in front of your computer that happens to be already on.
So he is putting a high level of commitment into writing these articles and
programs, higher than many people would be willing to do.  It's unfortunate
that his limited Internet access prevented me from knowing at press time that
he had decided on a last-minute revision to tone down the article and make it
more balanced, but c'est la vie.

So it isn't precisely right to say that TECO was emacs' predecessor;

The procedure is simple.  Think of any three-digit number, then
select the corresponding buzzword from each column.  For instance,
number 257 produces "systematized logistical projection," a phrase
that can be dropped into virtually any report with that ring of
decisive, knowledgeable authority.  "No one will have the remotest
idea of what you're talking about," says Broughton, "but the important
thing is that they're not about to admit it."

ViewTouch is genuine killer app.  My life's work resulted in the sales
of millions of computers in the 26 years since I first started writing
and using POS software.  I invented many of the concepts in use today
worldwide in retail software, including virtual touchscreen graphics
to represent the universe of retail business operations.  Much of what
we are doing today will become standard in the future.  ViewTouch is
the original and longest-lived.  Thanks for your comments.

Hello, Gene - I remember talking to you when I wanted to install VT for
a client in Florida a few years back (they backed out of the deal by
trying to rip me off, but, erm, I had the root password. We parted ways,
and they're still without a POS last I heard. 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> As I'd mentioned, I
really like the look and feel of your app; however, good as it is, not
being Open Source limits its applicability in the Linux world. If I
remember correctly, that was the upshot of our discussion here.
</P>
<P>
Just for the record, folks - Gene was very friendly and very helpful
despite the fact that the client had not yet bought a license from him;
given his help, the setup (at least the part that I got done before the
blow-up) was nicely painless.

<blockquote><font color="#000066">We also got a request for aid finding a POS from a fellow with a pizza
parlor;  luckily, Linux folk have already dealt with Pizza, although
it's worth following the old articles over at <EM>LJ</EM> and seeing how that
project moved along.   We're still looking for news or articles from
people using or developing open source Point of Sale, and I re-emphasize,
we mean physical cash registers, not just e-commerce.  E-commerce apps
we've got by the boatload, on sale and in "AS IS" condition.

<P>
I will be out of town March 18 - April 3 at the
<A HREF="http://www.python.org/pycon/">Python conference</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.python.org/cgi-bin/moinmoin/WebwareSprint">Webware
sprint</A> (and visiting New York, Chicago, and Columbus [Ohio]), Heather will
be busy the week before Memorial Day (May 26), and I'll be gone Memorial Day
weekend.
</P>
<P>
This means I'll need to finalize the April issue by March 14, so the
article deadline is March 10.  I've let the recent authors know.
</P>
<P>
May's issue will be normal.
</P>
<P>
For June, the article deadline will be May 19 (a week early).
