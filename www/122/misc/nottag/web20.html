There are bridges between the two, though: Net::Flickr::Backup can
export RDF for each photo, there are some nice javascript-based tools

The thing with blogs is that there are at least standards (trackback
and pingback) that let you have the same sort of social network with
services you host, and several APIs that let you access the data in
them. Caolan McNamara, RedHat's OOo hacker, has an OOWriter plugin in
Python that lets you write blog entries for Blogger-compatible
servers: <A HREF="http://people.redhat.com/caolanm/oooblogger"

The thing Backpack (and Flickr, Del.icio.us, etc.) has going for it is
that you can get everything you put into it back pretty easily:
there's Net::Backpack for Perl, as well as modules in just about every
other language you can think of (<A HREF="http://jf.backpackit.com/pub/73119"

None of these services really strike me as things to worry about: set
up a few cron jobs to back up your data, and if the service goes belly
up, it's not too hard to extract your data again.

Hmm. It seems there are a few open source del.icio.us clones out there,

(Separately, Mike Orr noted[1] that Unalog, mentioned above, depends on
an old, probably unmaintained version of Quixote, using the Dulcinea
add-on objects, the Durus object database rather that ZODB, plus a
number of other things.)

Jimmy, you know, that's a pretty nice apps list you accumulated, across
the several messages I've quoted from, above.  I hope you don't mind if
I steal it for my knowledgebase.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
I really do think we're starting to see a blitz of promotion for those
"Just use your {Web browser|RSS reader} and don't worry your pretty
little head over the question of who has your data" proprietary
"services".  I see this as one of the foci of the post-bust economy,
and I honestly don't know if we of the open-source community are
particular targets of that blitz, or if other people are getting it
worse.

I do know that hardly a week goes by with canned invitation messages for
such services (e.g., "social networks") don't hit my mailbox, many
purporting to come from friends or acquaintances who probably just hit a
button saying "Please send invitations to this list of friends' e-mail
addresses I've entered."  That is, it professes to be from someone I
know, but the writing style (and, X-Mailer header, etc.) are wrong, and
-- who'd have thought? -- it's attempting to leverage my acquaintance to
get me to "join" something that just coincidentally happens to feed
someone else's business model.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
A lot of initial impetus seems to have been furnished by Apple Computer
and by MacOS end-user types, both of which groups mostly couldn't be
bothered even noticing or caring whether code is proprietary or not --
and the users typically don't aspire to control their data or any other
aspect of their computing.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Anyhow, it's nice to have handy a list of "Luckily, I don't need to buy
into that hosted service model, since I can do it myself with [foo]"
answers.  I think I may try to maintain one.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Along those lines, I found the following entry about an open-source,
real-time collaborative editor program that's catching up on SubEthaEdit
for MacOS X -- yet another trendy gizmo -- in SCM developer David
Allouche's blog: <A HREF="http://ddaa.net/blog/gobby-first-look#gobby-it-works"
	>http://ddaa.net/blog/gobby-first-look#gobby-it-works</A>
(linked from RCS Planet, <A HREF="http://planet.revisioncontrol.net"
	>http://planet.revisioncontrol.net</A>):
</strong></P>

<pre><strong>  Gobby, it works!

  A few days ago, a colleague pointed me at Gobby
  (http://gobby.0x539.de/). The collaborative text editor from the
  0x539.dev group. I downloaded and compiled the application, played a bit
  with it, read the (still quite short) mailing list archive, and chatted
  a lot on the #0x539 IRC channel. And I have to say I was quite
  positively impressed!

  In short, Gobby is a multi-platform (Linux, Mac, Windows) collaborative
  text editor written in C++ and using the GTK toolkit. Despite the low
  version number (0.2.0 was recently released) it's already quite usable
  though it still has a few annoying limitations:

      * When a user loads a document, the whole document appears with the
        background colour of that user, making it impossible to see the
        text that user has typed during the session.
      * The Undo mechanism does not distinguish between local and remote
        edits. There is no way (yet) to undo your actions without first
        undoing more recent actions from other users.
      * The networking implementation is still less than ideal, in
        particular, the application freezes while trying to establish a
        connection.
      * The carets and selections of other users are not visible.

  On the upside, most of these limitations are likely to be fixed in the
  near future, except multiple-caret and multiple-selection display that
  would require a non-trivial amount of GTK programming.

  Most of the features you would expect are already there:

      * Lock-less collaborative text editing that actually works,
        providing all three of convergence, causality preservation and
        intention preservation.
      * Each user is associated to a background colour that marks the text
        the user has typed during the session.
      * A built-in chat service.
      * Syntax highlighting provided by the GtkSourceView widget.
      * Zeroconf networking using Howl.
      * A sane build system, based on the GNU Autotools suite.
      * Localisation support using gettext.

  My main issues with this project is that it is written in C++, which is
  not a language I would be programming in for fun, and that it enforces a
  centralised model. However, centralisation appears like a reasonable
  choice when you consider the additional complexity involved by useful
  decentralisation.

<P><strong>
The rest of the blog entry points out that SubEthaEdit implements the
design outlined in a publicly available ACM paper by Chengzheng Sun and
Xiaohua Jia of China, as revealed in a post to the AbiWord developers'
mailing list (<A HREF="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.editors.abiword.devel/17275"
	>http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.editors.abiword.devel/17275</A>).

<P><strong>
It's nice to know that we of the open-source world have a long-term
advantage:  Our stuff doesn't go away.  If/when del.icio.us,
LiveJournal, Flickr, BitKeeper, LinkedIn, Friendster, Frappr, Backpack,
etc. all fold up their tents in the night, we'll still be here,
gradually making progress and making certain that all work is available
for others to use, too.

Rick, I think that I'm failing to understand your argument. I've seen
you make it before, and it just didn't seem that compelling - but the
fact that you keep making it leads me to think that there's something
there that I'm just not getting.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Is is the fact that some form of, say, my personal data (zipcode-based
location) is out on the Net? That the resources with which this is being
done are not under my direct control? I'm definitely not understanding
something, then, because in any application of this sort, the ownership
of those resources - barring some sort of a cooperative agreement among
all the users - is going to be restricted to some small subset of all
users.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Is it that you believe that there just can't be any benefit in this kind
of thing - Frappr, to cite the most recent example to come up here -
unless it's explicitly Open Source? For myself, I see no harm in using
their service; I've read their TOS and their FAQ, as well as their
disclaimer, and the "worst" thing I saw in there was that they might
advertise on their own site, and you're not supposed to complain when
they do. I don't really see this as a bad thing; my "cost" is nearly
zero (yeah, it took a few minutes to set it all up, hunt up a pic, etc.)
and I get enjoyment out of seeing where my friends are.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Yeah, their business model - whatever that happens to be ("we'll get a
billion users and that will allow us to sell ads" seems to be it) may
well be what drives their site - although I note that their server space
was donated by some company. I still fail to see how this increases my
cost, damages any of my rights, or restricts me in any way.

If you can explain what I'm missing, I'd be grateful.

On a "What the Hell?" theory, let's take a historical approach to the
question.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Entering Mr. Peabody's Wayback Machine with the dial set to 1986, we
find me mostly relying on third-party services for my computing, and
particularly for my presence on public data networks.  My e-mail
address, to the extent I had one, was various peculiar ones like
Rick_Moen@f207.n914.z8.rbbs-net.org, <A HREF="mailto:Rick.Moen@fidogate.fidonet.org"
	>Rick.Moen@fidogate.fidonet.org</A>,
Rick.Moen@f27.n125.z1.fidonet.org, and <A HREF="mailto:76711.243@compuserve.com"
	>76711.243@compuserve.com</A>.
(Don't bother to try those; they've metaphorically gone 404.)
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
This was still back in dinosaur days, circa 1987, when the term "address
book" unambiguously referred to a dead-tree artifact I kept in my
rucksack's pocket, and I would joke about certain people being "pencil
people", i.e., that you had to pencil in their contact details because
those changed so often.  The irony is that I was too close for my
personal liking to a pencil person myself, as to my on-line presence.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
I noticed, at that time, that it was standard managerial practice during
layoffs to separate the portion of the herd to be culled and escort it
out of the building without contact with the remainder, in part so
as to deliberately cut off that contact.  Because departed employees
most often lacked an established and findable public identity -- or,
worse, only one issued to them by the company -- they were usually
somewhere between difficult and impossible to re-establish contact with.
This situation triggered the previously described hot-button I have
about sudden, freakish personal loss, and I decided it was
impermissible, and that I would put an end to it.  Which is what
basically made me a mailing list admin.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
My establishment on 1988-10-16 and gradual development of my public
dial-up BBS, The Skeptic's Board, started the process of fixing that
situation: Though gradually it became very complex and technologically
sophisticated, it was unusual in relying on only what we would now call
genuinely open-source codebases, other than MS-DOS, QEMM, DesqView, and
my BASIC compilers.  Even the core BBS software, RBBS-PC (originated
circa 1983), was open source, which meant that I was enabled in
perpetuity to fix any problems and to implement my own policies in fine
detail.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Although it came attached to annoying maintenance and other
responsibilities, the control and autonomy that running my own system
gave me were eye-opening, especially when I started using bidirectional
gating to UUCP for e-mail and Usenet netnews, first through friends'
setup and then on my own using Tim Pozar's open-source Fidogate package.
Suddenly, I was not only running a sovereign system, but could offer
arbitrary data to the rest of the world, including something close to
ftp offerings via mail transport.  My site became a major publisher of
selected sort of text files.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
My BBS pushed the outer limits of what was possible with MS-DOS-based
processes and FAT16 filesystems:  To get around some of the uglier
limitations, I employed the storied "CRITMON" method -- Creative
Renaming In The Middle Of the Night.  That is, the BinkleyTerm scheduler
that ran as the master process and served as, effectively, a
single-tasking crond, would terminate to run a batch file at 2:00 am,
whose sole purpose was to swap in temporary substitutes for the normal
<TT>AUTOEXEC.BAT</TT> and CONFIG.SYS files, set a flag file, and do hard reboot.
The system came back up in a system-maintenance environment, and ran
through numerous maintenance and network-contact-related jobs that
normally would not run because either the BBS was changing the system
state too rapidly or too little free RAM was available.  At the end of
the maintenance run, the maintenance routine put the regular
<TT>AUTOEXEC.BAT</TT> and CONFIG.SYS files back, removed the flag file, and hard
rebooted again, bringing back online the regular system regime.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
The normal operating environment had the most amazing job of shoehorning
drivers and processes into the 386/40's 1 MB real-mode address space
(out of the 4MB total EEMS expanded memory) that you'll ever see:  I was
able to cram QEMM, DesqView, special FOSSIL serial drivers and secure
ANSI video drivers, a TCP/IP stack(!), and a full-blown multinode
BinkleyTerm/RBBS-PC environment into that tiny amount of RAM -- and have
it utterly reliable and all maintenance automated -- and even have it
documented so the entire thing was comprehensible.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
That and everything else I owned got moved up to San Francisco around
1993 when I moved into a gutted light-industrial building in South of
Market district to help construct a Linux-based Internet cafe (The
CoffeeNet, mirror site:  <A HREF="http://linuxmafia.com/coffeenet"
	>http://linuxmafia.com/coffeenet</A>), which not
coincidentally landed all my machines on a full 1.54 MB/sec T-1 line,
connected live with no filtering whatsoever to the Internet.  The BBS
became "munin.imat.com", my desktop 486 (initially running OS/2 3.0)
"ymir.imat.com", and my Unix host "hugin.imat.com" (first 386BSD, then
Linux) -- using my landlord/friend (and CoffeeNet proprietor) Richard
Couture's "imat.com" domain, standing for Imagine That.[1]
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
The BBS's DOS/FAT limitations were becoming ridiculous by 1994, and I
developed tentative plans to migrate the system to Maximus BBS, which
was (unlike RBBS-PC) <em>  not  </em> open source but at least source-available and
free of charge for non-commercial usage.  I planned to eliminate FAT's
absurd file-metadata limitations by using the OS/2 version of Maximus on
HPFS filesystems instead of FAT.  But the more I prototyped and explored
it, the more I realised that many of the more subtle limitations were
deeply embedded in BBS culture and technology, and were no substitute
for having a real Unix system -- and running FidoNet-type BBS software
on a real Unix system seemed foolish when that class of technology had
basically reinvented Usenet poorly in the first place.  So, instead I
closed The Skeptic's Board in January 1996, transferring the portion of
its substantive contents that I still cared about to my Linux host
hugin.imat.com (which is now linuxmafia.com).
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
But I'd spotted the pattern:  The more I became directly involved with
open-source Unix, the more control, autonomy, and stable, consistent
presence on the Internet I enjoyed.  The better I understood that
technology, the more I was able to protect and extend that control and
autonomy.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Friends had to endure shifting presences on the Net -- being pencil
people, to some degree -- as companies went out of business or were
bought up, or as they changed employers, or as something they did was
held to violate someone else's Terms of Service, or some aggrieved
business interest complained and got an account cancelled.  In <em>  theory ,</em> 
their creations were always backed up and movable to other hosting;
it practice, there was also lossage both literal (if only from subtle
differences in handling data) and social in the sense of no longer being
consistently in one place.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Also about that time, it occurred to us early Linux people to do what
Linux people <em>  characteristically  </em> do (and online communities and the
better sort of microcomputer groups did before them) -- to use the
technology to form communities.  I started helping to run the PC-Unix
Special Interest Group in San Jose that was soon to become Silicon
Valley User Group, and helped found BALUG and a number of other Linux
user groups in my area (including my group CABAL, which is an offshoot
of BALUG) -- all of them with major online presences, which they used to
organise and run publicity stunts and other events.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
And here's the thing:  Both our individual and collective Internet
presences express <em>  our  identity and promote  our  </em> interests, and aren't
subject to control, interference, whimsically imposed third-party
advertising, sudden cancellation, third-party bankruptcy <TT>/</TT> changes of
business model.  The final change I personally had to undergo was
when Richard Couture (a year or two after he moved himself and his
business to Jalisco State, Mexico -- see <A HREF="http://www.linuxcabal.org"
	>http://www.linuxcabal.org</A>)
ceased offering nameservice for "hugin", and I had to cut over entirely
to my personal "linuxmafia.com" FQDNs.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
And there I stand.  The <em>  only  </em> third-party service I rely on is
unfiltered IP routing, and that's fungible and purchasible from anyone
-- and equally fungible DNS registration that's heavily protected and
paid many years in advance.  Anyone who tries to dislodge, threaten,
manipulate, or manipulate my presence and writings on the Net with
anything short of an uncontested court judgement is in for a rude shock:
The only place to complain about me or my users is not to some twitchy
corporate manager but rather directly to <em>  me ,</em>  the guy who reads law
books, takes only careful risks, looks out for his users, and really
<em> hates  </em> being pushed around.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
(My mother, during my teenage years, declined to be pushed around by
various Boeing Company agents, and I'm very much my mother's son in
certain ways -- and have a lot of my key interests mediated via the
Net.

</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Also, I care about the message we veteran Linux users project to the rest
of the world in other matters:  The very deliberate message the
Linux community have conveyed to the rest of the world, from the very
beginning, is:  "Sure, we can do that -- and with open source, too.
With documented, stable file formats, openly documented protocols,
totally platform-neutral."  Sometimes, that message has been a bit of a
stretch, e.g., PostgreSQL was only barely credible as a database for a
long time, and open source identity management <TT>/</TT> enterprise access
control is still a mess, and even open source source control management
(Bazaar2, Mercurial, Codeville, DARCS) is only just now overtaking the
best proprietary offerings (ClearCase, BitKeeper).  But we get there --
and we <em>  stay  </em> there, once we arrive.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Every time I decline to use some third-party, usually proprietary
service that I can reasonably do with Linux and open source on my own
systems, instead, I am protecting and promoting the perception by
onlookers that Linux and open source are the right solution -- not to
mention improving my own competence.  Internet services are supposed to
be the Linux community's core competency:  What sort of message does it
send to go moving our affairs onto other people's third-party services
as a convenience, in an area where we're supposed to be the leaders?
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
That is not to say that I don't use some upstream services:  I don't
spider the Web and run my own search engine.  I don't have my own atomic
clock.  My NNTP news spool is not full-featured, so I rely on one of a
couple of upstream full news feeds and spools.  All of those services
are kept as fungible and moveable as feasible.   I occasionally put data
I don't care centrally (to my affairs and online presence) and lastingly
about on third-party hosting sites.  Frappr could easily be one of
those.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
And of course, I participate in collective efforts that I don't
personally run -- like this one, and even Eklektix, Inc.'s LWN.net.  But
I put limits on the extent of that latter stuff, having been burned one
time too many by third-party outfits, and deciding I can do better in
aspects that matter such as continuity and sane management over time.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Let's take "social networks" like LinkedIn as an example:
</strong></P>
<P><strong><BLOCKQuote>
If "social networks" become sufficiently compelling, I expect I'll
see development of a <em>  distributed  </em> one rather than one that is centrally
controlled, one in which peer nodes can form/reform their own associations
as their needs change.  LinkedIn is someone else's (centrally
controlled, proprietary) game; I as a participant would not be in any
way on a level playing field.  There's a management that decides what to
offer you as a service product, and whether and when you can participate
at all, and in what way.  And, when they decide they aren't making
enough money and plaster banner adds all over "your" information, or
decide to sell information about you to arbitrary other parties, you
would have no say in the matter.
</BLOCKQuote></strong></P>
<P><strong>
I might be willing to put up with those drawbacks, if the advantages are
sufficiently compelling, and doing something functionally similar on my
own is a truly excessive amount of bother.  My reluctance might be
reduced to the extent the service is fungible, easily moveable, and
providable by others -- analogous to the IP transport, NNTP access, and
NTP syncing I use.  On the other hand, it's not just an Internet
service but also a form of community, and both as mentioned have
traditionally been the Linux community's core competency.  So, we're
going to buy that from others?  Really?  Have we no sysadmins and
software architects among us?  I rather think we do.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
The foregoing of control and autonomy is social as well as individual:
It starts with "Well, they needed to add banner ads in order to support
their business", and continues with "Well, they needed to throw that guy
off because somebody might sue them", but ends up with "We all buy cool
stuff when and if it's offered by some central authority."  You become,
to that degree, a technoserf.  That's one of the longer-term reasons why
the hackish reaction to something like LinkedIn or SubEthaEdit or Flickr
isn't "Wow, that's cool; where can I get it?" but rather "Wow, that's
cool; how can we help make everyone able to do that on their own?"  The
way to stay in charge is to, well, insist on being in charge.  The habit
of dependency, instead, at minimum creates bad precedents and a bad
balance of power.[2]
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Moving on from the historical approach, we might switch to analogy --
always one of my favourite forms of distortion and self-delusion:  I go
to restaurants a good bit.  Sometimes, it's to be where friends are.
Sometimes, it's for convenience at a cost.  Sometimes, it's to eat
something really interesting.  Most of the time, when I'm there, I try
to favour dishes I don't personally know how to make, or that I know
would be ridicuously complex for the payoff -- e.g., filo dough
pastries.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
One difference, of course, is that I'm only a casual cook, and
restaurants are seldom even an indirect threat to people's operational
autonomy or privacy.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
I have little confidence that I've covered the core of my concern, in
the above, as I fear it's based primarily on instinct and the deep-down
lessons of personal computing history.  However, I hope at least you
find parts of it interesting.

then bought me "linuxmafia.com" as a gift, in part because I discovered
the hard way that hardly anyone could remember "hugin.imat.com".

"consumer", pointing out that a model that reduces me to a digestive

For myself, I don't see control as a negative - as long as it points
<EM>in</EM> rather than out. I've never heard the term "control freak" applied
to, say, yoga practitioners - and yet, this is one of the largest facets
of yoga practice. Instead, the term usually refers to people who want to
control <em>  others,  </em> or other people's resources (which amounts to the same
thing.) When someone denotes the former in me, I see it as a compliment;
the latter would be an insult if false and a really bad problem to be
fixed ASAP if true.

So, instead of "spinning" it one way or the other, simply ask the person
using the term what they mean. And be sure to thank them when they
compliment you.

it's got lots of very large holes in it at the moment, and more holes

I'm glad to hear that it's back to normal, anyway. For us, the hurricane
season is nominally over, but I don't know if anyone has sent a postcard
to the hurricanes themselves to let them know. There have been so many
that we've gone right through the English alphabet and are well started
into the Greek one (hurricane Beta was the last one.) Oh well... by the

<blockQuote>
Just to give everyone an idea - this season broke all records when it
got to Tropical Storm <EM>Beta</EM>. We're now at <EM>Epsilon</EM>. The one saving
grace is that the water temperatures around here have dropped, and
hurricane development is unlikely (no guarantees, but it's a big help.)

I see your point. I strongly agree with it: I can't argue against it,
because it's at the core of what I believe. My problem is that, due to
the way I live, I don't have access to the services that allow you to
maintain that autonomy; for me, the choice often comes down to "be on
the consumer end or forget about having the service." Up until very
recently, all of my communications at home were done via Nextel, at
1okB/S or less; as of yesterday, I have a Verizon card that promises DSL
speeds (yeah, right. But it <EM>is</EM> a lot faster than the Nextel was.) If I
tell Nextel, or now Verizon, to take a long walk off a short pier, then
I don't get to be on the Net at all - unless I take a mile-long hike to
a cafe where I can connect (sometimes, when their notwork is up) <EM>if</EM> I
buy food.

In a way, it's sorta like being disabled. There's only so much autonomy
you can have before you have to ask your nurse to wheel you over to the

In practice, it just doesn't work. You saw what I went through when I
was trying to run my own mail server - dammit, I <EM>wanted</EM> that bit of
autonomy! - and it came down to "no can do" because I didn't have

that's going to change, except perhaps in the direction of "less

Canal, etc. to sail over to California, and will likely be out of touch
most of that time. The wireless solutions, up until recently, were
either a) ridiculously expensive ($40k+ for Inmarsat M, a lot cheaper
for Inmarsat C if I wanted 2400Bps.  Gee, thanks...) or b) technically
infeasible (many of them required kilowatts of juice to run.) My options
came down to, well, lack of autonomy or simply not having the service.

A large number of companies offer either hosting or virtual hosting,
which you could take advantage of in addition to whichever low-bandwidth

All of those are things sort of vaguely like VMware, except open-source.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Ordinarily, one of the reasons hosting a machine at a colo (Internet
co-location centre) is expensive is that your bitty box occupies rack
space, and also gulps down AC power (mains power, for
Commonwealth-English folk).  This is one of the reasons the 1U form
factor (and even more unwise things) has become so popular for server
farms:  It allows you to fit 40 1U servers into the same 19" rack that
otherwise would have been limited to about 20 standard 2U servers.  (As
standard rackmount servers have become shorter, the engineering required
to prevent self-immolation from heat buildup has become much more
difficult.)
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Xen, UML (User-Mode Linux), and QEMU are all virtual-machine
technologies ("virtualisers"), implemented entirely[1] with open-source
code, that allow you to run multiple virtual machines underneath Linux.
Each virtual machine can run the Linux distribution of your choice,
which while running believes itself to be running on native hardware as
the sole operating system, unaware that the "hardware" it's running on
is emulated by a virtualiser that intervenes between it and the
underlying hardware.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Xen is the most-recent of those virtualisers on Linux, and is looking to
be wildly successful as a hosting environment for colos that run Linux.
You sign up to get root on a virtual "machine", which gets preloaded
for you with the distro of your choice.  After being given the initial
root password, you ssh in and do... anything you want, including opening
a chroot and installing something else entirely.  After all, you're root
-- a veritable microcosmic god.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Limitations?  I suppose the colo might impose I/O throughput limits
on each emulated ethernet interface -- or not, per contract.  Also, the
underlying physical hardware only has so much excess capacity:  If all
20 or so emulated hosts on a physical 2U box start doing database
rebuilds all at once, odds are that performance will suffer.  On the
bright side, that probably won't happen often, and the existence of
those 19 others means you'll probably pay only 1/10 of what having the
box to yourself would cost.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
(I'm assuming those are real, modern Linux machines, something like a
dual 3GHz Xeon EM64T or Opteron, not an antique piece of junk like
uncle-enzo.linuxmafia.com's single-proc PIII/500 and Intel N440BX
motherboard.)

It's where you lease a "virtual server" as Rick described rather than an
entire computer.  It's cheaper for the ISP because they can host several
people on one box.  You usually have a choice of three or four Linux or
BSD distros, although they may give better support for the distro they
use themselves.  If you hose your "system" they just replace the
filesystem image and you start again.  It'll come with <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A> and a
database preinstalled, but you can install your own webserver or
mailserver or whatever you want.  It's more expensive than a chroot or
limited-shell service because the ISP has to provide more memory and
disk space -- the libraries and software aren't shared between users.
I've seen prices from $20 - $99 <TT>/</TT> month.

One such company is tummy.com.  They are dedicated to Linux, the owners
are active in the Python community, and they were even distributing
Linux CDs at one of the PyCons.  I haven't used the service, but I
haven't heard any complaints from those who do.

Thought I should share some of my experience with Linux Virtual
Servers(LVS). I had a <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> based virtual system running on User-mode
Linux (<A HREF="http://usermodelinux.org"
	>http://usermodelinux.org</A>). It was pretty stable and I liked
having root access on the server without having to pay through my nose
for hosting.

One thing to keep in mind is that you should try to get as much RAM and
swap space as you can afford or you will end up getting some very wierd
errors or a lot of coredumps (As I found out the hard way) when
processes start running out of memory.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
So if you want to run a plain old webserver/mailserver that doesn't need
a lot of horsepower then a LVS would be the way to go, but if you are
running applications/websites that need a lot of juice to run (e.g. Some
blogging software like Serendipity need a lot of juice) then you 'might'
have a problem.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I used redwoodvirtual as my hosting service and I would have probably
stuck around and tried to work out the problems I was having if their
tech support had been more helpful/responsive.  (The only way to contact
them was via email and they usually took about 2-3 days to respond. The
one time I was really really upset with them was when my LVS went down
and it took them over a day to restart it)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I might look at other LVS services in the future but for now I guess I
will stick with a shared hosting website for my site.

Hope all this made some sense.

You can also own your own domain, and virthost just the mail for it
somewhere, if nothing else:

No, what I meant by <em>  that  </em> is something even cheaper.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Let's say you registered okopnic.com as your personal domain.  You get
a couple of friends to agree to do DNS for you (which is simple, and no
big deal).  Now, you're all dressed up but have nowhere to go, because
your $15/year for the domain plus two friends' nameservice has got you a
functional domain (i.e., it resolves names), but no host to <em> live </em>
within that domain.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
So, you talk to me, and say "Rick, could I receive my mail for FQDNs
okopnic.com and mail.okopnic.com on your linuxmafia.com machine?"  And
I'd say "Sure."  And I'd have no real need to charge you a penny for
that.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Old uncle-enzo currently answers to just a few FQDNs (linuxmafia.com,
uncle-enzo.linuxmafia.com, www.linuxmafia.com, ftp.linuxmafia.com,
enzo.linuxmafia.com, ns1.linuxmafia.com, mail.linuxmafia.com,
debian.linuxmafia.com, and mail.linuxgazette.net), and <em>  used  </em> to also
answer to hugin.imat.com -- but can respond to a hundred domains pretty
much as easily as it can to one.[1]
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
You'd tell your friends who maintain your DNS zonefile to point
okopnic.com and mail.okopnic.com to uncle-enzo's IP, 198.144.195.186,
and you'd be in business.  Well, you'd be in business after a few days
of my debugging MTA-configuration errors, but that goes with the
territory.

It comes down to a question of owning that kind of resources. I have no
way to offer, e.g., Flickr-like services on any server that I control;
my web stuff is hosted on a BSD system at Freeshell.org, and I have no
more control over that than I do over Flickr. Use it, and put up with
that lack of control? Or deny myself the (admittedly minor) bit of fun
at nearly zero cost? That way lies a fairly grim existence.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
There are, undeniably, services which promote a pernicious model, and
they <em>  should  </em> be shunned - even at a high cost (i.e., I don't shop at
Walmart, even though it costs me more to shop elsewhere.) However, I
simply <em>can't</em> draw the line as low as I wish; at a certain point, the
cost becomes too high.

On the other hand, it's not just an Internet

traditionally been the Linux community's core competency.  So, we're
going to buy that from others?  Really?  Have we no sysadmins and
software architects among us?  I rather think we do.

But, to get back on track: the issue about things like Flickr and
Frappr tit practically a requirement that they be ASP-hosted as they
are is the networking aspect of them --  Metcalfe's Law:

<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
"The usefulness of a network rises as the square of it's number of nodes."
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
It's an uncommon -- but, I think, a useful -- generalization to apply
it to services like this; they <EM>could</EM> be implemented as distributed
services, but it would be damned difficult, and since 98.3% of the
current-day inhabitants of the current-day internet aren't equipped to
participate in them in that fashion, the cost-benefit analysis on the
implementation isn't looking all that bright.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Now, admittedly, there's some chicken-and-end interaction between that
issue and the old "long live the end-to-end internet" thing, but,
really, most of it is "developing for Windows is much more of a pain
than doing it for *nix, and that's still where all the people are".
</blockQuote>

So, while they may in <EM>fact</EM> have business models that aren't entirely
palatable to Libertarianism, let's remember that that's not the only
reason they're built that way.

[2] Anyone who thinks the software industry customer model (and, by

been paying attention.  This extends down to the concepts and terms

A lot of people seem to like Flickr, for that purpose
(<A HREF="http://www.flickr.com"
	>http://www.flickr.com</A> -- a Yahoo property).  After uploading photos,
it furnishes some automatic image-manipulation (image rotation, sizing,
thumbnails, notations, RSS/Atom feeds, albums, "tags"=categories).  With
the default no-charge login, individual images you upload must be &lt; 5MB,
only your most recent 200 uploads are accessible, only various
scaled-down image variants are available (not your original file), and
there's a 20MB/month bandwidth cap.  Such accounts are
advertising-subsidised.  Naturally, there's also a "Pro account" upsell,
that eases those limits.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Which is a sneaky way for me to shlep into the conversation a broader
topic: people deciding to use commercial services to hold their personal
data -- or not -- which is tangentially relevant to the recent blogging
thread on this list.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
The topic of hosting comes up quite a lot in my family and among my
friends, and sort of an ongoing tug of war:  I and a relative few others
remain in the "if I want it, I'll do it myself, thanks" camp; everyone
else goes for various hosted-services fads.

Web 2.0 (or Web 1.9 as NTK would have it) seems to be the dumbed down
version of the Semantic Web: non-standardised meta information in
simple XML vs. (over-)complicated RDF.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
There are bridges between the two, though: Net::Flickr::Backup can
export RDF for each photo, there are some nice javascript-based tools

The big one that hit me a few years ago was LiveJournal -- followed

LiveJournal server-end code apparently used to be open source, but then
was taken proprietary.

Any time you host your data on someone else's site, you inherently give
up a <em>  lot  </em> of autonomy -- and are subjecting yourself to third-party

What I told the LiveJournal crowd after several appealed to me to join
their "community" was that if I wanted to blog, I'd do it with (1)
entirely open-source software that is (2) hosted on MyOwnDamnedServer
(uncle-enzo.linuxmafia.com), which last I checked wasn't broken.  That
way, it has the functionality I want to run (and maintain), I control
everything, and nothing of mine is subject to banishment just because
some twinkie filed a complaint or applied a creative interpretation of
some Terms of Service guidelines -- nor will my data suddenly sprout
someone else's advertising, abusive Javascript SSIs, etc.  And, if their
"communities" could not interoperate with my stuff, then it was to that
degree retarded and unclear on fundamental concepts of the World-Wide
Web and the end-to-end model.

The thing with blogs is that there are at least standards (trackback

That end-to-end model has been under pressure:  Private and dynamic IP
spaces are all that cyberpeasants ever live on, copyright barons here in
the United States of Disney want everything in central storage for
easier control, and bandwidth providers keep pushing asymmetric
connections.  Even my server suffers the latter problem:  Its home DSL
service, albeit superbly provisioned by the clueful and Linux-friendly
firm Raw Bandwidth Communications, has an outbound Committed Information
Rate (CIR) cap of 128kbps, which is unavoidable unless I want to spring
a lot more for fractional T1 over frame relay.  Back when its 486
ancestor was on T1 in San Francisco, it survived full-on <A HREF="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</A>ting

The thing Backpack (and Flickr, Del.icio.us, etc.) has going for it is
that you can get everything you put into it back pretty easily:
there's Net::Backpack for Perl, as well as modules in just about every

The thing that worries me is Ning.com: "Ning is a free online service

The whole idea behind Ning seems to be based on a bastardised notion
of open source: build your apps, copy other people's code (they have
'view source' and 'clone this' buttons for every program), but they're
vague about what you can take elsewhere.
Perhaps not surprising, as they intend to make money from advertising.

Er, I wasn't following this thread, but from the README it depends on:

<blockquote><pre>    - dulcinea-0.1 (http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/dulcinea/)
        Also works with dulcinea-0.2.1, but you will have to do one
        of the following:
        [snip]
        ...otherwise I believe dulcinea-0.2.1 will just work.
        Note that dulcinea-0.3+ will NOT work; it uses Durus, not ZODB,
        and unalog uses the ZODB.
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Dulcinea is a set of add-on objects for Quixote; e.g., a name/address
widget for a form.  I don't use it because it's undocumented.  Durus is an
object database, much simpler than ZODB.  It has transactions and an
optional server mode, but is not thread safe.  MEMS Exchange, which
sponsors Quixote, uses all of these internally.
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>    - ZODB-3.2.4+ (http://zope.org/Products/ZODB3.2)

framework with its own IDE, but is available standalone.

In the name of avoiding the maudlin and self-indulgent, let me try to be
brief on those aspects, and expand on the interesting bits:
</strong></P>
<P><strong><BLOCKQuote>
Sometime around 1968, Boeing sold and put into service a number of B-707
gets that all had the same manufacturing defect, something concerned
with a safety system concerning the flaps, that made catastrophic
failure likely during operation in extreme temperatures.  (It would have
caused certain types of trouble to get details, so I don't have many.)
Boeing was aware of the defects when they handed off the planes; they
sent illegally insufficient notifications of them that didn't raise
anything like the level of urgency required to get the problem fixed.
</BLOCKQuote></strong></P>
<P><strong>
Christmas 1968, the first and (thankfully) only of those in-service
catastrophic failures occurred, on Pan American Airways cargo flight 7,
diverted by extreme cold weather from Anchorage, Alaska to nearby
Elmendorf Airforce base.  The three members of the flight crew and the
flight attendents were killed in the explosion and crash that occurred
during takeoff.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Friday, December 27, 1968, some private detectives apparently hired by
Boeing Company arrived at the doorstep of one of the widows, Faye Weeks
Moen, widow of Captain Arthur Moen, who with their two children Frederick
Arthur (10) and Michele Faye (9) had recently moved back from Hong Kong
to San Mateo, California.  The purpose of the detectives' visit was one
of the interesting parts:  It seems that certain Fortune 500 companies
maintain (or hire, as needed) dirty-tricks squads to threaten widows and
small children when they, the companies, screw up and kill people.
(I'll bet this is not news to the people of, say, Bhopal.)
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
The detectives' objective was to threaten Mrs. Moen into not filing a
liability lawsuit.  It may have been that they saw her as the potential
leader of the survivors, or they may have sent similar brute squads to
the others, as well.  In any event, they professed to represent Boeing,
and intimated that things would go very badly for her and her small
children if she were to file litigation of any sort:  They suspected
that her late husband might have had numerous skeletons in his closet,
that would be likely to emerge if she pressed matters, and who knows
what other vulnerabilities her small family might have?  There were
several of them, and they took care to be physically intimidating as
well as rather vaguely suggesting that the large amount of money behind
them would crush her, if she were to act in a way the company found
displeasing.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
This left Mrs. Moen (further) shocked, and temporarily unable to respond
-- but after some days' contemplation more-or-less backfired.  Though
some of the other widows were, indeed, opposed to pursuing a lawsuit,
she was not, and gradually over a period of six years of pre-trial
delays introduced by the defendents, built a strong civil case based in
large part on internal Boeing documents and filings with the Federal
Aviation Administration and Civil Aviation Board, and on the findings of
the FAA crash-investigation crew that had visited Elmendorf A.B.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Through either malice or amazing coincidence, Mrs. Moen did have to put
up with considerable harrassment for the entire six years that followed
-- which, curiously, stopped thereafter:  Each year, her income tax
return was chosen for special Internal Revenue Service compliance
audits, which according to one revenue officer's account was triggered
by "tips" they had received from an unnamed source.  Mrs. Moen also
found herself urged by sundry parties to invest her family funds into
various really bad, obviously fraudulent investment schemes.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
The lawsuit came up to its initial trial date, after many carefully
contrived delays from the defendent side, in 1974.  As background,
recall that this was in the middle of the Watergate hearings, and the
"missing White House tapes" and Rosemary Woods's 18-minute gap were very
much in the news.  One of the very first items subpoenaed by the
plaintiffs was the aircraft's two tape recordings (the cabin recording
and the instrument one):  Boeing's attorney, with evident discomfort,
said, "Your Honor, we are unable to locate those tapes."  The judge
replied, "You're kidding."
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Boeing settled with the plaintiffs shortly thereafter.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Young Frederick Arthur Moen (who went by "Ricky" in those days) at least
got an interesting bird's-eye view of both the underside of corporate
power and on the USA's Federal civil litigation system -- and a good
start on his latinate, sesquipedalian vocabulary.  And he got to be an
Ivy Leaguer at Boeing Company's expense -- but was already arrogant and
pedantic, long before that.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
The other, similarly defective airplanes got fixed before anyone else
got killed -- no thanks to Boeing Company, and thanks almost entirely to
Mrs. Moen's pushing on the investigation and publicity front.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Pan American World Airways, Inc. were almost equally culpable, since
they were provably aware of the defects but did not bother to expedite
their repair.  However, they could not be sued for negligence because of
the shield provisions of the Federal Workman's Compensation Act.
However, that firm went bankrupt and dissolved in 1991, primarily
because of gross mismanagement and their much-publicised negligence
about flight security at Heathrow Airport, London, that had made
possible the Lockerbie bombing of 1988 (claimed to have been carried
out by a Libyan agent).
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Mrs. Moen was left permanently damaged by strain from the six-year
fight, and lives to this day with life-threatening hypertension and a
tendency towards clinical depression that are both kept somewhat in
check by medication.  She lives alone in Moraga, California near near
daughter.

Sure, go ahead. I'll even go one better: you mentioned your wife had
switched from using iCalendar to Backpack. Well, that's not exactly the
"right" web service for event sharing: upcoming.org is, and one of the
drupal[1] projects in the Summer of Code was to add a module to clone
upcoming.org's functionality and API, and as an added bonus it'll sync
with upcoming.org.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
You also mentioned Live Journal: drupal already has all (AFAICT) of Live
Journal's functionality, but there's also a module to authenticate
against Live Journal's servers (so its users can add comments and such
with the utmost convenience).
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
I've also seen mention of cloning digg.com (cross between del.icio.us
and slashdot: if enough people post a link, it goes on the front page)
using the nodevote module.

<P><strong>
There's no Backpack clone yet, but there is a textile module, so it's
probably a matter of time. Same goes for frappr: there's a google maps
module.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
No flickr clones yet, but it's on the Gallery todo list. It shouldn't
take too long: I had a nearly-working clone for Gallery 1, but as it
tended to eat data at random intervals, I didn't deem it suitable for
public consumption. The hardest part would be the image map maker bit,
but it should be easy to repurpose the RDF image map making bit of
Javascript I mentioned elsewhere.

proprietary software, but users' data isn't. Flickr and del.icio.us

There's a lot of verbose and tiresome exposition for 10 paragraphs
while Tim attempts to explain paradigm shifts to his pointy-haired
target audience.  Stick with it, because even with all the tedium and
transparent attempts to get heads nodding reflexively -- which, sadly,
don't cease after the introductory 10 paragraphs -- he eventually
reaches his point, quoting Clayton Cristensen:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
When attractive profits disappear at one stage in the value chain
because a product becomes modular and commoditized, the opportunity to
earn attractive profits with proprietary products will usually emerge at
an adjacent stage.

Tim cites Google as an instance of a proprietary-advantage business
built on open-source software, where the value doesn't even rest in
Google's secret algorithms, but rather from their database's very size,
and network effect of its participating users -- in effect, their market
position.

Tim goes on:  "And the opportunities are not merely up the stack. There
are huge proprietary opportunities hidden inside the system."  He quotes
Christensen as saying that "attractive profits" move to "subsystems from
which the modular product is assembled".  He cited as an example every
sysadmin's object of derision, the domain-registration business of
Network Solutions (now Verisign) that was built using the open-source
BIND nameservice daemon, citing with approval not the firm's infamously
grasping misdeeds, but rather its high profitability.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
(He also points out that branding a la "Intel Inside" can be key to
making profits, pointing to <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A>'s strategy in that area.)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
He then launched into one of his larger points, about the value of
"network collaboration" to proprietary businesses.  This would seem to
describe Backpack and many of the other recent examples:  The value lies
in the collaboration service sold (er, rented) to members of the public.
He mentions EBay and Amazon's touted "network effect" marketing
advantage, and says the key underlying concept is "user-created value",
pointing out that Gmail and orkut show that Google hasn't forgotten that
lesson.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
He then briefly discusses customisability (one of the classic open
source advantages for business), and then gets to his final major point:
software-as-service.  He points to the ways that, at businesses like
Yahoo, Google, eBay, and Amazon, software is used as a vehicle for
business <em>  process .</em>
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
In his conclusion, he waves his arms rather vaguely about a future
"Internet operating system", hinting that there may be proprietary
advantage to be found in... I dunno... components of it or ways in
which it's put together.  It's unclear what he meant in that part, but
he was writing for pointy-hairs and so didn't have to make sense; he
just had to sound halfway plausible (and suitably grandiose).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Tim probably intended to provide a blueprint for finding proprietary
niches; I personally look on it as a blueprint for how to avoid or
replace them.

The main (Web 2.0) points, as I see them, are:
</strong></P>
<P><strong><BLOCKQuote>
* Collaboration ("The Read-Write Web"): the same desire to add to the
collective knowledge on the 'net that's driving Wikipedia is driving
most of these services, even if what you're adding is just a URL and a
description.
</BLOCKQuote></strong></P>
<P><strong>
* Metadata ("The Semi-Semantic Web"): these services all provide <EM>easy</EM>
(as opposed to most, if not all, RDF-based offerings) ways to annotate
your data, even if it's just a set of "tags".
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Flickr, for example, lets you add the date the photo was taken and
generates calendars from the dates -- great for jogging your memory.
There's a pair of greasemonkey scripts available that let you select
where the photo was taken using Google Maps, adding the coordinates as
specially formatted tags, so you can easily find photos taken in the
same place, etc. It lets you add descriptions to different regions of
the photo, etc.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
It's nothing compared to the promise of the Semantic Web: with flickr, I
can tag photos of my brother as "Joe", but looking for photos with that
tag are going to get me a lot more than just my brother. Heck, it
wouldn't even work well within my own family: my mother is more likely
to tag photos of my Dad with "Joe". On the semantic web, I'd use FOAF to
provide information about each person, which uses email as a unique ID.
It doesn't matter what name is used, I can find the right pictures.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
(But it's not that simple. RDF is a nightmare, because it's still
limited to academia, and noone is in a hurry to standardise).

For 30AUD a month you can get your entire company hosted on a host like
DreamHost. Configure clients to use their IMAP server and send mail via
the server in California. DreamHost's Web panel makes it all pretty

Just as a follow-up, Dreamhost are equally inept with DNS -- in a
particular sense that is widely true of cut-rate, commodity hosting
providers.  E.g., DomainDirect does it too, as do many others.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
To explain:  Have a look at this report on the Bay Area Linux User Group
domain's DNS, which along with the Web site itself is hosted at
Dreamhost:
</strong></P>
<P><strong><BLOCKQuote>
<A HREF="http://www.dnsreport.com/tools/dnsreport.ch?domain=balug.org"
	>http://www.dnsreport.com/tools/dnsreport.ch?domain=balug.org</A>
</BLOCKQuote></strong></P>
<P><strong>
Notice that none of the Dreamhost's three nameservers have "glue" at the
parent .ORG zone.  The practical consequence of that is that BALUG's
DNS is unnecessarily slow, because each lookup of its NS records must
be followed up by an otherwise unnecessary matching "A" lookup -- for
lack of glue records.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Glue records are "A" records for nameservers within the parent zone,
that get sent back with results of all queries for NS data,
<em> specifically  </em> to avert the need for that second lookup.  (In special
edge cases, glue records also avoid a chicken-and-egg problem -- if the
nameserver's hostname is <em>  within  </em> the zone it serves.)
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
As it happens, there <em>  cannot  </em> be glue records within .ORG concerning
<TT>.COM</TT> (or, e.g., .NET) nameservers, because such would be
out-of-bailiwick and hence DNS-illegal on grounds of preventing cache
poisioning -- because the .ORG TLD has no delegated authority over .COM
hostnames.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
How <em>  should  </em> Dreamhost deal with such bailiwick problems?  By creating
new NS and A records <em>  within  </em> the domain in question (e.g., balug.org)
pointing to its nameserver IPs, and adding <em>  those  </em> to the parent
zonefile.  E.g., they'd add lines for NS1.BALUG.ORG, etc.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Why didn't they?  Because their one-size-fits-all solution that ignores
bailiwick problems is easier, and doesn't require their staff to know
what they're doing.  They either assume their customers don't know better,
or more likely aren't even aware of the issue or the resulting
performance hit.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
We keep being told how much more reliable "hosted" services are -- and
yet, why is it that individual Linux hobbyists so often do a better job?
(BALUG are at Dreamhost because one of their volunteers likes the outfit
-- even though more Dreamhost lapses of diligence becoming apparent all
the time, like that bit about rejecting mail to postmaster.)

Quoting Brian May (bam@snoopy.apana.org.au):

&gt; Are you sure about this? I have seen references that state glue

Well, <em>  wrong  </em> glue records are evil, as they can be used by malign
nameserver operators (or intruders who've compromised nameservers) for
cache poisoning.  (Caches do or should protect aagainst this by vetting
bailiwicks, and rejecting any returned glue information that's outside
the reporting nameserver's bailiwick.)  <em>  Correct  </em> glue records are in the

are necessary to make nameservice work at all.  (See my discussion of
your RFC1537 item, below.)

<P><strong>
That is, consider what happens when a caching nameserver gets a client
request, doesn't yet have what's asked for in cache, and has to find the

The three lines in "ANSWER SECTION" are the information requested:
Notice that what are provided are <em>hostnames</em>:  Before the querying
nameserver can proceed with using those nameserver locations, it must
resolve the nameserver hostnames to IPs, which would thus be (in the
absensce of valid glue information) a separate lookup.

Now, it happens to be the case that the NS results above <em> were </em>

.ORG has no authority for <TT>.COM</TT> names.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Therefore, since it can't (or shouldn't, for security reasons) accept
the glue information it just received from .ORG, the querying nameserver

In this case, the querying nameserver <em>  can  </em> safely accept the glue

RFC author P. Beertema says, in short, wrong glue records are bad.  I
agree:  I recommend <em>  correct  </em> glue records.

If you prefer for every NS record to require two lookups instead of one,

&gt; general case a useful aid to good DNS performance, and in one edge case
&gt; are necessary to make nameservice work at all.  (See my discussion of
&gt; your RFC1537 item, below.)
&gt;
&gt; That is, consider what happens when a caching nameserver gets a client
&gt; request, doesn't yet have what's asked for in cache, and has to find the
&gt; target domain's nameservers:   It queries for "NS" records for that
&gt; domain, like this:

[snip my "dig -t ns balug.org" example.]
</strong></pre>
<P><strong>
Apologies for having been too rushed in picking that example:  It was
slightly wrong, in that I should have queried  NS records at the
<em> parent  </em> zone, i.e., in .ORG.  One suitable place to ask would be
tld6.ultradns.co.uk[1] , like this:

<P><strong>
You'll notice that, this time, there <em>  is  </em> no "ADDITIONAL SECTION"
information (and thus, no glue records).  Thus there must be an
otherwise avoidable follow-up "A" query for every "NS" query, on this
domain.  That's because the listed <TT>.COM</TT> nameservers are out-of-bailiwick
for the .ORG parent zone's nameservers:  They have no authority in that
namespace.
</strong></P>
<P><strong>
Contrast those results with the same sort of test for a different domain,
randometry.com, whose two nameservers are both in-bailiwick for the
parent <TT>.COM</TT> domain.  In this case, an appropriate server to ask would be
m.gtld-servers.net[2].

<P><strong>
Please notice that the returned results include not just the hostnames of
the NS entries asked about, but also their IP addresses in the
"ADDITIONAL SECTION" stanza, thus averting the aformentioned second
lookup.

<P><strong>
I hope that example makes my point clearer, and apologise for muffing it
the first time.

Heh. On the wider topic of hosting your own version of Web 2.0-type
applications, AutoDesk have set up the 'MapServer Foundation': they're
taking over hosting of UMN MapServer (now 'MapServer Cheetah':
<A HREF="http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu"
	>http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu</A>), and have released their own map server
('MapServer Enterprise':
<A HREF="http://www.mapserverfoundation.org/mapserver_enterprise/download.html"
	>http://www.mapserverfoundation.org/mapserver_enterprise/download.html</A>)
under the LGPL.

So now, if you have maps (and, IIRC, Bruce Perens has a bunch of US
maps), you can run your own Google Maps-alike.

There are quite a few web-based RSS readers out there. Here are a few
