<h2>News in General</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">SUN Approves Oracle Merger, Cancels "Rock"</h3>
<p>At a special meeting on July 16, 2009, Sun Microsystems stockholders 
adopted the merger agreement with Oracle Corporation, under which 
Oracle will acquire Sun common stock for $9.50 per share (or $7.4 
billion). Approximately 62% of Sun shares outstanding voted for the 
deal.</p>

<p>The transaction remains subject to regulatory approvals 
and other closing conditions. For more informawtion regarding the 
proposed transaction, please visit 
<a
href="http://www.sun.com/third-party/global/oracle/">http://www.sun.com/third-party/global/oracle/</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, Sun has been reported as cancelling its multi-billion dollar 
"Rock" program, which was based on a new third-generation SPARC 
architecture for high-end systems. Sun had said the next SPARC 
processor was part of its plan to compete with PowerPC and x86 chips.</p>

<p>Rock was designed with 16 cores, each of which had two software 
threads. Rock used hardware-based dynamic parallelization of the 
instruction stream, and would have been the first processor to use 
transactional memory in hardware.</p>


<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">NY Times Releases Thesaurus to Linked Data Cloud, FOSS Data Converter</h3>

<p>At a keynote presentation at the 2009 Semantic Technology Conference,
in San Jose, California, staff from the <em>New York Times</em> made a 
significant announcement regarding use of the NYT Annotated Corpus and 
the NYT Index in the "Linked Data Cloud".</p>

<p>For nearly 100 years, the staff at the <em>New York Times</em> have
maintained a thesaurus for use with its content. The thesaurus consists
of more than a million terms organized into five controlled
vocabularies: subjects, personal names, organizations, geographic
locations, and the titles of creative works (books, movies, plays,
etc).</p>

<p>At the June Semantic Technology Conference, Rob Larson and Evan Sandhaus
announced their intention to publish the <em>New York Times</em>
thesaurus under a license that will allow the community to both use it
and contribute back to it. The results will, in time, prepare the <em>New
York Times</em> to enter the global linked data cloud, by releasing its
thesaurus in linked data format.</p>

<p>Releasing the <em>Times</em> thesaurus is consistent with their developing 
TimesOpen strategy. In a blog entry at the <em>Times's</em> "Open" site, 
Larson and Sandhaus wrote, "We want to facilitate access to slices of 
our data for those who want to include <em>Times</em> content in their 
applications. Our TimesTags API already makes available our most 
frequently used tags, the 27,000 that power our topics pages. But the 
new effort will go well beyond that. We plan to release hundreds of 
thousands of tags from the corpus back to 1980, and, later, in a second 
phase, hundreds of thousands more, going back to 1851."</p>

<p>Their plan is that user and Semantic Technology communities will begin 
to link the <em>NY Times</em> thesaurus to new and existing taxonomies, and 
eventually help standardize the use of those terms on the World Wide 
Web.</p>

<p>The specific license details remain to be worked out, but will be based 
on one or more existing open source licenses.</p>

<p>Also, in June, the <em>NY Times</em> released a PHP framework called 
NYT_Transformer.  This is a flexible open source data converter that 
can be customized for various input and output types.</p>

<p>NYT_Transformer accepts records from an input source, passes them 
through filters, and sends them to an output object. It can also 
perform further data manipulation, such as changing the data in the 
resulting records or discarding records based on criteria specified.  
It was originally developed to convert XML data for storage in a MySQL 
database. NYT_Transformer uses the Apache 2.0 license.</p>

<h2>Distro News</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">RHEL 5.4 Beta Now Available</h3>
<p>Early in July, Red Hat released the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.4 beta 
(kernel-2.6.18-155.el5), with versions for x86, x86/64, Itanium, IBM 
POWER, and System z. This RHEL beta release includes a variety of new 
features and capabilities, combined with enhancements in 
virtualization, storage/filesystems, security, and developer tools.</p>

<p>The most exciting new capability in the RHEL 5.4 beta is the 
incorporation of KVM-based virtualization, in addition to existing 
Xen-based virtualization. RHEL 5.4 provides the first 
commercial-strength implementation of KVM, which is developed as part 
of the upstream Linux kernel. Xen-based virtualization, of course, 
remains fully supported for the life of the RHEL 5 family. Red Hat 
also announced the availability of the beta release of the Red Hat 
Enterprise Virtualization portfolio, which includes Red Hat Enterprise 
Virtualization Manager for Servers, Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 
Manager for Desktops, and the standalone, KVM-based Red Hat Enterprise 
Virtualization Hypervisor.</p>

<p>An important feature of any RHEL update is that kernel and user APIs 
are unchanged, so that RHEL 5 applications do not need to be rebuilt 
or re-certified. This situation extends to virtualized environments: 
with a fully integrated hypervisor, the application binary interface 
(ABI) consistency offered by RHEL means that applications certified to 
run on RHEL on physical machines are also certified when run in 
virtual machines. The portfolio of thousands of certified applications 
for RHEL applies to both environments.</p>

<p>Here are some additional highlights:</p>

<h4>Virtualization Enhancements</h4>

<ul>
<li> KVM hypervisor;
<li> Hardware support (SRIOV, IOMMU, VT-d):<br />
With this release, Red Hat is introducing support for SRIOV 
(Single Root I/O for Virtualization). This feature aims to 
improve transaction throughput performance in virtual 
environments, by taking advantage of PCI cards that can be shared 
by multiple virtual machines at one time without creating a 
throughput bottleneck. These throughput improvements combine 
with previous CPU and memory performance enhancements to allow 
customers to further consolidate workloads to lower their costs. 
SRIOV works with either IOMMU or VT-d, in AMD and Intel platforms,
respectively;
<li> VDI SPICE protocol enablers:<br />
This software, unique to Red Hat, offers better response times 
for graphic/screen rendering by adaptively taking advantage of 
either client or host capabilities. This leads to better CPU 
usage, enabling improved VDI consolidation ratios, without 
the need for expensive special hardware;
<li> Libvirt:<br />
perl interface for libvirt (new);
<li> Kernel:<br />
Improved clock management when RHEL is deployed on a VMware 
platform.
</ul>

<h4>Storage/FileSystem</h4>

<ul>
<li> New Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) utilities for management 
of FC instances on Ethernet;<br />
<li> Clustered Samba (Technology Preview.)</p>
</ul>

<h4>Security</h4>

<ul>
<li> RHEL 5.4 is a FIPS-140 certification target.
</ul>
<h4>Developer/Sysadmin</h4>

<ul>
<li> Kernel tracepoints (Technology Preview), coupled with tracepoint 
support in SystemTap. This release provides user-space backtrace 
support, complementing kernel-space backtracing that was provided 
in previous releases. SystemTap provides a powerful, comprehensive 
performance troubleshooting tool;<br />
<li> New CIM support for DHCP services.
</ul>

<p>For full details on the new features in the RHEL 5.4 beta release, 
check the Release Notes, available at <a href="http://press.redhat.com/?s=itanium">http://press.redhat.com/?s=itanium</a>.</p>

<h2>Software and Product News</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">TopQuadrant Offers Free Semantic Web Modeling Tool</h3>
<p>TopQuadrant, a major player in Semantic Web application development 
technology, released TopBraid Composer Free Edition, a professional 
editing and querying tool for Semantic Web technology that allows 
users to view, share, and query RDF data. TopBraid Composer Free 
Edition is a starter version of TopBraid Composer, a leading 
commercial Semantic Web modeling tool.</p>

<p>Technical users can build enterprise-class semantic models, design and 
edit semantic queries, create semantic business rules, and share their 
creations with others for free. Users can also import RDFa markup used 
to publish machine-readable data on the Web. TopBraid Composer Free 
Edition simplifies the process of linking business logic to domain 
models by providing an object-oriented rule model. </p>

<p>"There is fast-growing interest from all industries to understand the 
unique data quality, data integration, and dynamic discovery benefits 
that Semantic Web technology has to offer," said Holger Knublauch, VP 
of product development at TopQuadrant. "But we recognize that 
unfamiliarity with W3C Semantic Web standards and cost are two 
obstacles prohibiting many organizations from starting a Semantic Web 
project. By offering a free version of our modeling environment, we 
are removing these barriers."  Knublauch is a co-creator of Owl, and 
joined TopQuadrant a few years ago.</p>

<p>TopBraid Composer Free Edition shortens the learning curve for 
starting Semantic Web projects by using Eclipse, a popular open source 
development environment that is familiar to a broad set of developers. 
In addition to support for W3C standards such as RDF, OWL, and SPARQL, 
TopBraid Composer Free Edition also includes SPIN (SPARQL Inferencing 
Notation), the first Semantic Web language with an explicit 
object-oriented rule model that can link business logic and domain 
models. SPIN eliminates the need to learn OWL to link RDF resources 
with associated queries or to reuse queries.</p>

<p>TopBraid Composer Free Edition offers all of the functionality needed 
to view, share and query RDF data in an enterprise-class Semantic Web 
project. Users can:</p>

<ul>
<li> Load, edit and save RDF files in RDF/XML, N3 and N-triple files;
<li> Define ontologies using form-based editors;
<li> Create and execute SPARQL queries;
<li> Create and execute SPIN rules;
<li> Import RDFa markup from Web pages.
</ul>

<p>NASA recently announced it is using TopBraid Suite 3.0 as a semantic 
application platform to model, organize, integrate, and exchange data 
within and across the multi-decade Constellation Program. NASA's use 
of TopBraid Suite is a significant commitment to using a semantic data 
architecture in the full "engineering-through-operations" lifecycle to 
achieve the Constellation Program's ambitious planetary exploration 
goals, which include manned travel to Mars.</p>

<p>More specifically, NASA will use TopBraid to develop and manage NExIOM 
- the NASA Exploration Initiatives Ontology models. NExIOM formalizes 
the way machines and people specify NASA Exploration systems, related 
work activities, and their interrelationships.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Keynote Releases New Monitoring Services</h3>
<p>At the Velocity 2009 conference in June, Keynote announced Keynote 
Transaction Perspective 9.0, a much enhanced version of the company's 
Web site monitoring service, for "Next Web" applications.</p>
 
<p>Umang Gupta, CEO of Keynote, announced the new SaaS-like solution in 
front of 600 people at the O'Reilly event.  A video of his short 
announcement and demo is available here: 
<a href="http://velocityconference.blip.tv/file/2280364">http://velocityconference.blip.tv/file/2280364</a>.</p>

<p>Transaction Perspective 9.0 includes new support for interactive Flash 
and Silverlight, composite Web transactions, and 3rd party online ad 
tracking.</p>

<p>In April, Keynote Systems introduced LoadPro 2.0, which enhanced its 
load-testing tools in support of user metrics or Quality of Experience 
(QoE). Keynote has already established strengths in QoE-related 
testing with a strong "human face," including insights into business 
competitiveness globally, as well as domain and consulting expertise 
in how consumers interact with Internet services.</p>

<p>EMA (<a href="http://www.enterprisemanagement.com/">http://www.enterprisemanagement.com/</a>), a leading market research 
analyst firm, wrote a very positive note on Keynote LoadPro 2.0.  The 
new version includes a new end user portal, an expansive overview 
dashboard, precise visibility into real time tests as they execute, 
and comprehensive enterprise-level account management. The new 
functionality is built on top of a dedicated load testing network that 
can deliver up to one million concurrent test users across multiple 
Internet backbones.

<p>Recent research from EMA in December, 2008, established that 79% of 
the 207 respondents view QoE as becoming more important to their 
business or organization. QoE demands a focus on the "human consumer" 
in all his or her complexities, rather than on more convenient, but 
far less relevant, component-centric technology metrics.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Sourcefire Releases Virtual Appliances for Physical and Virtual 
Environments</h3>

<p>Sourcefire, creator of Snort, announced Sourcefire 3D System 4.9, with 
the new Sourcefire Virtual 3D Sensor and Sourcefire Virtual Defense 
Center. These new virtual appliances enable users to deploy the 
company's security solutions within their virtual environments. 
Available during the second half of 2009, the Sourcefire 3D System 4.9 
also features the industry's first policy layering capabilities that 
deliver increased customization for large or multi-organizational 
networks, including cloud or virtual implementations.</p>

<p>As part of the Sourcefire 3D System 4.9, the new virtual appliances 
allow organizations to inspect traffic between virtual machines, while 
also making it easier to deploy and manage sensors at remote sites,
where resources may be limited. They also enable Managed Security 
Service Providers (MSSPs) and cloud computing companies to easily 
implement Sourcefire's leading security solutions for increased 
protection. MSSPs can configure multiple Virtual Defense Centers to 
support multiple customers from a single VMware server, increasing the 
efficiency of management efforts.</p>

<p>Users can deploy Virtual 3D Sensors on VMware ESX and ESXi platforms 
to inspect traffic between two or more virtual machines (VMs), while 
also using physical Sourcefire 3D Sensors to inspect traffic going 
into and out of a VMware virtual environment. Deployed as software 
running within VMs, the Virtual 3D Sensor also makes it easier for 
users to inspect traffic on remote segments of the network where local 
IT security resources may not exist (e.g., retail stores, remote 
offices) or where little rack space remains in the datacenter.</p>

<p>The Virtual 3D Sensor will provide simultaneous execution of 
Sourcefire IPS, RNA (Real-time Network Awareness) and RUA (Real-time 
User Awareness) functions. Customers can deploy the Virtual Defense 
Center to monitor any combination of up to 25 virtual or physical 3D 
Sensors. They can also opt to monitor their Virtual 3D Sensors from 
the same physical Defense Center they use to monitor their physical 3D 
Sensors.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Sourcefire 3D System v4.9 Will Be Available in
Second Half of 2009</h3>

<p>The new Version of VNC Enterprise provides cross-platform remote
printing. In June, RealVNC launched the latest version of its enterprise
VNC solution for remote desktop control. VNC Enterprise Edition 4.5 offers
fully cross-platform remote printing, enabling users to print documents
from the remote machine to the local default printer on the VNC Viewer.
Other new features include enhanced cross-platform chat, support for
international characters, and more robust performance.</p>
 
<p>Designed and built by the original inventors of VNC, VNC Enterprise 
Edition 4.5 has a wide range of applications - from desktop support and 
assistance in a business environment to delivering Linux and Unix 
applications to Windows or Mac users. Also, because it is designed 
specifically for the enterprise, it includes multiple configurable 
security mechanisms, and is backed up with full technical support and 
maintenance. </p>
 
<p>Cross-platform remote printing means that when a connection is made, 
documents printed by the remote computer running VNC Server will 
automatically default to the local printer attached to the computer 
running VNC Viewer.</p>
 
<p>VNC Enterprise Edition 4.5 also supports cross-platform chat, creating 
a quick and simple channel of communication between users, which can 
be initiated from either end. VNC Server can now notify users of 
incoming connections for added security.</p>
 
<p>VNC Enterprise Edition 4.5 includes tools for wide-scale distributed 
deployment, configuration, and management, and supports more operating 
systems than any other remote access software, including Windows NT 4, 
2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008, and Windows 7, along with 
Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, and AIX.</p>
 
<p>The cost of VNC Enterprise Edition 4.5 starts at $50 for a single 
VNC Server licence, with discounted volume pricing starting at three 
copies, quickly reducing the unit price. In addition, there are 
generous academic, governmental and non-profit discounts available on 
request.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">HP Ships Workstation with Dual 6-core 'Istanbul' Opteron CPUs</h3>

<p>HP is now outfitting AMD's six-core "Istanbul" Opteron processor into 
its high-end HP xw9400 workstation, aimed at 3-D digital content 
creation, and science and engineering applications.</p>

<p>HP officials say the troubled economy is putting pressure on 
businesses to quickly get a return on their IT investments, which the 
new AMD Opteron chips enable due to new virtualization, performance, 
and efficiency enhancements.  Each new Opteron chip has up to 34 
percent more performance per watt over AMD's previous quad-core 
processors. </p>

<p>The HP xw9400 workstation can seat two of the chips, for a total of 12 
cores.</p>

<p>HP also announced in June that of seven ProLiant G6 servers would be 
powered by new AMD six-core Opteron processors, which were officially 
released June 1.</p>

<p>Other Features Include:</p>

<ul>
<li> Enabling up to 4 3D displays, the HP xw9400 provides scalable 
visualization capability. Native PCIe x16 dual ports support 
high-end graphics and SLI-enablement. The 2 PCI-X 100 slots can be 
configured as a single PCI-X 133 slot to meet some Independent 
Hardware Vendors' (IHVs) requirements;<br />

<li> Large SCSI/SAS HDD capacity - The HP xw9400 offers 8 channel 
Serial Attached SCSI (SAS), the latest, highest performance disk 
subsystem. The 8 channels provide dedicated bandwidth to each SAS 
hard drive allowing for an optional external SAS connection to 
support external storage arrays, while still providing maximum 
internal storage capability;<br />

<li> With integrated SAS or SATA RAID controllers, the HP xw9400 provides

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Cisco Launches Linux WiFi Router with Media Sharing</h3>

<p>In June, Cisco announced a new Linux-powered router, a Linksys 
Wireless-N Router, model WRT160NL. The new model is essentially the 
next generation of the popular WRT54GL.</p>

<p>The design of the product is similar to other Linksys/Cisco N-routers, 
but has integrated connectors for external antennae. Consumers that 
prefer external aerials can enjoy the new router design because of the 
integrated R-SMA antenna connectors. The integrated Storage Link 
functionality lets consumers connect their USB storage device to the 
router to create a powerful media sharing solution for video, photo, 
and music sharing through the integrated media server. </p>

<p>"In the past we have had many successful Linux powered devices, with 
the WRT54GL and NSLU2 being great examples. The WRT160NL is the 
logical next step combining Linux, 802.11n technology, and USB storage 
functionality. We see the WRT160NL as a possible successor of our 
WRT54GL as the market transitions to 802.11n," said Aaron Marinari, 
senior product manager, Cisco Consumer Business Group.</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<li> The Storage Link port lets users connect USB storage devices to the 
router. The media server can stream to PCs orUPnP AV digital media 
adapters and supports FAT16, FAT32 and NTFS file systems.<br />
<li> Although most Linksys routers feature internal antennae, the 
WRT160NL also has external antennae to be more flexible in antennae 
choice and placement.<br />
<li> The new packaging provides a 40% reduction in waste materials and 
is made from 80% recycled content.</ul>

<p>The WRT160NL has a 400Mhz processor, 8 Megabytes of Flash memory, and 
32 Megabytes of DDRAM.  It will retail for $119.99.</p>
