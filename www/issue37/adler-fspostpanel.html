One of the post panel discussion group. This shot was taken just
before I got to talk to Richard for the first time. Richard is on the
left. I don't know who the guy in the green shirt is. The woman in the
black leather jacket was the British reporter who was trying *very
hard* to get some private time with Richard to do an interview and the
guy with the tie is one of the "establishment" guys. He's the one to
which Richard said "I'm going to work as hard as I can to DEFEAT YOU!".
