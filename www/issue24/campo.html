<H2>My Linux Revolution </H2>

<P> <HR> <P>  
For a long time, I  lived in my  cave, doing my thing.  One day, I got
out of my nice,  very functional cave and  saw that my fellow  man had
built a house just outside. It had all the same functions that my cave
had but was much comfortable and livable (for  one, you didn't have to
push a boulder to close the door every night). 
<p>
Many years later, I got Linux installed on my personal computer, doing
my thing. One day, surfing the net, I saw  my fellow man programming a
new version of  Linux, which had a great  user interface, was  easy to
install  and possessed much more new  added  features. For a long time
user of  Linux on an i386 like  me all Linux  was good for was routing
packets. This was a shock. 
<p>
Of course, the new user interface I am talking about is called the KDE
project, which  along with the  new Red Hat  distribution version 5.0,
the very active www.linux.org site and the many applications available
form   an  incredible  package.  To  my    great astonishment,   Linux
development is in full acceleration and is  starting to be viewed as a
real contender  to  Microsoft Windows  NT.  Not too  long ago,  people
installing Linux  on a  computer  where viewed  as computer  gurus, or
mystic "roots". With the arrival of  user friendliness, the question I
ask myself is: Is Linux  going to become an  operating system for  the
general public? 
<p>
Some people will feel bad  of loosing the  respect  of being the  only
ones able to install Linux in their social group.  As opposed to them,
I welcome this new age. I can't wait  to install Linux at my grandma's
place.  The operating system of  the people will  finally come back to
the people. 
<p>
This will, however  change  many things. If less  technically inclined
people jump on   the Linux wagon, new   demands will be  generated for
easier-to-use  software and better support and  help files. My grandma
will  ask  for drag-and-drop support   and  very large fonts. The  new
people on the  wagon will  not be of   much help in moving it  forward
(have you ever seen your grandma code lately?). Still, they will bring
new respect to the OS, and, well, why not, perhaps new ideas. 
<p>
Some time ago,  word from "Santa Cruz" was  that we had to upgrade out
of Linux. This of course was funny and  it highlighted the maturity of
Linux. Not only  that Linux  is free   but it compares  better (on  my
scorecard)  to  almost any other    operating system. And  unlike some
"other" operating system,   Linux is soon  to become  a general public
operating system (hello grandma!). 
<p>
So,  I finally decided I was  going to move out  of my cave and into I
much more respectable house. But the most important thing of it all, I
must start keeping  track of  the  developments and  start pushing the
wagon myself. By the way, Linux makes a great Christmas gift!
