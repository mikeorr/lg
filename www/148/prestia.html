<strong>Joey's Notes</strong> is a new column by Joey
Prestia, intended to introduce Linux users to basic and essential Linux
tasks and skills. Joey's current work toward a degree in Linux
networking, his daily experiences as a member of the RedHat Academy staff
on campus, and his knowledge as a programmer in a number of languages
provide him with an excellent list of qualifications for this task, and we
hope that our readers will benefit from his expertise and enjoy these fun
articles.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Information on Logical Volume configuration is somewhat sparse - at least
if you want to use the command line. There is a Logical Volume Manager tool
on RHEL 5, but it requires a GUI - and most servers only provide a console
interface. I tried to find a quick start guide for the CLI (command line
interface) and came up with nothing, so I wrote this little guide to help
people like me gain a quick insight into the basics.
</p> 

<p>
The hardest part about creating Logical Volumes is knowing which one must
be created first; from that point on it's pretty straightforward. First, we
have to create Physical Volumes on our hard disk; then, based on those
Physical Volumes, we will create our Volume Groups; and finally, we'll set
up our Logical Volumes. Let's start with a hard drive that's unpartitioned
- say, one that we just added to our system. Start up <code>fdisk -l</code>
to see how the device was assigned (we'll use '/dev/sdb' in this example.)
While in <code>fdisk</code>, create 2 partitions of the same size (500M),
then make sure to set their type to '8e' (LVM).
</p> 

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# fdisk /dev/sdb

Disk /dev/sdb: 120.0 GB, 120034123776 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 14593 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sdb1               1         200     1020096   8e  Linux LVM
/dev/sdb2             201         400     1020096   8e  Linux LVM
</pre> 

<p>
Write your changes and exit 'fdisk', then use the 'partprobe' command to
re-read the partition table.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# partprobe
</pre>

<p>
Now that we have re-read the partition table, we can get on with the actual
creation of the Physical Volumes on our hard disk partitions - the ones
that we tagged as Linux LVM while in 'fdisk'. We'll use 'pvcreate' for this
task. We can also specify both hard disk partitions on one line; 'pvcreate'
doesn't mind.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# pvcreate /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb2
	Physical volume "/dev/sdb1" sucessfully created
	Physical volume "/dev/sdb2" sucessfully created
</pre>

<p>
Ok, now we have two Physical Volumes, and we can create Volume Groups from
these. We'll use the 'vgcreate' command to do this, and this time we'll
specify a name for the volume group that we are creating. We'll use just
one partition, and reserve the other for later.
</p> 

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# vgcreate VolumeGroup_1 /dev/sdb1
	Volume group "VolumeGroup_1" successfully created
</pre>

<p>
So far, so good. Let's get a look at the stats on this Volume Group - we'll
use 'vgdisplay'. We need to pay close attention to the sections labeled 'VG
Size' and 'Total PE'. PE is the number of <em>physical extents</em> that we
have available. We want to avoid ever running out of physical extents,
because that would prevent us from being able to resize our LVMs -
something we'll be doing a little later.
</p>

<pre class="code">
 [root@localhost ~]# vgdisplay
    --- Volume group ---
  VG Name           	 	  	 VolumeGroup_1
  System ID             
  Format               			 lvm2
  Metadata Areas       	 		 1
  Metadata Sequence No 	 		 1
  VG Access            			 read/write
  VG Status            			 resizable
  MAX LV             			 0
  Cur LV               			 0
  Open LV               		 0	
  Max PV                		 0
  Cur PV                		 1
  Act PV                		 1
  VG Size               		 476.00 MB
  PE Size               		 4.00 MB
  Total PE              		 119
  Alloc PE / Size       		 0 / 0
  Free  PE / Size       		 119 / 476.00 MB
  VG UUID                  	     BCkPP1-2CM1-1hxW-7B2J-yfSt-mEMJ-7fMwNL
</pre>
  
<p>
This says that we've done everything correctly; it also tells us the number
of physical extents we have. In this case, it's 119 - and we'll need 5%-12%
of our available physical extents to perform resizing operations on LVMs.
</p>

<p>
Okay, then - let's create a Logical Volume out of this Volume Group so we
can put a file system on it.  We'll be using - you guessed it - the
'lvcreate' command. It's similar to 'vgcreate', but we must specify more
details on the command line to set things up correctly. The switches we
will be using are '-l' to specify the number of extents to utilize and '-n'
to assign a name to our logical volume. We will also have to specify it by
'/dev/VolumeGroup_1' now rather than the physical designation (/dev/sdb1)
as before.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# lvcreate -l 50 -n LogicalVolume_1 /dev/VolumeGroup_1 
	Logical volume "LogicalVolume_1"  created
</pre>

<p>
We have used 50 extents in this example, so about 200 MB worth of actual
file system can be used on it. Run 'lvdisplay' to see the results. Now,
let's put a file system on it so we can mount it and put it to use.
</p> 
 
<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# mkfs.ext3 /dev/VolumeGroup_1/LogicalVolume_1
</pre>

<p>
Let's label it as '/data':
</p> 

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# e2label /dev/VolumeGroup_1/LogicalVolume_1 /data
</pre>

<p>
Now, we'll make a '/data' directory and mount our Logical Volume on it.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# mkdir /data
[root@localhost ~]# mount /dev/VolumeGroup_1/LogicalVolume_1 /data 
[root@localhost ~]# ls /data 
lost+found
</pre>

<p>
Let's use that new space up so we can really see what all this logical
volume resizing stuff is about:
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# cd /data
[root@localhost data]# dd if=/dev/zero of=crap bs=1000k  count=190
190+0 records in 
190+0 records out
194560000 bytes (195 MB) copied, 16.2202 seconds, 12.0 MB/s
</pre>

<p>
That should push us to the limit of room on that logical volume. You can
see this via 'df -h':
</p> 

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost data]# df -h 
Filesystem            Size    Used   Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda8             965M    302M   614M   33%      /
/dev/sda1              99M    5.9M    88M    7%      /boot
tmpfs                 629M       0   629M    0%      /dev/shm
/dev/sda7             965M    618M   298M   68%      /home
/dev/sda5             9.5G    3.1G   6.0G   34%      /usr
/dev/sda2              19G    8.6G   9.5G   48%      /var
/dev/mapper/VolumeGroup_1-LogicalVolume_1 
                      194M    192M      0  100%      /data
</pre>

<p>
First, let's increase our size a little. A simple way to do this is 'lvresize':
</p> 

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost data]# lvresize -l 100 /dev/VolumeGroup_1/LogicalVolume_1
	Extending logical volume LogicalVolume_1 to 400.00 MB
	Logical volume Log_1 successfully resized
</pre>

<p>
Now this looks good - but we still can't utilize the added room. You must
first extend the file system onto the newly added area - remember, it's
still kinda "raw". We can do this by using 'resize2fs'. The file system can
be mounted while this is done, but I would recommend stopping all
filesystem activity on this partition while this is being performed. If you
have critical data on this partition, you will want to actually unmount it
before resizing. I did a 'live' resize in this example because our
partition does not contain any critical data.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost data]# resize2fs /dev/VolumeGroup_1/LogicalVolume_1 
resize2fs 1.39 (29-May-2006)
Filesystem at /dev/VolumeGroup_1/LogicalVolume_1 is mounted on /data; on-line resizing required
Performing an on-line resize of /dev/VolumeGroup_1/LogicalVolume_1 to 409600 (1k) blocks 
The filesystem on /dev/VolumeGroup_1/LogicalVolume_1 is now 409600 blocks long.

[root@localhost data]# df -h
Filesystem            Size    Used   Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda8             965M    302M   614M   33%      /
/dev/sda1              99M    5.9M    88M    7%      /boot
tmpfs                 629M       0   629M    0%      /dev/shm
/dev/sda7             965M    618M   298M   68%      /home
/dev/sda5             9.5G    3.1G   6.0G   34%      /usr
/dev/sda2              19G    8.6G   9.5G   48%      /var
/dev/mapper/VolumeGroup_1-LogicalVolume_1 
                      388M    193M   175M   53%      /data
</pre>

<p>
As a last exercise, we'll add the other physical volume to this one. Let's
assume that we need to add some more room to that logical volume; since we
have a physical volume left over (/dev/sdb2), that's what we'll use. For
this operation, we'll need the 'vgextend' and 'lvextend' commands. We'll
need to remember the order in which we created them: Physical first, then
the Volume group, and Logical Volume last of all. This order is very
important, and is reversed for the removal of these logical devices.
Here, we add the '/dev/sda2' physical volume area to our volume group
VolumeGroup_1:
</p>  
 
<pre class="code">
[root@localhost data]# vgextend /dev/VolumeGroup_1 /dev/sdb2
	Volume group "VolumeGroup_1" successfully extended

[root@localhost data]# vgdisplay 
    --- Volume group ---
  VG Name           	 	  	 VolumeGroup_1
  System ID             
  Format               			 lvm2
  Metadata Areas       	 		 2
  Metadata Sequence No 	 		 4
  VG Access            			 read/write
  VG Status            			 resizable
  MAX LV             			 0
  Cur LV               			 1
  Open LV               		 1	
  Max PV                		 0
  Cur PV               			 2
  Act PV                		 2
  VG Size               		 952.00 MB
  PE Size               		 4.00 MB
  Total PE              		 238
  Alloc PE / Size       		 100  / 400.00 MB
  Free  PE / Size       		 138  / 552.00 MB
  VG UUID                        BCkPP1-2CM1-1hxW-7B2J-yfSt-mEMJ-7fMwNL
</pre>
  
<p>
That's it; we've created Physical Volumes, Volume Groups, and Logical
Volumes and resized them. There's a lot more that can be done to and with
these; I would recommend lots of practice before doing anything involving
critical data and making sure you have a backup/snapshot of your data.

<p>
Joey was born in Phoenix and started programming at the age fourteen on
 a Timex Sinclair 1000. He was driven by hopes he might be able to do
 something with this early model computer. He soon became proficient in
 the BASIC and Assembly programming languages. Joey became a programmer
 in 1990 and added COBOL, Fortran, and Pascal to his repertoire of
 programming languages. Since then has become obsessed with just about
 every aspect of computer science. He became enlightened and discovered
 RedHat Linux in 2002 when someone gave him RedHat version six. This 
 started off a new passion centered around Linux. Currently Joey is 
 completing his degree in Linux Networking and working on campus
 for the college's RedHat Academy in Arizona. He is also on the staff of
 the Linux Gazette as the Mirror Coordinator.
