Introduction: What's the Point?</A>
</H1>

<P>
Linux users are a notorious bunch. We tend to be vociferous OS
	bigots of the first order.  This is a trait that has served
	the software community well. After all, if we were not that
	way we would never have put the time and effort into
	developing, deploying, and supporting the thing.  But it also
	a trait that has drawbacks.  Some of these drawbacks are
	serious, and effect our ability to present Linux as a serious
	alternative to other, more prominent OS's (using the term, in
	many cases, very loosely).

<P>
I'm not going to try to present the Linux alternative in
	anything but a fair and honest way.  That means I'm not going
	to be talking about the possibility of loosing your job for
	choosing Linux -- after all, that is not a problem that is
	unique or limited to any one OS. The fact is that when you
	choose the wrong tool for mission critical applications, you
	should be called to task for that choice.  This is regardless
	of the OS's involved.  Likewise I will not clamor on that
	Linux is the one, true solution to all problems. Such a
	statement, however much I'd like it to be so, is just as
	foolish.  

<P>
But, I wish to be clear that I will not have many good things
	to say about those other OS's. For the most part they are
	deserving of their poor reputations and of the scorn of any
	true Linux afficionado.  Still, there are better and worse
	ways of promoting the <EM>Nearly</EM> One True OS that is Linux.
	In this paper I would like to discuss some of those options.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
A Conversion Story?</A>
</H1>

<P>
A few weeks ago I helped a friend (we'll call him Mike, being
	that that is his name and I could care less about his
	anonymity) install Red Hat 5.0 on his system.  I made certain
	that all the configuration files were properly tweaked for his
	particular computer.  I installed KDE, and made KDM the
	default login method.  I set up his networking, making sure
	that it handled everything seamlessly in the background.  Then
	I showed him where the docs, howto's, mini-howto's and the
	like were located.  I spent time with him making sure he knew
	how to use info, find, grep, ps, which, apropos and the man
	pages.  After a few hours of work and teaching, I went my
	happy way convinced that another conversion to the Linux way
	(tm) had taken place. After all, Mike hated Windows and had
	had nothing but problems with both 95 and NT.

<P>
But the next week when I stopped over, I found my friend was
	back to running Windows 95, unhappy as ever about his daily
	crashes and computer problems.  It is important to understand
	that Mike isn't some <EM>luser</EM>; rather, he is a
	sophisticated computer professional with substantial computer
	knowledge.  He has been a consulting parter with me for major
	corporations, and has worked on developing a number of expert
	systems.  He knows his stuff very well.  So why, then, did
	Mike fail to embrace the Linux alternative?

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">
Why Linux Didn't Work</A>
</H1>

<P>
The answer, unfortunately, is one we advocates hear all the
	time.  The new user of the Linux system finds that the
	learning curve is too steep to be manageable.  Like many other
	people, Mike has a real life - he has a job, a girlfriend,
	various projects and hobbies, and he can not spend all his free
	time learning a new way of being productive.  Moreover, he
	can't afford to devote the days or even weeks it might take
	him to learn how to administer a system so that he can
	accomplish even simple tasks.  He needs to be productive
	today, and tomorrow, at the same rate he was yesterday.
	Because Mike is already familiar with the system and
	applications on the windows box, and not with those on Linux,
	he could not afford to switch. When the initial learning curve
	is so steep getting to be equally productive when moving from
	another OS to Linux can be daunting.  This is even more true
	if one is an expert user on the non-Linux machine.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00041000000000000000">
What Learning Curve?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Many <EM>OS Bigots</EM> (myself included on my more polemical days)
	will counter that it is simply untrue that it takes that long
	to learn a new system.  Or we'll simply deny that Linux is
	really all that complicated.  Instead of recognizing any
	validity in the statements made by the complainants, we
	attempt to invalidate the complaint by suggesting that the
	person in question must be a <EM>luser</EM> instead of a <EM>user</EM>.
	``I learned Unix in a couple of hours,'' or ``Heck, just pick
	up <U>Unix Unleashed</U> and read it,'' are statements that carry
	the implication that the person being addressed is somehow not
	as competent as the speaker.

<P>
This approach does more damage to the Linux (and Unix)
	community than many people realize.  We have good solutions to
	many problems, but if we aren't willing to take the people who
	need those solutions seriously, we will not be heard.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00050000000000000000">
The Problem and Three Solutions:</A>
</H1>

<P>
So, the question arises, ``How do we Linux users, developers,
	and advocates help those with limited time for learning new
	systems make the switch?''  There are several answers to this
	question, but they almost all fall into three categories.  I
	call these categories the <EM>OS/2 revisited approach</EM>, the
	<EM>suck it up approach</EM>, and the <EM>delayed skill
	transfer approach</EM>.  What are these methods? Glad you asked!

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00051000000000000000">
Big Blue, Round Two</A>
</H2>

<P>
The first, the <EM>OS/2 revisited approach</EM>, consists of
	making windows available on or under the new OS.  IBM had
	moderate success in getting dissatisfied users to switch to
	their products by providing a technically superior system that
	managed to provide the user with their favorite windows
	applications.  Linux has a number of programs and libraries
	available that help with this approach.  DOSEMU, the TWIN
	library, WINE, WABI, and others are all efforts to provide the
	user with access to his favorite MS products.

<P>
This approach has some big dividends. The user is able to
	transfer many of his or her skills immediately.  There is
	little trepidation in wondering how to do word processing on
	the very same word-processor you've been using for the last 2
	years.  There is far less worry about being able to get your
	work done when you don't have to worry about finding and
	learning new applications in order to accomplish your normal
	tasks.

<P>
However, this approach does have some problems. Today, the
	most obvious is that windows95 apps are not nearly as portable
	to Linux emulation as are the older 3.x apps.  This means that
	many users are not able to bring over their favorite
	applications any more.  Rather, the user needs to find and
	obtain an outdated version of his or her favorite product. The
	user then will need to worry about reformatting old data and
	projects to use the older program, as well as concerning
	themselves with being able to share their data seamlessly with
	coworkers.

<P>
Another major drawback with this approach, as IBM found out,
	is that the users are not encouraged to explore the power of
	the underlying OS.  ``A better memory manager for windows'' is
	not what Linux is about. It is not what it does best. And,
	like OS/2, eventually users who use it for that purpose will
	realize that the increased complexity doesn't pay out any real
	dividends.  The reason OS/2 failed (regardless of what the
	various OS/2 pundits say, it is dead) is the same reason these
	various projects will never really be the answer to Linux
	advocacy.  They don't really solve the problem of getting
	users up on the new OS.  All they do is offer a false sense of
	security at a cost of complexity and a lack of compatibility
	with state-of-the-art Windows environments (if there is such a
	thing.)  

<P>
The trend to develop Windows95-like applications such as
	StarOffice on Unix platforms seems to be an extension of this
	methodology. Instead of embracing the tenants of ``small is
	beautiful'' and ``make each program do one thing well,'' these
	development efforts are aimed at reproducing the Suite on Unix.
	The advantage of this, is, of course, that it is what managers
	expect to find on their computers.  The disadvantage is that
	the ``Office Suite,'' in all it's ugly, bloated, glory is now
	nestled into the Unix culture.  Most true devotee's of Unix
	will likely dismiss these suites as being against the Unix
	grain.  Still, they present a way to move reluctant Windows95
	people into the Unix world.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00052000000000000000">
OK, Take A Deep Breath!</A>
</H2>

<P>
The <EM>suck it up approach</EM>, also known as the <EM>sink
	or swim</EM> method can and does work.  I, for example, simply
	reformatted my hard-drive one day, and never looked back.
	However, for most people in real-life business environments,
	this isn't possible.  Unlike most people, I really did have
	lots of time to explore my system, and being in graduate
	school, I had few applications I really needed to run.
	``Mission Critical'' doesn't apply to most people in master's
	programs.  Like the example of Mike, above, the real user
	just doesn't have the time to waste on learning how to be
	productive all over again.  Still, for some users, it can
	work.  The key is having good teachers who are also good
	system administrators on hand to help the user along.  Had I
	been willing to visit Mike on a daily basis to hand hold
	while he got up to speed, he would probably be running on Red
	Hat instead of Redmond. 

<P>
The advantage to this method is that it doesn't rely on a
	sense of security.  Unlike <EM>OS/2 revisited</EM>, the
	<EM>suck it up'ers</EM> have to dive into the system, they have
	to tackle the learning curve, and with good teachers it can
	happen fairly quickly.  Most people can learn the basics of
	Emacs, LaTeX, Unix shells and command lines, and the various
	other Unix tools and tricks in a week or less.  While there
	may still be some touch and go moments when problems with
	system administration raise their ugly head, for the most
	part, after some intensive training and a few moments of
	butterflies in the stomach, the person can manage to get
	along.

<P>
The problem with this approach is, of course, that it takes a
	leap of faith, that most people are very leery of making.
	And, I might add, they are right to be leery of doing it this
	way.  Some people simply won't get the new way no matter how
	patient you are, because they will be stressing out over some
	project that they are working on. Others, because of various
	concerns about being able to get the job done, simply won't
	leave the tried and true - no matter how obvious it is that
	it is really tried and found wanting. Let's face it, most
	people are nervous about the unknown, and moving to Linux is
	the unknown for someone whose only computer experience is MS
	or Mac based.  Here again, the aforementioned Office-ish
	suites can come in very handy. While rarely the best tool for
	any one job, they can be used to make the <EM>suck it up'er</EM>
	more comfortable in his or her new environment.

<P>
It is important to realize that there is always the
	occasional person whose task still can not be adequately
	completed under Linux.  There are specialty apps which require
	MS or Mac products to run.  For these people, leaping before
	looking, long and hard, can be disastrous.  And, we gurus
	need to be aware that one story from such a person on
	newsgroups and mailing lists goes as far as ten stories of
	positive experiences.  Trying to coerce most people into the
	<EM>suck it up</EM> method is just asking for trouble.  You risk
	your credibility about OS matters on your ability to teach and
	support someone in learning a new environment.  This is a
	gamble that most likely won't pay off often enough to be worth
	the risk.  Our most powerful weapon in the Linux community has
	always been our honesty and integrity when it comes to the
	products we advocate.  To push someone to use a system they
	are not ready for can have deleterious effects on that
	reputation.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00053000000000000000">
Putting one foot in front of the other</A>
</H2>

<P>
This brings us to the last method - the <EM>delayed skill
	transfer approach</EM>.  What is this? It's simple -- give
	Windows, NT and Mac users Unix tools to use on their current
	projects!  Simple, huh?  The problem is, in our zest to push
	the Linux point of view on people, we often forget that we can
	give some demonstration of the power of the Unix way which is
	utterly non-threatening to new users.  By replacing the
	command windows prompt with bash, by changing dir to ls,
	by adding ghostview, ghostscript, emacs, perl, LaTeX and other
	tools to the Windows environment, we allow for users to
	develop their skills and confidence in Unix methods without
	compromising their ability to currently work.  

<P>
While this method may take longer to get any particular user
	up and running in a completely Linux-only environment, it also
	offers the most benefits with the fewest drawbacks.  The
	benefits of the <EM>OS/2 revisited</EM> method, namely that of
	having tools that you are comfortable with, is realized
	without the deficit of having to rely on out-dated versions
	or be worried about underlying complexities.  The drawbacks of
	the <EM>suck it up</EM> approach are avoided as the users are
	given plenty of time to become familiar with the new tools in
	an environment that doesn't endanger any current projects.
	Thus the users are less stressed and more open to trying new
	things, for the new things don't entail the need to be
	concerned about not being able to accomplish critical tasks. 

<P>
Further, after a few weeks or months, those ``mission critical''
	tasks are now being accomplished on Unix tools that have been
	ported to the user's (soon to be formerly) favorite
	platform. Thus, when the switch over to Linux comes, the user
	no longer has to learn two new things - how to be productive
	and how to system manage. Instead, they are instantly
	productive and can learn the underlying system at their
	leisure.  More often than not they will come to want the extra
	functionality of things like named pipes, IPC, and other Unix
	niceties that are unavailable in their scaled down ports. 

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00060000000000000000">
Why it isn't happening?</A>
</H1>

<P>
While this seems to be a fairly obvious method of helping
	users move to Unix environments it seems to be one of the
	least attempted. There are a few reasons for this. 

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Advocates tend to be very strong in their opinion that
	windows=bad, Unix=good.  They are not particularly willing to
	compromise their ideals for what seems like limited gains.
<LI>Advocates tend towards seeing the computing market as a
	battleground of sorts where Unix is pitted against the ``evil
	empire.'' Anything that doesn't seem like a direct attack upon
	Microsoft can be seen as an act of near treason. 
<LI>Linux users tend to spend lots of time under Linux,
	they are a bit out of touch with the windows world. As a
	result, they may not be aware of that neat new port of Bash as
	the command shell under 95, or that perl can run (and do some
	neat registry tricks too!) 
</UL>

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00070000000000000000">
Conclusion</A>
</H1>

<P>
The point of all this is that there is more than one way to
	skin a cat (or in the case of Gates-ware, a weasel).  Linux
	advocacy can, and should, take forms that are appropriate to
	the particular situation of a particular user.  A student in
	a computer science program with lots of free-time probably
	should opt for the <EM>suck it up</EM> approach.  A person with
	plenty of support from a local administrator and plenty of
	legacy apps might benefit greatly from the <EM>OS/2
	revisited method</EM>. And, most importantly, we can't forget that
	promoting Unix tools under other OS's is a form of advocacy.
	More importantly, in an environment where mission critical
	apps and projects abound, it may be the most effective form of
	advocacy.  Keep up with available ports of your favorite Unix
	tools under other systems, and you can increase your
	conversion success rate!
