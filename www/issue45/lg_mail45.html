<BR>Subject: Article idea

<P> Hi this is Marius.

<P> I think a very good article could be made about
PostgreSQL. One which wouldn't repeat what's in
the HOWTO, but present how to use it on the web, some 
interfaces to it ( like Java, Php3, Perl, ... ), with 
advantages/disadvantages, links to good sites for newcomers etc.

<P> I used to developed some Visual FoxPro applications, but I'd like
something more powerful ( and free ) for use over TCP/IP.
I've read the web section in the HOWTO but I don't have the
time to get the tools described there ( must learn for getting
admitted in university ).

<P> Thank you,
Marius

useable...

<BR>Subject: I have a question


I hope you don't mind this question, but I am a newbie at Linux Red Hat 5.2
and I am trying to find out what is a mount point and how do I define it
during installation?  T

<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>
	<P> A mount point is an empty directory upon which another disk
	partition is (or will be) mounted.  When mounted, it creates the
	illusion that the entire partition is inside that directory.  This is
	how UNIX handles multiple partitions, different from the C: D: E: drive
	letters that Dos/Windows uses.

	<P> I use Debian, so I'm not very familiar with Red Hat's installation
	program.  I believe the partitioning dialog (Disk Druid?) has a column
	where you define the mount point for each partition, and it
	automatically creates directories as needed.

	<P> Later, you'll use mount points to access floppy disks, CD-ROMs,
	network filesystems, etc, the same way.  The "mount" and "umount"
	commands (or an equivalent GUI dialog) open and close access to these
	devices, through the mount point directory. -Ed.

<P> I have been using Linux from the early days when Slackware and Debian where
the kings. I have always had a dislike for Windows 3.1 straight through to Win
98; but the one thing Windows has is some great software from great vendors
Like Macromedia. I switch from Windows to Linux just to use programs like
Flash, DreamWeaver, QuarkXpress, as well as small programs like Rio GUI,
ReBirth, etc. When can we see these programs ported to Linux? Are there any
rumors of companies trying to port se to Linux? Is there a competant Emulator
available that can run these programs without a problem? I now use Linux as my
OS of choice. It dominates my HD and I use nothing else; but I do miss some of
the great WYSIWYG HTML Editors and Flash etc...Oh well guess I will have to
make do with what I got.  The other thing is that I just purchased a laptop and
before it is delivered is there anything I should know about installing Linux
on my Laptop with minimal casulties? How should I go about installation? What
about video, sound, etc...?

<BR>Subject: A Request for Assistance 

<P> When I first read of Linux in a catalog, I had hopes that it would be my 
personal ticket out of Microsoft's sticky hands.  I had hoped it would be 
analogous to a modern DOS or something like that.  I would typify myself as 
an expert in pre-Windows DOS and as passable in post-Windows DOS.  

<P> Well, frankly, I hardly understand many of the words.  Right away I knew I
had made a mistake.  This Linux is for computer jocks and developers of the
first magnitude.

<P> My question for you is, "Am I right?"  Have I stepped through the 
looking-glass of computer literacy into the wonderland of the developmental 
dervish?  There could be one other explanation -- I jumped into the middle of 
the story when I should have begun at the beginning.  Is there a beginning 
for the computer literate person -- where terms are defined, examples are 
given, teachers are patient and I can begin to gradually "wean" myself from 
Mother Windows?

<P> Recently I noticed that, most every time, my niece used her Win 95

my Linux masq box.  Most of them  were from dalnet.somthing.or .other.  So
I sent email to several of them asking why they were trying to telnet to
my box.  Here's the reply that I got from one:

at 2 am because my niece wanted to use irc.  I don't like  anyone trying

port scanned  a few times  with my previous IP.)  I just wrote a new log
script that will skip the alarm if the in.telnetd attempt is from a "know"

<P> hi.  This is seyong from Korea.  

<P> I have so many users above 60,000,
and now i have to make them the shell id.

<P> can you tell me the way to adduser by cgi-script?
i will be waiting and waiting for your reply.

<P> if you can't, i'm so thank you.

<P> my website is http://www.ultari.com (now under construction because of the
+cgi-script).

	Hi, Seyong.  This will be published in the September Linux Gazette on
	August 31.
	
	<P> Just to make sure I understand your question:
	You want a form and a CGI script that runs the "adduser" command?
	
	<P> I do not know of any.  There are Linux products which allow central
	administration of a network, and some of them have web interfaces, but
	I do not know the names of the products.
	
	<P> You can of course write a CGI script yourself which runs adduser,
	or hire a programmer to do this.  But allowing a CGI script to run as
	root (which it would have to, to have permission to run adduser) is a
	potential security nightmare.  Be sure the program analyses its input
	very carefully before passing it on to "adduser".

<P> hi, this is seyong han.
i'm so thanks for your replying.
i want to adduser by web interface.
the program will run as root mode.
i made an java application to run the cgi.
it will run as root mode.
so i want the cgi program it get id and password and then add user to

<P> Hi ti everybody.

<P> I would ask some help on a problem recently occourred to me during an
upgrade of my system. I ran SuSe 5.3 very smoothly until I decide to
upgrade it to rev. 6, with kernel 2.2.1.
then I have encountered two problems : 1) I'm not anymore able to print,
except using the copy command to the printer. The aps filter is configured
for my printer (a HP Dj 550c); the lpr command doesn't "exist".  2) no
sound .....

<P> Does anybody know a good "rule of thumb" to avoid these kind of problems
when performing an upgrade ?

<P> Thanks to everybody

<BR>Subject: Color depth 8/16 and Xlib

<P> Hi everybody,

<P> I am not sure this is the right forum, but if anyone can give me
some hints to solve the problem or give an alternative FAQ-site it
would be utmost appreciated.

<P> I have written a number of Xwindow applications for special purposes.
They do all run without any problems if the Xserver is configured for
a color depth of 8. Actually those applications do not need many color-
map entries (less than 10). However, for other applications like xv
and netscape a color depth of 16 is preferred. There are no problem to
run eg. xv and netscape with a depth of 16 (I guess they set up their
own colormap). But if in depth 16 then my own applications can't set up
its color entries. The idea is to be able to run simultaneously both my
own applications and applications like xv,netscape with a reasonable color
resolution.

<P> To set up my colors I basically do:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
	screen=3DDefaultScreen(display);
	   colormap=3DDefaultColormap(display,screen);

	XLookupColor(diplay,colormap,"color",exact_color,screen_color);
	</PRE>
	or alternatively
	<PRE>
	XAllocNamedColor(.....);
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> When in depth 16 both XLookupColor and XAllocNamedColor both raises
the Xerror: BadValue (parameter out of range) ... something like this.
I don't know which parameter causing it and apart from display it must
be colormap or "color". It is hardly "color" and if so it must be the
colormap. I have checked the "visual" on colormap and it seems OK.
I have also tried XCreateColormap(...) and other "give it a chance"
methods but I am stuck.

<P> So, please, anyone having an idea, let me know.

<P> With my best regards.

<P> Hans.

--color") and as I've done on each of the other Linux boxes. An ls command
produced a colored display with every user except one! I've tried adding an ls
alias to that user's own .bashrc file but nothing helps. If I type "ls --color"
as that user, I get color! Without it, black and white. What might be going on
and what should I look for?

<BR>Subject: DNS for home network

<P> I just wanted to drop a quick note of thanks for the article: "DNS for the
Home Network" in the August 1999 (Issue 44) issue of the Linux Gazette.  I
had tried on several occasions to setup bind on my home Linux server only to
become frustrated and give up after hours of work.  Well thanks to your
succinct and accurate article my home DNS server is working great now for a
few hours!

<P> Mark Moran
