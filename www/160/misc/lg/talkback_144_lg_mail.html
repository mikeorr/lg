Subject: Regarding Proxy Tunneling (TLDP)
From: Aditya Bhiday &lt;aditya.bhiday@gmail.com&gt;
To: kapil@imsc.res.in
</pre>
Hi,
</p>

<p>
I came across a post at
<a href='http://tldp.org/LDP/LGNET/144/misc/lg/question_on_how_to_block_a_ssh_host_from_being_used_as_a_socks_proxy.htmlwhich'>http://tldp.org/LDP/LGNET/144/misc/lg/qu[...]om_being_used_as_a_socks_proxy.htmlwhich</a>
said that
</p>

<p>
"AllowTcpForwarding Specifies whether TCP forwarding is permitted. The
default is "yes". Note that disabling TCP forwarding does not improve
security unless users are also denied shell access, as they can always
install their own forwarders."
</p>

<p>
I was just experimenting around with tunneling and as to how to block it.
Please could explain to me how one can install their own forwarders if ssh
tunneling is blocked, or the name of such a forwarding software?
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
</p>

<p>
Regards,
Aditya Bhiday

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm new to mailing lists.
   I'll keep that in mind.
</p>

<p>
   However when I send a message to mailing list I am not a part of, do I
   receive the replies to my messages in my Inbox?

<p>
IF:
<pre>
 - shell account access is enabled
and
 - the user of that shell account can install programs
and
 - run these programs
</pre>
then forwarding is possible.
</p>

<p>
For example, the user can install "slirp" which takes a tty and
converts it into a ppp server. The user can then attach a pppd
process to the other end of the tty.

<p>
Yes, but if it an ordinary user, with no administrative powers, then just
   disabling the TCP forwarding in the ssh daemon config should block all
   tunneling right?

<p>
Not automatically.  However:  (1) TAG mailing list members make a point
of CCing querents under the assumption that they are not subscribed,
specifically so that you <em>do</em> get copies, and (2) you or anyone else are
of course very welcome to join the TAG mailing list.  (See URL at
bottom.)  You might merely find following the discussions to be
interesting, and eventually might wish to participate.  That's how we
get new members of The Answer Gang!  ;-&gt;

<p>
An "ordinary" user with a shell account can generally download a
program to their home directory and run it. So I don't understand
your remark.
