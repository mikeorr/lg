<h2><a name="introduction" id="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>WSGI has become a buzzword among Python developers, especially
since the <a href=
"http://pyre.third-bit.com/pyweb/index.html">PyWebOff</a> discussed
in my last <a href=
"http://linuxgazette.net/113/orr.html">article</a>. The burgeoning
proliferation of web application frameworks -- once a testament to
how easy it is to build one in Python -- is now seen by many as a
liability. The fifty-odd frameworks are non-interoperable for the
most part and leave the new user scratching his head wondering
which one to use. WSGI attempts to address the interoperability
problem by providing a common protocol between frameworks and
servers. A lot of related work has started over the past year, but
it's mainly been by individuals working alone quietly. There hasn't
been a central place to get an overview on what's available, and
the packages themselves often lack the documentation and demos
necessary to survey them all in a reasonable amount of time. One
bright spot is Paste (formerly WSGIKit), which is positioning
itself as a meta-framework and has seen significant development
over the past few weeks. This article attempts to bring all this
together and provide an overview of WSGI activity circa May
2005.</p>

<p>The article changed direction at least three times while I was
writing it because the WSGI landscape is changing so rapidly. My
original modus operandi was to get the Quixote Altdemo running in
the widest variety of WSGI environments. (The Altdemo is a one-file
application demonstrating logging in, sessions, and displaying the
request context. Quixote is our reference point because I like its
philosophy and am currently using it.) I started exploring, putting
my notes into the article as I went so they wouldn't get lost. The
first wall I hit was the lack of a WSGI interface for Quixote.
(I'll explain all these words later.) This led to the discovery of
Titus Brown's QWIP (the missing interface), and my detour to update
QWIP and embed it in a server module for Quixote (<a href=
"http://cafepy.com/quixote_extras/rex/wsgi_server.py">wsgi_server.py</a>).
Then I put aside the article for a few days, grew frustrated at how
long the not-yet-written sections were threatening to be, and
finally realized Paste is where I should concentrate my exploration,
even though I'm not yet ready to commit to Paste for my own
projects. So the article finally morphed from a hands-on HOWTO for
comparing projects into a bird's-eye summary of what's
available.</p>

<h2><a name="frameworks" id="frameworks"></a>Frameworks</h2>

<p>First let's take a <em>very</em> brief overview of the
differences between the frameworks. <a href=
"http://www.zope.org/">Zope</a> stands alone as the Emacs of web
application environments. It's very comprehensive but you have to
do things "the Zope way", which is very different from normal
Python programming. Zope predated most of the other frameworks, and
many of them are a reaction to it. Nevertheless, several advanced
add-ons have been written for Zope including the <a href=
"http://plone.org/">Plone</a> Content Management System.</p>

<p><a href="http://webwareforpython.org/">Webware</a> (or rather
its WebKit component) is based on the Java servlet model. Python
modules coexist with static files (images, multimedia) in the
filesystem. The URL resolver finds <tt class="literal"><span class=
"pre">foo.py</span></tt> if there's no closer match for "/foo". The
module must contain a same-name subclass of <tt class=
"literal"><span class="pre">Servlet</span></tt>. Various methods
are called to produce the output; various other method provide
context information (GET/POST variables, session variables) and
support services (redirects).</p>

<p><a href=
"http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/quixote/">Quixote</a> and
<a href="http://www.cherrypy.org/">CherryPy</a> resolve URLs by
searching object attributes rather than the filesystem. So you
provide a root object, and "/foo/bar/baz" maps to <tt class=
"literal"><span class="pre">ROOT.foo.bar.baz</span></tt>. Context
information comes from global imports that "know about" the current
request; this is not very OO but it keeps the application code
remarkably clean. A URL directory maps to a class, and a leaf node
to a method.</p>

<p>Quixote 2.0 goes a step further by giving you complete control
over the URL resolver. All Quixote does is call <tt class=
"literal"><span class=
"pre">ROOT._q_traverse(url_components)</span></tt>, and the default
implementation works as above, calling <tt class=
"literal"><span class="pre">._q_traverse</span></tt> on
"subdirectories" as necessary. But you can override it to do
anything you want, including handling all URLs another way,
diverting to a login form, checking authorization, calling leaf
nodes with additional arguments, wrapping a header/footer around
the output, etc. Many of the "Why doesn't Quixote do it this way?"
questions are answered with, "You can do it in <tt class=
"literal"><span class="pre">._q_traverse</span></tt>.</p>

<p><a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted</a> is more of an
application-and-server framework rather than just a web application
framework, but it does include the minimal <tt class=
"literal"><span class="pre">twisted.web</span></tt> upon which
<a href="http://nevow.org/">Nevow</a> is based. Both use the
Directory object model, with a <tt class="literal"><span class=
"pre">.locateChild</span></tt> method handling all URLs under
it.</p>

<p>Minimalist frameworks provide only the minimum required for web
applications: a URL resolver, access to context variables, session
management, handling HTTP headers and errors, and redirection. The
URL resolver more or less determines the structure of your
application. Richer frameworks provide a complete
Model-View-Controller structure, a template system, a database
access system, a Form object of some sort, HTML generation
functions, a configuration file, and/or a Javascript library.</p>

<p>Applications need a template system to merge calculated values
into predefined HTML. Most of these (Zope Page Templates, Nevow's)
use XML-style tags for the variable placeholders, and are thus
limited to producing HTML/XML output. <a href=
"http://cheetahtemplate.org/">Cheetah</a> uses a <tt class=
"literal"><span class="pre">$placeholder</span></tt> and <tt class=
"literal"><span class="pre">#command</span></tt> syntax, making it
suitable for other types of output as well. Quixote's PTL system
turns templating on its head: the template is an ordinary Python
function, except that standalone expressions are concatenated and
used as the implicit return value. PTL also escapes "unsafe" values
automatically -- those coming from a non-trusted source (arguments
or function calls) that may contain unexpected HTML markup. There's
an <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">htmltext</span></tt> class
to mark a string as "safe" to prevent further escaping. (There are
examples of PTL and Nevow in my <a href=
"http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/7541">PyCon 2004 article</a>.)
Python 2.4 includes a built-in template system using <tt class=
"literal"><span class="pre">$placholder</span></tt> syntax, but
it's so new and limited I haven't seen anyone using it. Most
template systems are affiliated with a certain framework but can
also be used standalone.</p>

<p>Another difference between the template systems is where the
plug-in values come from. For Python's, you provide a dictionary.
For Cheetah, you can provide a list of dictionaries/objects to
search in order, or you can set template attributes directly. For Nevow
you provide a function that sets the values in the template
(really!), and additional functions for looping. PTL gets values
from the function arguments or lexical scope. Fortunately, none of
these systems require a bunch of <tt class="literal"><span class=
"pre">.setValue(key, value)</span></tt> calls like certain Java/PHP/Perl
templates!</p>

<p>Applications also need to access a database. Some use object
databases like <a href=
"http://www.zope.org/Wikis/ZODB/FrontPage">ZODB</a> or <a href=
"http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/durus/">Durus</a>, others
use SQL directly, others use an object-relational mapper to pretend
they're not using a SQL database. Of course, the object-relational
mappers are non-interoperable; perhaps that is the next frontier
for standardization in Python. There are also various
SQL-generation modules that provide a thin wrapper over the syntax.
(I've written one of those, <a href=
"http://cafepy.com/quixote_extras/rex/dbutil.py">dbutil.py</a>.)</p>

<p>Most frameworks come with a Python web server either recommended
for production or used just for testing. All connect to Apache via
CGI, and some via a generic Apache module (FastCGI, mod_python) or
a custom Apache module (mod_scgi, mod_webkit). Some can run under
Twisted. Because web requests can arrive simultaneously, servers
have to deal with concurrency. There are four concurrency
models:</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Synchronous</strong> servers handle one request at a
time. Any subsequent requests just have to wait. (Python's
SimpleHTTPServer, Quixote's simple_server)</li>

<li><strong>Multiprocess</strong> servers handle each request in a
subprocess. (Apache CGI, mod_python, mod_scgi) Each subprocess
handles one request or several synchronously, but they all run in
parallel. A subprocess can handle the request itself or transmit it
to a long-running server via a socket.</li>

<li><strong>Multithreaded</strong> servers handle each request in a
thread. (Webware, Zope, WSGI Utils' httpServer)</li>

<li><strong>Asynchronous</strong> servers use <tt class=
"literal"><span class="pre">select</span></tt> to multiplex I/O
between several pending requests. (Twisted, Medusa)</li>
</ul>

<p>Each model has its advantages and disadvantages. Synchronous
servers are too slow for most production systems. Multithreaded
servers require careful programming to avoid clobbering shared
variables. Some frameworks are not thread safe anyway. Twisted uses
a non-linear programming model to avoid threads; its Deferreds and
callbacks are enough to make many programmers run screaming from
the room. The multiprocess model avoids clobbering shared variables
but can still clobber shared files. In many cases (especially with
Apache) the webserver adapter does not calculate the response
itself but instead forwards the request to a separate application
server. The application server may have a different concurrency
model than the web server.</p>

<p>All frameworks provide session management, each in its own way.
A session is a dictionary or object that is shared between requests
by the same user as long as the user doesn't quit his/her browser
or remain idle too long. A session manager stores sessions and
gives the correct session to each request. Sessions may be stored
in a dictionary, files, or a database. A dictionary session manager
requires a single long-running process (not multiprocesses), and
the sessions vanish when the server quits or crashes. File-based
sessions persist between server instances and can be shared by
multiprocesses, but file locking is required to prevent
simultaneous updates. Database sessions are similar but the
database server often handles the multiplexing for you.</p>

<p>Each framework also has a way for managing forms. Some have a
form object and widget objects; others use an XML description.
Quixote uses the former. The form object can both render a form,
validate it, and redisplay it with error messages. With some
frameworks you get the form input and validate it against the
widgets. In Quixote, you ask the widgets to find themselves in the
GET/POST variables, validate themselves, and return the value or
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">None</span></tt>.</p>

<h2><a name="pre-wsgi-standardization" id=
"pre-wsgi-standardization"></a>Pre-WSGI Standardization</h2>

<p>A few attempts at standardization were made before WSGI
appeared. For instance, frameworks come with their own web servers
and adapters for Apache, and these are generally not
interchangeable with other frameworks. Webware comes with
mod_webkit, a module that quickly transmits the request to a
Webware application server. Neil Schemenauer, a Quixote developer,
aimed to do this in a generic way and wrote <a href=
"http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/scgi/">SCGI</a>. It
serializes the request environment variables and input, sends it
through a socket, and expects a complete HTTP document (with
headers) in reply. His mod_scgi does this in an Apache module, and
his cgi2scgi.c does it in a CGI script. I wrote a Python
equivalent, <a href=
"http://cafepy.com/quixote_extras/rex/cgi2scgi.py">cgi2scgi.py</a>,
which is useful for testing. Titus Brown wrote SWAP, a SCGI-WSGI
gateway. It's included in Paste, or you can get it from his
<a href="http://www.idyll.org/~t/www-tools/wsgi/">QWIP and SWAP</a>
page.</p>

<p><a href="http://subway.python-hosting.com/">Subway</a>
aggregates CherryPy, Cheetah, SQLObject, and now Paste into an
integrated development environment similar to Ruby on Rails. It
uses CherryPy's WSGI interface to link into Paste.</p>

<p>Credit should also be given to the Zope team for unbundling
their <a href="http://www.zope.org/Wikis/ZODB/FrontPage">ZODB</a>
database and template systems so they can be used with other
frameworks.</p>

<h2><a name="wsgi" id="wsgi"></a>WSGI</h2>

<p>WSGI is Python <a href=
"http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0333.html">PEP 333</a>, the Web
Server Gateway Interface. It's a a protocol for communicating with
Python web applications. WSGI works by callbacks. The application
provides a function which the server calls for each request:</p>

<pre class="literal-block">
application(environ, start_response)
</pre>

<p><tt class="literal"><span class="pre">environ</span></tt> is a
Python dictionary containing the CGI-defined environment variables
plus a few extras. One of the extras is "wsgi.input", the file
object from which to read the POST variables. <tt class=
"literal"><span class="pre">start_response</span></tt> is a
callback by which the application returns the HTTP headers:</p>

<pre class="literal-block">
start_response(status, response_headers, exc_info=None)
</pre>

<p><tt class="literal"><span class="pre">status</span></tt> is an
HTTP status string (e.g., "200 OK"). <tt class=
"literal"><span class="pre">response_headers</span></tt> is a list
of 2-tuples, the HTTP headers in key-value format. <tt class=
"literal"><span class="pre">exc_info</span></tt> is used in
exception handling; we won't cover it here.</p>

<p>The application function then returns an <em>iterable</em> of
body chunks. In the simplest case this can be:</p>

<pre class="literal-block">
["&lt;html&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/html&gt;"]
</pre>

<p>Getting slightly more elaborate, here's the second-smallest WSGI
application in the world:</p>

<pre class="literal-block">
def app2(environ, start_response):
    start_response("200 OK", [])
    s = "&lt;html&gt;You requested &lt;strong&gt;%s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"
    s %= environ['PATH_INFO']
    return [s]
</pre>

<p>The protocol may look strange, but it's designed to meet the
needs of the widest possible variety of existing and potential
frameworks and servers. <em>And</em> middleware. Middleware are
reusable components providing generic services normally handled by
frameworks; e.g., a Session object, a Request object, error
handling. They're implemented as wrapper functions; i.e.,
decorators. Inbound they can add keys to the dictionary (e.g.,
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">quixote.request</span></tt>
for a Quixote-style Request object). Outbound they can modify HTTP
headers or translate the body into Latin or Marklar. Here's a small
middleware:</p>

<pre class="literal-block">
class LowercaseMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, application):
        self.application = application   # A WSGI application callable.

    def __call__(self, environ, start_response):
        pass  # We could set an item in 'environ' or a local variable.
        for chunk in self.application(environ, start_response):
            yield chunk.lower()
</pre>

<p>Assuming we had a server constructor <tt class=
"literal"><span class="pre">Server</span></tt>, we could do:</p>

<pre class="literal-block">
app = LowercaseMiddleware(app2)
server = Server(app)
</pre>

<p>Since it's so easy to write a WSGI application, you may wonder,
"Who needs a framework?" That's a legitimate question, although the
answer is, "It's tedious without one." Your application is
responsible for every URL under it; e.g., if it's installed as
<strong>http://localhost:8080/</strong>, it would have to do
something intelligent with
<strong>http://localhost:8080/foo/bar/baz</strong>. Code to parse
the URL and switch to an appropriate function is... a framework! So
you may as well use an existing framework and save yourself the
tedium.</p>

<p>Writing a WSGI <em>server</em> interface is more complex.
There's an example in PEP 333. I wrote an object-oriented one for
Quixote (in wsgi_server.py). But the experience taught me it's more
fun to write the application side.</p>

<p>WSGI opens the way for a lot of interesting possibilities.
Simple frameworks can be turned completely into middleware. Some
frameworks might be able to run on top of other frameworks or even
be emulated by them. Ideally, existing applications would run
unchanged or with minimal changes. But this is also a time for
framework developers to rethink how they're doing things and
perhaps switch to more middleware-friendly APIs.</p>

<p>Currently, CherryPy and Nevow have WSGI interfaces. Twisted's
CVS has a <tt class="literal"><span class=
"pre">twisted.web2.wsgi</span></tt> module. Quixote has QWIP.</p>

<h2><a name="why-wsgi-won-t-replace-scgi" id=
"why-wsgi-won-t-replace-scgi"></a>Why WSGI Won't Replace SCGI</h2>

<p>Many people think WSGI will replace mod_scgi and all the other
webserver adapters. This is partly due to the confident language in
the PEP about connecting to "web servers". But both sides of WSGI
must be in the same process, for the simple reason that the spec
requires an open file object in the dictionary, and you can't
pickle a file object and transmit it to another process. So a WSGI
call from an Apache module to an embedded Python application is
possible, but a WSGI call from Apache to a long-running application
server is not. Yet these long-running servers are necessary to
maintain state and factor out the initialization overhead. SCGI can
replace the framework-specific adapters since it is serializable
and framework neutral (and programming-language neutral), but WSGI
will have to operate on the "application side" of an SCGI
interface.</p>

<p>Conversely, people may wonder why to use WSGI when SCGI is both
a gateway <em>and</em> serializable. However, inbound processors
would have to parse and reformat the entire input stream instead of
merely passing a dictionary object through, and outbound processors
would likewise have to parse the headers.</p>

<p>Python web servers, however, can take the day off because they
have to provide only one interface now, WSGI. Then any compliant
application can be plugged into them regardless of framework. Since
the web server is a long-running process, the application will
initialize itself only once, and it can store any needed state in
module globals (but watch out for threading issues). And I suppose
a WSGI application could be a stub that calls a standalone
application server via SCGI...</p>

<h2><a name="quixote-s-challenges-to-wsgi" id=
"quixote-s-challenges-to-wsgi"></a>Quixote's Challenges to
WSGI</h2>

<p>Let's look at the specific challenges one framework has in
adapting to WSGI. QWIP exists to connect the monolithic Quixote
Publisher to WSGI, but what if we want to factor out parts of
Quixote to middleware? Given that the URL resolving is already
factored out to your <tt class="literal"><span class=
"pre">Directory</span></tt> object, if you take out the session
handling, error handling, and request handling, is there much of a
Publisher left? Do you use generic middleware, which would require
people to change their applications, or middleware that produces
Quixote-style objects? Three considerations stand out:</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Because Quixote makes it easy to subclass Publisher, Session
and Request, many applications do. These applications are
apparently incompatible with some middleware.</li>

<li>Applications access their context objects by calling global
functions: e.g., <tt class="literal"><span class=
"pre">quixote.get_session()</span></tt>. These functions are
frequently used in lieu of passing arguments. Middleware puts
context objects in the environment dictionary. A middleware'd
Quixote may have to create a fake <tt class="literal"><span class=
"pre">quixote</span></tt> module with functions that read the
environment dictionary, or maybe the middleware would have to stuff
the objects into a fake <tt class="literal"><span class=
"pre">quixote</span></tt> module itself. There is precedent for
this in Paste, whose webkit component provides a fake Webware
environment for a servlet to run in.</li>

<li>Most frameworks use a dictionary for the session object, but
Quixote uses an instance, and users often add attributes. One
predefined attribute is <tt class="literal"><span class=
"pre">.user</span></tt>, although Quixote does nothing with it
except initialize it to <tt class="literal"><span class=
"pre">None</span></tt>. But applications frequently set it to
something and access it via <tt class="literal"><span class=
"pre">quixote.get_user()</span></tt>. Is it better to change
applications to use dictionary sessions, or provide a Quixote-style
session middleware? Or can we use a generic session manager
middleware with our own session objects?</li>

<li>Quixote is not thread safe, so my version of QWIP refuses to
connect to a multithreaded server. There's a class and a wrapper in
wsgi_server.py to make it thread safe, but they need further
testing.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="wsgi-utils" id="wsgi-utils"></a>WSGI Utils</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.owlfish.com/software/wsgiutils/">WSGI
Utils</a> provides:</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>wsgiServer, a multithreaded HTTP-to-WSGI server based on
Python's SimpleHTTPServer. It takes a mapping of URL prefixes to
applications, allowing you to serve multiple applications from one
server, and can also overlay a static directory for any
non-matching URLs.</li>

<li>wsgiAdapter, a simple application framework. It provides Basic
Authentication and signed cookies.</li>

<li>some persistent session classes using DBM and an optional
daemon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Paste has an interface to wsgiServer, as does my wsgi_server.py.
I had some trouble with the application mapping. It works fine with
a single application but is not very robust for multiple
applications. One wonders whether attaching multiple applications
at this level is really that useful anyway, but time will tell.
wsgiAdapter may be an interesting framework to build other
frameworks on top of, although that may require more modification
to existing frameworks than it's worth.</p>

<p>One caveat about the static overlay, which is inherited from
Python's <tt class="literal"><span class=
"pre">SimpleHTTPServer</span></tt>: it serves from the
<em>current</em> directory, and there's no provision to specify
another directory. So make sure to chdir to the static directory
before launching wsgiServer.</p>

<h2><a name="other-packages" id="other-packages"></a>Other
packages</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.saddi.com/software/flup/">Flup</a> is Allan
Saddi's package of WSGI utilities. There are gateways to SCGI and
FastCGI, both threaded and forking. There are middlewares for error
handling, gzip compression, and sessions. The session object is a
dictionary subclass, and the session managers are memory-, shelve-,
and file-based. There's also a minimal application framework. (The
more the merrier!)</p>

<p><a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/">PEAK</a> is a library
for enterprise applications. Among its diverse offerings is
wsgiref, a reference library for WSGI including a simple HTTP
server. wsgiref seems to have spun off into its own repository,
located <a href="http://cvs.eby-sarna.com/wsgiref/">here</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="paste" id="paste"></a>Paste</h2>

<p><a href="http://pythonpaste.org/">Paste</a> is what I call a
meta-framework, a way to plug together frameworks and servers and
middleware using a common configuration system. Here's how Paste's
creator, Ian Bicking, describes it: <a href=
"http://pythonpaste.org/docs/what-is-paste.html">http://pythonpaste.org/docs/what-is-paste.html</a></p>

<p>Paste has been getting an extraordinary level of development
recently. It includes two frameworks: a WSGI-aware implementation
of Webware, and a (backward-incompatible) modernization of
<em>that</em> called Wareweb. Paste is becoming the <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg">Borg</a>, assimilating some
third-party code and linking to others. It has incorporated
gateways from SWAP and Flup, and Quixote support is in progress.
Subway has refactored itself to work with Paste. Paste should also
work with any generic WSGI application. It has been creating and
borrowing middleware left and right, for configuration, error
handling, caching, testing, authentication, redirects, session
management, HTML validation, and no doubt others.</p>

<p>Paste has a top-level executable 'paster'. If the first argument is
"serve", it launches the server/application/middleware combination
specified in a Python-syntax configuration file. Some of the
configuration parameters are:</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>server</strong>: "wsgiutils", "scgi", "scgi_flup_fork",
"scgi_flup_threaded", "console", etc. The console server is for
debugging and dumps the response on the screen. Run 'paster serve
--list-servers' to see all servers with descriptions.</li>

<li><strong>publish_app</strong>: a generic WSGI application. This
can be a function object, or a string naming the object to import.
This overrides the "framework" and "publish_dir" parameters.</li>

<li><strong>framework</strong>: "webkit", "wareweb", "subway", etc.
The default uses webkit.</li>

<li><strong>publish_dir</strong>: a directory containing a
framework-specific application. (Only used by certain
frameworks.)</li>
</ul>

<p>The configuration is read into a dictionary and available to all
parts of the runtime. This means frameworks can define additional
parameters, and so can middleware and your application. This allows
you to put all configuration information in one place with one
format. For instance, a session middleware might need to know which
directory to save to, and your application might need to know which
database to connect to.</p>

<p>If the first argument is "create", paster creates
a stub directory for a new application. You don't have to do this
-- you can build your own application directory from scratch -- but
paster has skeletons for several common scenarios.
For instance:</p>

<pre class="literal-block">
$ paster create --template=webkit_zpt /tmp/paste_app.py
$ ls /tmp/paste_app.py

__init__.pyc  sitepage.py  templates/
</pre>

<p>This creates a Webware application using Zope Page Templates and
SQLObject. Here's what it contains:</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>__init.py__</strong>: Makes this directory a Python
package so you can import it.</li>

<li><strong>server.conf</strong>: The configuration file.</li>

<li><strong>sitepage.py</strong>: Class <tt class=
"literal"><span class="pre">SitePage</span></tt>, the superclass of
your servlets.</li>

<li><strong>templates</strong>: Put your ZPT templates here. By
default you get a generic home page, a standard header/footer, and
a basic error page.</li>

<li><strong>web</strong>: The published directory. Put your servlet
and static files here. The default home page lists the WSGI
dictionary for the request.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's the server.conf file created by the above command
(comments deleted):</p>

<pre class="literal-block">
import os
app_template = 'webkit_zpt'
app_name = 'paste_app'
framework = 'webkit'
publish_dir = os.path.join('/tmp/paste_app', 'web')
sys_path = ['/tmp']
verbose = False
server = 'wsgiutils'
reload = True
debug = True
</pre>

<p>Obviously I didn't choose a good location since you don't want
/tmp in your Python path, but you get the idea. (Note: don't call
your application directory "paste" or Python's import mechanism
will get confused.)</p>

<p>Paste had Twisted support but it removed due to bugginess and
obsolescence. New code for <tt class="literal"><span class=
"pre">twisted.web2.wsgi</span></tt> (not released yet; in Twisted
CVS only) has not been written.</p>

<h2><a name="qlime" id="qlime"></a>QLime</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.qlime.org">QLime</a> is a rich framework built on top of
Quixote. I'm mentioning it because it has an intriguing
configuration system, one that might be useful for Paste or another
meta-framework. QLime uses a global "registry" <tt class=
"literal"><span class="pre">reg</span></tt>, which is just a
container for arbitrary attributes. <tt class=
"literal"><span class="pre">reg.site</span></tt> is the published
application; i.e., a Quixote Directory and its sub-Directories.
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">reg.oc</span></tt> contains
table classes for QLime's object-relational mapper, and <tt class=
"literal"><span class="pre">reg.ds</span></tt> contains database
connection objects. But you can set any attributes you want, such
as <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">reg.skin.red</span></tt>
and <tt class="literal"><span class=
"pre">reg.skin.blue</span></tt>, which might be instances
describing user-selectable color themes.</p>

<p>The registry is built from a configuration file in Windows .ini
format:</p>

<pre class="literal-block">
[site qlime.registry.SiteObject]

[site.colorhello colorhello.Hello]
skin_name=skin.red

[skin.red colorhello.Red]
[skin.blue colorhello.Blue]

[oc.note class:qlime.demo.noteapp.Note]
ds=notedb
oc=default
</pre>

<p>Each [] line is a section header. The first word in the header
tells where in the registry to attach this object. The second word
names the class to instantiate. Any key=value pairs are arguments
to the constructor (strings only). If the second word begins with
"class:", it attaches the class itself rather than an instance. In
that case, the arguments are passed to a special class method,
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">._q_class_init</span></tt>.
So the above configuration corresponds roughly to:</p>

<pre class="literal-block">
from qlime.registry import SiteObject
from colorhello import Hello, Red, Blue
from qlime.demo.noteapp import Note
reg.site = SiteObject()
reg.site.colorhello = Hello(skin_name="skin.red")
reg.skin.red = Red()
reg.skin.blue = Blue()
reg.oc.note = Note      # Class, not instance!
Note._q_class_init(ds="notedb", oc="default")
</pre>

<h2><a name="the-web-sig" id="the-web-sig"></a>The web-sig</h2>

<p>Python's <a href="http://python.org/sigs/web-sig/">web-sig</a>
is a mailing list for coordinating the various web-related
projects. Discussion topics include how to improve the Python
standard library for HTTP/HTML/framework support, and what
third-party packages are needed and how they should be structured.
Of course the cabal cannot tell a developer what to do, but those
interested in standardization will look to the group's consensus,
and the list is also a resource for questions like "Is anybody else
working on X?" and "How do I do Y?" The list is pretty active, and
most of the bigwigs are on it. So this is a good place to
coordinate WSGI work.</p>

<p>Recent topics include making a Javascript library a la Nevow's,
an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX">AJAX</a> framework,
what Rails got that we don't got, porting frameworks to Paste,
etc.</p>

<h2><a name="conclusion" id="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>

<p>WSGI is only part of the solution. It helps interoperability but
does nothing for the Python newbie who just wants to get a simple
dynamic site up and running quickly and is overwhelmed by the
choices. Documentation is what the newbie needs, and the Python
community needs to come to an agreement regarding the top
framework(s) to recommend, or perhaps the top framework for each
purpose (simple site, large site, heavily-loaded site). Paste plays
a paradoxical role. On the one hand it encourages people to write
even <em>more</em> frameworks to experiment with the expanding
possibilities. On the other hand, this new code will be designed
with interoperability in mind, something we haven't had before. And
perhaps instead of compromising on one framework and giving up our
beloved esoteric features, we can compromise on this meta-framework
and keep our features, and Johnny Newbie will be less confused.</p>

<p>Next month I'm planning an article on User-Centered Design and
Usability Testing, and maybe the following month I'll have more to
report on Paste.</p>
