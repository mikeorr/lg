So, after that long thread, I'm wondering what Braun thinks of his
choice.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
No, no, not the distro choice; his choice of ILUG as a place to email
a question about Linux distros...

Are you suggesting that there's at least one on-line Linux forum on the
globe where soliciting "Suggestions for best 64-bit [sic] Linux distro"
would <em>  not  </em> constitute the hapless posting of flamebait?
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Someone with a bit more common sense <em>  might  </em> have posted "Here's the
Linux distros I'm aware of, so far, with active x86_64 ports:  Ubuntu,
Kubuntu, Gentoo, <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>, Fedora, Mandriva, <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A>, RHEL, CentOS, Tao
Linux, Scientific Linux, CRUX, Lineox, cAos-2, RockLinux, Knoppix64,
Slamd64 (<A HREF="http://www.slackware.org/">Slackware</A>), StartCom, SourceMage, Rocks, rpath Linux, Kanotix,
White Box.  Any others worth mentioning?"

It would be nice to get some ideas of what people are using.  If you
want to use a distro that will have local support, I think the question
has some merit.

Yes, OK, that wasn't the wisest choice of words.  But still, no matter
how distro questions are asked, these threads always seem to careen out
of control.

I was rather amused, actually.  I was thinking of asking another question
on the list about <A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</A> vs. <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A>, to see if I could spark another long
flamewar.

Bah. Neither approach the professionalism of classic X desktops.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Okay, in most respects they do, but one thing really annoys
me about both KDE and GNOME is the way they still don't handle
applications running from different machines and home directories
properly at all.  They make the assumption, time and again, that
all the apps on the screen are running on the one display with prefs
in the one home directory. If I wanted that, I could get a fucking
Macincrap.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Older X applications used the xrdb, so that UI configuration
was a property of the display. All your resource db-supporting apps
could look just how you wanted them, no matter which host they
were running from.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Then 10000 Windows-developer-weenies apparently jumped ship to Linux,
bringing an incoherent mess of files stuck in the home directory and
slagged off xrdb while completely missing the point of it, so we have
things like the  unadulterated horror of GConf.  A few did eventually
grasp what xrdb brought, and I acknowledge that xrdb would need heavy
tweaking bordering on rearchitecting for "modern" preference datatypes,
but they really threw the baby out with the bathwater by forsaking its
core ideal of dynamic, server-brokered preferences.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
P.S. See "man Xaw" for an interesting hack: you can now specify the
vector-drawing commands used to draw a widget in the "displayList" xrdb
resource of an Athena widget...

The reason I asked the question was not because I wanted to know the
best "distro", I wanted to know what was the best "64-bit" distro.
Given that 64-bit chips are still fairly new to the average user, I
wasn't sure how well the 64-bit distros stacked up.

It's a reasonable concern.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Part of the problem is that AMD64/EM64T (collectively: x86_64[1]) are
sufficiently new that they're relatively new to many long-time Linux
people, too.  Some will have had recent experience with one x86_64
flavor; few will be in a position to compare and contrast them very
well.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Another part of the problem is that there are some subtle migration
(32/64) problems, which, speaking for myself, aren't easy to master, let
alone know where all the ported distros stand on them.  (Some are a
problem for all of the distros roughly equally, e.g., the lack of a
native OO.o, Macromedia Flash interpreter, <A HREF="http://www.winehq.com/">WINE</A>, Win32 codecs, etc.)
Basically, after booting an x86_64 Linux distribution, running apps
provided only in binary IA32 form requires a IA32 environment, which can
be either a chroot (in what is otherwise dubbed a "pure64" OS build,
with the disadvantage of chewing up disk space with all the duplicated
libs, applications, and utilities) <em>  or  </em> a set of separate 32-bit libs
known to the dynamic linker and in a parallel directory structure
(reserving "lib" for IA32, using "lib64" for x86_64), a category of
solution termed a "multiarch" OS build -- which has the disadvantage (if
I understand correctly) that compiling and installing <em>  new  </em> 32-bit apps
and libs is difficult.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
A good survey of x86_64 distributions would start with classifying each
as to whether it uses the pure64 or multiarch approach.  And not even
Distrowatch seems to have attempted that, so far.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Of course, you can also ignore the CPU instruction set extensions and
run a regular old IA32 ("x86") distro[2] -- bringing with it the
relatively smaller memory map, but simplifying software support -- but
what fun would that be?  ;-&gt;
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
[1] The nomenclature is hopelessly confused:  AMD say that "x86_64"
(their original term for the extended architecture) is now deprecated
and that everyone should say "AMD64", but that of course would make an
awkward way to encompass Intel's compatible EM64T implementation that
competes with AMD's.  A minority in the Linux community, such as the
Debian Project, call the architecture "amd64"; I follow the most-common
usage and say "x86_64", since the term is vendor-neutral.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
[2] This level of backwards compatibility is the architecture's salient
advantage over Intel's still-exotic and incompatible IA64
Itanium/Itanium2 (dubbed "Itanic" by TheReg) architecture -- whose
existence hints at one of the problems with "lib64" directories: the
namespace collision with Itanium.

This is definitely the truth.  For example, I'm using a GeForce 5500
video card.  SUSE Linux doesn't ship with the 3D drivers, so I
downloaded (or so I thought) the appropriate driver from the nVidia home
page.  It was the one for x86_64.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Imagine my surprise when, upon trying to run it, the shell script
complains that the architecture is incompatible with the drivers....
