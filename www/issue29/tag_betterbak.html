        We are running Redhat 4.1 (kernel of 2.0.37). We recently added a tape
        drive where we would like to do remote backups. Everything works fine
        as long as we are not root, ie, the remote backup using "<tt>tar -cvf 
        remotehost:/dev/st0</tt>" works fine for non-root. But for root, we 
	get a "Permission denied" error.  I understand that 
	<tt>hosts.equiv</tt> does not control remote access for root but

	where the tape drive resides, without success.   How are others 
	handling this problem?

You need to allow root to login to tty's not listed in 
<tt>/etc/securetty</tt>. The proper way to fix this is to edit your 
<tt>/etc/pam.conf</tt> or <tt>/etc/pam.d/login</tt> (which ever is 
appropriate) and remove the line refering to securetty.

	I'm sorry to bring up such and old thread but this 
	answer is still pretty bad and there is a <strong>much</strong> 
	better solution (or several).

<br><br>
	First you can use the following syntax:

<blockquote><code>
		tar -cvf operator@remotehost:/dev/st0 ...

</code></blockquote>
	... by creating an "operator" psuedo-user with appropriate
	permissions to the tape device on the remote host, and
	creating an <tt>~operator/.rhosts</tt> with entries like:

<blockquote><code>
		myhost.mydomain.org	root

</code></blockquote>
	For each of the hosts to be allowed to perform backups.

<br><br>
	This doesn't expose the remotehost (tape server) to 
	nearly as much risk as the approaches suggested in these
	responses (although the normal concerns about user 
	r* access and host spoofing apply.

<br><br>
	To alleviate that concern we can use the <tt>--rsh-command=</tt>
	switch to tar to force it to run over ssh like so:

<blockquote><code>
		tar -cvf operator@remotehost:/dev/st0 
			--rsh-command=/usr/local/bin/ssh ...

</code></blockquote>
	'<tt>cpio</tt>' and '<tt>dump</tt>' also support this 
	"<tt>user@remote.tapeserver...:/path</tt>" syntax --- though I don't
	see any option regarding the <tt>--rsh-command</tt> over-ride on those.

<br><br>
	In most cases (at least with '<tt>dump</tt>') you'll need to ensure
	that there is a copy of the '<tt>rmt</tt>' command on the "operator's"
	<tt>$PATH</tt> (on tape server, of course).

Their question was not how to backup, but how to allow root to do backups.

	My answer was about how to allow root (on the client) to do backups
	on a remote machine without exposing that remote machine (the 
	tapehost) to the risks of allowing <tt>rsh</tt> root access.  The 
	point is that you don't have to change <tt>securetty</tt> or allow 
	remote root access to provide tape service to to your clients.
<br><br>
	Getting off of the security issues, there is another important note
	that's worth pointing out.  If you just run these commands as 
	I've described them, you'll probably find that the tape drive
	doesn't "stream" very well.  That is to say that the flow of data
	to the drive will probably be "bursty" enough that you'll see the
	drive stopping, rewinding, and restarting frequently (several 
	times per minute.
<br><br>
	If you tape drive isn't streaming your backups can take ten times
	as long as it should --- and it will put even more wear and tear on 
	the drive than that.  So you want to avoid this non-streaming 
	wherever possible.
<br><br>
	The solution to this problem is to use Lee McLoughlin's 
	<a href="http://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/packages/unix/buffer/">
	<tt>buffer</tt></a> program.  I'm pretty sure that this is the same
	Lee McLoughlin that wrote the popular FTP <tt>mirror</tt> Perl script.
<br><br>
	This program reads input from one data stream (often a network
	socket) <strong>reblocks it</strong>, and writes it (usually to 
	<tt>stdout</tt> which would usually be redirected to the tape drive).
	You'd also use this if your going to compress or encrypt the data as 
	you write it to the tape drive (e.g. using <tt>gzip</tt> as a 
	filter, or using the '<tt>z</tt>' flag on GNU <tt>tar</tt>).
<br><br>
	Here's an example of one of the earlier commands using
<blockquote><code>
		tar -czvf - ... | rsh -l operator otherhost "buffer > /dev/st0"
</code></blockquote>
<br><br>
	I didn't go into that detail in my other message since it 
	related to the mechanics of the backup process rather than the 
	specific security issues at hand.  However, anyone else reading this
	message might put their tape drive and tapes through unecessary stress 
	and get unsatisfactory performance and results by trying to follow
	these examples without using a copy of <tt>buffer</tt>
<br><br>
	I've noticed that the <a href="http://www.suse.com/">S.u.S.E.</a>
	distribution ships with a copy of <tt>buffer</tt> and 
	<a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> has it in a package
	for it (which will presumably be included in their &quot;Official
	CD Sets&quot; as the 2.0 distribution is finalized and 
	&quot;shipped&quot;.  I'd like to see this included with Red Hat
	and I'd like to see GNU <tt>tar</tt> use it, if available, by
	default when it is called with the '<tt>z</tt>' (gzip/compression) 
	flag or with a remote file specification.  Likewise for the 
	appropriate options in the GNU <tt>cpio</tt> and <tt>dump</tt> 
	packages.
<br><br>
	This should <strong>not</strong> be a bit of hacker lore that must
	be passed down from one sysadmin to another.  It should be documented
	in the <tt>man</tt> and <tt>info</tt> pages for all of the programs 
	that conventionally write to tape drives, particularly if they support
	syntax to directly do so over network sockets, and through compression 
	and/or encryption packages.
<br><br>
	One final note about network and remote tape backups:
<br><br>
	Most sysadmins seem to spend entirely too much of their time 
	reinventing the backup wheel.  I haven't looked at the slick 
	commercial packages like 
	<a href="http://www.estinc.com/products.html">BRU</a>
	<a href="http://www.legato.com>Networker</a> 
	(which has a Linux <strong> client</strong> --- unsupported --- 
	but apparently no server support).   These and packages like 
	<a href="http://www.multiline.com.au/~yusuf/">Taper</a>
	seem to be mostly user interfaces.
<br><br>
	Recently, however, I've been playing with the 
	<a href="http://www.amanda.org">Advanced Maryland Automatic 
	Network Disk Archiver</a> from the 
	<a href="http://www.umd.edu/">University of Maryland</a>.  
	This seems to be well suited to enterprise data backups.  It has 
	not UI to speak of --- you add and configure the appropriate 
	psuedo accounts and groups (providing network access over 
	<tt>rsh</tt> or <tt>ssh</tt>), install the client and server 
	components on your machines, in your <tt>/etc/services</tt>, and 
	<tt>/etc/inetd.conf</tt>, and you add some <tt>cron</tt> jobs.  
	It manages its own library of tapes and its own "holding space" 
	on one of the server's filesystems.
<br><br>
	Basically you just feed it tapes. One <tt>cron</tt> entry does an 
	<tt>amcheck</tt> and mails the operator(s) if the wrong tape is 
	in the drive.  That's normally done during the day when you expect 
	an operator to be around to fix the problem.  Another entry writes 
	the backups from the holding disk(s) to tapes; which would normally 
	be done in the middle of the night.  <strong>Amanda</strong> supports
 	a variety of tape changers (and has an extensible design so any tape 
	changer mechanism with a decent command-line control program can be 
	used with it).
<br><br>
	Many of the users on the Amanda mailing list (see their web site) 
	are using it to maintain archives of hundreds of filesystems --- 
	some of them measure their Amanda capacities in <em>Terabytes</em>!
<br><br>
	The biggest problem with <strong>Amanda</strong> at this point is the 
	lack of documentation for new users.  It has plenty of features 
	(the underlying backup processes use standard <tt>dump</tt> or 
	GNU <tt>tar</tt> commands so the system is very portable, and some 
	even use it to backup their NT systems).  
<br><br>
	Another problem is that Amanda is a complex system.  I'd suggest 
	that an initial backup of the tape server be created using some 
	traditional Unix/Linux command like <tt>cpio</tt> or <tt>tar</tt>, 
	and that the resulting tape be write-protected and permanently 
	stored.  (A removable medium, such as a CD-RW, CDR, LS-120, or 
	whatever would also work).  The point is that this should have the 
	Amanda installation on it, so you can bootstrap from a tape server 
	failure to do a full recovery.
<br><br>
	<strong>Amanda</strong> deserves much more coverage than this; and 
	perhaps, when I understand it well enough, I'll write an LG article 
	on it.  I think that every professional Unix and Linux sysadmin 
	should take a look at it.
