<h1>Away Mission -- SDWest 2006</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</A></b></p>

<p>

<p>This March conference, at the Santa Clara Convention Center, has been
the flagship conference of the CMP empire. This year SDWest offered the
usual solid matrix of developer tracks, but showed a growing emphasis on
security in software development. There were also a significant number of
sessions focusing on Agility in the development process, meaning that Agile
methods are becoming mainstream.</p>

<p>Not only did we have Scott Ambler [an industry-recognized software process 
improvement (SPI) expert and contributing editor with Dr. Dobb's Journal] 
discussing XP, RUP, and SCRUM in an evening BOF and Agile Modeling in a halfday 
tutorial, but he also presented a technical session on Agile UP - Streamlining 
the Rational Unified Process (RUP). In fact, there were 47 sessions referencing 
"Agile" methods out of 235 total sessions including titles such as "Agile 
Estimating and Planning", and "User Stories for Agile Requirements".</p>

<p>Another trend was the rise of AJAX. Almost as many sessions addressed this 
REST approach to updating web pages as sessions focused on Web Services 
[including WS-Security]. This is the paradigm <em>du jour</em> for new web development. 
</p>

<p>One of the surprises at the conference was seeing the last run by the
now-defunct Software Development magazine. The whole operation -- articles,
archives, conferences, etc -- are now under the Dr Dobbs logo. So future
conferences will be "Dr. Dobbs' SD Expo" conferences, and the URL "<a
href="http://www.sdexpo.com">http://www.sdexpo.com</a>" is redirected to
the Dr. Dobbs site. Although this is partly a rebranding effort, some of
the well-known staff personalities were not visible. I would speculate that
some other publications in the CMP stable may also do the consolidation
dance this year. [as a note of historical interest, "Software Development"
used to be called "Computer Language"]</p>

<p>This year, Microsoft's Visual Studio swept the awards. The VS product
manager, Rick LaPlante, went up a record 4 times for the Jolt awards. This
included Jolt's Best Product Award along with several others, including the
prestigious long-term Accomplishment Award. They also had one of the last
keynotes to present the new features of the award-winning VS Team System
product. </p>

<p>The VSTS demo showed integrated unit test refactoring, code coverage 
checking, and result tracking. Everything goes into a data warehouse for team 
access, and reports are available in Word and Excel formats. Also, VSTS has 
wizards for building stress and performance tests which show bottlenecks via 
automatic instrumentation. The final part of the demo showed linking TEAMprise 
in a Linux environment to the VSTS repository -- impressive, and maybe something 
that would catch your boss's eye, but the TEAMprise folks started as developers 
of VS addins. TEAMprise is not primarily a Linux vendor. </p>

<p>For balance, Rails 1.0 won the Jolt award for Web Development Tools.</p>

<h3>Mechanical Turk</h3>
<p>The best keynote also had the most intriguing title -- Artificial 
Artificial-Intelligence and the Web. This was partly an introduction to Amazon's 
experiment with with making public Web Services [and flexing its software 
muscles], introduced by Amazon's WS evangelists Philipe Babrera and Jeff 
Barr.</p>

<p>To tease our interest, the presenters retold the arcane history of the 19th 
Century enigma, the Mechanical Turk. This was purported to be a mechanical chess 
player seated at a chess board that could play winning games. In actuality, a 
very small chess master controlled the mechanism from the trunk beneath the board 
that supposedly housed the machinery. Because a human was in the mix, this was a 
form of "Artificial Artificial-Intelligence" and Amazon has borrowed the name 
for its new Web Service that links computers and humans.</p>

<p>The big idea is to use human interaction to understand input questions and 
their context, aided by web automation.</p>

<p>Clients can ask for services at <a
href="http://mturk.amazon.com">http://mturk.amazon.com</a> [which is really
an asynch parallel network of human processors].</p>

<p>The task are farmed out to HITs -- Human Intelligence Tasks. The Web Service 
organizes the tasks, allows human agents to volunteer for the tasks, collects 
and forwards the results to the requesters. And all of this is organized by 
micropayments of a penny or a dime or even a dollar a HIT.</p>

<p>On a practical level, Amazon had millions of photos of business addresses, 
many similar and some just mislabeled. So they used the Mturk community to 
verify and clean out inventory. They made small payments for each verifed or 
corrected image and spent only a fraction of what the effort would have cost by 
an outside agency. In effect they harnessed the intelligence and knowledge of a 
large community of web users. Of course, some members of the audience were 
concerned that this might create a legion of web wage serfs, working at or below 
legal minimum wage.</p>

<p>A new company has organized itself around this service, <a
href="http://askforcents.com">http://askforcents.com</a>. Currently they
are offering free requests as they workout the service details and business
model. </p>

<h3>AJAX and REST</h3>
<p>Christian Gross, Chair of SD Web Services Track, gave a back-to-back double 
session on "Developing With AJAX and REST Patterns" to a full house. [ AJAX 
represents the next generation of dynamic web development, Gross said. ]</p>

<p>REST is a development technique for Web Services using HTTP and, very often, 
XML. REST has ruffled feathers in the Web Services world because of its 'simpler 
is better' development strategy. For example, Ajax-Rest Components are agnostic 
and do not require a file ending like .html, .aspx, or .jsp.</p>

<p>Besides examples of mash-ups and instantly updating sections of web pages, 
Gross compared AJAX to technologies such as SOAP, and CORBA/DCOM/IIOP. Examples 
and a short overview are available from: <a 
href="http://www.devspace.com:8088/">http://www.devspace.com:8088/</a>. Also see 
Christian's blog at devspace: <a

<p>Another gem of SDWest06 was the 2-day tutorial from C++ Experts Bjarne 
Stroustrup and Herb Sutter. This required a special VIP or C++ Tutorial Pass for 
attendance. It began with a 25th-anniversary keynote placing C++ in historical 
and future context. Among other topics were new ISO C++ Libraries, C++(0x) and 
the Concur Project, and Exception Safety. A full description is available here:
<a href="http://www.sdexpo.com/2006/west/tutorial.htm">http://www.sdexpo.com/2006/west/tutorial.htm</a>.</p>

<p>An added "Grab Bag" technical track included sessions such as "Essential 
Virtual Computing Tips and Tricks" for VMWare and Virtual Server and "Open 
Source ROI" which offered real world case studies. [Here is a link to the Open 
Source Maturity Model that was discussed: 
<a href="http://www.navicasoft.com/pages/osmm.htm">http://www.navicasoft.com/pages/osmm.htm</a> ]</p>

<h3>The Roundup....</h3>
<p>Costs --- over $2000 for a full conference and tutorial pass, although 
organizations can avail themselves of the "fourth person attends FREE" discount 
for a net 25% savings. In comparison, pricing for EclipseCon and the MySQL User 
Conference is under $1500. Of course, this is still less than the $2,495.00 
Early Bird discount for conference and tutorials at JavaOne.</p>

<p>The Expo was small again, but featured a good mix of build tools, code 
testers and software houses. There were raffles for Sirius satellite radios, 
American Express checks, free software, and trainings. But by far the most 
interesting was Macabe's instant lottery. They offered a check for $100,000 
[!!!] if some one punched in the correct 6 numbers on a key pad. That would be 
easy if you had 999,999 chances, or knew the previous entries, but no one did. 
</p>

<p>This year again SDWest conferencees got large black tote bags and again had 
sandwiches each day in boxed lunches. On these points, EclipseCon was clearly 
superior with a logoed backpack and full sitdown meals. Of course, EclipseCon 
was much more narrowly defined - but that is also an advantage; it was all 
Eclipse, all the time. </p>

<p>The best reason to come to the next SD Conference is the stellar cast of 
developers and trainers who run the rich and detailed technical sessions. And 
the broad scope and platform agnosticism is also refreshing. You can't eat those 
things in many other conferences...</p>
