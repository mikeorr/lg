I have a PII (350MHz) running with an AGP ATI 3DRage graphics card (which
works fine) and a Sound Blaster 16 PnP (which also works fine). But, I
I can't get my internal SupraExpress 56k modem to work.
<P>
I have set the port (cua2 - COM3 in Windows) to IRQ11 (as it is under
Mr. Gates' OS) and the memory but it won't work. I tried changing the
modem initialization strings and still nothing. Minicom says that there
is no connection (!?).
<P>
If someone can help me, I would be most grateful as I want to use Netscape under X
because I want to use less of Windows because it's no good and expensive and hey, who
likes expensive stuff eh?

Thanks for your time

<P>
First I would thanks all the people and <I>Linux Gazette</I> who answered me
in a my previous mail.
<P>
I've another request to do now ..... that is :
<P>
I've upgraded my system from a K5 @ 133 MHz to a K6-2 3D @ 266 MHz
processor ... and,
as wrote on the Linux HOWTOs  "... with the older version of K6 we have to
disabled the cache memory ... ".
<P>
So, my fault was that I didn't read the HOWTO prior to buy the new
processor, but I'm asking to myself if "... is really a K6-2 an "older"
version of K6 family ... "  ?
<P>
The system runs anyway, but is a 'little slow' :-(
Is the cache disabling the only way to fix this problem ?
If not, which kind of K6,  I can 'safely' use ?
<P>
Thanks in advance to all the Linux people.
Have Fun :)

I'm interested in setting up Sendmail so that it routes mail over the

What I have done is setup a Web site and a Linux server on my Intranet.
Both have the same domain name. I can download mail and distribute it
internally using fetchmail and procmail. I can also send mails to users
on the Internet as well as users within the network. 
<P>
What I would like Sendmail to do is check if the user is a valid user on
the system. If so it should deliver the mail internally, otherwise it
should route the mail over the Internet.

My problem seems to be very simple yet I am struggling to solve it. I am trying to have a very basic installation of Linux on a single 1.44MB floppy disk and I cannot find any documents on how to do that.
<P>
My goal is to have just one floppy with the kernel, TCP/IP, network driver for 3COM PCMCIA card, Telnet daemon, so I could demonstrate our RF products (which have a wireless Ethernet interface - 802.11 in case you are interested) with just a laptop  PC and this floppy. I have found several suggestions on how to create a compressed image on a diskette but the problem is how to create and install a _working_ system on the same diskette, either through a RAM disk or an unused partition. The distribution I am currently using is Slackware 3.5.

These are PCI controllers that seem to have some ISA characteristics.
Everything I found said multiple PCI controllers could share a single
driver, but that apparently isn't the case for this controller.  I was
never able to force the probe for the second card.
<P>
The first two (alias) lines were added by the X-Windows configuration,
and I added the two (options) lines to /etc/conf.modules.
<PRE>
 alias eth0 hp100
 alias eth1 hp100
 options eth0 -o hp100-0
 options eth1 -o hp100-1

"eth1" popped right up on the next reboot.  This is well documented for
ISA controllers, but I couldn't find it associated with PCI anywhere.
Desperation + trial and error...

<P><font color="navy">
In a previous message, Pierre LAURIER says:<BR> 
I'm just a new user of Linux, without too much time to consider learning it.
I'm just having a quick question :
Do you know of specific developments that have been made on X environments
(KDE, GNOME or others) that are giving specific features for visually impaired
people.
</font><P>
No, I don't know of anything like this thats specifically planned for the 
desktop designs.
<P><font color="navy">
- control of the pointer device with the keyboard
</font><P>
You can do that now if you use the IBM "mouse" - the little post thats
placed right in the keyboard.   But that depends on your definition of
"control".  If what you're really looking for is to use the tab key, for
example, to move from application to application then you can already do
that with some window managers.  Then the applications need to have proper
traversal configuration (done in the source code, not from the user's
perspective) to allow movement of keyboard focus within the application.
<P><font color="navy">
- customizing the pointer with any kind of shape, color...etc
</font><P>
<P>
Doable, but I don't know to what level KDE or GNOME supports this.  It
would have to be done in the Window Manager in order for it to be
applicable to all applications.
<P>
<P><font color="navy">
- features that help retrieve the cursor on the screen (key stroke, blinking
etc...)
</font><P>
I take it you mean "find it" - make it stand out visually so you can tell
where its at.  Again, this would be a function of the window manager.  None
of them currently do anything like this.  At least not that I know of.
<P><font color="navy">
- instant zooming of the screen (by function key for example)
</font><P>
This would be a function of the X server, not the window manager or GNOME
or KDE.  None of the X servers have a "zoom" per se, but they all support
on the fly resolution switching via the keyboard.
<P><font color="navy">
- changing screen color/ resolution etc on the fly
</font><P>
Resolution switching can be done with CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE with the Xi Graphics 
server.  I think XFree86 does the same.  But with either you have to configure 
the server properly for this to work properly.  I don't use this feature so 
couldn't explain how its done.
<P>
By "changing color" I take it to mean the color of the background and/or
borders/frames around windows.  This would be a function of the window
manager.  CDE (a commercial environment that uses the Motif Window Manager,
aka mwm) supports this.  I don't think any other window managers support it
just yet but they might.
<P><font color="navy">
and I'm just here mentioning feature for disabled people, not for blind ones.
But one way or the other the IT community needs to remember that computer can
be a fantastic tool also for these peoples.
</font><P>
True.  The problem is finding someone who both understands what the issues
are and has an interest in doing the work (or organizing the work to be
done, either by the OSS community or by commercial vendors).
<P><font color="navy">
I'm sorry  I was taking this time, if you're not a person that can help here,
just pass along this message to anyone that could help.
</font><P>
I'll forward this reply to the Linux Gazette.  They'll probably post it and
maybe someone with better information than I will contact you.

Subject: <font color="maroon">article idea</font> 
<P>
I'm just writing in with an idea for a quick article. I've been
using the GNOME desktop. I'm a relative Linux newbie though, and
I think that many of your less experienced readers could probably
benefit from a short article about window managers. These are some
things I currently don't quite understand:
<ol>
<li>Terminology: The differences (if any) among a GUI, a window manager,
a desktop, and an interface. How do they differ from X windows?

<li>Do all window managers (like GNOME or KDE or FVWM95) run on top of X
windows?

<li>What exactly does it mean for an application to be GNOME or KDE
aware? What happens if it's not? Can you still run it?

<li>What exactly do the GTK+ (for GNOME) or Troll (for KDE) libraries do?

<li>How does the history of Linux (or UNIX) window managers compare to
that of say, the desktop given to Win98/95 users?
How, specifically, does Microsoft limit consumer's choices by giving
them just one kind of desktop, supposedly one designed
for ease of use?

<li>What's happening with Common Desktop Environment? Is it correct that
it's not widely adopted among Linux users because it's a resource hog,
or not open source?
</ol>
These are some questions that might make an enlightening, short article.
Thank you for your consideration.

<P>
This afternoon, Kevin Cullis, Business Account Manager at the
Denver Park Meadows CompUSA, graciously invited several Northern
Colorado Linux advocates and consultants to help him set up a 
demonstration Linux system. 
<P>
Attending were Lynn Danielson of CLUE, George Sowards, Brent Beerman, 
Fran Schneider, Alan Robertson of the High Availability Linux Project, 
and Sean Reifchneider and I of tummy.com, and Pete who has been advocating
Linux to Kevin for several years.
<P>
Kevin started out describing some of the opportunities he sees for
Linux in small and home offices, and was quite enthusiastic about
using Linux as a tool to leverage information in Intranets, Internets,
and Extranets (VPNs). We discussed the strengths and weaknesses
of Linux as a desktop machine, particularly the different style of 
administration required between Windows or Macintoshes and Linux, and the
ways in which the Linux community, particularly Wine, is moving closer
to achieving binary compatibility with Wintel applications.
We also discussed how reliability is the biggest selling factor for
those power users who are sick of the Blue Screen of Death.
<P>
We installed Red Hat 5.2 using server mode as a fresh install first, 
and Kevin was absolutely delighted with how simple it was. Three questions
and 20 minutes. 
<P>
While the applications were loading for Red Hat, Sean hooked up the
machine we brought loaded with Red Hat 5.2, KDE, Enlightenment and Applix.
Kevin was very impressed with KDE, I suspect because he was expecting
a much different interface. He could see selling a KDE system to someone
who had only used Windows or Macintoshes without any problem.
<P>
We then installed Caldera 1.3 on the first machine, as a dual boot. The
installation was only slightly more complicated than the Red Hat server mode.
<P>
This is only the beginning of the journey, though. Lynn Danielson will
be guiding Kevin through the basics of administering and demonstrating
these systems. On December 10th many of the participants today will
be meeting again at the Boulder Linux Users Group Mini-Expo to get 
a look a much broader range of Linux applications. 
<P>
As Sean said, a good Saturday of advocacy.

<P>
I have a lot of sympathy with Tim Gray's remarks on the intelligence of the
user, but (inevitably) I also have reservations.
<P>
I'm not a computer professional of any kind, but I bought a BBC computer
way back in 1983 and taught myself to program. I then learned two other
flavors of Basic, then QuickBasic, and currently Delphi for a hobby
application I've been selling since 1989. I also taught myself HTML (and
taught others afterwards). And while I haven't yet got to grips with Linux
because the latest version of my application is due out again, I have the
two versions of Linux recently distributed on UK magazines and I'm at least
90% confident of installing it. The other 10% will be the challenge.
<P>
But in common with many users, I apply the maxim "when all else fails read
the manual" (ironic when I write a manual for my own application). As a
result, I have spent months programming things that I then learned could
have been done much more simply *if I'd only known the command.* Well, at
the time I didn't! And the very wealth of material can be a hindrance if
you cannot yet slot all the bits into the right place in your mind. It's
also enormously frustrating to work with manuals, etc. (when you *do* read
them!), that gloss over the particular point that causes trouble. In some
cases, the problem is more imaginary than real - but it's real enough to
the beginner until he/she cracks it.
<P>
I work in a University Library where we do our best to get students using
computers. Some need only a hint, some will never understand more than a
tiny fragment. But we've produced the briefest handouts we can (1 sheet of
paper) and still had the student begging for help when the answer was
plainly written in the handout clutched in their fingers. People commonly
want people for help, not documents.
<P>
Finally, some people don't want education, they want to cut straight to the
answers. If we're honest, we all do it at different times. I've got stacks
of software that came on magazine discs. Unless they really fascinate me,
the only ones likely to survive a five-minute exploration are those that
convince me I can make them work with minimum effort. With me, as with many
users, it isn't intelligence that's in question, it's commitment to the
task in hand. And that determines whether the user is into exploration and
education, or just picking up a work-ready tool for an hour.
<P>
I'll see you with my newbie questions shortly!

	I read your remarks on Jonathan Creek with interest, but appreciate them
while you can. They only make about 6 episodes at a time, with (I think)
two series in all so far. I suspect the concept was a one-off series to
test the water and was successful enough to do more.
<P>
	My wife and I (as ordinary viewers) are confidently looking forward to a
third series in due course, but we've seen some very promising ideas
survive only one series. Britain also has a large percentage of viewers who
would quickly switch to soaps, game shows, or - if they stretched
themselves - Dallas et al. That does tend to kill shows that have promise
but need to build.
<P>
	Things like Jonathan Creek, Morse and so forth are probably no more common
on our screens than they are on yours. But you *are* right about beautiful
people. Using 'ordinary' people has the downside of making the programmes
look more ordinary to us, but more closely linked to reality as well. For
viewers abroad, of course, there is always an exotic flavour as well -
something the native (in any culture) usually misses.
<P>
	Happy viewing!

I just want to say that's a really sexy link at the top of the index
page... and even I can't miss it now... Hopefully I'll never forget to
download an issue now..
<P>
And even though you already know I think you guys are the best, I have
to tell you again....

Thanks  :)<BR>

Subject: <B>Telnet vs Rlogin</B> 
<P> 
In issue 34, article "Securing Your Linux Box", the author mentions
TELNET using the .rhosts file.  In the few systems I've used (BSD4,
SunOs, Solaris, Linux), "rlogin" uses the .rhosts file, but "telnet"
does not.  
<P> 
Other than that, great article!
thanks..
