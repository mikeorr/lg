This is only an occasional task, but an important one. The LG production
scripts are written in Python and use Cheetah templates; once in a while,
the scripts and the templates need to be modified. As well, having the
capability to do this would give us a little more flexibility in what we
can do with LG overall.

Time commitment:
	Monthly: minimal
	Overall: You'll be involved in the project planning, and will be able
			 to determine your level of involvement via your input
