\beginarticle{The Light Fantastic}

\textbf{\textit{The Light Fantastic}} is a \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comic_fantasy}{comic fantasy} novel by \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett}{Terry Pratchett}, the second of the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld}{Discworld} series.
It was published in \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986}{1986}. The title is a quote from a poem by \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milton}{John Milton}.

The events of the novel are a direct continuation of those in the preceding Discworld novel, \textit{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Colour_of_Magic}{The Colour of Magic}}.



After the wizard \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rincewind}{Rincewind} has fallen from the edge of the Discworld, his life is mysteriously saved as he lands back on it.
Meanwhile, the wizards of \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankh-Morpork}{Ankh-Morpork} discover that the Discworld will soon be destroyed unless the eight spells of the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octavo}{Octavo} are read: the most powerful spells in existence, one of which hides in Rincewind's head.
Consequently, several orders of wizards try to find Rincewind and kill him, led by Trymon, a former classmate of Rincewind's, who wishes to obtain the power of the spells for himself.

After Rincewind, who has met again with \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twoflower}{Twoflower}, escapes them, it becomes apparent that \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_A\%27Tuin}{Great A'Tuin}, the giant turtle that carries the Discworld, has set a new course that leads it directly into a red star with eight moons. Rincewind and Twoflower are accompanied by Cohen the Barbarian, an aging hero, and Bethan, a sacrificial virgin saved by Cohen, with assistance from Rincewind and Twoflower. 

As the star comes nearer and the magic on the Discworld becomes weaker, Trymon tries to put the seven spells still in the Octavo into his mind, in an attempt to save the world and gain ultimate power.
However, the spells prove too strong for him and his mind becomes a door into the ``\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Dimensions}{Dungeon Dimensions}'', from whence strange, horrible creatures try to escape into reality.
After winning a fight against them, Rincewind is able to read all eight spells aloud - whereupon the eight moons of the red star crack open and reveal eight tiny world-turtles that follow their parent A'Tuin on a course away from the star. The Octavo is then eaten by Twoflower's luggage chest.

The book ends with Twoflower and Rincewind parting company, as Twoflower decides to return home, leaving his luggage chest with Rincewind as a parting gift.

\textbf{Slayer} is a \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thrash_metal}{thrash metal} band featuring \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_King}{Kerry King} on \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guitar}{guitar}, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Araya}{Tom Araya} on \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bass_guitar}{bass} and \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vocals}{vocals}, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Hanneman}{Jeff Hanneman} (also on guitar). The band's classic material between \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983}{1983} and \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990}{1990} features \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Lombardo}{Dave Lombardo} on \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/drums}{drums} while \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bostaph}{Paul Bostaph} has played on the studio albums since the mid-\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990s}{90s}.  However, Lombardo has frequently rejoined Slayer for tours. The band has been recording aggressive metal since the early \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s}{1980s} and have maintained a steady musical approach since their formation in \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981}{1981} in \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington_Beach\%2C_California}{Huntington Beach}, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California}{California}.

\subsection*{Biography}

\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Lombardo}{Dave Lombardo} left the band in \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986}{1986} briefly during the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_in_Blood}{Reign in Blood} tour and was replaced by \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Scaglione}{Tony Scaglione} (\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiplash}{Whiplash}).  However after the tour was over, Lombardo came back and asked to rejoin Slayer.  Lombardo left the band again in \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992}{1992} (most believed for good) and formed a band called \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grip_Inc}{Grip Inc}.  \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_King}{Kerry King} recruited former \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_\%28band\%29}{Forbidden} drummer \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bostaph}{Paul Bostaph} who remained in the band until \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001}{2001}.  Bostaph claimed he had sustained an injury that would hinder his ability to play.  Shortly thereafter he announced he had joined the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area}{Bay Area} band \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic}{Systematic}.  Lombardo rejoined Slayer once again during the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Hates_Us_All}{God Hates Us All} tour and has remained there since.

Slayer (along with \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica}{Metallica}, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthrax_\%28band\%29}{Anthrax}, and others) are often credited with creating the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thrash_metal}{thrash metal} style, by speeding up the sound of \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Wave_Of_British_Heavy_Metal}{New Wave Of British Heavy Metal} bands like \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Maiden_\%28band\%29}{Iron Maiden} and \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom_\%28band\%29}{Venom}.  Slayer are also often credited with influencing the creation of the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/death_metal}{death metal} style, as well as providing musical elements for \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_metal}{black metal}.  Though Slayer never used the low ``grunt'' vocal style usually associated with death metal, their music -- most notably on the albums \textit{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_Awaits}{Hell Awaits}} (\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985}{1985}) and \textit{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_in_Blood}{Reign in Blood}} (\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986}{1986}) -- can be regarded, musically, as proto-death metal.  Moreover, these two albums were their first of many albums to be produced by well-known and respected \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Def_Jam}{Def Jam} Co-Founder, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Rubin}{Rick Rubin}.  

The \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986}{1986} album \textit{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_in_Blood}{Reign in Blood}} was described by the magazine \textit{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerrang\%21}{Kerrang!}} as ``the heaviest album of all time''.  

The band received their first \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy}{Grammy} nomination for ``Best Metal Performance'' on \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_8}{January 8}, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002}{2002}.

In \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996}{1996}, a lawsuit was brought against the band by the parents of Elyse Pahler, who accused the band of encouraging their daughter's murderers through their lyrics. The lawsuit was thrown out in \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001}{2001}.

\beginarticle{MACHINA II/The Friends and Enemies of Modern Music}

\textbf{\textit{MACHINA II/The Friends and Enemies of Modern Music}}, released \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_5}{September 5} \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_in_music}{2000}, is an internet-only compilation of recordings by \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smashing_Pumpkins}{The Smashing Pumpkins}. The songs, outtakes from the \textit{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MACHINA/The_Machines_of_God}{MACHINA/The Machines of God}} sessions, were released to a select few to be placed on the internet as a parting gift to the band's fans, and as a parting thrust to the band's record company, Virgin, who had refused to release the recordings.

At the time the Smashing Pumpkins released \textit{Machina II}, the band had already decided to split up. A limited run of 25 numbered vinyl albums, each accompanied by 3 10" vinyl \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EP}{EP}s, were made available to specially chosen fans, with the express instruction that the music be encoded and placed on the Internet. This request was duly complied with, and the tracks were made available for downloading in time for the band's final European tour.

\textit{Machina II}, the album proper, is a companion piece to \textit{Machina}, continuing the theme of that record. The band had run a competition for fans, in which fans were asked to decipher the meaning hidden in the records, with the single hint that ``June'' is a woman. In part, the \textit{Machina} records are a tribute to \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie}{David Bowie}'s \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziggy_Stardust}{Ziggy Stardust} persona.

\textit{Machina II} (the whole) contains several alternate versions of songs which originally appeared on \textit{Machina}, including ``Try, Try, Try'', ``Heavy Metal Machine'', ``Glass and the Ghost Children'' and ``Blue Skies Bring Tears''.

The subtitle ``The Friends and Enemies of Modern Music'' is a reference to an experiment \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Corgan}{Billy Corgan} carried out in April 2000, before the release of \textit{Machina II}, where he gave a fan a tape containing some rare tracks, also with the instruction that the songs be distributed. The tracks on this cassette were ``Glass' Theme'', ``The Everlasting Gaze (Disco King)'', ``Dross'', ``Blue Skies Bring Tears (Arising! version)'', ``If There Is a God'', ``Le Deux Machina (Mike Garson version)'', ``Heavy Metal Machine (Version I)'', ``Here's to the Atom Bomb'', ``Real Love'', ``Money (That's What I Want)'', ``X.Y.U.'', ``Once Upon a Time'', ``Crestfallen'', and an untitled instrumental. ``Here's to the Atom Bomb'' and the untitled track are incomplete, as the tape was a 60 minute copy of a 90 minute cassette.

\subsection*{Track Listing}

SPFC.org's (SPFC was one of the original distributors of the recordings) discography page mentions ``As there was no tracklist included with the release, song titles are given as their standard name, and some were given additional descriptive comments in parentheses by SPFC. A press release issued later includes slightly different versions of the song titles, which are given in quotes as appropriate.'' This information is preserved here, as the songs in question are available under both titles. ``Slow Dawn'' is also listed elsewhere as ``Slow Down''.

\subsubsection*{EP 1}

\beginarticle{Project Xanadu}

\textbf{Project Xanadu} was founded by \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson}{Ted Nelson} in \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960}{1960} as the original \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hypertext}{hypertext} project. It was referred to by \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Magazine}{Wired Magazine} as ``longest-running \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vaporware}{vaporware} story in the history of the computer industry'': the first attempt at implementation began in 1960, but it wasn't until 1998 that (incomplete) software was released.  In the meantime, the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web}{World Wide Web} came into being, fulfilling many of the project's underlying visions.

\subsection*{History}

During his first year as a graduate student at \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard}{Harvard}, Nelson began implementing the system which contained the basic outline of what would become Project Xanadu: a word processor capable of storing multiple versions, and displaying the differences between these versions. Though he did not complete this implementation, a mock up of the system proved sufficient to inspire interest in others. 

On top of this basic idea, Nelson wished to facilitate ``nonsequential writing'', where the user could choose their own path through an electronic document. He built upon this idea in a paper to the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery}{ACM} in 1965, calling the new idea ``zippered lists''. These zippered lists would allow compound documents to be formed from pieces of other documents, an idea he would later refer to as \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transclusion}{transclusion}. In 1967, while working for Harcourt, Brace he named his idea \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanadu}{Xanadu}, in honour of the poem \textit{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubla_Khan}{Kubla Khan}} by \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge}{Samuel Taylor Coleridge}.

Ted Nelson published his visionary ideas in his \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974}{1974} book \textit{Computer Lib / Dream Machines} and the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981}{1981} \textit{Literary Machines}. \textit{Computer Lib/Dream Machines} is written in a non-sequential fashion: it is a compilation of Nelson's random thoughts about computing, among other topics. The books are printed back to back, to be flipped between. \textit{Computer Lib} contains Nelson's thoughts on topics which angered him, \textit{Dream Machines} discusses his hopes for the potential of computers to assist the arts.

In 1972, Cal Daniels completed the first demo version of the Xanadu software on a computer Nelson had rented for the purpose, though Nelson soon ran out of money. In 1974, with the advent of computer networking, Nelson revised his thoughts about Xanadu into a centralised source of information which he dubbed a ``docuverse''. 

In the summer of 1979, Nelson lead the latest group of his followers, Roger Gregory, Mark Miller and Stuart Greene, to Swarthmore. In a house rented by Gregory, they hashed out their ideas for Xanadu; but at the end of the summer the group went their separate ways. Miller and Gregory created an addressing system based on \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transfinite_numbers}{transfinite numbers} which they called tumblers, which allowed any part of a file to be referenced. 

The group continued their work, almost to the point of bankruptcy. In 1983, however, Nelson met John Walker, founder of \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk}{Autodesk}, at a conference for the people mentioned in \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Levy}{Steven Levy}'s \textit{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers\%3A_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution}{Hackers}}, and the group started working on Xanadu with Autodesk's financial backing.

While at Autodesk, the group, lead by Gregory, completed a version of the software, written in the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_programming_language}{C programming language}, though the software didn't work as well as they wanted. A newer group of programmers, hired from \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_PARC}{Xerox PARC}, used this as justification to rewrite the software in \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk}{Smalltalk}. This effectively split the group into two factions, and the decision to rewrite put a deadline imposed by Autodesk out of the team's reach. In August 1992, Autodesk divested the Xanadu group, which became the Xanadu Operating Company, which struggled due to internal struggles and lack of investment. 

Charlie Smith, the founder of a company called \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex}{Memex} (the name of the hypertext system designed by \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush}{Vannevar Bush}), hired many of the Xanadu programmers and licensed the Xanadu technology, though Memex soon faced financial difficulties, and the unpaid programmers left, taking the computers with them. At around this time, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee}{Tim Berners-Lee} was developing the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web}{World Wide Web}.

In 1998, Nelson released the source code to Xanadu as Project Udanax, in the hope that the techniques and algorithms used could help to overturn some \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_patent_}{ software patents}.

\subsection*{The influence of Xanadu}

Many of Project Xanadu's proposed features have found their way into other \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_}{ hypertext systems}, including the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web}{World Wide Web} and \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiWiki}{WikiWiki} systems. Though lacking in the scope proposed by Nelson, transclusion is practised on the web. \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML}{HTML}'s IFRAME element allows full web pages to be included within other pages, and \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS}{RSS} aggregators provide compound web pages which consist of items from several locations.

Though \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/micropayment}{micropayment}s have been slow to take off, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal}{PayPal} is slowly gaining acceptance on the web.

\subsection*{The Web versus Xanadu}

There are several reasons why the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web}{World Wide Web} gained the popularity it now enjoys, while Project Xanadu remains a relatively obscure piece of computing history.

\begin{itemize}\item  \textbf{Complexity vs. Simplicity}
\begin{quote} Project Xanadu contains many complex ideas. Transclusion in Xanadu allows documents to contain any part of any other document, whereas the web merely allows linking to complete documents. The web is compatible with existing \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file_system}{file system} ideas, while Xanadu would possibly require the use of complicated databases, which may be difficult to maintain.

\end{quote}

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}\item  \textbf{Copyright}
\begin{quote}Xanadu's model of transclusion may have proven unpopular with authors. Despite the facilities for authors of documents to be paid when part of their work was \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion_}{ transcluded} in another's document, there seems to be no guarantee that the authors of these documents would receive proper credit in the transcluding work. Many authors object to their work being used as the basis of the sort of derivative works which transclusion would allow, but feel comfortable with having their complete work distributed on the web. 

\end{quote}

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}\item  \textbf{Availability}
\begin{quote}Another factor is that, quite simply, the web was there, and it worked, while Project Xanadu is still incomplete.

\end{quote}

\beginarticle{Equal Rites}

\textbf{\textit{Equal Rites}} is a \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comic_fantasy}{comic fantasy} novel by \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett}{Terry Pratchett}.
Published in \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987}{1987}, it is the third novel in the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld}{Discworld} series and the first where the main character is not \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rincewind}{Rincewind}.
It introduces the character of \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granny_Weatherwax}{Granny Weatherwax} who reappears in several later Discworld novels.

\subsection*{Synopsis}



The wizard Drum Billet knows that he will soon die and travels to a place where an eighth son of an eighth son is about to be born. Since such a boy is destined to become a wizard (on Discworld, the number eight has many of the magical properties that are ascribed to seven in the real world), Billet wants to pass his staff on to him as his successor.

However, the child born is actually a girl, Eskarina. Since Billet notices his mistake too late, the staff is passed on to her.

As she grows up, it becomes apparent that she has uncontrollable powers, and the local witch Granny Weatherwax decides to travel with her to the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unseen_University}{Unseen University} in \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankh-Morpork}{Ankh-Morpork} - but a female wizard is something completely unheard of on Discworld.

Esk is unsuccessful in her first, direct, attempt to gain entry to the University, but Granny Weatherwax finds another way in; as a servant. While there she follows the progress of an apprentice wizard named Simon, who she had met earlier, on her way to Ankh-Morpork. Simon is a sourceror; a wizard capable of devising new spells. His magic, however, causes a hole to be opened to the dark regions.

\subsection*{Notes}

For reasons never explained by Terry, Esk never appeared in the Discworld novels again. Although she was the main character in the book, the only character (besides Death) who would appear again after the book was \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granny_Weatherwax}{Granny Weatherwax}, but the events of the book were never even mentioned again; the next 'witches' book, \textit{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyrd_Sisters}{Wyrd Sisters}}, starts off with a virtually clean slate. The closest thing to a mention of the book that occurs later in the series is in \textit{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lords_and_Ladies}{Lords and Ladies}}, when Granny mentions to Archchancellor Mustrum Ridcully of \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unseen_University}{Unseen University} that she has been there a few times before. Another almost-mention is that granny learned to fly 'late in life' - an event of \textit{Equal Rites}.

\textbf{Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire} is the fourth book in the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter}{Harry Potter} series by \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling}{J. K. Rowling}. Published in \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000}{2000}, the release of this book had been surrounded by more hype than any other children's book in recent times - outdone only by its successor, \textit{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix}{Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}. At 636 pages (hardback British edition) it was fairly large for a children's book. The book attracted a lot of hype, because J. K. Rowling warned that one of the characters would be murdered in the book, raising pre-publishing rumours as to who the murdered character would be. This was also the first Harry Potter book to be published after \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pottermania}{Pottermania} had comprehensively gripped the world. Filming of the movie based on this book began in March \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004}{2004} and is due for release in November \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005}{2005}; the screenplay was written by \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kloves}{Steve Kloves}.

This novel won a \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award}{Hugo Award} in 2001.

\subsection*{Plot of the book}



In this book, Harry Potter spends his summer with the Weasleys in anticipation of the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch}{Quidditch} World Cup. During the World Cup, a group of \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Eater}{Death Eater}s attack a number of \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muggle}{muggle}s, but flee when the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Mark}{Dark Mark} - Voldemort's sign - mysteriously appears above them. The sign is found to have been made by a wand found with \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winky}{Winky}, the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House-Elf}{House-Elf} of \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barty_Crouch}{Barty Crouch}, a respected minister in the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic}{Ministry of Magic}. Winky is fired by her master at once. Crouch's treatment of Winky prompts \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger}{Hermione} to start campaigning for elves' rights.

When Harry arrives at Hogwarts, he finds that the Triwizard \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament}{Tournament} - which was banned since many participants died during it - was to be restarted, and to be held at Hogwarts. The names of all intending participants would be put into a goblet - known as the Goblet of Fire - which would shoot out one name from each of the three competing wizarding schools (\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogwarts}{Hogwarts}, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauxbatons}{Beauxbatons}, and \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durmstrang}{Durmstrang}). After choosing \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Krum}{Viktor Krum} from Durmstrang, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleur_Delacour}{Fleur Delacour} from Beauxbatons, and \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedric_Diggory}{Cedric Diggory} from Hogwarts, the Goblet spits out Harry's name - although he was too young to have added his name to the Goblet.

With help from his friends and teachers, Harry manages to make it through the first two parts of the Triwizard Tournament. During the second task{---}\allowhyphens{}to rescue the person the competitor would miss most{---}\allowhyphens{}though Harry finished outside the time limit, he was given bonus points by all but one of the judges{---}\allowhyphens{}as the limit was drawing close, with no sign of the others, he attempted to rescue all of the ``victims'', believing they would die. During this time, his relationship with his best friend, Ron Weasley, is strained by Harry's sudden explosion of fame. This fame soon backfires, as \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Prophet}{Daily Prophet} reporter \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Skeeter}{Rita Skeeter} begins to dig deep to find anything which will tarnish Harry's reputation. Harry's friendship with Ron is saved once Ron realises just how perilous the Tournament will be for Harry.

In the last part of the Tournament - in which the four competitors will have to run through a maze populated by many dangerous creatures - Harry and Cedric arrive at the trophy (placed in the centre of the maze), and decided, because of the help they provided to each other, that it wouldn't be right if either one won by himself. Instead, they decide to grab the trophy at the same time.

The trophy turns out to be a Portkey, a magical object which transports them to a graveyard - where they find \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew}{Peter Pettigrew} (also known as Wormtail) and \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voldemort}{Voldemort}. Peter kills Cedric using the unstoppable Avada Kedavra curse, then uses Harry's blood as part of a macabre ritual which results in Voldemort being reborn, more powerful than before, and immune to the charm which had prevented him from harming Harry twice before. Voldemort then summons the Death Eaters, and attempts to kill Harry, to prove that ``the boy who lived'' will not prove to be his undoing again.

 \end{figure}
Since Harry's and Voldemort's wands are formed from the same core - a feather from Fawkes - a freak phenomenon known as Priori Incantetum occurs, in which Voldemort's wand begins to produce ghostly echoes of its past victims - including Harry's parents. The ghosts hold off Voldemort while Harry manages to escape to the trophy.

On reaching Hogwarts again, Harry lands in the centre of the confusion caused by his disappearance. In the confusion, he is lead up to his castle by his \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Against_the_Dark_Arts}{Defense Against the Dark Arts} teacher, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastor_Moody}{Professor Moody}. Moody reveals that it was he who put Harry's name into the Goblet, who ensured that Harry made it through the three rounds of the tournment. At this point, Dumbledore barges into the room, and stops Moody, who is about to attack Harry. After his interrogation of ``Prof. Moody'', it is revealed that ``Moody'' was \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barty_Crouch_Jr.}{Barty Crouch's son} in disguise. The real professor Moody had been kept imprisoned in a magical trunk. Having learned that Voldemort had risen again, Dumbledore began proceedings to restart the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix}{Order of the Phoenix}. The Minister of Magic, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_Fudge}{Cornelius Fudge}, refused to believe that Voldemort had risen again, which results in Dumbledore being removed from several important posts within the wizard community, and the reputation of Harry Potter being trampled judiciously, in the next book, \textit{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix}{Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}.

\beginarticle{Guards! Guards!}

\textbf{\textit{Guards! Guards!}} is the 8th \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld}{Discworld} \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/novel}{novel} by \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett}{Terry Pratchett}, first published in \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989}{1989}. It is the first novel about the City Watch. The first \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld_\%28computer_game\%29}{Discworld computer game} borrowed heavily from \textit{Guards! Guards!} in terms of plot.

\subsection*{Synopsis}


The story follows a plot by a secret brotherhood, the Unique and Supreme Lodge of the Elucidated Brethren, to overthrow the Patrician and install a king, who would be under their control. Using a stolen magic book, they summon a dragon to strike fear into the people of \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankh-Morpork}{Ankh-Morpork}, so their ``heir'' to the throne will be accepted. It is the task of the Night Watch--\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Vimes}{Captain Vimes}, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_Colon}{Sergeant Colon}, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobby_Nobbs}{Corporal Nobbs}, and new volunteer \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot_Ironfoundersson}{Carrot Ironfoundersson}--to stop them, with some help from the librarian of the Unseen University, an orangutan trying to get the stolen book back.

The Watch is in bad condition; they are regarded as a bunch of drunks who just walk around ringing their bells. The arrival of Carrot changes this; Carrot has memorised the laws of Ankh-Morpork, and on his first day tries to arrest the head of the Guild of Thieves for theft. Carrot's enthusiasm rings with the feeling nagging at Captain Vimes; that the Watch should prevent crime. Vimes begins investigating the dragon appearances, which leads to an acquaintance with Sybil Ramkin, a breeder of swamp dragons.

Though the leader of the Elucidated Brethren is initially successful in controlling the dragon; and banishes it when he no longer needs it; he has not counted on the dragon's own magic. The dragon returns, and makes itself king of Ankh-Morpork, keeping the head of the Elucidated Brethren, the now imprisoned Patriarch's secretary, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupine_Wonse}{Wonse}, as his mouth piece; and demands the people of Ankh-Morpork bring him gold, for his bedding, and regular virgin sacrifices. 

Vimes is imprisoned, in the same cell as the Patrician; who has been leading a relatively comfortable life, with the help of the rats he uses as spies. The orangutan helps Vimes to escape; and he runs to the aid of Sybil, who has been chosen as the first virgin to be sacrificed. One of Sybil's dragon's, Errol, fights the king; and wins. While a crowd attempts to close in on the king to kill it, Sybil tries to plead for it, while Carrot places it under arrest; but Errol lets the dragon escape, to be his mate. 

\subsection*{Adaptations}
The novel has been adapted as:
\begin{itemize}\item  A ``Big Comic'' (\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_novel}{Graphic novel})
\item  A stage play scripted by \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Briggs}{Stephen Briggs} (script later published in book form)

\beginarticle{Feet of Clay}

\textbf{\textit{Feet of Clay}} is a \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld}{Discworld} novel by \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett}{Terry Pratchett} which parodies detective novels. It was published in \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996}{1996}. The story follows the members of The Watch, as they attempt to solve murders committed by a \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golem}{golem}.

\subsection*{Synopsis}



The story begins with the sale of a golem, under suspicious circumstances; and continues with the death of a priest, Father Tubelcek, and the Watch's subsequent investigation, led by new recruit Cheery Littlebottom, a dwarf \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alchemy}{alchemist} hired for a new \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forensics}{forensics} department.  By enlarging an image of the priest's eye, Cheery discovers that the last person he saw was a golem; she also finds a piece of paper in his mouth, similar to the chem used to give life to a golem.

\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Vimes}{Commander Vimes}, after thwarting an assassination attempt on himself, must keep an appointment with the Royal College of Heralds. After a brief education in heraldry by the chief herald, the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vampire}{vampire} Dragon, he is informed that he cannot have a family crest, as one exists, but was withdrawn after Vimes' ancestor killed a king. He is also told that \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobby_Nobbs}{Corporal Nobbs} is an Earl.

Later, the proprietor of the Dwarf Bread Museum is found dead, and the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrician_of_Ankh-Morpork}{Patrician} is found poisoned. Dorfl, a golem, tries to turn himself in for the murder, but \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot_Ironfoundersson}{Carrot} believes Dorfl was trying to bring the priest back to life the only way he knew how. 

Later, despite a constant watch, the Patrician is poisoned again, while across the city golems are committing suicide, leaving messages which include the phrase ``clay of my clay''. Commander Vimes tracks down Mildred Easy, the only member of the Patrician's staff who can't be located, and finds her at her at a funeral for her grandmother and baby brother, both poisoned in the same way as the Patrician. 

Carrot suspects that the golems have created a new golem to be their king, with the help of the priest to provide it's chem, and using the oven in the Dwarf Bread museum, but were ashamed when it started to kill people. Carrot and \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angua}{Angua} follow Dorfl, to find him mobbed by a crowd, which Carrot disperses, before arranging to buy Dorfl from his owner. Carrot then places the deed of ownership inside Dorfl's head, alongside his chem, which causes the golem some difficulty. As this happens, Fred Colon, who had been questioning golem owners, wakes to find himself tied up and escapes with the help of Wee Mad Arthur, a gnome rat hunter the Watch encountered while investigating a case of poisoned rats in a dwarf caf{\'e}\allowhyphens{}. Meanwhile, Commander Vimes, stressed over his inability to find how the Patrician is being poisoned, discovers a bottle of whiskey in his desk drawer.

Fred and Wee Mad Arthur are chased by the king golem, and manage to escape. The king falls a great height and is smashed on the ground, but Fred is amazed when the golem starts to piece itself back together. Vimes is visited by the heads of the Guilds, who have been told to search his desk. They are overpowered by the smell of whiskey, and see Vimes slumped over his desk. They find a packet of powder in the desk, but Vimes eats the contents. He knew the whiskey was planted in his desk so that he would be tempted, and swapped the arsenic planted there for a packet of sugar. He then realises how the Patrician is being poisoned; he goes to the palace to question Miss Easy, and finds that the candles used in the Patricians chambers are not used anywhere else; and that Miss Easy had taken the stumps to her grandmother.

Carrot, Angua and Cheery go to the candle factory, after making thir way through streets full of animals - Dorfl has determined that no one should have a master, and find the king golem. Dorfl faces the king, and eventually beats him, but is almost destroyed in the process. Vimes orders that he be taken away to be repaired, and given a tongue. Vimes then goes to face Dragon, who had been behind the plot. Dragon had long been preoccupied with preserving the royal lineage in Ankh-Morpork, and upon discovering evidence that Carrot is the heir, and horrified by his relationship with Angua, a werewolf, Dragon tried to get the Patrician out of the way, and install a fake, easily controlled, royal - Nobby - as ruler of the city. The solution had only occurred to Vimes after he found the whiskey and arsenic - only a vampire could have flown through his window, and remembered his visit to the College of Heraldry, where Dragon had pointed out the Candlemaker's crest in particular, and shown his the \textit{poisson}, both a heraldic symbol for a lamp, and a blatantly placed clue.

The book ends with Dorfl joining the Watch.

\beginarticle{The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents}

\textbf{The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents} is the 28th \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/novel}{novel} in \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett}{Terry Pratchett}'s \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld}{Discworld} series, published in \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001}{2001}. It was the first Discworld book to be aimed at the younger market, followed in that by \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wee_Free_Men}{The Wee Free Men} in 2003.



The Amazing Maurice is a talking cat, who leads his Educated Rodents, a group of talking rats, as they go from town to town being a plague so that their accomplice, a boy piper, can ``lure them all away'' from the town, after which they share the money the piper makes. The rats had gained intelligence from eating the waste from the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unseen_University}{Unseen University}; Maurice gained it after eating one of them.

The group is not completely happy; the leader of the rats, Hamnpork, despises Maurice, while Dangerous Beans, a blind rat who guides them like a \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guru}{guru}, wants to start a rat civilisation and both he and Peaches, the group's scribe, find their trickery unethical. The rats are seeking an ideal of humans and rats living together, following the example of their sacred book ``Mr Bunnsy Has an Adventure''. They agree to do one last job, in the town Bad Blintz. 

The rats set about planning their offensive, lead by Darktan, their general, while Maurice and Keith, the piper, look around. They are surprised to find that while the buildings are expensively built, the people have little food, and rats are hunted for more visciously than anywhere else. Maurice and Keith meet Malicia, the mayor's daughter, who is a story teller (her grandmother and great aunt were the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_Grimm}{Sisters Grim}). She soon discovers that Maurice can talk, and meets Sardines, a tap-dancing rat who is the most daring of the group. While talking to her, Maurice reveals that the rat-catchers have been passing off boot-laces as rait tails (for which they are paid 50c each).

As they set off to look in the rat-catchers' house, the rats discover many rat tunnels, which are empty, save for traps and poison. The two groups meet in the rat catchers' den, where they have been storing the food the rats are thought to have eaten, and find cages where the rats are being bred, for coarsing.

The rat-catchers return, and lock Keith and Malicia away, and take Hamnpork to be coarsed.. Maurice hides, and feels a voice trying to enter his mind. The rats feel it, and it returns many of them to being simple rats, to the dismay of Dangerous Beans. Darktan leads a group to rescue Hamnpork, while Peaches and Dangerous Beans free Keith and Malicia. Malicia lets slip that ``Mr Bunnsy Has an Adventure'' is a children's book, and Dangerous Peaches leaves in despair. 

Darktan's group is successful in rescuing an injured Hamnpork, though Darktan himself, the head of the Trap Disposal Unit, finds himself in a trap. After a \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_Death_Experience}{Near Death Experience}, and the death of Hamnpork, he assumes leadership, and sets out after Dangerous Beans. Maurice, in the meanwhile, has given in to his conscience and is also seeking them, but the voice gains power over him. Malicia and Keith, after gaining freedom, trick the rat catchers into revealing their secret by tricking them into thinking they have been poisoned. The rat catchers have created a powerful \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rat_king}{rat king}--several rats, tied together at the tail, who make a single mind with power over others--who is named Spider, being made of eight rats.

Spider is interested in Dangerous Beans; other rats he can control, but Dangerous Beans has a mind similar to his: one that thinks for others. Dangerous Beans refuses Spider's offer of jointly ruling, as Spider wants to wage war on humans. As this happens, Malicia and Keith, under Spider's control, are about to set free the trapped rats. Spider tries to destroy Dangerous Beans' mind; this is felt by his army of rats, and Maurice. Dangerous Beans' is able to resist, but Maurice reverts to being a cat, and the cat instinct tells him to pounce on Spider, though enough of his mind remains to tell him to sever the knot in Spider's tails.

Darktan's army, who have been fighting Spider's rats, find Peaches in Spider's lair, which is burning after Peaches dropped a match. Maurice emerges carrying Dangerous Beans. When he is safely out, he falls over and dies. In ghostly form, he sees the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Rats}{``Bone Rat''} coming for Dangerous Beans. He attacks him, but is picked up by Death, with whom he strikes a deal: one of his remaining lives for Dangerous Beans'.

Though Spider is defeated, there is still a problem remaining: the rat piper is due to arrive the next day. The rats set about rounding up the other, non-intelligent, rats ('keekees'). When the piper arrives, Keith challenges him. His pipe had been broken by the rat-catchers, so he uses a borrowed trombone, to the sounds of which Sardines comes out dancing. When the piper starts to play his magical pipe, the rats plug their ears to not be charmed. One rat does come out: a Mr. Clicky, a clockwork rat the rats use to test traps.

The piper calls Keith aside, and tells him the tricks of the trade: the pipe is just a dog whistle, the stories are made up so people will be scared into paying. Keith and the piper then lead the keekees out of town - Keith wants to maintain the story of the piper, and the rats want a convenient way to set the keekees free.

Once that has been done, the rats emerge, offering to tell the humans where to find the stolen food and money, in return for living peacefully with them. Maurice negotiates, selling the humans a promise of a brighter future, with the rats as a tourist attraction. Keith stays on as the town's piper, and the town becomes a tourist attraction, as Maurice predicted.

\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category\%3ADiscworld_books}{Category:Discworld books}

\textbf{\textit{A Hat Full of Sky}} (ISBN 0-385-60736-9) is a novel written by \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett}{Terry Pratchett} set on the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld}{Discworld}, written with younger readers in mind.  It is set two years after \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wee_Free_Men}{The Wee Free Men}, and features an 11-year old Tiffany Aching. 



\subsection*{Synopsis}

\textit{A Hat Full of Sky} begins with a disembodied presence roaming the hills, looking for a strong mind. Tiffany is trying on a new pair of boots, and a new hat. She tries to look at herself in her small, cracked mirror, but is unable to see herself properly. Tiffany is a witch, though, and has a trick for these situations. She says ``see me'', and is able to see herself from the outside. Doing this, however, attracts the attention of the presence.

Tiffany is packing her things, preparing to travel with Miss Tick to the home of Miss Level, a research witch with whom Tiffany is to learn about witchcraft. On the journey, Tiffany meets Roland, who always seems to be where she is. He gives her a gift: a silver horse, like the White Horse on the chalk. As Tiffany explains to Miss Tick, in the words of Granny Aching, ``'Taint what a horse \textit{looks} like, it's what a horse \textit{be}''.

In the home of the Nac Mac Feegle, Rob Anybody is being taught to write by his new wife, Jeannie, the \textit{kelda}. They are interrupted by Big Yan, who tells them that the witches are being followed by a ``hiver'', the disembodied presence. Rob wants to send word to Tiffany of this, but is forbidden by Jeannie, who has taken a dislike to Tiffany, who was briefly kelda, and briefly engaged to Rob. Miss Tick suspects that something is wrong though, while waiting for a coach, she builds a ``shamble'', a \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cat\%27s_cradle_\%28string_game\%29}{cat's cradle} with some alive inside it which is used to detect magic, and both she and Tiffany feel the presence of the hiver, which quickly leaves.

Eventually they meet Miss Level. Told to go away while Miss Tick talks to Miss Level, Tiffany finds her curiosity aroused when Miss Level says that she left her spectacles on her other nose. Tiffany and Miss Level travel by broomstick to Miss Level's cottage, and Tiffany is glad to arrive: she suffers from \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/air_sickness}{air sickness}.

Tiffany is soon worried, though. She hears sounds of another person in the cottage, and while she eats, an invisible person tries to take her plate. In the morning, she notices a circus poster, featuring ``Topsy and Tipsy: The Amazing Mind Reading Act''. She meets Miss Level, or rather, both of Miss Level, who explains that she was born with two bodies, with a single mind. Tiffany then guesses that prior to becoming a witch, Miss Level had been a circus performer. Miss Level also explains about Oswald, an ``ondageist'' - the opposite of a \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poltergeist}{poltergeist}, who compulsively cleans. 

Miss Level then introduces Tiffany to her area of research: finding the instructions for the use of plants, which the Creator of the Discworld has written on or in the plants themselves. As an example, she shows Tiffany that the message in a walnut may be read with a green magnifying glass, lit with a taper of red cotton: ``May contain nut''.

The book then features a passage from \textit{Hivers: A Dissertation Upon a Device of Amazing Cunning} by the wizard Sensibility Bustle, who tried to capture a hiver, and was consumed by it. Back in the home of the Feegles, Jeannie tells Rob that she will have seven sons and a daughter, and orders him to go find Tiffany: he was so worried about her that he wouldn't even get drunk. Rob organises the Feegle, and determines that they need a plan: he writes ``PLN'' on piece of paper, and they set off. Awf'ly Wee Billy, the clan's new gonnagle, tells them about \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scarecrow}{scarecrow}s, and they manage to disguise themselves in a somewhat human shape, bribing coach drivers to go as quickly as possible with gold of an ancient king, whose burial ground they live in.

Tiffany is finding the work of witches dull: helping people who don't seem to show appreciation. She particularly dreads visiting Mr. Weavall, an old man whose only concern is that he is able to pay for his own funeral. Tiffany, who he calls Mary, after his long-dead daughter, has to count his money at every visit. She is becoming disheartened, since she isn't able to make a shamble. She is visited by another trainee with, Petulia, who has a tendency to get tangled up in the numerous amulets she wears. Petulia takes Tiffany to a meeting of trainee witches, which is presided over by Annagramma, who takes great pleasure in mocking the other girls. Annagramma mocks Tiffany for the virtual hat she was given by Mistress Weatherwax, but blames Mistress Weatherwax for messing with her head. She, like Mrc. Earwig, who is teaching her, believes that witchcraft should be done ``properly'', with sacred circles, written spells, and a hierarchy of witches (with her on, or near, the top). Back at Miss Level's house, Tiffany wants to see the virtual hat, which had been so clearly visible to her before. She says ``see me'', and the hiver occupies the space left where her mind had been.

Tiffany, controlled by the hiver, now finds her chores intolerable. She finds that she now has power, and uses magic for every task, including making cheese, which she had enjoyed before. While making it though, a part of her writes ``help me'' on the table. She tells Miss Level about the new memories she suddenly has, of being a great lizard, and speaks with a man's voice. The hiver is taking over, and the Nac Mac Feegle arrive too late to save her.

Miss Level finds the Nac Mac Feegle, and they tell her about the hiver, and about her ``see me'' trick. Miss Level tells them that this is Borrowing, and that you have to learn to protect yourself before even trying it. Tiffany, drunk with new-found power, goes to the house of Mrs. Earwig to find Annagramma. She scares Annagramma with her power, though every time she speaks, she adds a faint ``help me'', and together they go to buy the various trinkets Annagramma thinks are necessary for witches to possess. At the shop of the dwarf Zakzak Tiffany starts to argue over the price of the items. Zakzak calls his wizard, Brian, to deal with them, but Tiffany knows that Brian is not a real wizard, and asks if he knows what happens to the rest of the mass of a person who is turned into a frog. When he says that he doesn't know, Tiffany shows him: she turns him into a frog, which is accompanied by a large pink balloon. Zakzak agrees to Tiffany's discount to have his ``wizard'' back. 

Miss Level and the Nac Mac Feegle are discussing how to return Tiffany to herself. The Feegles tell her that they will go into Tiffany's head and fight the hiver: the Feegles are able to walk between worlds. Tiffany returns, and Miss Level is puzzled about how Tiffany was able to buy the new things she has, but soon guesses that Tiffany stole Mr. Weavall's money. Half of her confronts Tiffany, but the hiver in Tiffany kills her. The rest of Miss Level is struck senseless by the death of part of her, and the Feegles try to figure out how to get into Tiffany's head. They see the necklace, and decide to follow the horse.

Inside Tiffany's head, they find a land like Tiffany's home, and the cottage which used to belong to Granny Aching. They notice that the sun is setting, a sign that the part of Tiffany that is still herself is fading, when a sign comes to them from Tiffany. Written on the wall, they read ``Sheep's wool, Turpentine, Jolly Sailor'' - the smells that remind Tiffany of Granny Aching. Rob sends the rest of the Feegles out to steal these items, while he remains to guard Tiffany. With these scents, the hiver is drawn out, and into a fight with the Feegles, and is eventually driven away when the land starts to form hills in the shape of Tiffany.

The awakened Tiffany is still not free of the hiver; she doesn't know which mind is hers. Mistress Weatherwax, who was attracted by the use of magic, brings her back to herself. Miss Level, has recovered, but hasn't noticed that half of her is gone. She notices while the ghost of her other half is carrying tea for Mistress Weatherwax, who helps her to maintain control of the ghost of her other part. 

Tiffany and Mistress Weatherwax go about making Miss Level's usual visits, and Mistress Weatherwax uses her powers of ``headology'' to bring about the changes Miss Level had been trying to. Tiffany goes alone to Mr. Weavall's house, and is given the usual request to check the money box. She does, but finds that the copper money she had stolen has been replaced with gold by the Feegles. On seeing this, Mr. Weavall is changed utterly. He thanks Tiffany for stealing the money, for the gold he got in its stead, sets off to propose to Widow Tussy. Tiffany and Mistress Weatherwax then go to find the hiver, which keeps away from them. 

The next day, Petulia comes to see if they need help, and tells them that the Witch trials are on. Mistress Weatherwax sends Petulia to tell Miss Level that she is going to the trials, and sets off for the trials with Tiffany. Along the way, she tells Tiffany to call her Granny. At the trials, Tiffany causes a stir by calling Mistress Weatherwax ``Granny'', and another when she sees the hiver approach. While she was trying to become herself again, Granny had been talking to sensibilty Bustle through Tiffany, and Tiffany was left with a nagging feeling about three wishes, that the third wish was important. She goes around trying to find out from various witches what the third wish is, but only Granny can tell her: to undo what the first two did.

Making a shamble, using Rob, Tiffany traps the hiver, and talks to it. She has learned that the hiver isn't trying to hurt people, but that it is afraid; she offers it protection. The hiver wants to be human, because it wants boredom: knowing everything has driven it mad. Tiffany helps it, she uses the analogy of \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evolution}{evolution} to show the hiver, which refers to itself as ``us'', that humans are made up of as many different parts as it is, and names it ``Arthur''. The hiver wants to die, so it can put things right, so she helps it find the door, and helps it through. Rob comes with her: he is under a \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geas}{geas} to ensure her safety. 

Tiffany helps the hiver to understand that no one knows what death is like, and watches it walk across the black desert. When it has left, though, she can no longer find the door. Death appears, and explains that the rules say that you can come in, but not leave, and advises her not to sleep. Granny follows her through the door, and drags her and Rob out; telling her that part of being a witch is that they weren't \textit{her} rules, and that all witches help people to find their way to death, but to never speak of it.

Back at the trials, Tiffany wakes in the healing tent, surrounded by the other yound witches. All of the witches know what has happened, and some have seen the essence of a white horse, but Annagramma refuses to believe it, until Tiffany shakes black sand from her boot. Tiffany is told that Granny gave her her hat, which astounds the other witches. The trials go slowly, with everyone expecting Tiffany to challenge Granny, but they both sit, staring at each other. Eventually, Petulia gets up to do the ``pig trick'', but does it with a sausage, which impresses many people there. The reaction gives her the courage to stand up to Annagramma.

A week later, Tiffany goes to visit Granny. On the way, she meets a witch made of bees, and dances with it. She meets granny, and returns her hat. Granny explains that it is important for a witch to find her own hat, and Tiffany reflects that Granny Aching used the sky as hers. Granny gives her a lesson in witchcraft. She takes a stick and uses it as a magic wand, and makes Tiffany try the same, but it doesn't work. This, Grany says, is because the power comes from within. Granny then tells her to throw the silver horse down the well. Tiffany reflects that this is another test, and refuses. Granny congratulates her, ``If you don't know when to be a human being, you don't know when to be a witch''.

Tiffany returns to the Chalk, and assumes the role left vacant by Granny Aching. She tends to the sheep, and to the people, who are filled with pride to have their own witch. She also visits Jeannie, to see her children. In the end, Tiffany throws away the hat she had been using, and decides to use the sky as her hat.

\textbf{\textit{Twenty Years After}} (\textit{Vingt ans apr{\`e}\allowhyphens{}s}) is a novel by \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Dumas\%2C_p\%C3\%A8re}{Alexandre Dumas, p{\`e}\allowhyphens{}re}.

This sequel to \textit{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers}{The Three Musketeers}} and a book of the so-called 
\textit{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D\%27Artagnan_Romances}{D'Artagnan Romances}} (the third and last book being \textit{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vicomte_de_Bragelonne}{The Vicomte de Bragelonne}}) was serialized from January to August, 1845.

\subsection*{Synopsis}



The action begins under \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Austria}{Queen Anne of Austria} regency and \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_Mazarin}{Cardinal Mazarin} ruling. \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D\%27Artagnan}{D'Artagnan}, who seemed to have a promising career ahead of him at the end of \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers}{The Three Musketeers}, has for twenty years remained a lieutenant in the Musketeers, and seems unlikely to progress, despite his ambition and the debt the queen owes him. By chance, however, he is summoned by Mazarin, who requires an escort, as the French people detest Mazarin, and are on the brink of rebellion. D'Artagnan is sent to the Bastille to retrieve a prisoner, who turns out to be his old friend and former adversary, Rochefort.

Rochefort is brought to his audience with Mazarin, after renewing his acquaintance with D'Artagnan and making a promise to aid his advancement, where he learns that the cause for his imprisonment was his refusal to serve Mazarin at an earlier stage. He does, however, remember his promise, and though he offers his own service to Mazarin, he soon learns that he is to be returned to the Bastille, though this does not deter him from speaking highly of the achievements of D'Artagnan and the Three Musketeers.

Having determined that D'Artagnan was the man he sought, Mazarin enters the chambers of the Queen to let her know that he has enlisted the man who had served her so well twenty years earlier. The Queen, feeling guilty for having forgotten D'Artagnan's service, gives Mazarin a diamond ring which she had previously given D'Artagnan to be returned to him, which D'Artagnan had sold in her service. The avaricious Mazarin, however, merely uses the diamond to show D'Artagnan that he is once again to enter the Queen's service. He commissions D'Artagnan to go in search of his friends.

D'Artagnan is at a loss; he has completely lost touch with his friends, who have resumed their real names. Athos, the Comte de la F{\`e}\allowhyphens{}re, had returned to his estate near Blois; Porthos, Monsieur du Vallon, had married the lawyers wife; and Aramis, the Abb{\'e}\allowhyphens{} d'Herblay, had returned to the church. Fortune intervenes, however, when Planchet, his old servant, enters D'Artagnan's chambers, attempting to escape arrest for aiding the escape of Rochefort. Through Planchet, he locates Bazin, Aramis' old servant, now beadle at Notre Dame. Though Bazin is unwilling to help, D'Artagnan is able to find out, through an altar boy, that Bazin makes frequent visits to Noisy. D'Artagnan and Planchet go there, where they are set upon by a group who think them Frondeurs while outside the house of Madame de Longueville. When this group is satisfied that D'Artagnan is not the man they seek, Aramis surprises Planchet by dropping onto his horse from the tree in which he had been hiding.

Though D'Artagnan finds, through the decoration of Aramis' chambre, that the former musketeer who had thought of little other than being a priest is now a priest who thinks of little other than being a soldier, Aramis is not willing to enter into Mazarin's service. When the time for departure comes, D'Artagnan waits in hiding, suspecting that Aramis is the Frondeur who had been sought earlier, and is the lover of Madame de Longueville; a suspicion which is confirmed.

The visit to Aramis was not fruitless, as it yielded the address of Porthos. When D'Artagnan arrives at Porthos' estate he finds Mousqueton, who is overjoyed to meet D'Artagnan and Planchet. He finds that Porthos, despite his wealth and life spent in pursuit of amusement, is not happy. Porthos desires a title, and with this bait D'Artagnan lures him into Mazarin's service. 

D'Artagnan then continues on his  search, seeking Athos, who he finds almost completely changed, to be an example to his ward, Raoul. Though Athos will not be enlisted into Mazarin's service, the two arrange to meet again in Paris; Athos wishes to bring Raoul there to help him to become a gentleman, and also to separate him from Louise de Valliere, who Raoul is obsessed with. In Paris, Porthos visits Madame de Chevreuse, the former mistress of Aramis, with whom, under the name Marie Michon, Aramis had much communication in The Three Musketeers. Athos reveals, discreetly, that Raoul is the son born of a chance encounter he had with her, and through her gets a letter of recommendation for Raoul to join the army.

The scene then changes, to focus on the Duc de Beaufort, Mazarin's prisoner at Vicennes, who finds a new jailer, Athos' servant, the silent Grimaud. Grimaud instantly makes himself disagreeable to the Duc, as part of an escape plot. Using messages passed to Rochefort using tennis balls, they arrange to have a meal on Whitsuntide, to which La Ram{\'e}\allowhyphens{}e, second in command of the prison, is invited. The escape is successful, but D'Artagnan and Porthos are in pursuit.

After a race against time, and having defeated several adversaries along the way, Porthos and D'Artagnan find themselves in the dark, surrounded, with swords crossed against adversaries equal to them, who are revealed to be Athos and Aramis. The four arrange to meet in Paris at the Place Royale, both parties, now finding themselves enemies, enter fearing a duel, but they reconcile and renew their vows of friendship. 

As this is going on, Raoul is travelling to join the army. Along the road he sees a gentleman of around the same age, and tries to make haste to join him. The other gentleman reaches the ferry before him, but is thrown into the river. Raoul, who is used to fording rivers, saves the gentleman, the Comte de Guiche, and the two become friends. Further along the road, the debt is repaid when the Comte saves Raoul when they are attacked by Spanish soldiers. After the fight, they find a man who is close to death, who requests the last rites. They help him to a nearby inn, and find a travelling monk. This monk is unpleasant to them, and does not seem inclined to perform this service, so they force him to go to the inn. Once there, the monk hears the confession. The dying man reveals that he was the executioner of B{\'e}\allowhyphens{}thune, and confesses his part in the execution of Milady. The monk reveals himself as her son, and stabs the executioner. 

Grimaud, who is to join Raoul, comes upon the inn just as this is taking place, though too late to prevent it, or to detain the monk. After hearing what happened from the dying man, making his excuses to Raoul, he departs to warn Athos about the son of Milady. After his departure, Raoul and Guiche are forced to retreat when the Spanish come upon the town. After joining the army of the Prince de Cond{\'e}\allowhyphens{} Raoul provides assitance in interrogating the prisoner brought by Guiche and him, when the prisoner feigns to misunderstand them in several languages. Once they have learned the location of the Spanish army, they set out for battle, Raoul accompanying the Prince.

\subsection*{Interpretation}

The album is almost a concept album in that the theme of people as puppets runs through most of the songs on the album. Many of the songs deal with a particular ``master'': anger in ``Battery'', addiction in ``Master of Puppets'', madness in ``Welcome Home (Sanitarium)'', and religion in ``Leper Messiah''. In addition, the notion of soldiers as cannon fodder is explored in ``Disposable Heroes'' and, to stretch the point somewhat, even the reference to the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu_Mythos}{Cthulhu Mythos} in ``The Thing That Should Not Be'' brings to mind the followers of a cult; ``Orion'', the hunter of Greek myth, was killed by \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis}{Artemis} after he became her follower. ``Damage Inc.'', the album's final track, is a call of non-conformity, to cut the strings of the puppet master.

The album's cover gives hint to some of the threads of the album. The cover shows a military cemetery with crosses as grave stones, bringing to mind both the dead soldiers of ``Disposable Heroes'' as well as the followers of the corrupt preacher of ``Leper Messiah''. The grave stones are attached by strings to a pair of controlling, puppet master-like, hands reaching down from above.

\subsection*{Historical Significance}

\textit{Master of Puppets} occupies the central position in the recorded output of Metallica's career, and is also regarded as one of the most important albums in the history of the metal genre.  

For many Metallica fans, particularly those fans who first experienced the album in late 1980s, \textit{Master of Puppets} represents a kind of golden age in the band's history, demonstrating now-classic approaches to speed/thrash metal songwriting and precision ensemble performance, as well as showcasing the classic line up of Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett, and Burton.  Indeed, a significant part of how the album is remembered stems from the fact that it was the last album Burton recorded (he was killed in a tour bus accident during the tour to support the album).  

\textit{Master of Puppets} is also noteworthy for the way it seemed to speak to real issues instead of simply wallowing in shocking occultism, fantasy, and mysticism, or escaping into hedonistic male lust.  As such, many commentators see the album as the second in a trilogy of albums (coming between \textit{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ride_the_Lightning}{Ride the Lightning}} (1984) and \textit{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...And_Justice_for_All_\%28album\%29}{...And Justice for All}} (1988)) which are credited with injecting a distinct level of ``seriousness'' into heavy metal.  

In terms of both musical technique and industry marketing, \textit{Master of Puppets} provided many metal fans with a clear alternative to the commercially visible (and increasingly pop-oriented) sounds of groups like \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_\%28band\%29}{Poison}, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\%C3\%B6tley_Cr\%C3\%BCe}{M{\"o}\allowhyphens{}tley Cr{\"u}\allowhyphens{}e}, and \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiet_Riot}{Quiet Riot}.  Not only was the music on \textit{Master of Puppets} complex, virtuosic, and very heavy, but Metallica also emphasized a decidedly ``normal'' visual presentation of themselves, sporting a costume of ripped jeans, t-shirts, and unteased long hair that contrasted the spectacular androgyny of Poison, et al.  It was in this construction of the ``real'' that Metallica found success: real music played by real musicians who looked like real people.

\textit{Master of Puppets} features Metallica's most famous song, ``Master of Puppets''.  Clocking in at over eight minutes, the song's complex structure serves as a kind of metaphor for the topic of control that runs throughout the song (and the entire album).  The lyrics topically refer to drug addiction (evidenced by lines such as ``Chop your breakfast on a mirror'') as a source for the loss of personal independence and control, however Metallica refrain from using the song for an explicitly anti-drug ``message.''  Instead of saying ``drugs are bad, don't do them,'' the music offers up a competing and more nuanced argument: ``drugs are bad \textit{because} you will lose all self-control and independence.''  Moreover, the song implies that the level of ensemble precision required to write and perform the music in ``Master of Puppets'' cannot be accomplished if one is a slave to a drug addiction.  

In addition to physically intense metal riffs, the song features a lengthy interlude comprised of clean guitars, plaintive melodic figuration, and a clear-cut presentation of diatonic harmony.  This type of quiet repose, while ultimately traceable to songs like ``Fade to Black'' (from \textit{Ride the Lightning}), also appears in ``Orion'' and signals the representation of musical interiority avoided initially, though later adopted, by other thrash bands such as Slayer and Megadeth (and typically understood as antithetical to the musical image of the thrash metal style).  Still, in a broader sense these quieter sections operated as a type of musical complexity that was highly valued by Metallica fans.  As such, the song presents competing experiences of personal control: precise ensemble playing across a lengthy and complicated musical structure serve as powerful metaphors for staying \textit{in} control, whereas the lyrics{'}\allowhyphens{} topic of drug abuse represents but one means of complete submission and the \textit{loss} of control.

Nevertheless, the lack of an explicit anti-drug message in ``Master of Puppets'' was a somewhat controversial move in the mid 1980s.  Not only had the U.S. \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_drugs}{War on drugs} received renewed attention due to the efforts of First Lady \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Reagan}{Nancy Reagan}'s ``\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Say_No}{Just Say No}'' campaign (begun in 1984), but the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMRC}{PMRC}'s hearings in 1985 had helped to create a crisis atmosphere with respect to adolescents and the media.  As such, the entire \textit{Master of Puppets} album was designated as ``non-compliant'' by the PMRC, who specifically pointed to the song ``Master of Puppets'' as an example of harmful content.  

Not only do the songs on \textit{Master of Puppets} serve as the foundation for the repertoire of most Metallica tribute bands, but in February 2002 the American \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_metal_}{ progressive metal} group \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_Theater_}{ Dream Theater} performed the entire album as an homage to Metallica.  As \textit{Master of Puppets} approaches its twenty-year anniversary its stature in the metal world is continually being reinforced.

Temple of the Dog was started by Chris Cornell. After the death of his former roommate, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Love_Bone}{Mother Love Bone} singer \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wood}{Andrew Wood}, Cornell wrote two songs in tribute: ``Say Hello 2 Heaven'' and ``Reach Down''. Cornell approached Wood's former bandmates, Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament, with the intention of releasing the songs as a single.

With the band completed with the addition of Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron and Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McCready, the band started rehearsing the songs. The rehearsals soon lead to several new songs, and the single soon became an album. 

Eddie Vedder, who had flown to Seattle to audition to be Pearl Jam's singer, ended up providing backing vocals. ``Hunger Strike'' became a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell was having trouble with the vocals at practice, when Vedder stepped in. Cornell later said that ``he sang half of that song not even knowing that I'd wanted the part to be there and he sang it exactly the way I was thinking about doing it, just instinctively''.

Vedder's role on the album, and appearance in the video released to accompany ``Hunger Strike'' confused and angered several people. Pearl Jam fans, who were not aware of the background of the project, saw Vedder's lesser role as a slight; while fans of Soundgarden and Mother Love Bone presumed that Vedder's appearance on the album was due to record company machinations.

Aside from a show the band played in Seattle, at the Off Ramp Caf{\'e}\allowhyphens{}, on \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_13}{November 13}, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990}{1990}, while rehearsing and writing the material for the album, the band had two opportunities to perform the material live. In October 1991, both Soundgarden and Pearl Jam appeared at the Foundations Forum showcase, and in 1992 the band played at the last show of that year's \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lollapalooza}{Lollapalooza} festival. 

``All Night Thing'' (as well as Soundgarden's ``Loud Love'') appears on the soundtrack of \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne\%27s_World}{Wayne's World}, though not on the soundtrack album.

Though many fans regard him as being a \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanist}{Satanist}, he regards these people as ``dumb''.

In addition to apperaring on Slayer's albums, he has also made guest appearances as lead guitarist, including:

He also spent a short while as a guitarist in \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megadeth}{Megadeth}, though this was only a temporary arrangement. 

He is noted for openly speaking his mind, which has lead to arguments with various other bands, including \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica}{Metallica}, when he branded \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Hammett}{Kirk Hammett} ``the most overrated player ever to grace the pages of a guitar magazine''.

His father owned a recording studio, where he watched many \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blues}{blues} guitarists play, and this early influence can still be heard in many of Pantera's songs.

At an early age he began entering state-wide guitar competitions, and by the age of 16 was banned from entering them, having won too often. It was through the prizes won at these competition that he was able to start Pantera, including the guitar that has since become his tradmark.

He frequently graces the pages of guitar magazines, both in adverts for equipment he endorses, and in the reader's polls, where he frequents the top 10 metal guitarist spots. He has also contributed a long running column in Guitar World magazine, which has been compiled in the book ``Riffer Madness'' (ISBN 0769291015)

His brother, Vinnie Paul, also plays drums in Pantera. The two have also played in a project with \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Allan_Coe}{David Allan Coe} called ``Rebel Meets Rebel'', and have started a new band, \textit{Gasoline}, during Pantera's hiatus, as well as the \textit{New Found Power} project.

The album's influence has been most pronounced on the American \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/death_metal}{death metal} scene which developed in the late \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s}{1980s} and early \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990s}{1990s}, though it is also a seminal album of the speed metal genre.  \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer}{Produced} by \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Rubin}{Rick Rubin}, \textit{Reign in Blood} largely abandoned the  \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/progressive_rock}{prog}-influenced stylings of \textit{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_Awaits}{Hell Awaits}}for quick beats and a runtime of under half an hour.

My name is Jimmy O'Regan, and I'm from \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurles}{Thurles}, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Tipperary}{County Tipperary}, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland}{Ireland}. I'm a 24 year old factory worker, waiting for the slump in computing to end... hopefully. I have a son named \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User\%3AJimregan/Mark}{Mark} who will be 7 in June--that's him on the right.

Though I'm also interested in \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux}{Linux} and \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software}{Free Software}, my main interest (for Wikipedia purposes at least) is in music, particularly in \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grunge}{grunge}, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/punk}{punk}, and \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heavy_metal_music}{metal}, and \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guitar}{guitar} music in general. As of June 12th, I am \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia\%3AWikipedians_by_number_of_edits}{279th most active} in the main name space and 262nd in all namespaces; as of April 10 I'm \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia\%3AList_of_Wikipedians_by_most_recent_edit}{308th} in the list of most recent edits. I'm an \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia\%3AAdministrators}{admin} - but don't ask me about a cabal, 'cause I wouldn't know about it. (Besides, there is no cabal).

As well as making edits to Wikipedia, I also try to repair the damage a monotonous job (and \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beer}{beer}...) has done to my brain by \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Proofreaders}{proofreading} and answering \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Gazette}{linux related} questions.

Hi Jim I'm listening to Fruupp at this very second- I managed to download Prince of Heavens eyes earlier which is an album I remember from my very long ago youth- I used to own this album in 1976, and probably havn't heard it since then... nostalgia corner! BTW I've got Carcass' first album as well (but havn't hear Heartwork), I wonder if I'm the only person in the world to have both??? \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User\%3AQuercusrobur}{quercus robur} 21:14, 31 Jul 2003 (UTC)

Will do. I've been watching this user for a while and their determination to remove the word \textit{terrorist} while using \textit{six counties} pretty much makes clear their POV agenda.

Hi Jim, if you get a chance could you take a look at \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_sex_abuse_allegations}{Roman Catholic sex abuse allegations}. I took a look at it tonight and almost threw up! As Carlsberg would say, 'probably the worst article in the world'. I started doing a rewrite and in the end could find about three lines in the whole diatribe worth salvaging. So I re-wrote the whole thing in one 7 hour stretch!!! 31 friggin' K! I'm interested to hear your opinion on it now. lol \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User\%3AJtdirl}{Fear{\'E}\allowhyphens{}IREANN} 02:12, 9 Aug 2003 (UTC)

Thanks for the comment. After 7 hours I was bloody exhausted writing the damn thing. Eloquence still seems to want to POV the thing. We had an edit war tonight over his attempt to add in stuff. Now he has called a vote on a proposed POV naming he wants (that's after I kept reverting his attempts to unilaterally name it (shades of his unilateral date changing all over again. *sigh*). So please feel free to cast your vote. (God I am soooo fed up fighting NPOV battles lately on wiki. Some people seem to see wiki as their own private soap box to push POVs, pace the Sinn F{\'e}\allowhyphens{}in nut earlier in the week.) lol \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User\%3AJtdirl}{Fear{\'E}\allowhyphens{}IREANN} 02:24, 10 Aug 2003 (UTC)

\begin{quote}I'm having difficulty comparing versions at the moment... There we have it - as of last edit, so far as I can see, he's removing the footnote about ages of consent, and adding that the scandals lead to a crisis of faith in followers? In the former case, I'd leave your footnote - the age of consent is mentioned; but there is an article about the different ages of consent around the world (I remember editing it) - maybe link to it, and trim the footnote accordingly? Did you know that lesbians are favoured wrt the age of consent in Ireland, btw? It scares me that there's so much confusion about the age of consent here; two departments of the government were at each other's throats last year or the year before because of a pamphlet which perpetuated the myth that the age of consent (for heterosexuals) is 16 here. As to the former, I think that's a fair addition; it was one of the things which lead to my crisis of faith at least (mainly though, it was that most of the church's dogma is at odds with most of what Christ actually said -  read the Bible at an early enough age, and haven't been classifiable religiously since :) -- \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User\%3AJimregan}{Jim Regan} 03:17, 10 Aug 2003 (UTC)

IBIZA!!! bastard!!! :-) It'll probably be colder there than Ireland though, hee hee. I'm afraid I too am rusty as hell when in comes to the mother tongue. I last learnt Irish for my Leaving Cert in 1984!!! And even then I was crap. I wonder would Conradh na Gaeilge be interested in getting people involved? We'll have to find someone. The irony is that since coming onto wiki I've used more Irish than I did in the previously nearly two decades. I actually began to say \textit{Slan leat} etc. I'm working on a newspaper article on wiki. I've offered the idea to the Irish Independent and am waiting to hear a yes or no. How long will you be gone for, Ibizasing? I was going to interview you as one of the Irish 'specimans' for the article, and see can I get Mav, Erik, Jimbo, 172 and a few others to talk about the 'wiki experience'. But Peter Carvosso, whom I offered the article to is away on his hols too until mid next week, while I am starting a new job on Monday, (or 'starting a new job Monday', in American english!) Anyway, enjoy Ibiza. Don't drink \textit{too} much! :-) And remember while there to keep going to an internet cafe to get your daily 'wiki-fix'. lol \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User\%3AJtdirl}{Fear{\'E}\allowhyphens{}IREANN} 01:37, 28 Aug 2003 (UTC)

Well, I was pretty good at Irish - I won a scholarship for the Gaeltacht. Every time I think about it, I feel a small pang of regret, as I honestly intended to write to people there, but alas, writing letters was outside the scope of my abilities then :( 

I think Conradh na Gaeilge would be interested; I had been thinking of using my sister's Irish teacher (my former Irish teacher) as a go-between with Tiobraid {\'A}\allowhyphens{}rann ag Labhairt, but most people need something to start from, and that just isn't provided. I'll give it a shot when I get back though.

I'll be in Ibiza for two weeks, but I don't know about the wiki fix; I offered to start a guitar textbook on Wikibooks, but I've been stuck for a way to describe these things without using the first person - I haven't \textit{ever} seen guitar written about in that fashion, as most articles are written as a description of a particular person's approach. Plus, I'd be working backwards; most of the stuff I do is thrash or death metal, which need a high degree of ability, and I'm trying to learn music theory and have been finding that the ``complicated'' topics, like using harmonic minor scales etc are the the things that I knew ``intuitively'' from my taste in music, while the simpler things, such as understanding basic time signatures, have caused me most hassle :) (It occurs now that those words may have meant absolutely nothing to you, but I may as well type this instead of hitting backspace!). Basically, I have feck all organisational skills - I didn't apply for a passport till Monday!

As for drinking ``too'' much; I don't think I will - I've been pretty calm since my first year of college, when a friend threatened to send me to AA. (He was exaggerating, but the point was well made).

Interview, eh? You'll have to talk to my manager. (Most of my friends are in bands... running joke with us). I suppose the obvious first question is either going to be how I found wikipedia, and/or what prompted me to start editing; the answer is, I saw it on Slashdot, but didn't really take part, as I'd developed a dislike for previous wikis I'd seen. Then it came up a few times on the Linux Gazette's Answer Gang list, and I had a look, and found the answers to a few of the music theory questions that had been bugging me. I didn't bother editing though, till I stumbled on something about Irish dioces, and created an account, and changed ``Cashel'' to ``Cashel and Emly'', and from there... the same old story I guess.

Oh, and 10 day forecast for \href{http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/local/SPXX0044}{Ibiza}\footnote{\texttt{http:{\breakslash}{\breakslash}www.weather.com{\breakslash}outlook{\breakslash}travel{\breakslash}local{\breakslash}SPXX0044}} and \href{http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/local/EIXX0079}{Thurles}\footnote{\texttt{http:{\breakslash}{\breakslash}www.weather.com{\breakslash}outlook{\breakslash}travel{\breakslash}local{\breakslash}EIXX0079}} - 'nuff said!

If you can afford to, I'd strongly recommend a digital camera. I got one in April and wow!!! (I was able to take 250 photos of my sister's wedding!) My one was about 350 euro and has 3.2 million pixels. You might get one a lot cheaper in the airport, but if you can afford one, get it. You'll wonder how you \textit{possibly} lived without one. I can plug mine into my eMac keyboard and in about 10 seconds have all the pictures downloaded onto the screen. (I took one picture of the Kings Inns - which is across the road from where I live - at 7.01 a couple of months ago. I was back in my apartment at 7.08. My computer on by 7.09. The picture on the screen at 7.10, cropped and improved by 7.13, and placed on a wiki page at 7.14!!! I kept a note of the times as a joke. I also had an accident some weeks ago, I fell and badly injured my ankle thanks to a bit of incompetent Dublin Corpo repairs. I had my camera with me, as it happens. While still on the ground I took the camera out and photographed the hole, then kept a daily record of my ankle, as it swelt to twice the size, turned purple, cream and as the swelling changed in size. The pictures are now with my solicitor.   I ended up apparently with torn ligaments, though now my physio thinks my ankle may actually be broken - the swelling may have kept the bones together so meant an initial break wasn't caught in the x-ray. So tomorrow (yikes today) I have to get another x-ray. And just to cheer me up even more, I've only just remembered I am supposed to write an article for one of the Sunday papers tonight. F@*@!!! I'd better get writing. lol and enjoy Ibiza. \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User\%3AJtdirl}{Fear{\'E}\allowhyphens{}IREANN} 03:14, 28 Aug 2003 (UTC)

Hi there, you appear to have deleted and recreated the article for the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_International_Comedy_Festival}{Melbourne International Comedy Festival}. Why was this done, particularly without prior notification? In the past I have been instructed by another admin that this will only be done in very extreme situations because it destroys the history, severing the link between authors and their changes, violating the GFDL.
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User\%3AZuytdorp_Survivor}{Zuytdorp Survivor} 06:59, 3 Jul 2004 (UTC)

\begin{alltt} Pages with copyvios in their history are a problem which I was trying to decrease. I
 posted the page history prior to deletion on the relevant talk page - not a great 
 solution, but the only one available, and better, IMO, than leaving copyright 
 violations in Wikipedia. It would be great if there was a way of deleting individual 
 edits, but there isn't; it'd be better still if people would read and follow the
 instructions in the copyvio notice, and edit a temp page as instructed.

\begin{quote}\begin{quote}Let's keep this discussion on one page. Makes it easier to follow :)
\\In the past I have followed the procedure you have mentionned regarding temp pages, and have been admonished by one of your fellow admin users as apparently it is not always appropriate. From then until your changes I thought I understood the process.
\\I was instructed that page deletion was only to occur when there was no redeemable (non-copyvio) material. In the case of the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_International_Comedy_Festival_}{ MICF} there had been many page rewrites since the alleged copyvio. Furthermore, I was informed that copyvios in a page history should be ignored unless a complaint has been made by the copyright holder, in which case a developer can remove the specific revision. No such complaint had been made on the MICF article, indeed the allegation of copyvio was rejected by the author and not subsequently upheld by the person making the claim. \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User\%3AZuytdorp_Survivor}{Zuytdorp Survivor} 00:51, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)

\\So now I have this fuck up, and no way of fixing it. Great. What makes it worse is that now that I've done it, I remember that I've done this before.

Hey, I responded to you at \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk\%3ATUF-KAT/List_of_albums}{User talk:TUF-KAT/List of albums}.  Many thanks for all your work so far, but I would like to point out a few pretty minor things.
\begin{itemize}\item I reworded one para at \textit{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade_of_Aggression}{Decade of Aggression}}.  The original wasn't badly POV (if you haven't yet, see our policy about \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPOV}{maintaining a neutral point of view}), but I attributed the view to Slayer's fans.
\item Songs should be quotes, albums in italics
\item Genres aren't capitalized as a rule (there are exceptions, like New Wave).  I fixed this at \textit{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_Awaits}{Hell Awaits}}
\item Don't preemptively disambiguate albums unless there's an obvious need for it.  For example, there's no reason \textit{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infernal_Love_\%28album\%29}{Infernal Love (album)}} shouldn't be at \textit{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infernal_Love}{Infernal Love}}, unless you know something I don't about another use of the term.  It's easy to disambiguate later if another use comes up.

Hi Jim. Calling a fellow Irishman. Defend your country! *grin* Actually a recurring problem has cropped up again. Some months ago a user called Scipius tried to screw up the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland}{Republic of Ireland} page. He wanted to call it simply \textit{Ireland} even though the page is only on the RofI, and everyone else told him it should be called the Rep of Irl. He tried to change facts and got into a major row with me, with other Irish users, with Northern Irish users and people who had worked on the page in general with his pre-occupation with changing things to his own highly inaccurate understanding of Irish history, culture, politics, etc. Now he is back again and trying to rewrite the agreed template on the RofI page; one of his recurring insistences for example, is in suggesting that the Irish and english languages have equality of status, by removing a simple reference to the Irish language being defined as the \textit{national language} and english as \textit{a} (not \textit{the}) secondary language. On past evidence, he will simply keep reverting the page again and again and again, ignoring any past consensus reached until it people can get it clear to him that he is not getting his way. So it would be a \textit{great help} if you could keep an eye on the page and tell him that the page as it is (I reverted his changes) is factually accurate and his 'version' is factually inaccurate and simplistic. In the past people have just given up when he has waged his factually dodgy war elsewhere. But there is no way I am going to let him screw up the R of I page again. The more Irish people join in the better. Otherwise we will have weeks of him ignoring everyone and bulldozing his way through, as he tried (and failed) the last time. \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User\%3AJtdirl}{Fear{\'E}\allowhyphens{}IREANN} 02:59 10 Jun 2003 (UTC)

On the ``getting more Irish people to join'' front, I've been trying to get a friend of mine to chip in, though I think he'll wait till he's gotten through your articles first (he loves his politics - used to spend his mornings arguing with Morning Ireland when I shared a house with him in college). -- \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User\%3AJimregan}{Jim Regan} 20:24 10 Jun 2003 (UTC)

\begin{quote}\begin{quote}Sorry about that characterisation I made of you - a joke between JTD and I (as you may have gathered from other comments on this page). Having read your changes, and reasonings, and JTD's, I would tend to agree with his position; after all, the consensus seems to be with him, your contributions to the Republic of Ireland page \textit{do} have inaccuracies, and it \textit{is} inappropriate to discuss the history of Ireland in a page about the Republic. That said, I think if you and JTD could discuss these changes point by point I think you could both find some common ground. There was a thing or two I thought sh/could be kept (the details escape me at the moment), but I didn't have the time.

Hi Jim, re the fada. I never actually noticed I had accidentially fadaised (if such a word exists!) the i and capitalised it as well until you mentioned it. I meant to thank you for spotting that, so a belated . . . oh hell, I can't remember the Irish for 'thank you' *embarrassment*. I see that Scipius has contacted you. Oh lucky you! :-) The saga of Scipius and the Republic of Ireland goes on and on . . . and on and on. How many users does it take for Scipius to listen to them? It was like this the last time and like the last time Scipius just ignored everyone and changed things to his way. (Though John reverted.) The irony is Scipius is a good contributor, just a tad ``stubborn'' as Mav put it. He doesn't seem to grasp that having cleaned up the mess on the Irish pages that was on wiki before (go to the old \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Redmond}{John Redmond} page if you want a laugh. Though I hasten to add that was nothing to do with Scipius) Irish users tend to be rather stubborn too when it comes to defending accuracy with regard to Ireland on wiki. Having once had a page that said deV won the civil war (which would have come as a surprise to him!) the days of inaccurate half-baked Oirish stuff packed with simplistic theories and monumental inaccuracies are over. Only Scipius seems incapable of realising that he is wrong. I wish a user with his ability would stick to pages where he knows what he is talking about not forcing his version when people are queuing to tell him he is wrong. \textit{Plus ca change}. lol. \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User\%3AJtdirl}{Fear{\'E}\allowhyphens{}IREANN} 23:30 10 Jun 2003 (UTC)

Good idea. I see 149.101.1.126 is doing strange things to articles again. Sometimes they add in good stuff, sometimes POV garbage.

Have you tried the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/safari}{safari} browser? It is the best I have come across. \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera}{Opera} is also pretty Ok. I see you have done some edits on work by 67.122.114.153 on Phil Collins. Can you be sure the original article is accurate? The problem is that people strongly suspect that 67 . . . is Michael *sigh* again. If it is Michael and is accurate, the best solution might be to blank Michael's version and state you are doing that. Then install the text under \textit{your} name with some textual changes. I know it seems a bit alkward but everytime Michael sees that his version unreverted exists it acts as an encouragement to him to think he can still work on wiki and get away with it. Another alternative might be to do a redirect to the basic text rewritten by you under a new article name. Such actions by everyone might just get the message through to that ejjit Michael that the entire wiki is saying to him "fuck off''! Though it is a long shot. \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User\%3AJtdirl}{Fear{\'E}\allowhyphens{}IREANN} 16:50 13 Jun 2003 (UTC)

As to the 67... edits, I did check, though if I'm completely honest, I'm not 100\% sure about the track order, just the names. I've never knowingly listened to Phil Collins voluntarily, so I never could be 100\% sure :) I wouldn't be too sure about that being Michael - the info (I saw) was accurate, and it's anathema to a punk (as Michael claims to be) to listen to an old fart like Phil Collins! I don't see the point in blanking Michael's stuff, as in anything I've edited that he's touched, there's never been any sentences, just track listings, dates \&c, which don't merit that sort of rewriting once verified. I know most people prefer that approach, but a lot of them have more of an axe to grind with him; I prefer to live and let live where possible{---}\allowhyphens{}I'll just try to take on what I can do in a timely fashion to try and take the load off. Like I've said before, (though where, I can't say) Michael is an annoyance to most, but a motivator to me, in that most of the articles I work on are music related, and within my tastes, which have some overlap with Michael's; and I don't think it right to put articles up under an incorrect title, as would be the case if I were to rename an article written about an album or band. (Speaking of getting a kick up the arse, your message prompted me to verify those Phil Collins pages).

Hiya, could you take a look at \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles}{British Isles}. There is one user who doesn't seem to understand that it is seen as a \textit{geo-political} term, not merely a \textit{geographic} one, and seems to think that the offence is caused on when the term is wrongly interpreted. They seem not to understand that this term is a problem for Irish people, and keeps adding in POV stuff to the effect of 'it is only offensive if you interpret it as offensive.' \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User\%3AJtdirl}{Fear{\'E}\allowhyphens{}IREANN} 20:09 13 Jun 2003 (UTC)

Did you know that Ian Paisley gets thousands of Catholic votes?  I'm dead serious. ''At this point you have probably fallen of your chair, are clambering up in a state of confusion going ``what the fuck did I just read?'', have read it and collapsed down on the ground again in shock.

If you are shocked, think how Big Ian felt! And Sinn F{\'e}\allowhyphens{}in! OK now that you have recovered from all your falling around, I looked over the page and agreed with the sentence you put in. In fact I agreed with it so much I went and redid the entire article again. :-) I can understand the point the original author is making about it being a geographic term, but he doesn't seem to grasp that in the real world there is no such thing as geography, or history, or politics, or economics, or . . .  Everything is tied to everything else and looking at it purely from the point of view of geography is not merely factually wrong but ludicrous. It is much much more complex than that and hopefully the rewrite conveys that. OK. It is 6.25am.

Hi Jim, 

Have you voted yet on \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk\%3ANaming_conventions_\%28years_in_titles\%29}{Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (years in titles)}?. I am afraid that wiki is about to make a major captioning error. It seems to be voting to putting the year first when naming elections, sports events, etc. While people often do so in spoken english, in titles and captions it doesn't do so, because to do so makes the year the central fact, whereas in reality \textit{what} the event is is central, the year the disambigulation point. For example, media outlets caption election coverage as \textit{Election 2000}, \textit{General Election 2000}, \textit{Presidential Election 2000}  etc because the the fact that it is an election is the main fact to know, that it is a general/presidential/local/state/congressional election central. We have been following this rule for ages on wiki, so we have everything from \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_general_election\%2C_1970}{UK general election, 1970} to \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._presidential_election\%2C_1932}{U.S. presidential election, 1932} to \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_general_election\%2C_2002}{Irish general election, 2002}, etc. Moving to \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1932_US_presidential_election}{1932 US presidential election} goes against standard media caption style and would involve the wholescale renaming of pages covering elections and all sorts of events from all over the globe. You are talking about hundreds if not thousands of pages having to be renamed and go against standard caption style, which is often called the \textit{where what, when} rule. After all, people if they are searching for a page on an election will use the name of the election as their entry point for a list (particularly if they don't know the year). Typing in a search for ''U.S. presidential election throws up a clear orderly list of US presidential elections, with the disambigulation year at the end uniformly. 

As you may guess, I do think wiki's proposed to system would amount to a pointless waste of energy in remaining vast numbers of pages, especially when it is to a format that is generally not used in titles and captions but only in speech. And this debate is all about titles. So I am canvassing support to vote down what I think is a flawed, ill thought through and pointless that originated initially with Adam Rinkleff (in the \textit{Susan Mason} persona) some months ago and survived as an idea after SM was banned. (I don't know if you know about Adam. Basically Adam was another Michael only more devious and who caused chaos for six or seven months, creating multiple person{\ae}\allowhyphens{} who went around wiki spreading mischief and provoking edit wars. Sometimes he'd have two 'trolls' working at once; in an attempt to convince us they weren't him he'd have them talking to each other. But each in turn was banned and Adam claims now that he has stopped his infiltration, though few believe it. So if nothing else this message has given you some background info on our \textit{most} famous troll, Adam, who would make the likes of Michael or DW look like amateurs in comparison!) wikilove \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User\%3AJtdirl}{Fear{\'E}\allowhyphens{}IREANN} 01:46 18 Jun 2003 (UTC)

\begin{quote}I looked at it, and was disappointed to find that while I could vote several times, I couldn't weight my voting. Maybe it's just that I've only experienced voting in the form used in our elections, and in the ``just pick one'' form. 
\\Now, the thing I don't understand is why there has to be a single convention for years - the two main examples given were for elections and sporting events, but the convention I've always observed are that both use different conventions - 2002 Premiership and General Election, 2002 \&c. Since it's natural to assume that people who work on sporting events and those who work on elections wouldn't have much overlap, both here and in, say, newspapers, why can't these different groups use their own conventions? Are people really that opposed to the use of redirect pages? The waste in energy goes in both directions, as the sporting people already have their convention, and the elections, as you have said, have another. To me, it's much like the capitalisation debate you commented on in the mailing list.
\\And no, I've never had any dealings with Adam. In fact, apart from one-off vandals, I've never had any dealings with any of them except Michael. The thing that gets me about the whole thing with Michael is having to deal with the aftermath. Having to constantly check pages to see if he's been around tampering with them is no big deal to me - I end up checking revisions to \textbf{any} page I've made changes to anyway (or, at least, the one's I'm interested in). -- \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User\%3AJimregan}{Jim Regan} 02:49 18 Jun 2003 (UTC)

It is a fair point re different styles for sports and everything else. re Adam - oh you were soooo lucky never to deal with him. He was the troll from hell. When I joined, there was an edit war going on, where people would all work together on a version of one particular page. An agreed version would be worked out, then \textit{Vera Cruz} as he called himself, would tear it to shreds and produce a version that was factually incorrect, hard to read and blatently POV. It would be reverted, he would revert. Then his cancer would stread to other pages, and he would almost stop the wiki as everyone got focused on the latest \textit{Vera Cruz} versus the entire wiki became the issue. Over a few months, Rickleff came back as Lir, Vera Cruz, Bridget, Susan Mason, Dietary Fiber, Zxcvb, Shino Baku and a host of other trolls. At one stage to try to convince us that they weren't the same person and neither was Adam, Susan and Dietary began leaving messages for ``each other'' supporting each other against all the attacks. But then one of them inadvertently claimed that they had done an edit that the other had actually and demonstrably done so they were caught. One night it all came to a head. Zoe, 172, myself, Tannin and others decided ``fuck it. We have had enough.'' 

So, as now happens to Michael, we waged total war. Everything Adam in the name of his latest troll  touched was reverted on sight. One page on \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_I_of_England}{James I of England} was reverted by the minute all night. If he so much as changed a comma, it was reverted, no matter how accurate (and a lot of Adam's stuff was quirky, to put it mildly!). Eventually he went away and sent a message to Jimbo saying he was gone for good; he even give a list of his trolls and it turned out there were some that had not been caught. He swears he is gone for good, but few believes it. Unfortunately some new users came on at the time of the 'night war' and, not knowing what was going on, presumed Zoe, Tannin, 172, I and others were bullies attacking this poor user!!! (Cpromt still thinks we were hard on them. He never had to deal with them, though. Adam's classic stunt was to start off all nice and polite, do something, people would change it and nicely explain why it was wrong. Adam would be so nice and polite . . . and change it back. So the gullible user would be all nice back, trying to explain the change. Then finally it would dawn on the user after a week or two that they were falling for an act. Adam was ignoring everything they said while pretending he was listening, appreciated their friendliness, was thinking about what they said etc. And he'd find a gullible newbie everytime to fall for it, sending messages around saying 'why are you all being so horrid to this poor user? If you explain the problem they will listen'. 2 weeks later, that newbie would be spitting blood, screaming ``that son of a bitch'' at Adam, by which time another newbie had fallen for the charm offensive. (I did once in my time too!)  So the next time you hear people screaming that 'x' or 'y' is Adam or Lir, don't be surprised if things get a little heated or that you find yourself facing an unexpected charm offensive from that x or y, as they mutter 'but I'm an innocent user being attacked by all these bullies' before taking you for a ride if you are not careful.

\begin{quote}And now Zoe has learned and applied that same trick to me, so rather than being tricked into appearing the same as the vandals I have waited until I spotted her selectivity elsewhere. Now I can show people a track record of misbehaviour - thin so far, but real - I hope without (as she has) becoming what she fought. You don't believe it? She requires a certain level of proof from others, as in ``fanny'', yet lets through stuff she has no problem with. Selectivity, which adds up. All I ask for is decent equitable criteria, evenly applied. (And once we have established that, look at the internal evidence in what I gave that she suppressed. Then we can give it a fair go for deciding how to word what ought to go in, rather than just suppressing what doesn't fit preconceptions.) PML.

I moved your comment here, the page was getting too long. I hope that's enough of a quote to put yours in context, though I have to say, I think it's fairly rude to start a reply in the \textit{middle} of someone else's message. Now that we've gotten off to a bad start, to my reply. I'd have to say that valid or not, it's really not a good time to complain about Zoe. Many other people seem to have gotten the same idea. Maybe Zoe really is the nastiest thing since... whatever the polar opposite of sliced bread is, but if all she's asking you for is proof, what's the problem in providing it? Maybe she does have a double standard, but she's only human. 

If you want to be treated the same way as everyone else, why don't you create an account? By having just an IP in a page history, you are waving a red flag at everyone who has an eye on RC. Wikipedia does have a hierarchy, and by not logging in you are choosing to stay at the bottom of that hierarchy {---}\allowhyphens{}if you're not being treated the same as everyone else, you've only yourself to blame -- \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User\%3AJimregan}{Jim Regan} 05:32 18 Jun 2003 (UTC)

\begin{quote}I was trying to anchor things to a related context (now missing - you shouldn't have guessed you left enough context). As for ``...if all she's asking you for is proof, what's the problem in providing it?'' - that's exactly what was shown by the context against which I put the comment (now missing). She was not doing that, any more than the usual suspect vandal was ``only'' doing this or that. She made out that that was all she was after - but she cut regardless, only giving the appearance of making a reasonable request in a way that might fool people coming in in the middle (possibly unintentional, but just like that earlier vandal), and she wouldn't accept spelling things out in the post as proof or accept that prima facie obvious stuff put the burden of proof on rejecting it (at least show what's not prima facie about it!). So I decided to give her plenty of rope and wait for her to be out in the open before again raising the area (the sale of the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_Virgin_Islands}{Danish Virgin Islands}) as part of a wider whole (bias), in the hope that eventually it would get an impartial review so we could get an agreed phrasing in - which is why it is a good time to complain about Zoe, or more precisely about what she does, now she's exposed and will find it harder to hide the fact that she has a pattern of bias we need to offset. Reworking the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_Virgin_Islands}{Danish Virgin Islands} may take a while before we get around to it, but I can't just wait for the pressure to be off her - she'll make out that it's me that's biassed (as she just now has, falsely stating that the point related to being NPOV). As for why not create an account - I have already given reasons for that (it's work related); and matters should be judged on their form and content, not author. Apologies for rushed mind dump phrasing there. PML.

Oh. I guess the correct quote, then, would be ``Adam's classic stunt was to start off all nice and polite, do something, people would change it and nicely explain why it was wrong. Adam would be so nice and polite . . . and change it back. So the gullible user would be all nice back, trying to explain the change. Then finally it would dawn on the user after a week or two that they were falling for an act''. So this leaves me with having to read through several revisions to find out what it is you said. I'm guessing the contentious part is
\begin{quote}``During the submarine warfare phases of the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War}{First World War}, the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA}{USA} feared that these islands might be seized by \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany}{Germany} as a submarine base and accordingly put pressure on \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark}{Denmark} (more precisely, the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark}{Danish} \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown}{Crown}) to sell the islands to the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA}{USA} to pre-empt \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany}{German} seizure. It should however be noted that the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US}{US} pressure itself took the form of a threat of seizure if a sale could not be agreed, that this took place between neutral non-belligerents, and that the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA}{USA} only contemplated a permanent acquisition and not the conventional temporary acquisition for the duration of hostilities. On \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_17}{January 17}, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1917}{1917}, the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States}{United States} bought the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_West_Indies}{Danish West Indies} for \$25 million and took possession of the islands on \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_31}{March 31}, with the funds going to the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark}{Danish} \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown}{Crown} and so helping to maintain a degree of royal independence.''

\end{quote}
I can see the problem with POV here, from both sides. Fine, Zoe is Americo-centric, and wants proof. Simply stating that the US threatened seizure of the Islands isn't enough - you need to back it up, with evidence supporting this claim. Unless you can provide this proof, it's simply a matter of the US's word against Denmarks, and you need to flag your claims accordingly. Simply saying ``The Danish Crown felt they were under pressure to sell the islands'' or whatever should be the right sort of thing. -- \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User\%3AJimregan}{Jim Regan} 06:12 18 Jun 2003 (UTC)

\begin{quote}There was one more problem, that doesn't show in this fossilised retrospect. I had been seeking alternate forms of words to firm things up. No dice - everything got cut, including context that showed what I was putting made sense. So I stopped and awaited a strategic moment rather than seeking a synthesis that would be kyboshed. Had I continued, I would probably have put ``...the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US}{US} pressure itself could only be a threat of seizure... since the owners were the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark}{Danish} \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown}{Crown}'', only hopefully a bit clearer than that. Then I would have tried to clarify this internal evidence even more, showing that the USA had nothing to offer the Crown, since it was all a one way loss for the Crown. Showing that would have been a serious digression into constitutional aspects - but it was already clear that I was being cut regardless, since the Second World War comparative stuff had been simply cut. Zoe et al were simply assuming that presenting evidence is POV and that if it was once cut, that showed I had no evidence to offer. No credence was being put on internal evidence, and there was no willingness to check my reasoning. PML.

BTW take a look at \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk\%3AManual_of_Style_\%28dates_and_numbers\%29}{Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)} and let me know what you think. Eloquence, a normally very nice german guy, has a bee in his bonnet about using the dating format of dd/mm/yy. He insists we should use mm/dd/yy which things used to be written in up until a few months ago. He also dislikes British english being used on wiki and would prefer if we used both American dating and American english. Or as a compromise, that he could tolerate British english if non-Americans agreed to use American mm/dd/yy dating. I delivered a rather long and sharp attack on his arguments on the above page. I'd love to hear your views on it. \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User\%3AJtdirl}{Fear{\'E}\allowhyphens{}IREANN} 11:59 22 Jun 2003 (UTC)

\begin{quote}You know, I've been staring at that page for 15 minutes, and can't think of much to say. I presumed from your comments that some misguided people were literally using numerical dates dd/mm, mm/dd \&c. In that case, I would have votes for ISO dates, but since the issue is different, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22_June}{22 June} vs \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_22}{June 22}, I don't see the problem. Honestly, I wasn't fully aware that the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22_June}{22 June} form \textit{could} be used, and have been using the American style. Though, mostly I've been writing pages about bands, albums etc and most of them are American anyway - though I have not once used an American spelling - I'd be too confused (confuzed?).

\begin{quote}I've been taking part in \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Proofreaders}{Distributed Proofreaders}, and while there, mostly focussing on Vol. 2 of the 1911 ed. of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. AFAIR, this was before the company moved to the US, and since that encyclopaedia has a mixture of conventions across articles, I fail to see why some people find it so unprofessional/inconsistent/bad here. In fact, since I started here, and started seeing these little tiffs over ``standardizing'' on AE, I've found myself flicking through other encyclopaedias to see how they do it, and I don't recall seeing any difference. Maybe I'll actually take a survey--I doubt it'll placate the hardcore AE people, but it'd be nice to have. -- \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User\%3AJimregan}{Jim Regan} 13:48 22 Jun 2003 (UTC)

To be honest I am utterly puzzled by Eloquence's stance. I don't see how using \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/27_June}{27 June} rather than \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_27}{June 27} is going to cause the end of civilisation as we know it.

The thing with Michael Hardy is he has done this before with political science pages and it is getting irritating, to put it mildly. But in this case he changed the actual formula, removed an important definition phrase and mucked up on the capitalisation for the umptheenh time. I have asked him before that if he has any doubts to raise questions on the relevant talk page first before makingh wholescale changes but he never does. He just bulldozes ahead and I am fed up as a political scientist regularly having to clean up after his mess. But the changes to \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droop_Quota}{Droop Quota} hit a new low. He obviously doesn't know what the Droop Quota is but still changed everything anyway.

Congratulations, you have just been made a sysop! You have volunteered for boring housekeeping activities which normal users sadly cannot participate in. Sysops basically can't do anything: They cannot delete pages arbitarily (only obvious junk like ``jklasdfl,{\"o}\allowhyphens{}asdf JOSH IS GAY''), they cannot protect pages in an edit war they are involved in, they cannot ban signed in users. What they can do is delete junk as it appears, ban anonymous vandals, remove pages that have been listed on \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia\%3AVotes_for_deletion}{Votes for deletion} for more than a week, protect pages when asked to by other members, and help keep the few \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia\%3Aprotected_page}{protected page}s there are, among them the precious \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page}{Main Page}, up to date.
