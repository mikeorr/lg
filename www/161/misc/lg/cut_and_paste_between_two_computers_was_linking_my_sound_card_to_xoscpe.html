This cutting and pasting  between various screens on two different computer 
is a real PITA.
</p>

<p>
As you can see from  the forwarding I also had to invoke the use of a third 
computer on a different address. I have no way to directly link  the two 
different computer directly. At least none that I know  of.   And having to 
copy  down  letter by letter what I see on one machine  to get it into the 
other machine is error prone.  Is there a quick way to  network  a Windows 
and a linux machine together so the two can see each other and copy each 
other's files?

There is "synergy" which is meant for something more or less similar. 
</p>

<p>
The setup is explained in <a href='../../../128/lg_tips.html'>http://linuxgazette.net/128/lg_tips.html</a>
(Search for synergy).
</p>

<p>
The keyboard and mouse <em>and</em> clipboard of one computer is shared
between the two machines.
</p>

<p>
Of course, whether this is PITA or NaaN is something for you do
decide. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">

Yep. As I mentioned in my previous email, you could solve the problem in
several ways: you could use your Linux machine to do your mail via a
mail client; you could use it to do mail via a web browser; or you could
- the most complicated method of the three - use VNC to connect them,
run your Windows box via a VNC connection, and copy-and-paste into it
that way.

Don't know how to do that in Linux.  Can't seem to figure it out.
</p>

<p>
Judging by how my query on siggen is being handled I despair of ever
figuring  out these other issues.  Maybe I should stick to Windows.
I am just getting more confused by all the jargon.
