<h1>Design Awareness: What Parachute Is Your Color?</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/seymour.html">Mark Seymour</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>Colors are, for all of us except those unfortunate enough to be
blind to them, much of the way we perceive the world. They are so
powerful that they've even made themselves part of our language, as
written on our very faces: green with envy, red with anger, gray
with pain.</p>

<p>We use them every day, almost without thinking, to create any of
the visual media: painting, photography, design. In traditional
forms, your eye and hand skills were all you had to create,
compare, and reproduce colors, and the number of colors you can
create from oil paints or watercolors, for example, is nearly
infinite. Computers have given us powerful tools to manipulate
color (<a href="http://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a> and <a href=
"http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/">Photoshop</a> are two
common examples), yet have forced us into ever narrower color
gamuts.</p>

<p><em>Gamut</em> is one of those 'techie' words many of us use
without exactly understanding its meaning. The earliest dated
reference I could find was "Gamut, the scale, or rudiments of
music" in a <!--

book</a> entitled <i>The Sacred Harp, A Collection of Psalm and
Hymn Tunes, Odes, and Anthems, Selected from the Most Eminent
Authors: Together with Nearly One Hundred Pieces Never Before
Published; Suited to Most Metres, and Well Adapted to Churches of
Every Denomination, Singing Schools, and Private Societies. With
Plain Rules for Learners.</i> It was published in Philadelphia in
1860, as a "New and Much Improved and Enlarged Edition", by B.F.
White and E.J. King, who knew a thing or two about writing titles,
if nothing else.</p>

<p>The Oxford English Dictionary gives this definition:</p>

<ol>
<li>the complete range or scope of something</li>

<li>Music: a complete scale of musical notes; the compass or range
of a voice or instrument</li>

<li>Historical: a scale consisting of seven overlapping hexachords,
containing all the recognized notes used in medieval music</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>from the Latin <i>gamma ut</i> (in sense 4): the Greek letter
<i>gamma</i> was used for bass G, with <i>ut</i> indicating that it
was the first note in the lowest of the hexachords <i>example:</i>
run the gamut; to experience, display, or perform the complete
range of something <a href="#1">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href=
"http://www.public.asu.edu/%7edetrie/pages/design_foundation/pages/glossary_g.html">
glossary</a> of the School of Design at Arizona State University
defines it as an "entire series of recognized notes" along with
numerous mathematic and geometric definitions, though oddly enough
without any color reference. The <a href=
"http://www.cs.rit.edu/%7encs/color/glossary.htm">glossary</a> at
the Rochester Institute of Technology defines it as "The entire
range of perceived color that may be obtained under specified
conditions", a delightfully vague academic definition. (I've
appended a <a href="#GlossaryList">list</a> of glossaries at the
bottom of this column; you may find them useful for other graphics
terms.)</p>

<p>So it appears the term began in the music world and then
purloined by the design world, but still means basically the same
thing: <i>the range of perceivable items</i>, whether notes or
colors. However, that's not the same as the range of everything we,
as observers, can visually perceive. It's the range of whatever
device (computer monitor, printer, ink system, film, camera CCD,
etc.) we're using can perceive. And they, lamentably, are all
different from each other and from our eyes.</p>

<p>There have been many color-definition systems set up, each with
its own gamut, in an attempt to standardize and codify the use of
color. Few in this industry are old enough to remember printing
prior to the development of the <a href=
"http://www.pantone.com/aboutus/aboutus.asp?idArticle=51">Pantone</a>
system of printing inks, but imagine trying to tell your printer
exactly what green you wanted to use: "Sort of an Irish mossy
green, with just a hint of lemon, really, and a touch of blue like
that cloudless sky I saw when I went to New Mexico and got drunk
and fell down last summer." This sort of ambiguity led to endless
rounds of 'ink drawdowns' (a quaint and now almost-unheard-of
practice of actually mixing a little can of ink to your nebulous
specifications, rolling it out onto high-gloss proof paper, drying
it, and sending the sheet over to your office for approval and
revision: "No, no, a little more yellow") and arguments over
exactly what color any particular color actually was. (Try
'matching' a color to an object before there were scanners!)
Fortunately, in the early 1960s the Pantone Matching System (thus
the phrase 'PMS color') was released to printers and designers, and
things pretty much settled down until the advent of the
Macintosh.</p>

<p>Oh, there was the constant struggle to 'match' a PMS color to
its rough equivalent in CMYK inks (the first of many gamut
disparities), but Pantone and other ink systems like <a href=
"http://www.toyoink.com/ibhp.htm">Toyo</a> (though to view a
classic example of the worst of Japanese design see their <a href=
"http://www.toyoink.co.jp/en/index.html">Japanese web site</a>,
where a flying cartoon lion first paints in their logo on-screen
and then goes to sleep and blows snot bubbles; <i>would I kid you
about a thing like that?</i>) soon issued their official 'cracks'
of their colors, and you became pretty much stuck with whatever
they showed.</p>

<p>But the gamut compatibility problem really got going when you
began to display color in RGB on color monitors, and the argument
heated up over what color you were really looking at versus what
color would appear when the file was either output to film (and
thus converted to CMYK) or, worse yet, output on some other device,
like an ink jet or laser writer printer.</p>

<p>Let's look at the differing gamuts we commonly work with, and
see why this <b>gamut war</b> is still on-going and may never be
resolved.</p>

<p>You're reading this on a computer monitor which displays
information in RGB (red, green, and blue, the colors originally
generated by the phosphors activated by the electron beam in a
television). This column was created using Adobe GoLive on a
Macintosh flat-screen LCD monitor. GoLive allows me to define the
color of objects on the screen in RGB (the 'native' gamut for
monitor-based material), CMYK (the gamut for process color printing
inks), HSB (hue, saturation, and brightness), and HSV (hue,
saturation, and value); the latter two gamuts are derived from
classic color theory and use color 'wheels' <font color="black">to
describe color:</font></p>

<div align="center">
<p><img src="misc/seymour/HSBwheel.png" alt="" height="170" width=
"224" border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/HSVwheel.png" alt=""
height="170" width="224" border="0"></p>
</div>

<p>Photoshop, like other graphic design software, also provides a
wide range of color pickers including, along with the Pantone and
Toyo colors, the ANPA, DIC, Focoltone, HKS, and Trumatch systems.
(It also has a 'Lab' color picker, which I confess to not
understanding at all, try as I might. If anyone out there does,
send your explanation along.)</p>

<p>No matter what gamut you pick, however, it limits you to
significantly different numbers of colors:</p>

<ul>
<li>Toyo inks come in 1050 colors</li>

<li>Pantone inks provide 1114 standard colors, and even their
'hexachrome' system (CMYK + hexachrome orange + hexachrome green),
while supposedly "meeting or exceeding the RGB gamut", has only
about 2000 numbered colors:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<div align="left">
<p><img src="misc/seymour/PMSbooks.png" alt="" height="56" width=
"106" border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/PMShex.png" alt="" height=
"90" width="83" border="0"></p>
</div>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>HSB and HSV each allow a gamut (<i>360x100x100</i>) of
3,600,000 colors</li>

<li>RGB gives a wider gamut (<i>256x256x256</i>) of 16,777,216
colors</li>

<li>CMYK provides the broadest gamut (<i>100x100x100x100</i>) of
100,000,000 colors (and don't be fooled by software; while the
sliders for CMYK in GoLive show 256 steps for no apparent reason,
your printer can only differentiate between 100 steps
per color, and you'll be lucky if they can hold a standard within
2% either side of a particular ink percentage)</li>
</ul>

<p>Yet browsers navigating the Internet are limited by the
convention of HTML to 216 'web-safe colors', from FFFFFF to 000000.
Is it any wonder that designing for multiple mediums (print &amp;
web) can be a pain? Let's say you have a logo that you want to
print in PMS 123, a nice golden yellow:</p>

<div align="center">
<table width="50" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"
height="50">
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#FFCC33">
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>Yet, what is that color <i>really</i>? Pantone says it's simply
ink number 123 on coated stock. Easy enough to specify, and easy
for the printer to mix and print. But let's say you want to print
it in a brochure along with color photographs, thus you need its
equivalent in process (CMYK) color to make it cheaper and easier to
print. The 'crack' for that color in Photoshop (I'm trusting them
here; I didn't check my Pantone book) is 0C 24Y 94M 0K (which I
will now translate into the unpatented SeymourCMYK system
nomenclature, 0.24.94.0, which we will use henceforth), yet that
color isn't available in web-safe colors for use on your web site,
so we have to nudge it to 4.21.87.0, which translates in hex to
FFCC33. While PMS 123 is defined as 255.196.36 in the RGB gamut in
Photoshop, when entered as such via the RGB picker in GoLive it
displays as the non-web-safe hex color FFC424. Resetting it to
FFCC33, per our Photoshop definition, it becomes 255.204.51 in the
RGB gamut. Worse yet, the CMYK sliders equate that to 0.51.204.0,
which no one will ever understand.</p>

<p>So, what color are you using? Depends. If
you take the exact same PMS color and attempt to reproduce it in
Photoshop, InDesign, and GoLive (hey, I've got friends at Adobe,
what can I say?), let alone the Apple applications, you'll come up
with completely different colors. Here are screen captures of what
several different applications generated as PMS 123, for
comparison; the distinction is subtle, but obvious:
</p>

<div align="center">

"0"> <img src="misc/seymour/123inPhotoshop.png" alt="" height="50"
width="50" border="0"></p>
</div>

<p>Let's attempt to look at using color, now that we've thoroughly
confused ourselves as how to define it, to describe objects or
feelings or states of being. Because that's what we really do in
design, isn't it? Some one says they want their logo to be a nice
apple red. Do they mean the red of an apple you buy in the grocery
store (and which variety, and is it ripe or not ripe?), or do they
mean a nice Apple red? Back in the day, the logo of Apple Computer
used to be PMS 185, which looked a lot like this (on my screen, at
least) when printed:</p>

<div align="center">
<table width="50" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"
height="50">
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#F60000">
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>Yet that color red is 0.255.255.10 in the GoLive CMYK picker,
while PMS 185 is defined as 0.91.76.0 in the Photoshop CMYK picker,
which looks like this color when you set the equivalent
(0.233.195.0) in GoLive:</p>

<div align="center">
<table width="50" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"
height="50">
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#FF163C">
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>Do we go with what looks right (and to whose eye, and on what
monitor, and when was the last time you calibrated it and to
what?), or do we go by the numbers? Depends. Are you just
displaying it on someone's monitor via the web, or are you trying
to match a printed color? If it's web-only, and especially if you
can test it across a suite of CPUs and monitors, so much the
better. If you're trying to match something printed, whether it's a
PMS color or a CMYK color, that pretty much hopeless, as we've
seen.</p>

<p>We'll go with what looks right, and hope it looks 'right' on
your monitor as well. (For those of you benighted people viewing
this on a CRT monitor running Windows, good luck.)</p>

<p>Choose an object or a feeling to mimic in color. Something
difficult to describe. Something subtle. That sultry blonde you saw
on the beach during your vacation in Brazil, say. (If you find
yourself tasked with creating a travel brochure, you can bet that's
what the client is seeing in <i>his</i> head...) Or the cool blue
tones of a fresh snowfall. (Remember our work with Alpine Gear?) Or
a delicious dark bar of chocolate. (Milk chocolate? Semi-sweet?
With nuts or without? Almonds or peanuts? See how hard this is?)
Even the "golden yellow" we were trying to imitate with PMS 123
isn't really gold, but trying to represent the color of the actual
metal, whether printed or on-screen, is nearly impossible:</p>

<div align="center">
<p><img src="misc/seymour/Gold.png" alt="" height="100" width="100"
border="0">
</p>
</div>

<p>Worse yet, try and combine these disparate things and see where
the string of adjectives leads you:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a sultry, tan Brazilian blonde, in a bikini the sea-green color
of shallow Bahamian waters, eating a thick bar of Swiss milk
chocolate while standing on gold-plated skis in the midst of an icy
Norwegian glacier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, you can see her <i>in your head</i>, but try deciding
which colors you should use to represent that image... (For those
whose gender identification requires it, please substitute 'blond'
for 'blonde' and 'his' for 'her'.)</p>

<p>But we're idiots, we designers, so we'll try. And we'll do them
all in the HSB gamut (just to be a nuisance), leaving the
conversions for someone else:</p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="margin-left: 100px">
<tr height="25">
<td bgcolor="white" width="150" height="25">her tan</td>
<td bgcolor="#C86113" width="100" height="25">
</td>
</tr>

<tr height="25">
<td bgcolor="white" width="150" height="25">her blonde hair</td>
<td bgcolor="#FFEA37" width="100" height="25">
</td>
</tr>

<tr height="25">
<td bgcolor="white" width="150" height="25">her bikini</td>
<td bgcolor="#C7FF13" width="100" height="25">
</td>
</tr>

<tr height="25">
<td bgcolor="white" width="150" height="25">the chocolate</td>
<td bgcolor="#9A3011" width="100" height="25">
</td>
</tr>

<tr height="25">
<td bgcolor="white" width="150" height="25">the skis</td>
<td bgcolor="#FFC809" width="100" height="25">
</td>
</tr>

<tr height="25">
<td bgcolor="white" width="150" height="25">the glacier</td>
<td bgcolor="#C3FFF4" width="100" height="25">
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Nice, but not quite the picture you formed in your head, is it?
But they are certainly evocative colors, and you could play around
endlessly with tweaks to the formula to find some that were closer
to that bikini-clad, chocolate-eating skier you (or the client)
were imagining.</p>

<p>Applying this palette to your client's <a href=
"misc/seymour/chocolate.html">brochure for chocolate</a> (or
bikinis or ski equipment or resort travel), you can now hope that
every design feature (headlines, tables, text blocks, leader lines,
color backgrounds) will somehow evoke the tantalizing picture that
inspired the choice of these colors.</p>

<p>But now let's try and pick colors to represent a real Brazilian
woman standing in real Brazilian water (and what intelligent
Brazilian woman would ever find herself on a Norwegian glacier,
even to eat chocolate?):</p>

<div align="center">
<p><a href="http://www.domai.com/main.html"><img src=
"misc/seymour/Brazil.png" alt="" height="200" width="200" border=
"0"></a>
</p>
</div>

<p> Much harder, isn't it? (And that's why
photography replaced artwork early on. Look back at ads from the
1950s, with their painted and airbrushed illustrations: flat colors
and simplified forms. Yet it's considered very retro to mimic that
today.) So which part of her, precisely, shall we pick to stand for
'tan'? Should wet hair or dry hair represent 'blonde'? Which of the
several colors of her suit cry out 'bikini'? What part of the surf
would say 'ocean'? What part of the sky might mean 'sunset'? Tricky
business, this color.
</p>

<p> Where does this all leave us, besides pissed off and frustrated
with the vagaries of color systems, software programmers, ink
manufacturers, and the limitations of technology in general? With
the notion, first of all, that no amount of technology or software
gimmickry can truly replace a good eye. If you have one, bless you
and use it well. If you don't, and not every designer does, you'll
have to decide where your strengths lie and work around them. For
instance, I can't open Photoshop and 'paint' an image any more than
I ever could with a box of crayons. Actually, I do better with the
crayons. But if you think we've come a long way since we were kids,
remember that HTML can handle barely twice as many colors as
Crayola:</p>

<div align="center">
<p><img src="misc/seymour/Crayons.png" alt="" height="82" width=
"137" border="0">
</p>
</div>

<p> The parti-colored images and Flash animations flooding the web
these days will never come out of my box of tricks. But I can, if I
work at it, come up with a color way for a logo, a brand, or a
product that can be utilized effectively across print and video and
the web. By analyzing the needs of the piece, so can you. But
turning those colors into artful designs that entice the viewer and
sell the product (and thus please the client), that's what will
separate you from a guy or gal who can just turn on the computer
and double-click the Photoshop icon. Solving the what-color-is-this
problem? Perhaps not fixable. My suggestion is to determine where
the majority of the work will be seen, whether web or print, and
choose your gamut accordingly. CMYK, of course, if you're going
mostly to print, and use the official Pantone (or other patented
color system) 'crack' to represent its flat colors in CMYK. You can
reproduce the CMYK fairly easily in any web-content generator. RGB
if you're going web, and do the best you can to represent that in
CMYK for any print that results. Remember, no matter how good the
software, no ink-on-paper version will ever have the luminosity or
depth of colors displayed on a good computer screen, even
black.</p>

<p>I hope this has inspired you to wrestle with the complexities of
color. It's worth the battle, unless you like to see the world this
way:</p>

<div align="center">
<p><img src="misc/seymour/BrazilBW.png" alt="" height="200" width=

<p>As ever, let me know what design issues you'd like explored.</p>

<p>[1] Not to be confused with "running the gantlet", let alone the
often-misused "running the gauntlet", like the <a href=

Clint Eastwood film</a> of that name. A gantlet is "receiving blows
while running between two rows of men with sticks", while a
gauntlet is "a stout glove with a long loose wrist". The English
insist on using the same spelling for both, but that's just being
silly...</p>

less), the logo for Davey Tree, a national tree service company. My thanks,

<p> I started doing graphic design in junior high school, when it was still
the Dark Ages of technology. Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were both eleven

still, painfully, learning how web design is different from, but not
necessarily better than, print.
