Belltown Media Acquires Linux Journal
</p>

<p>
Houston, TX --  Dec. 4, 2006 -- Belltown Media, Inc., a privately
held Houston, TX-based media corporation today announced the acquisition
of the premier Linux publication, Linux Journal. Since its first issue
was published in April of 1994 Linux Journal has established a strong
position in the industry by catering to the loyal base of the Linux
audience.
</p>

<p>
Well-known as the original magazine of the Linux community, Linux
Journal has grown significantly in readership and editorial reputation
since its first issue and has come to be recognized worldwide as the
premier source for information, news and opinion on issues affecting the
Linux community. The 153rd issue of Linux Journal goes on sale December
5, 2006.
</p>

<p>
Belltown Media was founded by Carlie Fairchild who has worked closely
with Linux Journal founder and Linux luminary Phil Hughes for more than
ten years.  "As Linux Journal grew over the years,"  said Hughes,
"Carlie took on many publisher-related tasks and became increasingly
active in the Linux community. I promoted her to associate publisher a
few years back where she naturally excelled. That pretty much only left
one more possibility for her and that was to run the place. So, she has
been. And, well, now it is official." In addition to Fairchild, the
majority of the Linux Journal team will continue in their current roles
for Linux Journal under Belltown Media.
</p>

<p>
"This is a great opportunity for Linux Journal and for the industry
as a whole," said Fairchild. "We intend to take a hands-on approach,
working very closely with community leaders and our base of loyal
constituents to ensure that the magazine's content will be relevant and
useful, and that Linux Journal will be an enduring resource. We're
looking forward to taking LJ to the next level by focusing on this core
capability - delivering a highly specialized source of information for
Linux enthusiasts."
