I'm teaching a Sun class right now, and the response from my students
was uniformly sceptical: "They're just trying to stay in the game." I'm
just going to note that Apple has been playing exactly the same game -
kinda-sorta release some-but-not-all of the source, maybe - and it
hasn't done very much for them.

However, of course, the OpenSolaris codebase apparently (as everyone
suspected) includes quite a lot of binary-only, proprietary "secret sauce"
components.[2]  How useful the CDDL (and other open source <TT>/</TT> free-software)
portions would be without them is an open question.  My own expectation
would be "Not very; probably even substantially less than the
corresponding case with Apple Darwin."

The only thing I remember seeing mentioned specifically is drivers, which
is understandable--too many NDAs. IIRC, Sun has a compiler that recompiles
Linux drivers for Solaris--device support isn't one of great plusses of
Solaris that Sun have been cheerleading in any of the blog entries I've
seen (DTrace this, DTrace that :)

Heh. I think there will be a lot of public contributions to the code, if
only to clean it up. I never really understood why so much research goes
into code comprehension (well, aside from the fact that C lecturers write
some of the worst C around): open source projects <EM>need</EM> to have code that's
as clear as possible, otherwise noone can contribute. Heck, even Wine,
which (of necessity) has some of the most cryptic code I've ever seen
(self-modifying blobs of x86 binary code, C emulations of C++ exceptions
and classes, etc), is a model of clarity, as far as it can be.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Not so Open Solaris. Their tar implementation is one 182k .c file; their
nroff implementation uses the original Unix naming convention for files
(n1.c etc). I'm sure they'll get plenty of clean-up patches from people
cringing on Sun's behalf :)

I didn't have much time to really look into this yesterday (but I did
get some really good coding done, and had the very satisfying experience
of solving a thorny problem that's been bugging me for a couple of
years!); today is a new day, and I'm wasting^Wspending my morning
checking out the buzz on this. Fascinating - it looks and smells real.
In fact, reading Tim Bray's blog and the link tree that branches out
from it - thanks, Raj! - I'm slowly growing convinced that Sun has
finally clued in, bought the stock, drank the Koolaid. All I can say, in
stunned admiration, is "Bravo" - I had not expected it, and was actually
rather cynical about it, having built my expectations based on what I
saw from my little corner of the Sun culture. It seems I was wrong.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The interesting bit about this is that the Solaris kernel has been a
strictly "hands-off" affair since time immemorial; you could tweak some
user-space settings to influence its operation in some mild ways, but
that was about all (and learning to do even that required a three-day
class and using ADB [shudder].) As well, some of the operational
algorithms - e.g., the exact process of deciding how to accept/reject
TCP connections - were generally hinted at but the details were
<em> intentionally  </em> shrouded in mystery (security through obscurity, even
though Sun showed itself to be totally aware, in other places, that this
is not a useful approach.)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
There's also the fact - and I'm <em>  not  </em> snarking at Sun in the least, but
applauding their moving with the times - that Solaris installations are
growing far fewer percentage-wise; this latest change may just be a
simple recognition of fact and adaptation to it. I've spoken to many
people in the large corporate culture, in many places and many different
companies, and have heard the story/complaint/simple fact repeated many
times: "so this new guy comes into IT, and before anybody knows it, he's
got 30 Linux boxes up in one day..." Cost of software: zero. Cost of
machines: hauled out of a closet where it was stored due to being old
and unusable. That's a <EM>hard</EM> combination for a commercial machine+OS to
beat, stony hard - and companies that _aren't_ having to spend a million
bucks a year on buying new are starting to notice. Many of them -
including banks, the traditional stronghold of conservatism - are
quietly dropping their "no non-commercial OSes" policy.

Sun is an <em>  excellent  </em> hardware company; the cost of their gadgets is
quite high as compared to the commodity PC, but the quality and the
reliability that you get from the stuff can be absolutely stunning to
someone who's never experienced them. I've never had Sun stuff "fight"
me the way, e.g., a PC SCSI card has; the documentations was always
available, and the relevant setup was as obvious as it could be made and
robust. Solaris, seen in that light, has always been a house divided
against itself - and Sun appears to have finally resolved the ambiguity.

Bravo; bravo indeed. The Open Source world has grown - and it's quite

The "patents" comments are tautologically true -- but would be so
<em> regardless  </em> of licence.  That is, <em>  any  </em> codebase adversely encumbered
by patents is non-free/proprietary, irrespective of what licence
provisions would otherwise apply.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
That other bit about fixed attributions making a work
non-free/proprietary is one reason why, although I'm a long-time
subscriber to debian-legal, I only rarely read it, in order to safeguard
my blood pressure:  Author attributions may not be stripped in
derivative works by <em>  default action of copyright law ,</em>  so it is utter
lunacy to assert, as poster Garrett and numerous others do, that clauses
to that same effect make the work non-free through it "failing the
Chinese Dissident Test".

That licence requirement could be met by "Module foo.c was contributed

I tend to take an optimistic view of these things that look like naivete
from a certain perspective - any move in the direction of Open Source by
the historically-proprietary software companies is good for us. One of
the many underlying reasons for that is what I like to call "time in
grade": the longer these people spend using Open Source methods - to
whatever degree - the more these get embedded in their culture and the
environment around them. After a while, they're impossible to eradicate.
As for "the abyss looking back at you", I rely on the GPL and its ilk to
keep the resulting influence on the world of Open Source to a tolerable
minimum.

complex than this. However, abstracting this bit and staring at it for a
