As you might have noticed recently, several large companies have begun
to take an interest in Linux.  The Hewlett-Packard Company is one of
these, the first official involvement being their announcement of Linux
support for a line of PC Servers, announced in late January.  Shortly
thereafter, though not as a direct consequence, a group within H-P
sponsored what they called "Linux Day at H-P Labs" which was held on
February 9th of this year.
<P>
Interested people gathered from all over the corporation to the H-P
Labs buildings in Palo Alto to hear from Bob Young, of Red Hat, and
from Linus Torvalds himself.  Jean Bozman from IDC also spoke,
detailing the tremendous growth that Linux is experiencing.
<P>
The large conference room that was built for groups of 160 people
failed to hold a standing-room-only crowd that spilled out into the
hallway, so an overflow room had to be used, besides.  Additionally,
teleconferencing was used to bring the program to people who couldn't
travel to the conference in person.
<P>
I was very interested in what Linus and Bob said and thought that I
would pass along what I heard.  Their comments were informative and
filled in the history of how Linux came to be in its current position.
<P>
<H4><font color="maroon">Linus Torvalds</font></H4> 
<P>
When Linus got the idea in 1991 to write what has become Linux, he had
six month's experience with Unix.  He liked it much more than other
OSs, but there was a slight problem.  Actually several hundred to over
a thousand problems, those being the dollars it would cost to buy a
commercial Unix he could use at home.  At that time, all Unicies were
priced for large institutions, not for individuals--especially not poor
students. As a portion of the hardware cost, buying Unix for a PC
doubled, at least, the cost of the platform.  Linus began working on
his OS to provide himself and others with a low-cost (free) Unix-like
OS for personal use.  After the initial release, interest snowballed
and the number of contributors increased.  As Linus put it, a lot of
people put in a lot of work and he gets all the credit.
<P>
The people who contribute to Linux are motivated by personal
satisfaction, not money.  Many people do their best work for personal
satisfaction.  In a commercial setting, where the programmer is being
paid to develop, his manager might not allow him to refine, count
cycles, etc., like he can do on his own time.  In many cases, it would
not be viewed as cost effective to allow engineers that sort of time.
Whether it's for personal satisfaction, a desire to impress others, or
competition among kernel developers, a lot of craftsmanship goes into
much of the code.
<P>
Linux benefits from a development staff so large that no company could
afford it.  And much of the work is so meticulous that, in a commercial
setting, the cost would be too high to recapture the programmers'
salaries.  The absence of monetary concerns has created a product that
is better than any company could afford to produce.  The result of
Linux being free is that it has good technology due to collaboration,
and it is good for individuals to use and learn on.
<P>
Despite his desire for free software, he does not believe Open Source
Software (OSS) should be the only way to license software.  In his
opinion, OSS is good for "black and white" technical issues or
infrastructure.
<P>
It took two-and-a-half years between versions 2.0.0 and 2.2.0 of the
kernel, but still there are criticisms that Linux releases too often,
because of the 36 sub-releases of 2.0.  Linus said that since the
kernel developers mostly compile the kernel, other things that break
get found by non-kernel developers. Releasing often allows these things
to be found early.  Within the first two weeks of the 2.2 release,
there are already two patches.  He went on to say that if what you have
is working for you and there is no obvious reason to upgrade kernels,
then don't.
<P>
Linus' wish list for future kernels:
<P>
1.	parallel processing improvements (this seems to be a favorite
topic for him.  One of the major improvements from 2.0 to 2.2 is in the
SMP capabilities),
<P>
2.	a journaled file system [not because he thinks it is good, but
there have been many requests], and
<P>
3.	improvements for clustering (again parallelism).
<P>
In response to a question about porting Linux to PA-RISC, he said that
a partial port has been done and appears to work, but there is not a
lot of demand from end users. (It was unclear to me whether he was
referring to the MkLinux port reported in Linux Journal #44 (see
http://linuxgazette.net/issue44/2355.html), or some other work.)
<P>
When asked about types of programs for which kernel optimizations are
considered, he mentioned that web applications (which spend 90% of
their time in kernel-land), benefit far more than compilers, for
example, which spend very little time in the kernel.
<P>
When asked what H-P could do to help Linux: "H-P can release specs."
and "...stay away from legal problems with employees releasing under
the GPL [on their own]."
<P>
Quotes from this talk:
<P>
"Operating systems shouldn't be as exciting as they [currently] are."
<P>
"2.2 doesn't do everything.  It does everything you'd want to do."
<P>
"Set up a skunk works to develop a journaling file system within H-P. I
dare you."
<P>
Talking about the increasing complexity of kernel code management:
"[the] system is so complete that it is harder to add new features."
<P>
And, about how some companies deal with the GPL: "...more lawyers than
engineers...a dark and awful place."
<P>
<H4><font color="maroon">Bob Young, Red Hat</font></H4> 
<P>
To make sure we remembered who he was, Bob Young set his red hat on the
lectern at the beginning of his talk.  He was also wearing red socks.
Red must have become his favorite color.  He had no slides saying that
he saved such multimedia presentations for non-technicals­-like venture
capitalists.  Red Hat currently consists of about 100 engineers and
marketing people in the hills of North Carolina where, according to
Bob, salaries are low.
<P>
Bob made an analogy where he compared a "car" to a brand of car, and
Linux to a brand of Linux, Red Hat.  He considers Linux to consist of
the kernel (the engine) and all the other programs, shells, and
utilities that make it useful.  He said that, although you could build
your own car, we "usually" rely on a car maker to put all the parts
together for us. So, in this way, we "usually" rely on Red Hat,
Caldera, Debian, SUSe, etc. to assemble a useful distribution of Linux.
<P>
Bob's background was in leasing computers to large companies.  In those
days, once a company bought into a computer vendor's product, they were
pretty much stuck with them, because one vendor's machines didn't work
with any other's. He noticed that these companies didn't like that
their second computers would cost much more than their first ones.
This amounted to a loss of control in that the companies, once they had
decided on a particular vendor's systems, were more or less stuck with
them, unless they wanted to spend a lot of money and effort switching
over completely to another vendor.  The PC answered this loss of
control by allowing companies to pick and choose PC components that all
interoperated, mostly.  Linux does for computer software what PCs did
for hardware.  Linux was intended to be Unix-like, differentiated by
its licensing scheme.  It has given control to the user that is not
available from commercial OS vendors, including non-Unix flavors.
<P>
Red Hat started with FreeBSD (other free OS) while Caldera was pushing
Linux.  Bob wondered why Linux was getting to be so popular.  When he
found out why, he was waiting for some alternative hardware company
like Next or Be to pick up on Linux.  They didn't, so he did.
<P>
Bob said that Linux benefitted from Linus' relative isolation in
Finland.  If there had been a group of locals form as the main
contributors, then any distant help over the internet would be more
likely to be shut out, because the remote person wouldn't be there to
discuss and defend ideas.  With everyone having to work over the
internet because of the distance, all ideas had equal chance.  Having
developed a way to work over the internet also encouraged a broader
cooperative base.
<P>
He also explained that there are two types of programmers: those that
write company-internal applications, and those that write commercial
software; the latter are more likely to be Linux contributors, because
of their mindset toward the end product, i.e., users versus sellers.
He used an example to explain why cooperatively developed software is
more likely to be better software than commercial software.  Imagine a
radio astronomer has an idea for software to help point his radio dish.
 He could develop it in isolation, then try to market it to the "three
other" radio astronomers that might be interested in it.  He would also
be the only one to support it and fix any bugs found in it by the
customer-users.  The other way he could do it is to involve the others
from the start in the development of the software.  Bob's argument is
that the software that would result from this collaborative effort
would be better than what the commercial model would produce.  Also,
any bugs could be fixed by more people, and thus would be fixed faster.
 Bob calls this arrangement a "meritocracy". Linux benefits from being
a meritocracy because the contributors do their work for the benefit of
the code they themselves want to use. They also get credit among the
development community.
<P>
Periodically, the Unix community undergoes unification, but between
these times you see mostly division due to proprietary development from
each of the vendors.  When asked about the other Linux distributors,
and the danger of the same divisions happening among them, Bob pointed
out the expense of code forking. If one of the vendors forks the code,
they then become the only ones who can maintain the code, which he
believes would be very expensive.  He estimates that code maintenance
represents about 90% of the cost for a traditional commercial software
vendor.  Red Hat wants their developments to be adopted by Linus.  In
this way, Bob views all of the Linux distributors as partners.
<P>
Red Hat doesn't want to be in the shrink-wrap distribution business.
They would rather make their money from support.  Bob pointed out,
though, that the harder they try to get out of that business, the more
shrink-wrap they sell.  Now they are quite a large software
manufacturer.
<P>
Quotes from the talk:
<P>
"DOS is not an operating system; it is a bad collection of device
drivers."
<P>
Question from the audience: "Is the browser part of the operating
system?"--big laughs
<P>

<P>
In the afternoon session, a dozen presenters from within H-P spoke
about Linux in their current projects or products.  This is all pretty
new stuff so I am not allowed to write about it in detail.  However, I
can give some general information about the areas in which Linux is
finding place.  This covers the spectrum from internal use only, to
embedded Linux in full commercial products.
<P>
In the area of EDA (Electronic Design Automation) software H-P obtains
some tools from EDA vendors, while other tools are written internally.
One participant spoke about several internal EDA tools that had been
ported to Linux.
<P>
Another story of porting internally written software to Linux was from
a division that produces a commercial IC tester.  Wanting to take
advantage of the Intel platform, they had to decide between Linux and
NT and found that the Linux port was much simpler and less expensive.
Also, by purchasing a handful of proprietary libraries, they were able
to make the user interface on the new platform appear the same as on
the old.
<P>
Another couple of speakers shared their groups' use of embedded Linux
in the rapid prototyping of products; one in the area of networked
peripheral control, and the other in the area of telecommunications
measurement.
<P>
There were also some strictly software products that have been or will
soon be ported to Linux for general availability, including OpenMail,
H-P Web JetAdmin, and Firehunter ISP management software (see
http://www.hp.com for more information).
<P>
Finally, there is a group at H-P Labs porting Linux to IA-64.  They
demonstrated an emulator that can run the 64-bit code on a P133.  A
talk and paper will be given at Linux Expo in May.
<P>
One of the most important things I learned by attending Linux Day is
that there is a lot of interest in Linux within H-P.
