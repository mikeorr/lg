Hi.  I attempted to run your script at
<a href="../../../issue66/tag/2.html">http://linuxgazette.net/issue66/tag/2.html</a> on a directory on a USB drive,
ext3 partition, on a gentoo box with a 2.4 kernel.  The result (it seems to
be from your script, but maybe I'm wrong) is that many of the subdirectories
linux now thinks are not, in fact, directories, and for many others, it
gives an "Input/Output Error" on ls.  Any suggestions?
</p>

Hi, Amos -
</p>

<p>
You're probably unaware of this, but you sent your message in
an HTML format, which more than doubled the size of your message
unnecessarily, and will create extra work for our Mailbag editor.
Please change your mailer's settings to stop it from doing this. For
more info, please see <a href="http://expita.com/nomime.html">http://expita.com/nomime.html</a>.

I seriously doubt that it has anything to do with the script; it sounds
as though your directory inode is rather badly broken. My suggestion
would be to back up everything you can and run '/sbin/e2fsck -p' on your
device. In my experience, "Input/Output Error" is the message you get
when read() fails on a piece of hardware.

Heh -- I wrote up a separate script to do this sometime later in issue81, I
believe it was.  Your errors, however, are as a result of hardware.
