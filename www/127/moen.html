<h1>State of the antispam regime</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/moen.html">Rick Moen</A></b></p>

<p>
<p class="editorial"> One of the advantages of hanging out in The Answer
Gang is being privileged to hear when one of the Gangsters goes off on a
rant (which are usually lots of fun), or, as often happens in the case of
Rick Moen, fires off a mini-tutorial on some interesting subject. Recently,
in response to a comment of mine, Rick posted a reply that we'd like to
share with you, our readers; not only was it a bit long for our Mailbag,
but it also deserved the status of a full article. Many thanks to Jimmy
O'Regan for formatting the content; as with so many jobs around LG, "many
hands make light work".<br>

As to spam, you may or may not have noticed, but the incidence of it
has gone down (my estimate) by ~99% since Rick Moen took over
administering the list. It's been more than a year, and I don't think
I've seen a dozen spams get through during that time.</blockquote>
<p>Herewith, a brief report on the state of system spam-rejection.</p>
<p>As a reminder, TAG's setup is challenging, in that list policy
precludes requiring subscription before posting.  Thus, a prime antispam
tool isn't available.</p>
<p>The most-effective antispam tool is use of Exim 4.60 (w/sa-exim 4.2)'s
&quot;callout&quot; interface during incoming SMTP sessions, used to verify that
the connecting MTA is RFC-compliant (e.g., accepts DSNs and mail to the
postmaster and abuse accounts).  This blocks an immense percentage of
spam, and 55x-rejects those.  After that, the mail is subjected to
SpamAssassin 3.1 testing: High spamicity mail is 55x-rejected, <em>very</em>
high-spamicity mail is 45x-rejected (i.e., teergrubing, which attempts
to punish particularly flagrant malefactors by tempting them to
continually reattempt delivery).</p>
<p>I use some but not all of the optional enhancements provided by J.P.
Boggis's &quot;EximConfig&quot; package (<a class="reference" href="http://www.jcdigita.com/eximconfig/">http://www.jcdigita.com/eximconfig/</a>), of
which I have v. 2.0 installed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The setup does not (yet) use greylisting, which might be beneficial.</p>
<p>I've been reluctant to make my MTA depend on MySQL.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The setup does not (yet) attempt to SA-test mail with full unescaping and Base64 decoding of the message body text, which might be beneficial.</p>
<p>I've been reluctant to make my MTA depend on embedded Perl and MySQL.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The setup does not (yet) attempt flood protection / duplicate messages / repeat failed deliveries.</p>
<p>I've been reluctant to make my MTA depend on MySQL.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The setup does not (yet) attempt direct detection of malware as distinct from other types of spam.</p>
<p>I've been reluctant to make my MTA depend on detectors of MS-Windows malware, which after all isn't actually harmful, only annoying -- and it seems lame to have to run a virus checker on a Linux box, even ClamAV.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spam addressed to TAG since March 1 (to date) that evaded my filters was
as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>One in Polish.</li>
<li>A lame bit of Windows malware (zipped) with a quasi-nonsense cover message.</li>
<li>A piece of Russian/Cyrillic spam</li>
<li>Five 419 (advance-fee) frauds</li>
<li>Four phishing frauds.</li>
<li>An old-fashioned UCE</li>
</ul>
<p>In each case, I blackholed the delivering IP upon receipt -- but that's 
ultimately a poor solution:  You end up endlessly playing whack-a-mole.
Still, it makes sure there are no repeats from that IP.</p>
<p>I may finally overcome my reluctance to enable those above-cited
optional EximConfig features, persuant to my long-deferred server
migration to slightly less antique hardware, Real Soon Now.  Also, I
<em>could</em> attempt to update Exim and SA's rulesets, to help them
pattern-match better on 419 and phishing frauds.  (I gather that
financial fraud spam has been <em>really</em> taking off.)</p>
<p>The point of the recounting, above, is to highlight where the major
weaknesses in the current system lie:  non-English-language spam, and
financial fraud spam.</p>
<p>I try to be really, really careful in any experimentation with my MTA,
since mail is very important to me and my users, and since I can't
afford to lavish unplanned debugging time fixing a malfunctioning mail
system.  Thus, even though I know I really <em>should</em> upgrade to
EximConfig 2.2, sa-exim 4.2.1, and SpamAssassin 3.1.1 -- and put in
place some custom third-party rulesets for the latter
(<a class="reference" href="http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/CustomRulesets">http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/CustomRulesets</a>), I've been slow to
do so for fear of breakage and extra time commitment.</p>

<!-- http://lists.linuxgazette.net/mailman/private/tag/2006-April/008056.html -->
<p>[Description of the existing toolset:  Exim 4.60, sa-exim 4.2,
EximConfig 2.0, and SpamAssassin 3.1 -- along with its design goals, 
current weaknesses, and reasons why I've been reluctant to implement
some optional extensions and in general am very careful about breakage.]</p>
<p>Warning: Following paragraphs include opinions, which you are welcome to 
either adopt, take home, and admire, <em>or</em> scowl at and hurl imprecations
towards, as local cerebral wiring policy dictates.  Readers looking for
guaranteed objective truth should stick to mathematics -- and even then
stay far away from anything touched by Kurt G&#246;del.</p>
<p>Spam defence is endlessly controversial for lots of reasons, including
inherent drawbacks (false positives, false negatives, other types of
collateral damage) in even the best regimes.  No matter what tactics you
use, you annoy someone -- and mailing lists (being glorified
mail-forwarding devices) have proven to be Ground Zero for the spam
problem and resulting controversies.</p>
<p>The &quot;luv-main&quot; mailing list, of the Linux Users of Victoria (Australia) has
recently erupted in one such donnybrook, where the overwhelming majority 
(and pretty much <em>all</em> of the more-technical members) wish to convert
the mailing list to publicly searchable archives, while a vocal minority 
stand in the way, protesting their right to continue hiding their
mailing addresses from spammers.  Many innocent electrons have been
killed in the resulting discussion, but at least it was established to
the satisfaction of most that the only reasons hide-from-spammers tactics 
&quot;work for many people&quot; (as a proponent put it) are short usage periods
and dumb luck:  Over time, any address used for mail will become
discovered by spammers through any of several diverse means, including
exposure on other people's virus-infected Windows boxes.</p>
<p>LUV's likely compromise solution will be creation of a fully public
&quot;luv&quot; mailing list alongside the obscured &quot;luv-main&quot; one, with the
expectation that the latter ghetto will wither and die.  (Naturally, the
minority aren't happy with that proposal, either.)</p>
<p>On the other side of the Pacific Ocean, the Silicon Valley Linux User
Group's mailing lists are gradually becoming more spammy, despite using
(modulo versions) <em>exactly</em> the same MTA and spam-rejection software 
I use, because SVLUG's Linux server has been completely unmaintained for
2+ years.</p>
<p>I'm not unsympathetic towards hide-from-spammers people:  As they often
point out, most use mail facilities over which they have no
administrative control -- often, in fact, their work mailboxes.  A
deluge of spam would make their lives miserable and might even interfere
with their professional lives.  This perceived loss-of-control threat 
increases their stress levels immensely, and impels them to make
sometimes emotional demands on listadmins and others.  (I frequently 
get mail saying &quot;I [/someone else] inadvertantly revealed my private
e-mail address on mailing list $FOO.  Would you mind please removing it
from the public archive?&quot;  I always <em>do</em> help such people.  Even though
I don't share their general approach, it's the kind thing to do.)</p>
<p>In any event, I'd been pondering both the slow deterioration of SVLUG's
spam-defences (from my front-row seat as its mailing list moderator) and
my own system's occasional slippage on TAG mail -- e.g., the
aforementioned twelve spams over the last six weeks: 5 advance-fee
frauds, 4 phishing frauds, 1 in Russian, 1 Windows malware, and 1 UCE.
As with SVLUG's system, I realised that I could probably do better,
after a bit of updating.</p>
<p>So, a couple of days ago, I <em>did</em> some.  You'll maybe have noticed that
we've had absolute, blissful silence on the spam front, since then -- 
which might be coincidence, or maybe not.</p>
<p>I figured out that one easy path to the low-hanging fruit was:  beef up
the SpamAssassin rulesets.  In an ideal world, this would not be my
preferred approach:  SA is a very beefy and slow Perl app, and
those <em>same</em> heuristics, implemented as improvements to the Exim4
front-end rulesets would, mutatis mutandis, be much more desirable.
However, those aren't at hand, while there's a veritable bazaar in
third-party ruleset files for SA, right here:</p>
<p><a class="reference" href="http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/CustomRulesets">http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/CustomRulesets</a></p>
<p>The ones I dropped into /etc/mail/spamassassin, a couple of days ago,
were as follows:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
70_zmi_german.cf     Catches German language spam.
Chinese_rules.cf     Rules to catch spams written in Chinese.
mime_validate.cf     Finds MIME errors common in mails sent by bulk mailers.
blacklist_ro.cf      Catches spams written in Romanian or by Romanian spammers.
evilnumbers.cf       Phone #s, PO boxes, &amp; street addresses harvested from spam.
chickenpox.cf        Looks for words broken up by extraneous symbols.
french_rules.cf      Catches spams written in French.
malware.cf           Detects URLs known to point to malware.
</pre>
<p>There's a standard cronjob (Rules du Jour) to keep these and others
updated; I haven't implemented that yet, as I'm still testing.</p>
<p>Initially, I also installed this one:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sa-blacklist:  a large set of blacklist entries of domains and IP addresses. 
</pre>
<p>This turned out to an 11MB(!) ruleset file.  For a Perl script.  I
rather recklessly <em>did</em> give it a try, resulting in the kernel
out-of-memory killer going on a shooting spree (on my antique 256MB RAM
PIII server) about five minutes later.</p>
<p>In addition, <em>also</em> quite usefully, I'm sure (if not more so than the SA
improvements), I dropped in updated nine updated ACL files for the
J.P. Boggis's EximConfig suite of Exim4 rules (and other things):
<a class="reference" href="http://www.jcdigita.com/eximconfig/#ACLs">http://www.jcdigita.com/eximconfig/#ACLs</a></p>
<p>...which brings us to the present, and the (for now) absence of new spam
arrivals.  Moral of the story:  It's possible (at least, if you're an MTA
operator) to have a credible, livable alternative to the venerable
&quot;hide from spammers&quot; stance:  Use better technology, apply it
intelligently, and be aware that some ongoing maintenance is required.</p>
<p>Personally, I would regard it as beneath my dignity to do otherwise.  
Internet presence is my community's core competency, so I'll be damned if
I'm going to surrender even an inch of it.</p>
<p>One caveat:  Silence isn't necessarily blissful.  There will always be
collateral damage, and one must keep an eye out for addresses, IPs,
hostnames, etc. that should be whitelisted.</p>

<h3><a name="the-downside-of-blackholing">The downside of blackholing</a></h3>
<!-- http://lists.linuxgazette.net/mailman/private/tag/2006-April/008022.html -->
<p>Jimmy Regan replied to TAG querent Marcin Niewalda:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; My&#347;l&#281;, &#380;e to pomy&#322;ka: pan napisa&#322; do listy adresowego magazynu
&gt; internetowego. Dlatego &#380;e nasz magazyn jest napisany po angielsku,

&gt; Delaveaux&#64;heagmedianet.de ale my&#347;l&#281;, &#380;e ten pan mowi tylko po
&gt; angielsku i po niemiecku; a nie wiem, czy ten adres jest nadal
&gt; aktualny.
</pre>
<p>Separately, I had commented:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; In each case, I blackholed the delivering IP upon receipt -- but
&gt; that's ultimately a poor solution:  You end up endlessly playing
&gt; whack-a-mole.  Still, it makes sure there are no repeats from that IP.  
</pre>
<p>And there's another reason why it's a poor solution:  Some days, you get
trigger-happy, e.g., when an innocent, on-topic query arrives in Polish
-- which is a problem if, unlike Jimmy, one is Polish-challenged.</p>
<p>Having seen the original query and (erroneously) concluded that it was
spam, I absent-mindedly added the delivering host's IP to
/etc/exim4/eximconfig/reject/ip via the vim instance I leave open all
the time editing that file.  It's a straight listing of &quot;Individual full
sender IP addresses to reject&quot;, one per line.  Today, several days
later, I had long ago lost track of which line it was.  Fortunately, in
this <em>one</em> instance, my error remains fixable:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[rick at linuxmafia]
~ $ dig -t mx okiem.pl +short
10 mail.okiem.pl.
[rick at linuxmafia]
~ $ dig mail.okiem.pl +short
72.232.62.58
</pre>
<p>Accordingly, I've just now un-blackholed poor Marcin's ISP mail server
IP.  But in many cases, I'd either not realise I'd misjudged, or be
unable to re-find which IP it was.</p>
<p>Anyway, the larger point I wanted to make is that what I said in the
three-line quotation, above, wasn't exactly right -- because I actually
<em>do</em> try to be mindful of grey areas, and look closely at what the IP 
really <em>is</em>, before consigning it to permanent oblivion.  (One doesn't 
want to rely on Received headers' hostnames in so doing, except for ones
supplied by my own receiving MTA doing reverse-resolves:  Spammers lie;
&quot;dig -x&quot; is often one's friend.)</p>
<p>For example, if the prior-hop IP on a 419-fraud spam corresponds to
hostname mx105.exampleisp.com, then blackholing it would be dumb:  For
one thing, impliedly exampleisp.com has at least 104 other mail
exchangers.  For another, I'm not necessarily eager to pronounce
anathema on exampleisp.com just because of <em>one</em> 419 fraudmail.  That
could happen to almost anyone operating an MTA.  It could happen to me
(but only until I tracked down the user on my system who did it and... 
reasoned with him).</p>
<p>I'm reminded of a passage in my friend Karsten Self's (CC'd) excellent
recent analysis paper &quot;CIDR House Rules:  Use of BGP Router Data to
Identify and Address Sources of Internet Abuse&quot;<a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id2" name="id2">[1]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While blocklisting is one possible option, I'd very much like to see
the discussion move beyond that point.  A preferred approach is what I
term &quot;proportionate response&quot;.  First: you'll likely want rules to
expedite known-trusted mail, or high priority mail from remote
organizational sites, peers, clients, vendors, or other established
relationships.  Secondly, many peers will either have small overall
volumes, or not have a clearly identifiable nature.  This leaves the
set of networks that are both high-volume and overwhelmingly spammy
in nature.  Of course, any such implementation would have to be
evaluated in a business and organizational context.</p>
<p>In proportionate response, a certain level of abuse would be met by a
proportionate level of response.  For example, a network from which
90% of email was found to be spam, 90% of traffic originating from
that network would be denied or dropped, either at the service
(protocol) or IP level, at random.  If done at the SMTP transaction
level, either as a timeout (without 250 OK) or non-permanent
rejection, this would mean legitimate mail still has a fighting
chance to get through.  A 90% reject rate would allow half of mail
through on 5 retries, for a typical 2 hour delay.  A spam server
without retry rules would fail delivery of 90% of its mail; with
retries, it would suffer large mail spools and possible other resource
starvation.  The site implementing such a policy will receive
immediate benefit to itself.  Widespread adoption is not necessary to
be locally beneficial.  As multiple and large sites adopt such measures,
impacts on abuse-tolerant networks would be significant.  The approach
is to be both non-invasive and non-retaliatory.  You are not taking any
action that in any way directly changes or affects a remote system:
but are subjecting it to a denial of interest.  As a proportionate
response, reject rates could vary with total traffic volume, abusive
traffic percentage, and severity of abuse, as suited specific needs.
Fine levels of control are therefore possible; operators are not
reduced to all-or-nothing responses to abuse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't yet have the toolsets to implement Karsten's excellent advice,
though I admire its judicious approach.  Lacking those, I mostly rely on 
the previously described RFC-compliance checking (implemented via Exim
4.x callouts), SPF-checking, tarpitting, and intentionally very sparse
use of other lossy filtering.  Playing whack-a-mole on spam-source IPs
is mostly a losing game, with too much collateral damage.</p>
<p>Main exceptions are:  (1) Some IPs whose owning domains / companies I've
just seen much too often in that context, and accordingly have classed
as evil.  The French division of European broadband ISP Wanadoo is the
example that most comes to mind:  After seeing way, way too much blatant 
spam from IPs respolving to *.wanadoo.fr hostnames, I just started
adding them as they spammed me to /etc/exim4/eximconfig/reject/ip.
Legitimate French Wanadoo customers will increasiingly be SOL in
sending mail to any address on my machine, which is a little unfair but
life's imperfect.</p>
<p>It's basically a moral judgement on my part that Wanadoo should do much
better, and that therefore it <em>and</em> its users can go to Hell.  This
isn't very nice of me, and possibly isn't a wise long-term measure, but
it <em>feels</em> good.  ;-&gt;</p>
<p>(2) IPs whose surrounding facts make them seem like IPs from pools of
virus-infected Windows desktop machines being abused to crank out
virusgrams, UCE, etc.  One can reasonably guess that nothing from those
IPs will ever be legitimate, for at least 3-5 year values of &quot;ever&quot;.</p>
<p>It would be good if entreis in /etc/exim4/eximconfig/reject/ip 
entries (and similar files for related purposes) were at least 
date-stamped and would time out:  They aren't and don't.  My maintaining 
such a file manually is not very satisfactory and has obvious drawbacks.
Over time, I hope to phase it out -- and maybe even pull Wanadoo out of
its oubliette.</p>

<p>Abstract:  &quot;BGP router data may be used to identify contiguous regions of
network space from which significant abuse is observed.  Experience
suggests a strong power-law relationship in ranking such sources.
Applying this knowledge in abuse countermeasures may markedly reduce
filtering overhead while minimizing inadvertant blocking and increasing
total costs to abuse-tolerant networks.&quot;</p>
