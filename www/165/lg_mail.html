Hello list,
</p>

<p>
I have configured a samba server which is a standalone file and printer
sharing samba. I have no problem to use it from Linux. but strange
problem from WinXP box. First of all the XP machine wait long to reach
the share and though a mapdrive is possible to create for the share; it
is immediately <strong>Disconnected</strong> after a reboot of the XP. More over a
connected mapdrive lost its share path after approx 2 hrs. I am really
very confused to see these strange problem in XP box.

Here is my config file I am using for samba ( collected from an online doc )

Hello,
</p>

<p>
Is there anyone using icewm+idesk combination ? I have seen that
wallpaper support is already there in idesk; more over changing the wall
paper from a source folder is also possible. But is it all theory ? I
can't get the wallpaper working in box. I am using idesk  0.7.5-4.
</p>

<p>
Any success from anyone ?

It's been an interesting experience. We're at the midterm evaluations
now, and 8 of our 9 students look like they'll pass - I know I gave my
student a glowing review, which is no less than he deserves. The
student who looks like likely to fail leaves a bit of a bad taste in
our mouths, because he not only was a member of our community
beforehand, but a few of us specifically talked him into it, and heck,
we got drunk with him at a workshop in Dublin. Barring the (frankly,
unlikely) scenario that he has actually been busily working away in
some remote location without 'net access, I hope he'll do the
honourable thing and bow out gracefully - I don't think any of us
particularly like being in the position of having to choose between
either feeling like we've betrayed this guy in some way or that we've
helped him to steal money from Google.
</p>

<p>
But, all in all, it's been an interesting experience so far, and one
that I'd recommend to anyone.

<p>
Dear list,
</p>

<p>
I have become confused about the domain name handling in debian. I have
a suse box too. It is very easy to set the domain name in suse box "
domainname &lt;example.com&gt; ". Similarly to set FQDN in suse " hostname
&lt;hostname&gt;.&lt;example.com&gt;"
</p>

<p>
How to achieve this in debian ? No domainname command is there in debian
(lenny). There are /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname but where can I save
<strong>domain</strong> name ? and where to save FQDN ? I am really confused here.
Please enlighten me. Thanks.  
</p>

<p>
PS: Kindly CC me

Hello list,
</p>

<p>
I have upgraded my box to debian squeeze. And discover ffmpeg stops
converting to .mp3 . I have libmp3lame installed ; more over it was
running well before up-gradation. After doing some google serach I have
found that libmp3lame support has been disabled in official debian
package. Then I have found multimedia.debia.org repo where the ffmpeg is
distributed with less strict license policy. but again vlc now broken
after adding that repo in my sources.lst and updating due to library
collision. 
</p>

<p>
Is there any repo which provides the ffmpeg with mp3 support and still
maintain the official debian naming scheme ?  then I can use both vlc as
well as ffmpeg.
</p>

<p>
Thanks
</p>

<p>
Kindly cc to me

This is a part of an interesting series at the Good/blog about the (X)

Dear Mr. James T. Dennis,
</p>

<p>
I read of your article on the web "The Answer Guy" and I think you can
help me with my application.
</p>

<p>
I need help to write a program to sort out of some of my e-mail and auto
response to buttons " accept" or "decline". I am not a dot generation
and it will require too much efforts to start from the beginning. I am
asking some one will write the application for me for a
fee(appreciation). Can you help? Or, can you assign someone else to
help? I use the regular hotmail in the window environment.
</p>

<p>
Regards,
</p>

<p>
Terry Tung

&gt;&gt;&gt; These attributes are used by the quota management system, which I didn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; describe in the article. It is basically a web-based GUI where
&gt;&gt;&gt; administrators can change these values. Some scripts read the quota
&gt;&gt;&gt; values from the LDAP directory and write it to the Cyrus server by using
&gt;&gt;&gt; the Cyrus Perl API. mailSizeMax isn't used in the setup, but again it
&gt;&gt;&gt; was supposed to be.
&gt;&gt; Is the management system based off your "cyrus_syncboxes.pl"? Could you 
&gt;&gt; describe the system you used?
&gt; 
&gt; The management system consists of a couple of Perl scripts.
&gt; cyrus_syncboxes.pl only synchronises the mail quota settings from the
&gt; LDAP tree with the settings on the Cyrus server. The other scripts are
&gt; CGIs and part of a web management UI. Admins can create, delete and
&gt; modify accounts. A rough overview over the functionality can be found
&gt; here:
&gt; <a href='http://web.luchs.at/information/docs/mailadmin_prozesse.pdf'>http://web.luchs.at/information/docs/mailadmin_prozesse.pdf</a>
&gt; 
&gt; I am trying to publish the scripts as soon as I got the time to review
&gt; the code and remove everything specific to the servers they manage.
&gt; 
&gt; 
</pre>
Rene,
</p>

<p>
Did you ever get around to publishing the scripts mentioned above?
</p>

<p>
What web management UI are you using? Was it something like phpldapadmin 
or some custom job?
</p>

<p>
What webmail system are you using with this setup?
</p>


<p>
Cheers,
Peter.

Hi!
</p>

<p>
I use PPP to use a GPRS and/or CDMA modem. The 'pppd' often dies
abruptly, blurting out "modem has hung up".
</p>

<p>
I am not suspecting a network issue as it doesn't happen on Windows.
Any idea how can I find out the reason and may be then correct it ?
</p>

<p>
Thanks!
