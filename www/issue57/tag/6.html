Linux in a Windows NT Domain (under a PDC)

<P><STRONG>
Is it possible to connect the Linux <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> 6.0 (costum installed) to the
network wherein the PDC is a Windows NT 4.0 Server? Do I need additional
tools to connect it? Is it similar to UNIX X-windows?

Basically all interoperation between Linux (and other forms of UNIX)
and the Microsoft Windows family of network protocols (SMB used by
OS/2 LANManager and LANServer, WfW, Win '9x, NT, and W2K) is done
through the free Samba package.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Normally Samba allows a Linux or other UNIX system to act as an
SMB file and print server.  There are various ways of getting Linux
to act as an SMB client (including the smbclient program, which is
basically like using "FTP" to an SMB server, and the smbfs kernel
option that allows one to mount SMB shares basically as though they
were NFS exports).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now, when it comes to having Linux act as a client in an MS Windows
"domain" (under a PDC, or primary domain controller) it takes a
bit of extra work.  Recently the Andrew Tridgell and his Samba team
have been working on a package called "winbind."  Tridge demonstrated
it to me last time he was in San Francisco.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Basically you configure and run the winbind daemon, point it at
your PDC (and BDCs?) and it can do host and user lookups, (and
user authentication?) for you.   I guess there is also a libnss
(name services selector) module that is also included, so you
could edit your Linux system's <TT>/etc/nsswitch.conf</TT> to add this,
just as you might to force glibc linked programs to query NIS,
NIS+, LDAP or other directory services.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now I should point out two things about what Tridge showed me.
First, it was under development at the time.  It probably still
is.  You'd want to look at the Samba web pages and read about the
current state of the code <TT>---</TT> but it may not be ready for use
on production systems.  (I hear that some sites are already
using it in production, but basically that's because it's their
only choice).  The other thing I should mention is that I got the
basic "salesman's" demo.  That's not any fault of Tridge's (he wasn't
trying to "sell" it to me and he certainly can get into the technical
nitty gritty to any level that I could understand).  It's just that
we didn't have much time to spend together.  As usual we were both
pressed for time.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I'm writing this on a train, which is why I can't look for
more details at the Samba site for you.  So, point your
browser at: <A HREF="http://www.samba.org"
	>http://www.samba.org</A> for more details.
