<h1>EclipseCon Conference 2006: The Way of Eclipse</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</A></b></p>


<p>The 2006 EclipseCon had more of everything -- projects,
developers, tech sessions, exhibitors and sponsors.
This is substantially due to the increasing use of Eclipse both
by corporate developers and at within the major tool
vendors. IBM, BEA, Compuware, Sybase, just to name a
few, are all dedicating their in-house resources to furthering
many Eclipse projects, and reaping the benefits of interoperable
tools and components.</p>

<p>Over 1300 people attended, and it was a sell-out. The main
EclipseCon conference ran 3 days, preceded by a day of tutorials,
2 of which were free to conference attendees [ by
BusinessObjects, and by BEA]. There were 7 simultaneous tracks,
but some were 'short talks' [4 crammed into an hour] and some
were 'long talks', so there was a lot of intersession movement.
Here's a link to a table view of the sessions: <a href=
"http://www.eclipsecon.org/2006/Table.do?id=all&amp;date=2006-3-21">
http://www.eclipsecon.org/2006/Table.do?id=all&amp;date=2006-3-21</a></p>

<p>Now that Eclipse 3.2 is out and the coordinated Callisto
release of Eclipse projects has been successful, it would be nice
to review the conference that preceded Callisto.</p>

<p>It's hard to believe that Eclipse got started less than 5
years ago but is now widely used and respected. The Eclipse
Platform is written primarily in Java and has been deployed on a
range of development workstations including Linux, HP-UX, AIX,
Solaris, QNX, Mac OS X, and Windows systems.</p>

<p>Eclipse is first and foremost a tools framework.
The editor/IDE code is itself an assemblage of tools and
components built under various Eclipse projects. What
Eclipse provides is an extensible development platform with
application frameworks for building software in a consistent
way. The Eclipse ecosystem is those projects,
and it is also the developers and vendors who contribute to those
projects. At EclipseCon, those folks get to meet each
other.</p>

<p>One goal of this Eclipse summit was to coordinate on-going
Eclipse projects to better compete with offerings from Redmond.
This is shown in the complete lifecycle approach that many
projects take [see 'ALF' and 'Corona' below]. But, because most
of Eclipse is Java-based, developers get a 'write-once, run
mostly any where' premium with Eclipse. With the upcoming
Vista/Windows OS moving away from the aging Win32 API, there may
be incentive for enterprises to consider Eclipse for that very
reason.</p>

<p>EclipseCon is where a vast and vibrant community
assembles. There are poster sessions for embryonic
projects and whole tracks of sessions for widely adopted
projects. It can be a bit daunting for an Eclipse
newbie, although some of the tracks [and tutorials] are aimed at
those starting out.</p>

<p>I have a few session summaries below, but found I needed to
study the varied Eclipse projects to understand how everything
fit together. So, here are summaries of some major
Eclipse initiatives, many of which were announced or highlighted
at EclipseCon:</p>


<h3>ALF -- Integration the Open Source Way</h3>

<p>ALF extends the popular Eclipse development platform by using
an open-source framework to tightly integrate ALM suites or
individual products, helping developers to manage application
changes. The Eclipse Foundation announced support and new
partnerships that strengthen the Eclipse Application Lifecycle
Framework (ALF) Project, and has made new proof of concept
code available for download.</p>

<p>In the current practice, varied integration tools use numerous
point-to-point integrations that are fragile, partial, and
inflexible. The solution [ paraphrasing from the ALF Web page, <a
href=
"http://www.eclipse.org/alf/">http://www.eclipse.org/alf/</a> ]
is to make tools <em>orchestratable</em> to provide repeatable
processes responsive to changes in an organization by building
upon an interoperable and collaborative collection of services
and components. The tool provider can expose as much (or as
little) as he or she chooses, and the consumer of these
technologies will have the ultimate control over how these
technologies are orchestrated together. This is putting SOA
(Service-Oriented Architecture) into the tool set.</p>

<p>Using a BPEL engine to orchestrate the 'ServiceFlows',
compliant tools makes ALF aware that something significant has
happened, and the ALF EventManager filters and routes those
events. There is also a set of domain vocabularies
that define the events, objects, and attributes.</p>

<p>The ALF Project, initiated by Serena Software in the spring of
2005, addresses the universal problem of integrating Application
Lifecycle Management (ALM) technologies so that they provide full
interoperability. Currently more than thirty vendors have pledged
support for the ALF project, and recent additions to those
committing resources include AccuRev, PlanView, and Viewtier.</p>

<p>The four primary objectives of the ALF project are to provide
an SOA-based cross-tool communication infrastructure for ALM
solutions; leverage Eclipse open-source components and industry
standards; develop common and extensible domain-specific
vocabularies for improved interoperability; and provide
conformance rules for varying levels of participation through a
layered Web services extensibility API. ALF is a liberating
shift in how IT organizations can effectively manage change
within their environment and free developers from a most
common pain point -- broken development tool integration.</p>

<p>"ALF changes everything," said Kevin Parker, vice-president of
market development at Serena, and Eclipse ALF Project Management
Committee member.  "As tools evolve, ALF will remain the constant
integrator, enabling developers to select best-in-class
technologies in support of enterprise initiatives."</p>

<p>"ALF is an important project for the future growth of
the Eclipse ecosystem," said Mike Milinkovich, executive
director of Eclipse Foundation. "ALF builds on the promise
of the Eclipse platform for tools integration, and provides an
open-source infrastructure for collaboration and interoperability
between development tools across the entire lifecycle."</p>

<p>So, a lot of vendors in the Expo Hall displayed ALF logos at
their booths and some, particularly Serena and Seque, provided
integration demos.</p>


<h3>Corona Project - a Tool Services Framework</h3>

<p>Linked with ALF, Corona is about tool integration and an event
model to propagate events across multiple Workbench instances.
Corona will enable Eclipse constructs, such as a "project", to be
shared in a distributed environment. Corona will provide an
Eclipse-based server-side runtime environment that will provide
Web service access to allow manageability to SOA components
deployed within Corona.</p>

<p>Corona is conceptually a layer of middleware between the
Eclipse framework and individual plugins. With Corona, multiple
developer workbenches share events. However, the layer is
generalized enough that non-Eclipse development environments can
participate [e.g., Microsoft's VS, via a Web service].</p>

<!-- *** This is NOT much of a compliment... :) ***

<p>Corona derives its name from the bright flare of hot gases
that are visible around a star during a solar eclipse.</p>

-->

<p>Corona can be compared to the collaboration back-end of
Microsoft VS Team Foundation server and the tool integration of
MS VS Team System. There are also elements of IBM's JAZZ
developer collaboration. Taken together, ALF and Corona lay the
groundwork for Eclipse to succeed at Application Lifecycle
Management [ALM] and to compete with all of Microsoft's offerings
in this arena. Demonstrations of both ALF and Corona were
provided during the two day track of demos at EclipseCon.</p>

<p>See: <a href=
"http://www.eclipse.org/corona/doc/Corona%20Eclipse%20Forum%20Europe.pdf">
http://www.eclipse.org/corona/doc/Corona%20Eclipse%20Forum%20Europe.pdf</a></p>


<h3>Rich Client Platform - RCP</h3>

<p>While the Eclipse platform is designed to serve as an open
tools platform, its components can be used to build just about
any client application. RCP provides a way of assembling
GUI-based applications that can run without the need for the full
Eclipse IDE. It offers standard client interface
components that works as a front end to enterprise apps running
on Linux or any other supported OS. That means any client, any
server.</p>

<p>The minimal set of plug-ins needed to build a rich client
application is known as the Rich Client Platform. The main
thing that differentiates a rich client application from the
platform workbench is that the application is responsible for
defining which class should be run as the main application.</p>

<p>Applications other than IDEs can be built using a subset of
the platform. These rich applications are still based on a
dynamic plug-in model, and the UI is built using the same
toolkits and extension points. So, the developer can
chose how light or heavy to make the application.</p>

<p>The initial goal was to reuse Eclipse components to build and
deploy applications on any platform and leverage the Eclipse
development model. However, there are now four initiatives
to extend the usefulness of RCP:</p>

<ul>
<li> * Eclipse Data Tools Project (DTP) &ndash;
provides developers with a collection of core frameworks and
tools for writing data-centric applications on the RCP
platform.</li>

<li> * Eclipse Communication Framework (ECF)
Project &ndash; introduces protocol-neutral VOIP
"call API". Implementations are being developed based
on Google Talk (Jingle), SIP and Asterisk. ECF enables the
creation of RCP applications that require client-server and/or
peer-to-peer messaging and communications and currently supports
the creation of integrated multi-protocol IM/chat, file sharing
and data sharing applications.</li>

<li> * Enterprise Content Management Project
(Apog&eacute;e) &ndash; proposed by Nuxeo to create a global
client platform for building enterprise content management
(ECM)-oriented desktop applications. The project will help
developers to build RCP-based applications that integrate
features such as collaboration, document management, business
processes and business forms applications.</li>

<li> * Enterprise Component Framework Project
&ndash; a project to extend the Equinox GUI framework to enable
Eclipse components to be developed and used in enterprise server
applications. These include the GUI widget library
that allows applications to natively run on multiple platforms,
including Windows, Linux, and MacOS.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Session Summaries</h3>

<p>Most of the Technical Sessions are available here:
<a href=
"http://www.eclipsecon.org/2006/Sub.do?id=all">http://www.eclipsecon.org/2006/Sub.do?id=all</a></p>

<p>I'll provide a few summaries below:</p>


<h3>State of Eclipse</h3>

<p>This presentation was formerly called 'Eclipse goes for
Global Domination', and was hosted by John Andrews of
analyst firm Evans Data Corp (EDC). He decided to be a bit
less pre-emptive.</p>

<p>Eclipse users are substantially VARs and corporate developers,
compared to general user population statistics.  This means that,
at smaller companies, there is less adoption of Eclipse, but it
is very well represented in the middle and large company
space.</p>

<p>North American growth of Eclipse use has been 88% in 2+ years,
while Euro-ME-Africa adoption has grown 7-fold.</p>

<p>Results from EDC's IDE use survey shows Eclipse is 2nd to
Visual Studio, at 24.3 vs. 55.3 percent, whereas Sun Java Studio
and NetBeans, and IBM and Oracle's IDEs are all just around 11%
<em>each</em>. However, Eclipse use is growing faster than
Microsoft's VS suite. [Note that both of Sun's tools add up to
about 22%.] EDC estimates that Eclipse could catch up with Visual
Studio in about two more years.
</p>

<p><img src="misc/dyckoff/evans-ide-table.png" height="454" width="640" border="0" title="IDE table"></p>

<p>While MS tools dominate both enterprises and SMB, Eclipse
growth is stronger in the enterprise, while trends show MS VS use
is dropping slowly in large corporations. Among the challenges
Eclipse will face in winning over Microsoft-based developers is a
perception that Visual Studio provides more functionality in the
Windows environment than Eclipse, and that it seems to have
better support offerings from Microsoft.</p>

<p>Driving Eclipse acceptance is its low cost and other factors,
such as its existing broad industry adoption and the belief in
developer circles that Eclipse is among the most technologically
advanced tools sets. Yet, fewer than 30% are willing to pay for
Eclipse support, and only 15% are ready to pay now. Andrews
called this a 'complex story", since most respondents are
unwilling to pay over $100 for a plugin, and only 15% willing to
pay up to $250. That may trouble companies betting their futures
as commercial developers of Eclipse plugins.</p>

<p>The graphic below is taken from the Evans IDE study, and shows
the overall developer rankings based on compiler, make functions,
editor, profiler, help, etc., and shows both Eclipse and NetBeans
trailing the other IDEs.</p>

<p><img src="misc/dyckoff/evans-ide-2006.png" height="550" width="700" border="0" title="Overall rankings"></p>

<p>Another trend EDC notes: more Eclipse users are using more
OSS, and more often. This is consistent with the willingness to
embrace a FOSS IDE in a corporate setting and it may mean that
Eclipse is really the camel's nose in the tent.</p>

<p>[Evans Data had promised us at LG that they would make many of
the supporting slides available by June, but they haven't.
This partly updated 'IDE Scorecard' is publicly available, but
it doesn't fully cover the EclipseCon presentation:

<h3>Comparing Eclipse to Visual Studio</h3>

<p>Java developer Madhu Siddalingaiah presented a
comparison of Microsoft's Visual Studio IDE to Eclipse and
its open-source development environment. [This presentation
is here: <a href=
"http://www.eclipsecon.org/2006/Sub.do?id=50">http://www.eclipsecon.org/2006/Sub.do?id=50</a>]<br>

As a developer currently working on an e-prescription project using the
PocketPC platform, Siddalingaiah has first-hand experience with both VS and
Eclipse.</p>

<p>Siddalingaiah first conceded that the Visual Studio IDE is great for
beginners. It gives a novice a headstart, can support multiple programming
languages [VB, C++, C#], and can produce code targeted at different
environments, but mostly Microsoft. (This may change as MS flirts with Xen
virtualization to host Linux on Windows; see related NewsBytes
story <a href="lg_bytes.html#general">here</a>.)</p>

<p> The VS IDE, he noted, also has features for more-advanced users.
However, the development processes in Visual Studio still follows the old
waterfall development model: code, compile, debug, and repeat, repeat,
repeat.</p>

<p>Eclipse, in comparison, is open source, has a large developer
support community, and its code runs in almost every computing
environment. There is no Microsoft platform lock-in and no
Microsoft platform 'tax'. [VS Studio and Team products cost
hundreds of dollars per seat.] Also, new development
tools and frameworks just snap in.</p>

<p>That said, Siddalingaiah went on to critique VS in more
detail: its classes and methods are insufficiently documented for
a developer, and the compiler lacked full code completion and code
refactoring. He jokingly compared the C-compilers to
"TurboC with a GUI". Unless 3rd party add-ins are
considered, VS Studio lacks the constellation of plug-ins that
expand Eclipse capabilities [UML modeling, for an example].
Eclipse is open and open source, while VS is not. But VS
is more polished and requires less training.</p>

<p>Siddalingaiah did consider Visual Studio Express a good value
[it's free!] for novice Windows developers, but cautioned again
about the Microsoft lock-in.</p>


<h3>Why You Should Use Eclipse RCP (in 10 minutes)</h3>

<p>This was a zippy demo that displayed Eclipse RCP's
strengths and eased concerns about the difficulties of RCP
development. Presenter Wayne Beaton started by citing the
strengths of Eclipse and the richness of the UI, which has the
plumbing provided with help services and update
capabilities. Eclipse RCP makes use of the Eclipse component
model, which adds features not in standard Java. These
components can be versioned and are dynamically loadable.
Beaton also noted that GUI- and non-GUI extension points can be
used for application integration without component
interference. Menus and views can be shared.</p>


<h3>Testing Applications Using the Eclipse Test and Performance Tools Platform (TPTP)</h3>

<p>Paul Slauenwhite described how to use the performance, JUnit,
and manual test tooling in the Eclipse Test and Performance Tools
Platform (TPTP) for testing applications. TPTP provides a
flexible and extensible framework for creating and managing
tests, deployments, datapools, execution histories, and
reports.</p>

<p>TPTP is composed of 4 basic projects:<br>

- Platform<br>
- Test<br>
- Trace and Profiling<br>
- Monitoring
</p>

<p>TPTP includes reference implementations for manual testing,
JUnit tests, URL and automated GUI testing [Recording/Playback]
of applications. See: <a href=
"http://eclipsezilla.eclipsecon.org/php/attachment.php?bugid=102">
http://eclipsezilla.eclipsecon.org/php/attachment.php?bugid=102</a></p>


<h3>What's New in UML2</h3>

<p>Kenn Hussey of IBM Rational SW explained that UML2 is an
Eclipse sub-project for an EMF implementation of the UML
metamodel. It provides an XMI schema to allow
interchange semantic models and provide test cases for validation
and implementation. Mapping the XMI schema to Java was, as he
said, 'non-trivial'.</p>

<p>Hussey explained that his project team had to weed out errors
in the spec, which will help all UML2 implementers. These
errors were reported to the UML 2.1 Revision Task Force.
UML2 now supports one namespace for all elements, using UUIDs
- Universally Unique IDs.</p>

<p>The UML sub-project team are providing better documentation,
plus a number of convenience methods. The final version of
plugin, supporting UML 2.1, was due in April, will be
included in Eclipse 3.2, and will have a
migration path for UML 2.2. See: <a href=
"http://eclipsezilla.eclipsecon.org/php/attachment.php?bugid=37">http://eclipsezilla.eclipsecon.org/php/attachment.php?bugid=37</a></p>


<h3>Eclipse User Assistance: Lessons from the trenches</h3>

<p>Lee Anne Kowalski (IBM), Maria Brownstein (Sybase) and Dave
Resch (Sybase) described lessons learned at two different
companies that build products on the Eclipse Platform,
particularly the project lifecycle for authoring and
delivering content for the help system. They include
an overview of the help features available in Eclipse: dynamic
help view, cheat sheets, Welcome experience items, tutorials,
help system (Bookshelf), and information center function.
They ended with examples of tying the help features together for
a consistent information experience by users [see:
<a href=
"http://www.eclipsecon.org/2006/Sub.do?id=305">http://www.eclipsecon.org/2006/Sub.do?id=305</a>]</p>



<h3>AJAX and Eclipse</h3>

<p>One proposal aired at EclipseCon 2006 was Rich AJAX
(Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) Platform, or RAP Project, an
open-source project that aims to enable developers to build rich,
AJAX-enabled Web applications by using the Eclipse development
model, plug-ins, and a Java-only API.</p>

<p>The German company Innoopract, which initiated the
project, offered code from its W4Toolkit to enable
Java component user interface development with a mechanism for
browser detection. A full set of APIs are due by year-end,
and a RAP 1.0 release due mid-year 2007. IBM and
other vendors have also offered AJAX-ified libraries and toolkits
for RCP, but RAP is aimed at a fuller AJAX implementation.</p>


<h3>PHP IDE</h3>

<p>Just in time for EclipseCon, the Eclipse Foundation, Zend
Technologies, and IBM announced the PHP IDE Project, an Eclipse
technology project originally proposed in October at the PHP User
Conference. The project delivers a PHP IDE framework for the
Eclipse platform, and encompass the dev components needed to
develop PHP-based Web apps. It also leverages the existing
Eclipse Web Tools Project.</p>

<p>The PHP IDE will extend the Eclipse Platform to support
development of next generation Web applications in PHP, and make
the robust Eclipse platform available to the large PHP developer
community. The project will initially be a set of Eclipse
plug-ins that add PHP capabilities to Eclipse and will provide
extension points to further extend the functionality of the
project. The project will be composed of a set of extensible
features covering the development life cycle, including
functionality that deals with developing, deploying, documenting,
and debugging PHP-based applications.</p>

<p>For more information on the PHP IDE project, please visit
<a href=
"http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/php-ide/">www.eclipse.org/proposals/php-ide/</a>.</p>


<h3>Comparing Conferences</h3>

<p>This conference has really good value if Eclipse is your
development environment. Conference prices ranged
from about $1000 to $1500 with tutorials [and, as noted above, 2
tutorials were free to conference attendees].</p>

<p>In LG #126, I compared the offerings of the Software
Development Conference [SD West] to EclipseCon, and noted some of
the perks -- sit-down lunches with Eclipse contributors and
good food, great evening receptions, and a fuller Expo
Hall. There was also a great conference bag [only
a tote at SD West], which had its own detachable PDA case.
Finally, the majority of conference presentations were on a 256
MB USB jumpdrive given to all conference attendees.
That was sweet. EclipseCon definitely provides more for the
buck.</p>

<p>The folks at Eclipse ran a very open process, with a
significant number of comments highlighted in the online summary
of the post-conference survey. It seems that most
attendees were enthusiastic and expect to return.<br>

<p>EclipseCon 2007 will be held on March 5-8, 2007 in Santa Clara,
California.</p>
