<H3>Yup, that's Mars all right...</H3>

<P>This is a small .gif of a panoramic view of the Martian surface taken by
one of the Voyager Landers.  It's been graciously provided by the nice folks
at <A HREF="http://www.nasa.gov">NASA</A> who are happily sending all kinds of multi-billion dollar pieces
of electronics into outerspace to get us these postcard images.

<P><B>Pretty cool, eh?</B>

<P>Well, thought you might like to see where all good <B>flames</B> end up...
you might as well send it to Mars.  

<P>:-)
