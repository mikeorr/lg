Hi Ramon,
</p>

<p>
I didn't get round to discuss much of what you wrote with Daniel (Main
Admin around here). He keeps himself busy with fixing multiseat
machines  which got broken by upgrades....
 
As a first decision we are going to put out an order for a large
disk-raid system (max 24TB, initially 18 for budget reasons) which
we'll run as NFS fileserver and it will have to double as
backupsystem (two independent raid controllers) backing itself up,
configs from all clients and some smaller data amounts on local disks
plus homes on the then old fileserver.
</p>

<p>
If that disk space runs full we'll have hopefully new budget and can
think about tape solutions etc. Right now raw disc space is getting
scarce. 
</p>

<p>
The number crunchers are still not quite certain --- the Multicore AMD
is still on the wishlist, but delivery seems to be postponed and
postponed again. 
</p>


<pre>
&gt; If you're willing, we could also set up a call to discuss or 
&gt; alternatively use IRC ?
&gt; There's way too many options depending on setup discussion etc.
</pre>

<p>
Yes, I certainly would like to discuss a few things to see what might
be optimal solutions. 
</p>


<pre>
&gt; We've been through 4 generations of storage architecture including 
&gt; on-line but off-site backup.
</pre>


<p>
that "off-site" part is starting to worry me a bit. We have some
off-site backup but not everything by far. Mostly homes and the most
important written stuff (Programs, papers, etc.). Original measurement
data are just to huge for that off-site backup (*non* GB ethernet
doesn't help there).
</p>

New feature: anything you post in TAG that you surround with
&#091;PRIVATE]
&#091;/PRIVATE] tags, including multi-line content, will be replaced with a
note that says "Elided content". Not that this is a private list by any
means - but that could come in handy.

Mmm remember that a Boeing 747 stacked with DVD's with content has 
extremely high bandwidth which no-one can beat yet with traditional 
ethernet cabling.
It isn't used that often because:
</p>

<p>
 * Boeings are expensive hardware
</p>

<p>
 * The latency sucks
</p>

<p>
Remembering that sometimes helps, especially since it doesn't have to be 
a boeing 747 per se, although it is one of the coolest off-site backup 
technologies in the world <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
