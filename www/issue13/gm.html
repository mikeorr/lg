		<H4>OpenGL Programming for the X Window System </H4>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		I noticed a new text on the shelf of a local book store
		(Softpro, in Englewood, Colorado) this past month - Mark J. Kilgard's
		<I>OpenGL Programming for the X Window System</I>.  This book,
		from Addison Wesley Developers Press, appears to have a very good
		coverage of how to write OpenGL applications that make use of X Windows
		API's.  I haven't read it yet (or even purchased it - yet, but I
		will) so can't say how good it is.  Mark is the author of the GLUT
		toolkit for OpenGL.  GLUT is to OpenGL what Xt or Motif is to Xlib.
		Well, sort of.

		<H4>An Important Survey</H4>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		I've been talking to a couple of publishers about doing a book aimed at 
		Linux users.  I'd like to write a User's Guide for the Gimp but the
		publisher feels a more general text on doing Web-based graphics might have
		a wider appeal (face it - the Linux audience just isn't the size of the MS
		audience - yet - but the publishers are considering both types of books).  
		I told them I'd ask my readers which type of text
		they'd like to see.  The Gimp book would include details on how to
		use each of the applications features as well as a number of tutorials for
		doing various types of effects.  The book on doing graphics for Web pages
		would include discussions on using HTML, information on tools besides the
		Gimp and a few case studies (including something on animation).  However,
		the Web book wouldn't go into as much detail for each of the tools.
		That information would be more general in nature.

		<H4>A Gimp User's Story (or "Why I Use the Gimp")</H4>
		The following piece was posted on the Gimp User's Mailing
		list by <A HREF="mailto: mike@lawlib.wm.edu"> Mike Phillips</A>.
		<P>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		At work, we have a "Library News Network", which is actually a 386 pc 
		running a TV via a video converter in a continual slideshow with 
		information about upcoming events in the law library and the law school.  
		Last year, my boss did some stuff in Freelance Graphics which, quite 
		frankly, was rather limited in effect.
		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		This year, it's my baby, and I'm making the slideshow (640x480x256 GIF 
		files, run by a simple DOS program and looped by a batch file) in the 
		GIMP.  Here are some things I've done to make the text more readable 
		and make the display reasonably eye-catching.  Nothing fancy, but 
		hopefully the tricks will give other people ideas to play with on their
		own.
		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		First, don't use a plain background.  The blend tool is very nice for 
		this, and shaded green or blue with bright text is rather nice looking.  
		Start with a color and add some noise Create a blend image of the
		same size and multiply by the image with noise.  This creates a
		<I>very</I> cool background for a slide.  Better yet, if there's an 
		appropriate photograph, use it!  (I used a gorgeous picture of Yosemite 
		Park to announce an environmental law symposium, and a decent photo of 
		the U.S. Supreme Court justices to announce our Supreme Court Preview.)
		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		On the subjects of backgrounds, since I don't remember seeing this tip, 
		here's a quickie for clouds: Make a plasma of the appropriate size, 
		grayscale it, convert it back to color, and Brightness/Contrast/Gamma it 
		into submission.  I usually knock the brightness up about 75-100, and the 
		blue up to around 5 and the green to about 2.  Instant pretty sky 
		(Obviously, skies from other planets could be done with reds and greens 
		and whatnot.)
		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		For the text, nothing beats some good fonts.  Hit a 
		<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/os2/fonts/">font archive</A>, 
		or buy 
		a $10-$15 CD filled with fonts.  Granted, I have the Caldera Network 
		Desktop, so I can use some fonts that (I think) XFree can't, thanks to 
		the font server, but it's worth a shot.  I got a CD with 1250 fonts for 
		$13.
		[Ed. Next month I'll cover how to add fonts to your system so you
		can use them with the Gimp.  mjh]
		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		Here's a variation on the 
		<A HREF="http://abattoir.cc.ndsu.nodak.edu/~nem/gimp/">rounded-text tips</A>: 
		work out your 
		text, then Duplicate it once and Offset it once (say 4x4).  Edge Detect 
		then Invert the duplicate and Gaussian Blur the offset twice.  Multiply 
		the resulting images, and use the original as a mask to composite 
		something else over the image resulting from the multiplication.  
		Very nice, edged & floating/shadowed 
		text.  Shows up great on a TV monitor.
		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		For the text, use any appropriate single color.  Bright colors and high 
		contrast work very well for what I do, although I've played with 
		textures, rippled blends, plasma clouds, and what-not.
		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		Of course, it can be spiced up with all sorts of clipart (I heartily 
		recommend 
		<A HREF="http://www.barrysclipart.com"> 
		Barry's Clipart Server (www.barrysclipart.com)</A>, 
		from which I shamelessly borrow, and voila, instant slideshow!
		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		I have left our Fall Break edition of the LNN at:
		<A HREF="http://www.lawlib.wm.edu/LNN-old/">
		http://www.lawlib.wm.edu/LNN-old/</A>.
		if you want to see some of what can be done with it.  You might be better 
		off watching the show when the graphics aren't resized to 320x240.
		Also, the latest version of these is available at

		[Ed.  Later Mike posted another message that included some
		interesting effects.  I thought it might be appropriate to include them
		with his other posting.]

		<P>
		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		Recently, while wandering through the plug-ins available, I found the 
		charcoal plug-in.  Compiled it, added it, used it.  Rather nifty, actually.
		However, it got me thinking and experimenting, and I produced two 
		potentially interesting effects:

		<P>
		(1) Pastel sketch:  Take a color (RGB) image, Edge-detect it, Invert, and
		(optionally) contrast autostretch.  On many images, this will produce a 
		nifty pastel sketch.  If the image is too high of detail, degrade the 
		color or pixelize it first, otherwise you may end up with too many 
		extraneous lines.
		<P>
		(2) Watercolor sketch: Take a color (RGB) image, make a grayscale of it.
		Edge Detect the grayscale (this will give you the sketch lines); this can
		be hard to balance the way you want, so you may want to threshold it or 
		pixelize the image first.  Then, pixelize and degrade the main image to 
		32 colors (16 or 20 works even better).  Eliminate the background you 
		don't want, Gaussian blur it a few times, and brighten it some.  
		Multiply the edging onto it.  Voila; (nearly) instant watercolor, 
		akin to the court sketches on news shows.

		am not formally trained in computer graphics

		Everything I know
		I've learned in the last year or so by reading, examining source
		code, and through the kind assistance of many members of the Net.
		So my ability to understand some of the more formal texts on
		computer graphics is limited.
		<BR>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		Given this limitation, I found I was still able to read and
		comprehend a good portion of Jim Blinn's book
		<I>Jim Blinn's Corner - A Trip Down the Graphics Pipeline</I>, which
		is a collection of articles taken from his column in the <I>IEEE Computer
		Graphics and Applications</I> journal.  This book is the first of what may
		be two books, assuming there is sufficient interest in the first book.  The
		second will cover a set of pixel arithmetic articles taken from the same
		column.
		<BR>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		In the preface Jim describes how he used a writing style that is
		"certainly lighter than a typical SIGGRAPH paper, both in depth and in
		attitude."  I can't agree more.  Computer graphics should be a fun
		subject and, despite the math, this book does provide a giggle here
		and there.
		<BR>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		Don't get me wrong, though.  There is plenty of the technical details
		on how to compute positions in 3D space, perspective shadows, and
		subpixelic particles.  Hefty stuff for the beginner.  Nearly
		incomprehensible to the person who hasn't used matrix arithmetic in the
		past 8 years.  Still, chapters like <B>The Ultimate Design Tool</B>
		(which talks about how an idea should start), and <B>Farewell to
		Fortran</B> (which talks about using various languages in computer
		graphics) provided enough non-mathematical discussions to let my brain
		recover while still keeping my interest peaked.
		<BR>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		I haven't read the book front to back yet.  I'm saving whats left
		(about half the book) for my 16 days of freedom scheduled to start later
		this month.  Its first on my reading list.  Second will be my college
		Linear Algebra text.  The first half of Jim's book reminded me about how
		much I'd forgotten in 8 years.  Like the saying goes, one must strive
		for the impossible before they know what is possible.

		the past few months, I've been 
		helping to administer an Internet-based competition for users of
		raytracing software.  This competition, the Internet Ray
		Tracing Competition or 
		<A HREF="http://www.povray.org/irtc/">IRTC</A>, 
		is open to anyone interested in creating 3D images using 
		software on any platform as long as the software falls
		within a few 
		<A HREF="http://www.povray.org/irtc/mail/rules.html">basic guidelines</A>.
		It is based on another competition started back in 1994 by Matt
		Kruse.  Matt eventually had to close down the contest due to
		the enormous amount of time it takes to run such a contest.  At the
		time, he was more or less doing all the work himself.
		<BR>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		Earlier this year Chip Richards started to organize the contest
		once again.  A group of interested individuals signed up to help 
		out.  In the end, most of us (myself included) provide only
		organizational input - ideas for rules or input on rulings regarding
		cheating (yes, there has been some of that), helping to select topics, and
		so forth.  Most of the real work has been done by Chip, Bill Marrs, 
		and Jon Peterson (although Jon has since had to move on to other
		things).
		<BR>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		The contest is made up independent rounds that last 2 months.  Each
		round has a topic which entrants must use as the basis for their
		images.  Entries are supposed to be new images, created during the
		span of the contest, however most people use bits and pieces of older
		models that they or someone else has created.  The tools allowed
		vary but raytracing tools are preferred and no post processing is 
		allowed (for example, you can't add a lens flare after the image
		has been rendered).  Anyone is allowed to vote (currently) on the
		images and winners receive small prizes like CDs and prints of their
		images.

The following links are just starting points for finding more information
about computer graphics and multimedia in general for Linux systems.  If
you have some application specific information for me, I'll add them to my
other pages or you can contact the maintainer of some other web site.  I'll
consider adding other general references here, but application or site
specific information needs to go into one of the following general 
references and not listed here.
