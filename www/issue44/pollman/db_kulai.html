<b>FILE db.kulai</b>:&nbsp; This file translates names to
ip addresses. I use ***** to seperate the file listing from the rest of
this article, so do not put them into your file.<b> Bold</b> items are
explaned below - bold is not part of a regular file.&nbsp; Here is what
mine looks like:
<p>**************************************************************
<br><tt><b>@</b>&nbsp; IN SOA <b>master.kulai.org.</b> <b>jpollman.kulai.org.</b>
(</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; 10800;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3600;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; 604800;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; 86400 );</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>IN NS</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; master.kulai.org.</tt>

<p>**************************************************************
<br><b>NOTE:</b> The biggest problem in creating these files is missing
a period where one is required. The period says: this is the end of the
name. Without the period, the domain name will be tacked on, so master.kulai.org
will become: master.kulai.org.kulai.org&nbsp; In other words, the period
is the difference between absolute and relative names.
<p><b>@&nbsp;</b> This is shorthand for the base domain name. IMPORTANT:
the @ has to be on the top line and have no spaces in front of it.
<br><b>master.kulai.org.</b>&nbsp; This is the server's name.
<br><b>jpollman.kulai.org.</b>&nbsp; This is actually an email address
with the @ replaced by a period. If there is a problem, this person will
be notified via email.
<br><b>All those numbers:</b> These are the default times. If you want
to change them, read the books - the defaults work just fine for home use.
<br><b>IN NS</b> this line tells named that master.kulai.org is the <b>n</b>ame
<b>s</b>erver.
Note, the first part of the line is blank - named will put in kulai.org,
and the name given at the end of the line must be a name from an "IN A"
line listed somewhere in this file.
<br><b>IN A</b>&nbsp; these lines tell named what the name-to-ip relationship
is. Note, I did not end the names with a period (.) so named will automatically
add kulai.org (my domain) on to the end of them. It knows to use kulai.org
because I declared that name as a zone in the /etc/named.conf: <tt>zone
"kulai.org"</tt>
<br><b>IN CNAME: </b>this was formerly used to make additional names aliases
for the same ip. It is not needed any more - in fact it is discouraged.
So, my mail, web, and news servers are all on master.kulai.org. I could
just as easily have used only the server's name, i.e. master.kulai.org
for all the services, but mail.kulai.org is how it is usually setup at
the ISPs. Also note: I used an ip address and not a name like CNAME used
to use.
<p>Note: you have to list the server and localhost as regular computers
with "IN A" lines.
