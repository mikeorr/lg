Just got a disturbing disk error.  It was on my 486 laptop, which I've
only used for reading and writing text files on the past few years because
of its limited capacity (16 MB RAM, 512 K HD).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
1) I was in vi, and it caught a SEGV.  Fortunately, it was able save its
recovery file.  I restarted vi, recovered the file, saved it, deleted the
recovery file and went on typing.  Then,

Could be memory, could be HD...

2) I got an oops.  Something about paging.  I figured, common enough oops,

Ah. This sounds like memory.

even though it's never happened on that computer, so I pulled out the power
cable for a second and rebooted.  (The battery had long ago stopped holding
any charge.)  Linux found that the HD had been mounted uncleanly (no duh)
and started fsck.   Fsck found two deleted files with zero dtime and fixed
them.  I was glad I had saved the file after recovering it since I'd
deleted the recovery file.  Then--
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
3) "Kernel panic: free list corrupted".  I rebooted.  Again the same error.
What do you run when fsck doesn't work??  Is all my data gone bye-bye?
Not that it was that much, and I was about to blast away the current
(<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>) installation anyway and practice installing Rock Linux.  (If,
of course, the disk is good enough to be reformattable.)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
4) A happy ending.  I rebooted again to make sure I had the panic
message right, and this time fsck completed and I got a login prompt.
Quickly I tarred up my data and copied it onto a floppy.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I wonder if this will make Wacky Topic of the Month.

Had that happen... oh, can't even remember now. Something crunchy
happened, and required multiple fsck's. It would get a little further
every time, and finally got it straightened out. IIRC, it took three or
four reboots to get it - and I had exactly the same "if the salt have
lost his savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned?" moment. Pretty scary
to think that "fsck" doesn't work, just at the moment when it's the
only thing that _can._ As far as I'm concerned, "fsck" should have a
default "auto-restart" mode that can be interrupted with a 'Ctrl-C';
when it stops like that, the typical user's response isn't going to be
"reboot and try again" - it's "Ohmygawd, MY MACHINE IS BROKEN!"

Doesn't fsck automatically restart sometimes?  I know I've seen it do
this, although the last time was early in the kernel 2.2 days.  Is it an
ex-feature?  Or maybe <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> did it with a 'while' loop or something.

Can't say. I've only had "fsck" run in 'repair mode' three times, all
in the dim dark past; never saw it restart. I'm pretty sure all three
were in, or before, the 2.0 days.

Of course, you can't interrupt an oops with a Ctrl-C.  When an oops
happens, the machine halts and must be reset.

Hmm. Normal disk repair (fixing up inode dtimes and such) shouldn't
produce an oops; theoretically, there is a large but fixed number of
things that can be wrong, and there is supposed to be a programmatic
response to each of them. The only reasons I could see for an oops to
occur while "fsck" is running are 1) bad memory - which is an unrelated
issue - or 2) the inode that contains "fsck" itself is damaged. Other
than those, I can't see why a loop of the sort I suggested can't be
written... really, I can't see ANY reason for "fsck" to freeze in the
first place. It just sounds like some unaccounted-for cases that come up
- and even that should be "catchable".

<p><strong><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"

Sorry, I wasn't thinking clearly.  An oops is most likely bad memory, a
bad disk or cosmic rays.  A kernel panic (in my experience) is more likely
to be a programming, configuration or environment issue.  In either case, the
machine halts and you can't recover except by resetting it.  What is
curious is, is there a certain moment during disk activity where a SEGV
or oops would leave the filesystem in a "free list corrupted" state?
Intuitively, there must be.

Mmmm... sure. I'm not a kernel expert by any means, but if the machine
crashes while the free list is being updated, that would make it
corrupt. Not that it's really a big deal, the way it would be if
individual inode pointers got fried - but it's certainly a much better
mechanism than FAT, where a couple of K worth of mis-written data can
fry your entire drive contents.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><strong><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> 
 The next question is, is it possible to
retrieve the data after such an error (short of running a sector-by-sector
analysis)?  Apparently there is, and fsck does it, although it takes a
couple runs to finish the repair.
</strong></p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Ben]
Sure; it would be a inode-by-inode analysis ("anything that's not a
superblock, and is not owned by a file, and &lt;a few other considerations
that I can't think of at the moment&gt; must be free space"), but a
corrupted free list isn't that big of a thing. It's <EM>much</EM> easier to
find out which blocks are really free, rather than trying to find which
ones aren't _and_ how they're connected to the rest of the structure.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><strong><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> 
Too bad fsck can't somehow avoid causing a kernel panic or that the kernel
can't figure out the situation enough to provide a more reassuring error
message.

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Ben]
Agreed. That kind of tools, the "fall back if all else fails" kind,
should run flawlessly.

The worst fsck case Jim Dennis ever had against required him to run
fsck 6 times, but it <EM>did</EM> eventually succeed in cleaning up the mess
he had made.  (He had told his video controller to use the address
range which the hard disk controller actually owned.  Typos can be
<EM>really</EM> bad for you at that level.)   The moral here is, if at first
fsck does not succeed, don't give up all hope.  You may prefer to
reformat afterwards anyway, but you should get a decent chance to
rescue your important data first. -- Heather
