<h1>Joey's Notes: Guide to adding a new partition or drive to an existing system</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/prestia.html">Joey Prestia</a></b></p>

<img src="../../gx/minilogos/joeys_notes.png" alt="Joey's Notes image" align="left" />

<p>
The basic steps involved in this process are:
</p>

<ol style="margin-left: 185px">
	<li>Determine what partitions need to be created and where.</li>
	<li>Create the partitions (I use fdisk here but any Linux disk 
	    partitioning tool should work)</li>
	<li>Re-read the partition table either with partprobe or by a reboot
	</li>
	<li>Make a filesystem on the partition, label it, and create the 
	    necessary mount points</li>
	<li>Add the appropriate entries to /etc/fstab so the
	    partitions are mounted upon reboot</li> 
</ol>

<h3>Scenario</h3>

<p>
Imagine that we have a server running RHEL 4 and our supervisor comes over and
wants a 10 GB partition created for the data processing department. This is
in addition to what the server currently has allocated, so we can either
create a partition out of unpartitioned space on the existing disk
(experienced Linux system administrators will leave unpartitioned disk
space for future expansion) if available, or we can add another drive. This
scenario actually happens quite frequently in the production world, so this
is a valuable skill to have even if you administer nothing more than your
home machines.
</p>

<p>
We'll assume that your supervisor has given you the latitude of deciding
which of the above options you'll use, so your first task is to check to
see if space is available on your existing media. We'll run "fdisk -l" to
see the size of the disk; the data we need is on the first line of output.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@station17 ~]# fdisk -l

Disk /dev/sda: 80.0 GB, 80000000000 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 9726 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sda1   *           1          38      305203+  83  Linux
/dev/sda2              39        7687    61440592+  83  Linux
/dev/sda3            7688        7942     2048287+  82  Linux swap
</pre>

<p>
From this we can see the size of our drive is 80.0 GB. Now, we'll use "df
-h" to calculate the size of the partitions that are on our system. We only
need to be concerned with the rows that have a device label, the others
(labeled with "none") don't concern us. The column labeled "Size" has the
numbers we'll need to add up to get a overall size.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@station17 ~]# df -h
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda2              58G  6.5G   49G  12%   /
/dev/sda1             289M   17M  258M   6%   /boot
none                 1013M     0 1013M   0%   /dev/shm

[root@station17 ~]# 
</pre>

<p>
From this, we can see that /dev/sda2 is 58G and /dev/sda1 is 289M - a total
of 58.3GB.  Now we need to add in our swap size; "cat /proc/swaps" will
tell us what size our swap partition is.
</p>

<p class="editorial">
[ If you feel like using an actual system utility for this, "swapon -s"
will do the same thing. -- Ben ]
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@station17 ~]# cat /proc/swaps 
Filename                              Type            Size    Used    Priority
/dev/sda3                             partition       2048276    0       -1
[root@station17 ~]# 
</pre>

<p>
Adding in the 2GB from this means that we have 19.7 GB to work with - well
over what we need. Now, let's move on to creating our partition: "fdisk
/dev/sda" will open our drive's partition table for modification.  Since
we're already using 3 partitions on the drive, we'll have to make our 4th
one an <em>extended</em> one - a container to house any additional
partitions, including the one we are creating now. We'll want to accept the
defaults on this extended partition, which will make the whole rest of the
drive available for our new partitions. We'll be using an ext3 filesystem,
so we also need to keep this in mind: the "mkfs" command reserves 5% of the
blocks for root. Given all that, we'll make our new partition 11.5GB to
compensate for the blocks reserved for root plus a little extra.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@station17 ~]# fdisk /dev/sda

The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 9726.
There is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024,
and could in certain setups cause problems with:
1) software that runs at boot time (e.g., old versions of LILO)
2) booting and partitioning software from other OSs
   (e.g., DOS FDISK, OS/2 FDISK)

Command (m for help): <b>n</b>
Command action
   e   extended
   p   primary partition (1-4)
<b>e</b>
Selected partition 4
First cylinder (7943-9726, default 7943): 
Using default value 7943
Last cylinder or +size or +sizeM or +sizeK (7943-9726, default 9726): 
Using default value 9726
</pre>

<p>
Here you can see where I selected "n" for a new partition and 
"e" to make a extended partition. I then accepted the defaults 
for both the starting cylinder and again for the ending cylinder.
</p>

<pre class="code">
Command (m for help): <b>n</b>
First cylinder (7943-9726, default 7943): 
Using default value 7943
Last cylinder or +size or +sizeM or +sizeK (7943-9726, default 9726):.<b>+11500M</b>
</pre>

<p>
Next, I hit "n" to create a new partition; then, when prompted to use a
starting cylinder, I hit 'enter' to accept the default.  For the ending
cylinder I entered "+11500M" to specify the size. The plus is important -
without it, you will get an error.  Its a good idea to hit "p" to at this
point to get "fdisk" to print the partition table. This will show what we
have done before saving our changes. 
</p>

<pre class="code">

</pre>

<p>
If there are any mistakes just quit "fdisk" with a "q" and no changes will be
saved. This looks right - so lets write our changes with a "w".
</p>

<pre class="code">
Command (m for help): <b>w</b>
The partition table has been altered!

Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table.

WARNING: Re-reading the partition table failed with error 16: Device or resource busy.
The kernel still uses the old table.
The new table will be used at the next reboot.

[root@station17 ~]# 
</pre>

<p>
This warning can be remedied by using the 'partprobe' command to force the 
kernel to reread the partition table. Remember - if this were a production 
machine, we wouldn't want to have to reboot it.   
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@station17 ~]# partprobe
</pre>

<p>
At this point our 11.5G partition is /dev/sda5 and raw - it has neither a
file system nor a label descriptor - so let's format it and give it a
label. Giving the partition a label can be done at the same time that the
file system is being created with the -L option, but I prefer to do it in a
separate step.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@station17 ~]# mkfs.ext3 /dev/sda5

180 days, whichever comes first.  Use tune2fs -c or -i to override.
[root@station17 ~]# 
</pre>

<p>
Now we'll give it label ("/data"):
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@station17 ~]# e2label /dev/sda5 /data
[root@station17 ~]# 
</pre>

<p>
Next, we need to create a mount point in our filesystem and make sure that
it's mounted at boot time. Let's create a directory on our system called
/data.
</p>

<p class="editorial">
[ The usual method of allocating new space is often much more complex than
that - at least in the planning stages. In fact, creating a non-standard
directory name in the root of the filesystem as suggested here is incorrect
and violates the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS). As an example of a
more typical situation, if an administrator finds that a shared machine's
drive is running out of room, he may first examine the machine to see where
the most activity/space consumption is occuring. Assuming that it's in the
space assigned to users (i.e., "/home"), he would most likely back up the
data in that subdirectory, restore it to the newly-created partition, delete
"/home", and mount the new partition as "/home". This would recover all the
space used by the original "/home" and leave it available for the rest of
the system to use - and most users would not even realize that any change
had been made. This approach doesn't require rebooting the machine either.
-- Ben ]
</p>

<p class="editorial">
[ I do understand that the partitioning is inconsistent with the FHS, but
our RedHat course materials do instruct us to create directories in / for
simplicity and ease in the aid backups. We are also led by instruction to
do things such as specialized partitioning schemes for different things
this way here at the RedHat academy. -- Joey ]
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@station17 ~]# mkdir /data
[root@station17 ~]# 
</pre>

<p>
Now we put it in the file system table, '/etc/fstab', so it gets mounted on
every boot. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@station17 ~]# vi /etc/fstab

# This file is edited by fstab-sync - see 'man fstab-sync' for details
LABEL=/                /                       ext3    defaults        1 1
LABEL=/data            /data                   ext3    defaults        1 1
LABEL=/boot            /boot                   ext3    defaults        1 2
none                   /dev/pts                devpts  gid=5,mode=620  0 0

none                   /proc                   proc    defaults        0 0
none                   /sys                    sysfs   defaults        0 0

/dev/scd0   /media/cdrecorder   auto    pamconsole,exec,noauto,managed 0 0
</pre>

<p>
I used the root partition as a guide in this sample. The label is in the
first column, the mount point is in the second, then we have the file system type
and the mount options. The last two numbers are the dump indicator and the
fsck indicator; they determine when the system gets backed up if you're using
'dump', and when the system gets checked for errors. Basically, you can
copy these numbers and options just as I have. Write your changes and exit the
editor. Then, to make sure that there were no errors, run "mount -a" to
mount all the partitions listed in /etc/fstab. Any errors would be reported
at this point.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@station17 ~]# mount -a
</pre>

<p>
Since we didn't get any errors, let's do a "df -h" and see how everything
looks.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@station17 ~]# df -h
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda2              58G  6.6G   49G  12% /
/dev/sda1             289M   17M  258M   6% /boot
none                 1013M     0 1013M   0% /dev/shm
/dev/sda5              11G   59M   10G   1% /data

[root@station17 ~]# 
</pre>

<p>
That's it - we are now ready to start using this new partition, keeping in
mind we may have to modify permissions as needed for our users and groups.
This is a very common task, one that all Linux users should become familiar
with because you will almost certainly be faced with needing more room.
This process is very similar to adding another disk - you would simply
substitute your device labels as required.

Joey was born in Phoenix and started programming at the age fourteen on
 a Timex Sinclair 1000. He was driven by hopes he might be able to do
 something with this early model computer. He soon became proficient in
 the BASIC and Assembly programming languages. Joey became a programmer
 in 1990 and added COBOL, Fortran, and Pascal to his repertoire of
 programming languages. Since then has become obsessed with just about
 every aspect of computer science. He became enlightened and discovered
 RedHat Linux in 2002 when someone gave him RedHat version six. This 
 started off a new passion centered around Linux. Currently Joey is 
 completing his degree in Linux Networking and working on campus
 for the college's RedHat Academy in Arizona. He is also on the staff of
 the Linux Gazette as the Mirror Coordinator.
