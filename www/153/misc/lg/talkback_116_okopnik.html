Hi Gang,
</p>

<p>
_*
*_Found this list thanks to the excellent article of Ben Okopnik here 
&lt;<a href="../../../116/okopnik1.html&gt;">http://linuxgazette.net/116/okopnik1.html&gt;</a> - I was trying to create a 
floppy disk to help me boot-up an old PC (PII, 256MB RAM, 2xUSB + FDD), 
by transferring the control over to the USB drive (which can't be 
booted-up directly as the PC is too old). The USB contains slimmed-down 
version of FC8 containing propriety tools and programs. I wasn't 
successful, though this is not why I am writing this email (help with 
the floppy-usb boot-up is also appreciated though that may be a subject 
to a different email as Ben's article points out that I would need 
Knoppix Linux, but I have FC8 on the USB drive). Anyway...
</p>

<p>
After unsuccessfully trying to make the boot-up floppy, allowing me to 
boot-up the USB drive I tried to make a bare-bone boot-up floppy, 
containing just stage1 &amp; stage 2 files to get me to the GRUB prompt (see 
'What happened' below) with the intention of trying my luck from there 
and this is where I encountered my problem.
</p>

<p>
_*The problem:*_ I can't boot from my HDD - when I try I see the word 
"GRUB " on the screen and then nothing (this is not the GRUB prompt - it 
is just a message on the screen saying "GRUB " and then the system halts)!
</p>

<p>
I can access all my partitions - no problem (none of them appear 
damaged, same is valid for my partition table, thank god) using 
Boot/Rescue CD, which I made following the instructions shown in section 
3.4 here &lt;<a href="http://orgs.man.ac.uk/documentation/grub/grub_3.html&gt;">http://orgs.man.ac.uk/documentation/grub/grub_3.html&gt;</a>.
</p>

<p>
_*My system:*_
</p>

<pre>
Fedora Core 8 with the latest updates, P4-M, 1GB RAM, 80GB HDD, split 
into the following partitions:
 
hda1 - primary, WinXP, NTFS
hda2 - extended
hda5 - logical, data disk, NTFS
hda6 - logical, RedHat 9, ext2
hda7 - logical, Fedora Core 8 /boot, ext2
hda8 - logical, Fedora Core 8 LVM volumes (5 of them mapped to /, /usr, 
/var, /home and /var/cache), lvm
hda9 - logical, data backups, NTFS
hda3 - primary, Service/Rescue DOS, FAT
</pre>

<p>
GRUB used to be in my MBR as through its menu I used to boot all 
partitions successfully (up until now that is). One other thing I need 
to point out - as soon as the partitions were made I have created a 
copies of the boot sectors of all my partitions, plus the main MBR 
sector using these commands:
</p>

<pre>
%dd if=/dev/hda of=hda-mbr-full bs=512 count=1 # mbr including partitions
%dd if=/dev/hda of=hda-mbr-nopart bs=446 count=1 # no partition 
information, just the MBR
%dd if=/dev/hdaX of=hdaX-bootsect bs=512 count=1 # boot record of a 
particular partition
</pre>

<p>
where 'X' is the number of the partition. The files were saved on a 
separate usb device (memory stick) for safekeeping.
</p>

<p>
I should also point out that within FC8 Linux my HDD is mapped as 
/dev/sda (not /dev/hda).
</p>

<p>
_*W**hat happened*_ - From my PC while I was running my FC8 Linux I 
tried to create a bare-bone Linux floppy, which includes nothing but 
stage1 &amp; 2 files. I thought I could do it with 'grub-install /dev/sdb' 
(sdb is how FC8 maps the floppy drive when I connect the usb floppy to 
the PC). I got an error, which said something like 'my drive is not 
listed/recognised by BIOS'. I didn't pay attention to it at the time as 
I had a plan B, i.e. to copy stage1 &amp; 2 using 'dd' as described in 
section 3.1 here &lt;<a href="http://orgs.man.ac.uk/documentation/grub/grub_3.html&gt;">http://orgs.man.ac.uk/documentation/grub/grub_3.html&gt;</a>. 
This was successful, although I could not unmount the floppy (device 
busy) and then I decided to reboot.
</p>

<p>
Here is where the nightmare began!!!
</p>

<p>
When shutting down I had a dozen error messages that my /, /usr and 
/home directories could NOT be unmounted (very strange - never had that 
before). When I rebooted the machine, expecting the GRUB menu to pop-up 
with all the usual options, but no - BANG! - the dreaded "GRUB " 
message! I was absolutely shocked!
</p>

<p>
The first thing for me to do was to check my MBR, the partition table 
and all boot sectors on all partitions as I suspected that something 
might have gone there. I booted up FC8 Live CD (from which the whole FC8 
was installed on the PC in the first place) and then took a separate 
copy of these again using the 'dd' commands as above so that I could 
compare them to the previous copies I have got on my memory stick.
</p>

<p>
Here comes the weird bit - the new and the old files were *exactly the 
same* when I compared them with 'cmp -l &lt;old_file&gt; &lt;new_file&gt;' - there 
was no difference whatsoever!
</p>

<p>
Also, when I booted up FC8 Live CD - it automatically mapped all those 
partitions and I could see nothing wrong there (I specifically looked at 
my boot partition and all the usual files were there - the 
/grub/grub.conf, the initrd and vmlinuz files were all there!!!), which, 
in my view, it narrows it down to the MBR, which, if I have taken a copy 
of it correctly, is exactly the same as my old copy!
</p>

<p>
_*It gets worse*_ - to save time typing when I made my Boot/Rescue CD I 
copied the relevant sections from menu.lst &amp; grub.conf files (see file 
contents below) from my /boot HDD partition into the /boot/grub 
directory on the Boot/Rescue CD before it was made. This, I thought 
would save me the time to type all this 'root (hd...)' and 'kernel' 
commands from the grub command-line...so I thought.
</p>

<p>
When I booted up from the newly made Boot/Rescue CD, the GRUB menu 
showed up with all the correct options (as id does when I normally boot 
from the hard disk) I selected one of the partitions to boot up to and 
pressed enter. To my surprise (yet again) I've got "Error 25 - Disk Read 
Error"!!! The contents of my grub.conf &amp; menu.lst files is shown at the 
end of this email for reference.
</p>

<p>
Now, the bizarre thing is - when I press 'c' to go to the GRUB 
command-line and enter *exactly the same* command as it appears on the 
menu option listed and then type 'boot' and press return - all is well, 
no problem!
</p>

<p>
For example: my WinXP option in the GRUB menu.lst file shows:
</p>

<pre>
rootnoverify (hd0,0)
chainloader +1
</pre>

<p>
When I select this option from GRUB menu and then press enter I get 
Error 25! When I press 'c' and type:
</p>

<pre>
rootnoverify (hd0,0)
chainloader +1
boot
</pre>

<p>
from the GRUB command-line menu - no problem. I boot into my WinXP 
partion and all is well.
</p>

<p>
So, I ran out of options and don't know what may be wrong and what I 
have done wrong. I am tempted to run 'grub-install /dev/hda' while I 
boot to my FC8 partition, but don't know if this is going to mess things 
up even more - after the day I just had i am not at all inclined to go 
that route...
</p>

<p>
Help is desperately needed!!!
</p>


<p>

</p>

<p>
This is pretty funny actually (not anything about your request, just the
synchronicity of events) - we <strong>just</strong> had someone write in with a
question about an article in issue 116 that was addressed in issue
132... and your question is about an article in issue 116, with the
follow-up that answers your present question in issue 132. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> In fact,
the two Talkbacks in 132 are right next to each other.
</p>

<p>
(I don't know that I want to dig into this any further; it would
probably turn out that these guys have the same birthday, both married a
girl named Philomena Maryann Carstairs-Smith, and both own a
Pekingese-Schnauzer-Akita puppy that was born exactly three days, two
hours, and seventeen minutes ago. The only difference will be that one
of these people is composed of anti-matter... we just won't go there,
and thus save the world from destruction.)
</p>

<p>
Anyway. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> The problem, as I mentioned in that Talkback
(<a href="../../../132/lg_talkback.html#talkback.03">http://linuxgazette.net/132/lg_talkback.html#talkback.03</a>), is that the
Linux kernel is now too big to fit on a floppy - so the approach that I
described in 116 is, sadly, dead. On the other hand, there are new and
different ways of doing the same thing; several of them are mentioned at
the link I've cited.
</p>

<p>
Good luck, let us know how it goes - and stay away from any anti-matter
twins (ant-twins?) you may happen to meet! <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

That does sound pretty bizarre. The question is, do you want to find out
what happened/why it's happening, or do you want to fix it? The former
may take unspecified amounts of time, but you'll learn a bit about how
GRUB and booting work. The latter will give you a working system. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<p>
Running it may well be the best option if you just want it fixed. I
would back up the current '/boot/grub/menu.lst', and carefully check out
the resulting one.

This is the problem with citing stuff instead of attaching it - no way
for us to know whether that text is actually wrapped (which would be an

<p>
Does this kernel actually exist? How about the device? Does the latter
exist <strong>before</strong> your auto-dev-creation daemons come on line?
</p>

<p>
In any case, try rebuilding your GRUB setup from scratch. Can't do any
harm, as long as you have backups (and maybe a bootable CD on hand.)

Hi -

Please don't drop TAG from the CC list; we all get "paid" for our time

You can have one of those if you prefer - several of us are Linux

<p>
[laugh] Frankly, so am I - "and" is the operative conjunction in my life.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt;    Here is my plan (funny enough I was about to start doing this in about 2
&gt;    hours and possibly spend the whole of tomorrow - Sunday - depending in
&gt;    what kind of a mess I may end up in):
&gt; 
&gt;    1. Backup my entire current /boot partition (it is about 52MiB).
&gt;    2. Restore a month-old backup of this /boot partition to a safe' location
&gt;    (USB drive). As this backup is old apart from the new kernel version it
&gt;    won't contain anything wrong with the partition and my first task will be
&gt;    to compare the files, which may cause my partition not to boot (menu.lst
&gt;    etc) as well as the boot sector. I would expect to see changes and will
&gt;    ignore the ones caused by the kernel updates (like new versions of the
&gt;    vmlinuz- file).
&gt;    3. If I find such changes between the 'old' backup and the new one, which
&gt;    prevent me from booting up the new partition then I will reverse them and
&gt;    see if I can boot up.
&gt;    4. If there are NO changes I could find (the least favourable option for
&gt;    me as I will enter uncharted waters here!) then I would have no option,
&gt;    but to run grub-install /dev/sda while within FC8 Live CD to restore GRUB
&gt;    in the hope of getting GRUB to load. If I could then boot normally from
&gt;    the hard disk then I would compare what has been done (both in terms of
&gt;    files and the boot sector - bot on the /boot partition as well as the
&gt;    absolute on /dev/sda) and see if I can find any differences. If not, well
&gt;    ... it will remain a great mystery what really went wrong, sadly!
</pre>

<p>
Sounds like a reasonable approach - and it shouldn't take too long,
either. The only problem may be the stuff that gets compiled (at least I
assume it does; that's the way LILO used to work, and I'm not an expert
on GRUB) into the boot sector. Part of that was stuff like partition
locations.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt;    In the worse-case scenario nothing will happen and I will be at square one
&gt;    and will restore the /boot partition backup I have made in step 1.
</pre>

<p>
In the worst-case scenario, you could always go with the "guaranteed to
work" route: back up your data - at least all the user-generated bits
- and restore it to a freshly-installed system. Rick Moen documented a 
good approach to doing that here in TAG in the recent past.

&gt; &gt;  Does this kernel actually exist? How about the device? Does the latter

&gt; 
&gt;    Don't know what you mean here, but (hd0) is my hard disk and as such
&gt;    should be visible. 
</pre>

<p>
I meant the device specified as 'root' in your GRUB stanza -
'/dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00'.
</p>


<pre>
&gt;    Anyway, when I type this (at the grub&gt; prompt) it
&gt;    works, so I presume there is nothing wrong with it. Still don't understand
&gt;    why grub is treating what I type (and which subsequently works!)
&gt;    differently compared to when I press return after the option which
&gt;    contains the same statements is selected?
</pre>

<p>
That's precisely why I asked that question. This is somewhat unlikely,
but - what would happen if that device 1) didn't normally exist and 2)
was created by GRUB loading some device-creation module/daemon? It seems
to me that you'd see exactly the kind of behavior that you're
describing.
</p>


<pre>
&gt;    P.S. I just noticed a few interesting things when looked at my boot sector
&gt;    files with a BinHex viewer (Windows) - the boot sector of the /boot
&gt;    partition is all zeroed (both in the old - working - and new/current -
&gt;    non-working versions). 
</pre>

<p>
By "boot sector", I assume you mean /boot/grub/stage1, right? That <em>is</em>
pretty odd.
</p>


<pre>
&gt;    Also, in the boot CD the file I thought I copied as
&gt;    /BOOT/GRUB/GRUB.CONF is saved as /BOOT/GRUB/GRUB.CON ('F' is missing).
</pre>

<p>
I suspect that it has to do with the DOS 8+3 file naming scheme. Yep -
we're still stuck with that, given that the whole mess with booting CDs
still has those roots... In any case, there's usually some sort of a map
file that keeps track of the actual file names.
</p>


<pre>
&gt;    Both /BOOT/GRUB/GRUB.CON and /BOOT/GRUB/MENU.LST have the same content
&gt;    (attached to this email). The only other files on that CD are
&gt;    /BOOT/GRUB/STAGE2_E and /BOOT.CAT, nothing else.
</pre>

<p>
I don't have anything like that close to hand at the moment, but that
seems right for a bootable CD. I'm sure that someone will let me know if
I'm wrong.
