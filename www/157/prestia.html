<h1>Joey's Notes: Basic Samba Configuration</h1>

<p>
Samba is a program that runs on Linux and allows seamless interaction
between the Linux and Windows operating systems. By using Samba, your users can
be using Windows and actually access their data on a Linux server.
This benefits the administrator -  in the form of ease of
administration, along with the inherent security of Linux - while 
also benefitting the user through familiarity.  This month's article covers 
basic setup of a Samba server for use as a user home directory server,
and configuration for a simple group collaboration share.  </p>

<p>
"Microsoft's file access protocol [is] called the Common Internet File
System (CIFS). CIFS is an interoperable mechanism for a client system to
request file access from a server system in a network regardless of the
underlying operating system platforms of the respective systems." <a
id="prestia.html_1_back"></a><a href="#prestia.html_1">[1]</a> Samba has
been adapted to use CIFS, which is actually an update to Server
Message Block (SMB) protocol - which is what lies at the heart of SaMBa.
It can even serve as a Primary Domain Controller (PDC). Some
advantages are:    
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Your users will never know that they are using a Linux server, so
	they won't have to learn a new operating system.</li>
	<li>You'll be able to centralize backups and administer a more secure 
	environment.
	<li>You'll be able to allow your users to use their Windows 
	credentials to login and access their Linux home directories.</li>
	<li>You can share your Linux printers with your Windows clients.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The list goes on and on. More details can be found at <a
href="http://us1.samba.org/samba/">http://us1.samba.org/samba/</a>. Please
keep in mind that Samba is a very rich, complex environment, and that what I
am showing here just demonstrates its most basic operation.   
</p>

<p>
I'll be using Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2 in this tutorial, with the
firewall disabled and SELinux set to "enforcing". Samba isn't installed by
default in RHEL 5, so, if you didn't select Windows File
Server packages at install time, you can install it by doing <code>yum</code>
(i.e., <code># yum install -y samba</code>), or by using your distribution's 
package manager.  Ideally, having access to a Windows computer 
located on the same network will allow you to see firsthand how Samba
works. (Note: If you want to allow Samba through your firewall, you 
must allow access to ports 137-139.)
</p>

<p>
There are two daemons associated with Samba's basic operation: The
first is smbd, which handles the Server Message Block protocol.
The second daemon, nmbd, publishes WINS name service.  WINS implements
the NETBIOS nameserver protocol used by Windows systems.  (This can be
thought of as being a Windows-only version of DNS name mapping; somewhat
confusingly, modern Windows systems support both WINS and DNS.) When
connecting a Windows OS to a share, the syntax is
<tt>\\NETBIOSname\sharename</tt>; this format is dubbed "Universal
Naming Convention" (UNC). Samba's NMB daemon converts references to a
machine's DNS hostname to its NETBIOS name if necessary; therefore,
<tt>\\ipaddress\sharename</tt> will also work. There is a third daemon -
Winbind,  but it is for more-advanced configurations than I will be
covering in this basic article.  </p>

<p>
First, assuming you have Samba and all its dependencies installed, we'll
look at Samba's configuration file - <tt>/etc/samba/smb.conf</tt>.  
smb.conf has comments (indicated by #) and potential options
(shown by semicolons). Both get ignored by Samba, and are present for
readability purposes only.
</p>

<h3>
Configuration of /etc/samba/smb.conf
</h3>

<p>

Before we do anything else, let's back up this file (i.e., <tt>cp
/etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.orig</tt>), for safety. smb.conf
is divided in two main sections, indicated by a line of equals signs '='
and either "Global Settings" or "Share Definitions" in the middle of them.
Subsections are indicated by minus signs '-' with the name of the
subsection in the middle of the line. Now, configuring 
/etc/samba/smb.conf for basic operation as a user's home directory server
and a group collaborative share is really simple; in fact, it's almost
ready out of the box. The first thing we will be concerned with is the
Network Related Options subsection, under the Global Settings section. Look
for the directive workgroup, and set this according to your needs. In this
case, I will just set it to SAMBAGROUP. Later, I will have my Windows
computer join the SAMBAGROUP workgroup. You can also change the server
string; this may be especially desirable in a production environment,
although I didn't do it for this tutorial. (By the way, it's always a
really good idea when editing big configuration files like this to make a
note, wherever you make a change. Additionally, leave the changed option's
original value commented out rather than deleting it. This way, anyone
working with the file later can see what was changed, who changed it, and
why. You yourself at a later date may need this information when you need
to troubleshoot or modify something.) 
</p>

</table>

<p>
Let's start with the Global Settings section, in the Network Related Options subsection.
Again, both the pound (or hash) sign (#) and semi-colon (;) are
acceptable comment markers.  </p>

<pre class="code">
#  Edited on 7-2-08 by Joey changed workgroup and set NetBIOS name to server1 see below.
#        workgroup = MYGROUP
          workgroup = SAMBAGROUP
          server string = Samba Server Version %v

;         netbios name = MYSERVER
          netbios name = SERVER1          
</pre>

<p>
Next, we'll set up a group collaboration share for our users, so let's go
down to the "Share Definitions" heading.  When scrolling through this file,
notice that "homes" (users' home directories) are already enabled as shares,
by default. Be careful; even though these directives look simple, always
refer to the manpages for smb.conf(5) for explanation of anything you may
be uncertain of. 
</p>

<h3>Shares</h3>

<p>

I created my share at the end of the file, under Share Definitions.  Once
again, leave yourself a note for future reference. There's nothing worse
than playing detective through a configuration file months and months
later, trying to find out what was changed and why. Shares can consist of
lots of options, but we will just stick to the basics here. I will give a
brief explanation of the ones I use in this example.  The first thing
we see enclosed in brackets is the "sharename". This has no bearing on
the Linux path. The Linux path can be anything appropriate; I would use a
descriptive term and use the same term for the Linux path, so when you have
several of them they are easy to keep straight. When setting up shares, you
needs to keep in mind that a Linux path is not going to be the same as a
Windows path. In Linux a share named [Winshare] with a path of <tt>path =
/srv/samba/winshare</tt> would be referenced  <tt>\\NETBIOSname\sharename</tt> in
Windows, so, if our Linux machine were assigned a NETBIOS name of SERVER1 and
the share were called <tt>winshare</tt> one way to connect to it from Windows would
be to place \\SERVER1\winshare in the address bar and hit &lt;ENTER&gt;.  At this
point, you would get prompted for your credentials. 

</p>

<pre class="code">

#============================ Share Definitions ==============================

[homes]
        comment = Home Directories
        browseable = no
        writable = yes


[printers]
        comment = All Printer
        path = /var/spool/samba
        browseable = no
        guest ok = no
        writable = no
        printable = yes


# A publicly accessible directory, but read-only, except for people in
# the "staff" group
;       [public]
;       comment = Public Stuff
;       path = /home/samba
;       public = yes
;       writable = yes
;       printable = no
;       write list = +staff

# Edited on 7-2-08 by Joey added winshare for test project group 'smbuser'
# don't forget about SELinux and permissions for this to work! 
[Winshare] 
	comment = Samba test share
	path = /srv/samba/winshare
	hosts allow = 10.0.2. 
	browseable = yes
	write list = +smbuser

</pre>

<p>
Now notice  how the IP address is set up on the "hosts allow" line:  10.0.2. 
allows access to all hosts on the 10.0.2. subnet.  Below the "hosts allow"
line is "browseable = yes"; this will allow users on the network to browse 
the network and see the share.  Also note the "write list" - I gave
group-wide write access to the smbuser group. 
</p>


<h3>Testparm</h3>

<p>
The "testparm" command entered on the Linux command line parses the
/etc/samba/smb.conf file, and checks it for syntax errors. When you have
finished editing this file, run <tt>testparm</tt> and see if anything pops
up. It will also output your configuration, so you can see the shares you
have set up and whether things are set up correctly. You do not need
SMB running to test the configuration.  </p>

<pre class="code">

[root@rhce-prep ~]# vi /etc/samba/smb.conf 
[root@rhce-prep ~]# testparm

[global]
        workgroup = SAMBAGROUP
        server string = Samba Server Version %v
        passdb backend = tdbsam
        cups options = raw

[homes]
        comment = Home Directories
        read only = No
        browseable = No

[printers]
        comment = All Printers
        path = /var/spool/samba
        printable = Yes
        browseable = No

[Winshare]
        comment = Samba test share
        path = /srv/samba/winshare
        write list = +smbuser
        hosts allow = 10.0.2.
[root@rhce-prep ~]# 

</pre>

<p>
Check that everything looks correct:
</p>

<pre class="code">

[root@rhce-prep ~]# mkdir -p /srv/samba/winshare
[root@rhce-prep ~]# groupadd smbuser
[root@rhce-prep ~]# useradd john -G smbuser
[root@rhce-prep ~]# passwd john

passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
[root@rhce-prep ~]# chown .smbuser /srv/samba/winshare/
[root@rhce-prep ~]# chmod 2775 /srv/samba/winshare/

</pre>

<h3>Allow for SELinux</h3>

<p>
As things stand, when SELinux is in enforcing mode, Samba just won't work
with newly created directories; they don't have the correct SELinux context
applied to them. To allow access and have SELinux still enforcing, we need
to look to the comments in smb.conf. Under the SELINUX NOTES section
(toward the top of the file), note that it tells you what most people miss:
the SELinux boolean "samba_enable_home_dirs" must be set to <tt>on</tt>.
The command is right there, in the comments. In addition to the home
directories, we created a new directory that needs the SELinux context
"samba_share_t" assigned to it.  Again, smb.conf gives us the command we
need to set the context for SELinux protection.  
</p>

<pre class="code">
# If you want to share home directories via Samba, please run:
# <b>setsebool -P samba_enable_home_dirs on</b>
#
# If you create a new directory you want to share, you should mark it as
# "samba-share_t", so that SELinux will let you write into it.
# Make sure not to do that on system directories, as they may already have
# been marked with the SELinux labels.
#
# Use ls -ldZ /path, to see which context a directory has.
#
# Set labels only on directories you created!
# To set a label, use the following: <b>chcon -t samba_share_t /path</b>
</pre>

<pre class="code">

[root@rhce-prep ~]# setsebool -P samba_enable_home_dirs on
[root@rhce-prep ~]# chcon -t samba_share_t /srv/samba/winshare/
[root@rhce-prep ~]# chkconfig smb on 
[root@rhce-prep ~]# service smb start
Starting SMB services:                                     [  OK  ]
Starting NMB services:                                     [  OK  ]
[root@rhce-prep ~]# 

</pre>

<h3>Smbpasswd</h3> 

<p>
In addition to configuring standard group access and permissions, Samba
requires a different password-encoding algorithm, so we need to create
Samba passwords for our users. For domain controller configurations, there
are other advanced options for adding groups and users - but, for now, we
will just stick with the basics. In addition, the user must exist on the
system; you can't just create samba-only users. (Note that I created a
regular user called "john", earlier.) 
</p>

<pre class="code">

[root@rhce-prep ~]# smbpasswd -a john
New SMB password:
Retype new SMB password:
[root@rhce-prep ~]# 

</pre>


<h3>Testing the setup with smbclient</h3>

<p>
The "smbclient" command allows connections to Samba server shares from
the Linux command line. It will accept a username and password, as well
as the location and name of the share to which you want to connect. The
basic format of the command is shown below. You can use it in a variety
of ways; I have included the one that I find easiest.  Use -U to specify
the username, which is immediately followed by the % separator and
the password.  Following that, on the same line, I have the Linux
equivalent of a Samba location -  double forward slashes, 'localhost',
and a forward-slash separator, followed by the name of the share we are
connecting to; the result of all this should be an smb:\&gt; prompt.
</p>

<pre>
smbclient -U user%password //localhost/share
</pre>

<pre class="code">

[root@rhce-prep ~]# smbclient -U john%redhat //localhost/winshare
Domain=[RHCE-PREP] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 3.0.28-0.el5.8]
smb: \&gt; ls
  .                                   D        0  Sun Aug  3 15:34:49 2008
  ..                                  D        0  Sun Aug  3 15:34:49 2008

                63700 blocks of size 16384. 44363 blocks available
 smb: \&gt;

</pre>

<h3>Testing it out on the Windows side</h3>

<p>
The true test is to get on a Windows box and see how all this looks 
from there. Test it out: Can you join the workgroup? Can you access 
your home directory? What about the share? The first thing I did 
was join my Windows computer to workgroup SAMBAGROUP, 
which of course required a reboot. I did this by going into Control 
Panel, System, and clicking on the "Computer Name" tab, then 
clicking on "Change" to rename the computer or join a 
domain, and selecting the Workgroup option to make this computer a member 
of the SAMBAGROUP workgroup. After rebooting, I opened My Computer and browsed 
to My Network Places, then to View Workgroup Computers.
</p>

<img src="misc/prestia/smbgroup.png" alt="SambaGroup">

<p>  
At this point, you can clearly see the words "Samba Server Version
3.0.28-0.el5.8" (the Samba server string).  Depending on where you deploy
your Samba server, you may not want to give anyone a starting point for
hacking your setup; it only takes a second to hide the fact that you're
running a Samba server from others that may have access to machines on your
network. It is also important to consider whether you should make the
shares visible on the network or not. I believe it's best to leave things
on a need-to-know basis to prevent unnecessary problems.  But, again, on
things like this your company's policy should always be your guide.  You
should be aware that permissions - both in the smb.conf and on directories
- are <em>stacked</em>; i.e., the most restrictive ones control what
happens - so it is important to pay close attention to both. 
</p>

<p>
In this next image you can see where I clicked on Server1 and was presented 
with a login screen. If you're following along, you will have to present 
credentials at this point. We've also set up Samba for a group collaboration 
share and home directory server, and the options we selected in our 
share definitions dictate what will occur at this point.
</p>

<img src="misc/prestia/login.png" alt="Login to Share">

<p>
In the following image, we are able to view available 
printers that are available by default. We can also see user john's
home directory, along with our newly created Windows share 'Winshare'.   
</p>

<img src="misc/prestia/shares.png" alt="Shares">

<p>
Briefly, this is basic configuration of a Samba server for use as a
Windows home directory server and simple group collaboration share server.
Samba works out of the box with little or no configuration for a lot of
purposes, and can be configured to act as a Primary Domain Controller for a
network. This is a significantly more complex task, and requires a great
deal of time spent learning the various options and security measures and
implementing them correctly.  It is easy to assume, because something can be
so easy to set up, that it is overly simplistic and therefore implement
it in a haphazard way.  </p>

<p>
In this last figure, we will access user &quot;john's&quot; home
directory. As you can see, he can work from Windows without problems, not
even realizing he was in reality working on a Linux server.
</p>

<h3>Samba Web Administration Tool</h3>

<p>
The Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) tool allows an administrator to
configure Samba via Web interface. It is an excellent way for new Samba
administrators to get additional information on options available
when setting up Samba. It is also commonly used by seasoned Samba
administrators, because of its ease of use and advanced displays. It
allows the administrator to start and stop daemons, see advanced
possible configurable options, look up definitions for those options,
and get help.  It comes with some downsides: it is insecure and
therefore not a good idea to use remotely. Additionally, using it
overwrites smb.conf, which contains valuable comments.    </p>

This month\'s article covers  basic setup of a Samba server for use as a user home directory server, and configuration for a simple group collaboration share.  </p> ';

Joey was born in Phoenix and started programming at the age fourteen on
 a Timex Sinclair 1000. He was driven by hopes he might be able to do
 something with this early model computer. He soon became proficient in
 the BASIC and Assembly programming languages. Joey became a programmer
 in 1990 and added COBOL, Fortran, and Pascal to his repertoire of
 programming languages. Since then has become obsessed with just about
 every aspect of computer science. He became enlightened and discovered
 RedHat Linux in 2002 when someone gave him RedHat version six. This 
 started off a new passion centered around Linux. Currently Joey is 
 completing his degree in Linux Networking and working on campus
 for the college's RedHat Academy in Arizona. He is also on the staff of
 the Linux Gazette as the Mirror Coordinator.
