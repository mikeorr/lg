Folks,
</p>

<p>
Here is my scenario,
</p>

<p>
 We  have a version control repository running on my end and we have the branch offices too.Now people are checking in and out tunneling through firewall to the version control server in my end.
</p>

<p>
Now my problem is remote users are experiencing slow process when they are doing version control transactions.
</p>

<p>
We thought of rsyncing  the repo to the remote machine.and the users can do the version control operations locally but how do we maintain the consistency of files in all offices ?
</p>

<p>
Thanks &amp; regards,
Britto
</p>

<p>

Not that this has much to do with Linux, but I'll take a crack at it
anyway.

It seems to me that rsyncing the repository to remote hosts would
reinstate the same problem that CVS had solved. Wouldn't it be easier to
just uninstall CVS and be done with it? <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

The problem to solve, from what I see above, is the one that's causing
the slowdown. You seem to be assuming that it's in the versioning
software (it may well be, but you haven't told us anything that
indicates that); I would usually suspect the network, and perhaps the
firewall. Find out where the latency is occurring, and solve <em>that</em> -
then see if there's still a problem.

Depending on your development model this may even be an option. Linus
Torvalds gave a talk about git and his approach to source control
management:

<p>
Apart from that you might consider distributed filesystems. However this
doesn't save you from the problem of inconsistencie arising from
Internet connections and other sources.
