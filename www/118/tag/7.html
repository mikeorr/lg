A few of the writer's points make sense, or at least point in a
reasonable direction - but what I find annoying... no, scratch that.
What I find <em>offensive</em> about Mr. Dotzler's article are his repeated
"Linux must do XYZ" statements, which shows an astounding absence of
cluons for someone who is supposed to be a member of the Mozilla team.
Contrast, for example, <a href="../../117/raby.html">this month's article in LG by Dale Raby</a>; despite
being fairly new to Linux - or so I have gathered from correspondence
with him - nowhere does he say "Linux must" anything. That phrasing says
two things:
</blockQuote>

<blockQuote><ol>
<LI>That Linux is some monolithic thing - perhaps a company, or perhaps a
ruling Cabal underneath all that Potemkin-village "Open Source" nonsense
(come on, do you REALLY believe that people would just work for no money
like that? What are you, some kind of Comm-o-nist or sump'n?), and

<LI>That the writer knows better than the thousands of people who <EM>have</EM>
put in their effort, time, and ability into making Linux what it is.
This implication often also carries a stink of "they owe it to me",
although nowhere is it actually explained why the person making this
statement deserves his assumed entitled status.

</ol></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Dale Raby's article says, "if some group or company decided to do this,
they'd reap serious benefits." Asa Dotzler's article says "Linux must
fix this to be worth not turning up my nose at it." Nowhere does it say
why the Linux community should not turn up its nose at Asa Dotzler's
views on Linux instead... but I suppose that a thing accomplished speaks
for itself. Meanwhile, we'll all go on using thousands of dollars worth
of excellent software and being grateful to those who have provided it
for us without charge or requiring us to agree to freedom-abridging
licenses - including Mr. Dotzler when he's doing his part at Mozilla
(just as we can enjoy the performance skills of a sports figure while
deciding that his political statements are based on nothing short of
appalling ignorance.)

<blockQuote>
As for me, I suppose I'll <EM>never</EM> figure out why so many people are so
deathly allergic to freedom.

[laugh] You rock, Jason. "Computers are <EM>not</EM> easy to use" - that's a
simple fact of life. The problem is that there seems to be a certain
type of people - well represented by Mr. Dotzler - who expect Linux to
solve <EM>all</EM> their problems, including the absence of Tim-Tams at their
local supermarkets. What in the <EM>hell</EM> is <EM>that</EM> all about? Is it
because of Linux advocacy, because they feel that once somebody says
"here, have a great OS", they're somehow suddenly owed instant and total
magic resolution of their woes? It sounds insane when stated this
baldly, but... how many times have we all seen it?

<EM>nods</EM> I hadn't thought about how Linux advocacy probably has a part in
it, but it makes sense. I mean, here's people using an OS that they
claim is good! Sure, Microsoft says Windows is good, but nobody really
believes them.[1]
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
So then the shock of trying to install this things, that, it turns out,
is probably at least at complex at what the user is used to, and on top
of that, it's <EM>different</EM> complexity.

Perhaps it's simply that Linux - offered, as it often is, by a person
instead of a giant corporation - has a face. There's a person at whom
they can aim their computer-related frustrations - and they do. That
doesn't excuse the behavior, or perhaps even show anything other than
a bare glimmer of the real reasons behind it... but it makes <em> some </em>
sense in a highly bewildering situation where nothing else does.

I think you're right - if people separate the process into 1) getting
the software and 2) using it, then there's going to be a sense of "well,
however I got it - store-bought, shareware, stolen, or some weird 'free'
thing - now somebody OWES me because I went to the trouble of getting
it!" The thing is that I've <em>  seen  </em> this kind of thing in the world of
commercial software, ridiculous as it was: when I was working in tech
support, many years ago, we'd have people call us up (you could almost
always recognize them by their aggressive-as-hell approach) and tell us
how they wanted their DAMNED program fixed RIGHT NOW! That one didn't
take long to solve, though.

<blockQuote>
The problem with handling this, from the Open Source perspective, is
that there isn't the obvious implicit knowledge on the user's part of
having stolen the software - because they haven't (and no, I'm not
saying it would be better if they had - it's just that the attempted
theft of effort is glaringly obvious in the commercial case, but is
hidden by the free nature of the software in the non-commercial one.)
However, what they're <EM>trying</EM> to steal - via the same brazen attitude
(which comes from the same source and exists for the same reason) -
hasn't changed: it's other people's effort to which they don't have any
right.

We're so used to going to a store, buying something, and then expecting
to have somebody to yell at when something goes wrong. Then free
software comes along, and people unconsciously treat as just another
product.

&lt;shrug&gt; I don't know. I know that when something crashes, or doesn't
work the way you want, it's awfully hard to think "You know, on the
whole, I've saved a lot of time using this software, and I didn't pay a
cent for it. Maybe I should drop the author a thank you note. Or better
yet, money. Or maybe a gift certificate to some franchised pizza place."

I used to volunteer at the Student's Union when I was in college. At
the start of every year we made 'Fresher's Packs', packed with
whatever free goodies we could get. We tried to put the same things
into every pack, but some things ran out, sometimes people
accidentally more or less than others (and sometimes 'we' filled bags
with condoms to hand out to the cute girls. <EM>Ahem</EM>).

Guess what? We got nothing but complaints for the rest of the week
about the contents of those packs. (The best solution I used was to
add up the value of the average pack, and offer to refund the value of
the missing part(s), <EM>once the rest was paid for</EM>. That didn't shut
them up, but at least they took their grumbling elsewhere).

I kind of understand what the zdnet guy is talking about, but not where
he's coming from.  My first year using linux in 1996 was spent without
a GUI because I wanted to learn the command line and also, I had no
idea how to configure my machine for X.  From what I learned, I was
able to get a job with a VAR who put me through six months training to
become a "Sun Certified" sysadmin.  From Networking, I went on to my
present studies of Shell scripting, sed, awk,perl etc.  I wasn't a very
good sysadmin, but it's amazing  to me that a "non-geek" like myself
was able to get that far, just as it was amazing for me, after years of
fvwm2 and WindowMaker, to see <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> for the first time, which for me, has
so many more options than either the mac  or Windows desktops.  I've
turned at least a half dozen people onto Linux where they can easily
learn to navigate KDE or <A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</A>, download OpenOffice and Firefox, and
use The Gimp and Ghost View for graphics and pdf files without having
to upgrade Photoshop or Adobe's Acrobat for several hundred a year.
I'll never be a "professional" programmer, or even a good one, but I
have fun for a few hours a night on my Linux box and do all my
professional work in OpenOffice/Thunderbird/Firefox,whereas previously
I had to buy ( or "borrow") at last MS WORD if not MS OFFICE"S whols
400 dollar package.   I never would have learned the stuff I've learned
and am still learning and have so much more to learn if I'd just used
Windows or Mac to do the typical word=processing/emailing/web-surfing.
I also have a Mac running Jaguar.  Since I only use the "unix"
utilities -- and XDarwin-- I don't have to worry about coming up with
$130 to "upgrade" to Tiger and then to Wildcat or Griffin or whatever
they'll "offer" next.

There is perhaps a good reason why you are <EM>not</EM> a "professional".
Read Paul Graham's article on "What business can learn from Open

The
<a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=3D11134">article</a>
that <EM>this</EM> (ZdNet) article claims to rebut says that one of the things
that needs to be done is to have some company come out with good
pre-installed systems (with some CD's containing additional software
and a support infrastructure thrown in). The OSNews article also says
that this is targetted at users who would be willing to learn the new
interface if it was "cool enough" and goes on to claim that the current
desktop interface is. The target users are also those who are attracted
to the MacMini but find it too expensive and/or limited in terms of
available software.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The ZDNet article nowhere refers to these points---instead the author
talks mainly about how Windows users will find it difficult to migrate
to a typical GNU/Linux system. The author then concludes that the way
to simplify this is to make a Desktop that looks like Windows but is
GNU/Linux inside.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
This is a very old flaw---like the British Labour Party turning into
a clone of Ma Thatcher in order to come to power. Or the communists
turning on its head the philosophy of the withering away of the state.
The problem with "World Domination" is that you feel the need to go down
such a path---becoming like the rival or perhaps even worse.

To draw a parallel that has come up here quite often, it is also the
problem with the political process here in the US: no matter how good
and decent a man is when he starts out to climb the political ladder,
making it to the top will almost inevitably - at least in every case
I've seen - make him into a near-copy of the slugs that he's trying to
replace. What is bitterly ironic about the whole cycle is that good men
choose to climb that ladder <EM>because</EM> the slugs at the top are so
repulsive and need to be replaced.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The salient thing about Open Source, to me, is that the process of
reaching the top - however loosely that may be defined - is <EM>not</EM>
destructive in that manner. Trying to adapt it to this other philosophy
would make it so, in my opinion - and make it ultimately unethical (no
ethics can be called coherent or rational if it requires behavior that
is ultimately self-destructive.)

I think the OSNews article makes a very valid point that some company
needs to realise that there is a 5% and very visible market share to
be captured by having pre-installs of something like Ubuntu/Mandriva
or whatever. The folks at Apple and Sun (note the Java Desktop OS) have
realised this but have not been able to keep the costs low---perhaps
because they are older corporations with hidden costs. So <EM>someone</EM> can
capture this segment first---world domination can wait.

Not this old polemic <em>  again ?</em>   How many times is it that this one is
put through the mill grind?  The result is always the same -- there
never can be one.  And indeed, the article above doesn't mention
anything that hasn't already been discussed.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
One thing that the author of the article does depict rather clearly is
that he's more naive about operating systems than I initially gave him
credit for.  His argument is that technology is supposed to be the cure
to all of the problems computers suffer from.  Hmm, but that's user
error in my opinion.  And that I don't like.  If you suddenly approach
it from the fault of the computer's inability to do something, you
won't get anywhere.

That's another aspect of the "both sides are right" problem.  We've all
seen the "if computers were cars" jokes.  My dad used to say in the 80s,
"I can get into any car and the steering wheel is in the same place and
does the same thing, and so is the brake.  Why aren't computers like
that?"  It still apples today.  On the other hand, "If people treated
their cars like they do their computers, they would never change the
oil, <EM>ever</EM>, and when the engine falls apart they'd scream at the
manufacturer."   (I think I heard this one from Ben Okopnik.)

As to why this difference in perception exists, I don't know.  Maybe
it's because manufacturers overpromised on the wonders of computers in
the 90s (and 80s) to get more boxes off the sales floor and into
homes.   But I'm not sure if that's the whole story.  If it were, it
would be the marketing success of the century.  But I think there must
be other factors too, although I'm not sure what they are.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
And now, curiously, a significant number of people are cancelling their
broadband and going back to dialup, or putting their computer in the
closet, coz it wasn't the panacea they thought it was.  Were they duped
by the marketers?  Or did they not think clearly enough before they
bought?
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
But Thomas Friedman argues (in <EM>The World is Flat</EM>) that globalization
and computerization are actually much further along now than they were
in the "heyday" of the 1990s, even though thousands of .com domains have
been abandoned.  So that's even more curious, that some people are using
computers less yet the overall computerization is higher.

My answer to my dad was always,
"Computers are expected to be more versatile than any other appliance.
A car just runs one program that was
installed at the factory.  But people expect computers to run any old
program they got from who knows where, and they expect it to work with
any of the thousands of peripherals they might attach to it."  How much
do people attach peripherals to cars?   Maybe a stereo.  That's one
electric wire, big compatibility deal.  Maybe a speaker wire and
antenna, but those are already universal.

</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
But, of course, that's not quite right, either:  The problem's already
solved in any number of such appliances, starting with TiVos and
PalmPilots -- which, of course in many cases run Linux.  So, the
ultimate answer will be that such things will not be <EM>perceived</EM> as the
solution because they'll not be <EM>called</EM> computers, but nonetheless
that's what they'll be.

Pardon my hubris, but I think I had some of the best lines, including

any given time."

Given that a pundit can choose how to define "desktop" before he starts
to rant (equally for or against whether $foo is Ready For The Desktop),
many seem to be choosing to define "desktop" as whatever Redmond has a
lock on these days, "workstation" as anything that's escaped into UNIX'
graces but has a GUI (whether Linux or Sun or others, on the premise
that Those Engineers Don't Really Use Desktops), and "server" as those
scary things with no GUI.  If it has no keyboard they summarily declare
it not a computer and ignore it.  So serial console jugglers and uplink
managers with Linux or some BSDish OS inside are "not computers" the same
way your microwave or phone is "not a computer" whether a sysadmin could
login to them or not.  They're "internet appliances" and treated like
smart toasters.  Pulling out of the almost offtopic dive, appliances are
expected to not have or need documentation - their actual manual is more
than half filled with legal warnings like "caution: hot" and techie minutiae
like what kind of wall power it uses, even though the plug only goes into
one country's sort of wall socket.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
It leads to a good question about where the <A HREF="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</A> toaster I saw in the
.ORG Pavilion falls.  You can login to it as a UNIX shell, they gave it a
keyboard and a multi line LCD screen, and it can eject the toast early
from the commandline.  I asked if it can detect whether it was given toast
or bagels.  Yes, I took pictures.

I once complained to Ben about the high cost and lack of choice in

mean they always will be.  Perhaps computer usability is the same way,

And this is one thing that annoys me.  Of all
the articles I have read about whether Linux is ready for the desktop
or not, my answer to them has always been the same:  "Yes".  Linux has
<em> always  </em> been ready for the desktop, even way back when RedHat were
new.  The reason why Linux tends to "fail" in some people's eyes is
that they make <EM>such</EM> a tight and stringent comparison to Windows, that
a lot of people <EM>expect</EM> Linux to act like windows;  somewhat contrary
to the quote, above.  In so doing, what the evaluator doesn't therefore
do, is appreciate the differences Linux hails over Windows -- even in
the GUI world, which is <em>  still  </em> where the comparisons about whether
Linux is ready for the desktop take place.  It annoys me.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Yes, of course people are going to want to use GUIs, but they're so
determined to make sure it looks and acts like Windows, that they can't
see the differences it gives them, either.  KDE and GNOME have gone to
great pains to make their desktop environment as windowsey as possible.
Where's the gain, in doing so, when the comparisons people will
draw will be like from like, when comparing it to Windows?  It
belittles the comparison.

Nobody says
"<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A> isn't ready for the desktop!" or "If FreeBSD wants Soccer Mom
to use it, it'd better do this, this, and this, and quickly."  Why?
Because FreeBSD presents itself as a pure geek distribution.   BSD
developers/users are rarely interested in converting Windows users;
they're more like "If you want it, it's here."  But Linux lives in this
weird hybrid world that's part geek and part messianic.  There are a lot
of factors for this.  Maybe Linus's "World Domination" joke got out of
hand.  Maybe some companies like <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> and Lindows overpromised.

At the same time, you're not getting at each other's core values, you're
talking past them to some other faction.  Most of The Answer Gang falls
into the "geek" category who use Linux because it suits them, not
because they're on a jihad against Windows.  We'd <EM>like</EM> to see vendor
lock-in eliminated and Linux adopted by the masses, but it's not our #1
priority.  Because of this, we get angry when people appear to be
putting demands on our donated time.  But is that what this author is
doing?  No, he's merely stating that if Linux thinks it can replace
Windows it'd better be more friendly to Windows users.  Why is he saying
that?  After all, he's not saying it about FreeBSD.  He's knocking on
Linux's door and dissing it because Linux went to him <EM>first</EM> and told
him, "Thou shalt not use Windows, it is an abomination.  Thou shalt run
Linux, for that is pleasing to God."

I hear what you're saying - but again, I have to disagree. The adoption
of Linux is proceeding on a large scale, all over the world; no one has
held a gun to that author's head (I may be wrong, but it seems to me
that there would be a lot of repeated letters due to his teeth
chattering if that was the case) and said "ADDRESS THE TOPIC OF LINUX ON
THE DESKTOP OR <EM>DIE</EM>, SCUM!" If he said "if people want Linux to advance
in X direction, here are some ideas", I'd see that as valid input.
"Linux <EM>must</EM>" is an imperative, an arrogation of position that the
writer has not earned in any manner - and even though a stopped clock

Guess what?  People get used to unfamiliar software all the time.  In
the most-common form, it's called "The boss issued me this computer, and
I'm expected to use its software to carry out my job, or get fired and
take up some other profession elsewhere."  A less-common but still
popular form is "I wanted application $FOO that I'm used to, but it's no
longer available so I learned application $BAR instead."

People whine (e.g., "I demand an easy migration path!") when they
imagine that whining's going to get them something -- and few use
software they specifically want in the first place:  Most just end up
using something as the path of least resistance.  This has obvious
implications, including the people who say "Linux must do $FOO to become
popular with J. Random User" suffering from recto-cranial inversion for
lack of acknowledgement of that fundamental truth.

It's a fair point, and from what I remember of the article you wrote,
that more or less sums it up.  But one thing I am surprised you did not
mention (as it was something that was drummed into my head, when I was
studing "User Interface Design" -- "UID") is "Schneidermann's golden
rules".  Schneidermann lists eight golden rules to good UID.  They're
generic enough (in my opinion) that if developers stuck to them,
interfaces would be good to use.

The link Pete Jewel sent your way is all that's really needed to know

when designing GUI components, and evaluating them.  A good heurstic
approach, if nothing else.

You can't apply them to any one application.  If anything <em> all </em>
applications violate the eight golden rules in some way -- and in a
sense, it's expected to do so.  Really, the rules are about being
consistent.  Use of colour.  Appropriate use of menus, grouping of
related components.  Making sure people with disabilities (such as not
being able to use a mouse) are catered for....  the list is endless.

:)  I too had this debate.  If you read the windows XP style-guidelines
(I don't have the link handy, and I can't be arsed to google for it).
Microsoft recommend it to go on the right-hand side.  Which, again, if
one strives for consistency and familiarity, in the use of GUI apps
that have been well-established, then perhaps it is "better" to follow
the convention.  No?  At least, in so doing, you  minimise the
likelihood of not needing to (re)train people on how to use the end
product.

The "problems" arise then, between OSes.  Doing the above is fine on

I usually see it on
the right.  But we looked at some applications on the Mac and Linux
and they did have Cancel-OK instead of OK-Cancel.  I tried to do that in
a web app but it felt wrong, the Save button goes on the left.  Then I
pressed Enter in an entry screen and my changes were lost, and I
thought, "That's <EM>really</EM> wrong."

Default tab order is a different issue from positioning, but I agree

"Cancel", requires careful consideration before implementing.

that to be Cancel.

I'd never seen a web form with a Cancel button before (as opposed to a
Reset button), but it was required in my last application and I found it
pretty convenient, so I put it in my current application too.  Even
though I know I can just leave the page and it's a de facto cancel, it's
convenient to use that button at the bottom, and I set a message in the
session for the next screen saying "Add record cancelled".  Users like
that sort of thing, and I found I do too.

But they don't.  Just look at GNOME's save-dialogue window.  It's a
complete mess.  But on the other hand, it is a familiar interface.  I
watched my step-dad use KDE for the first time, the other day.  Being a

the different widget sets and toolkits -- a problem that is soon solved

Firefox and Thunderbird have
taken hold because they offer obvious improvements (95% drop in
viruses/spyware) and are easy to learn.  Linux as a whole (which we know
means, "a particular Linux distribution as a whole") still has too big a
gap in that area, too many times you have to call in an expert.  Whether
the problem is factual, perceptional, or the fault of secretive hardware
vendors and the DMCA, it's still a legitimate issue for discussion.

My firsthand experience of this is converting my mom to Linux.  Because
of her medical conditions, she doesn't learn or remember things as
easily as she used to.  I show her how to use Thunderbird but she
forgets, and then she's afraid she'll screw it up and break something,
so she goes back to the 10-year-old Eudora on the 486/66 because she can
get its basic functions working.  So the next weekend I come over and
show her how to use Thunderbird again and she takes notes, but she still
gets confused until she's done it several times.  Then she asks me, "Why
is [computer #2] so slow?  Does it have spyware?"  (She got it used as a
gift to replace her 486.)  I just have to say, "I don't know."  I don't
follow Windows closely enough to know all the different kinds of virii
and spyware out there.  But I don't want her paying $50 for an
anti-spyware program, not when she needs the money for glasses and
shoes.  The only alternatives are reinstalling Windows (tricky with the
incomplete distribution disks computers come with now) or switching to
Linux.  But I don't have the 50 hours it would take to handle all the
incompatibilities that might come up and walk her through using Linux
programs and administering her Linux box.  But I do want to get out of

I've made a Knoppix disk and I'll let her play with that for a while to
get used to it.  It's great that Knoppix automatically starts DHCP so
it's zero-configuration for DSL systems with dynamic IP -- except she
has dialup.  So I'll have to either edit her PPP chatscript file or find
the GUI configurator wherever it is, if it has one.  Yippie.  One good
thing though.  I've been able to indoctrinate her against Outlook
(vendor lock-in) and the evils of the DMCA.  She doesn't like

His vision of one Windows-like desktop to replace the
KDE/Gnome dichotomy is a bit hilarious.  Of course that's unacceptable
to geeks, both because of the lack of choice and because the Windows UI
is so limited.  (Can't type into a window that's not on top.  Can't
switch desktops.)  Users don't have to "choose" between KDE and Gnome;
they can take the distribution's default and have a perfectly competent

maybe the companies and volunteers that really want to capture this

As I understand it, Evolution provides a complete upgrade path for those
who want an 0utlook/IE/etc. migration for that. So do the Alacos
Migration Client, Versora, and MoveOver (and, I'm sure, a number of
others - that's just off the top.) The methods are <EM>there</EM> - for those

Well... I read that part somewhat differently. It is possible to import
mail from Outlook Express with Evolution and KMail (KMail even claims to
import Outlook/Exchange mail, but I've never tried it), but what I think
the guy is trying to say is that the Linux desktops need a
'libwinreg'[1] that can allow various programs to take their
configuration straight from Windows without bugging the user with
details like the path to their Outlook files etc. (That's what they did
with the Windows version of Firefox -- it takes IE's configuration from
the registry, automatically imports IE's Favorites, etc.)

The problem with that, as I see it, is that 'libwinreg' will have an
arbitrary dependency: Wind0ws. Whoever maintains it will have to spend
a hell of a lot of time learning and relearning Wind0ws every time a new
version comes out - which is, I submit, not what people generally want
out of their Linux experience.

Sure: anyone who intends to interoperate with any other system has to
expect that. The advantage here is that there are so many other projects
that depend on knowing the format of the Windows registry: Wine, Rewind,

Well, I pointed out the code from Rewind that does this already, and

This is one of those examples where software shows its true colours as
being supreme over its users, and other software dependant on it.  New
users might look at having to use Wine as complex;  to me it is.  OTOH,
if they reslise its a prerequisite to having to run an invaluable piece
of software they can't do with out, they might overlook the fact its
complex and try and use it anyway. Either way, the use of Wine is out
of the user's control, alas.

Windows, then automatically sets up a 'My Documents' link etc), a tool

As to why this difference in perception exists, I don't know.  Maybe
it's because manufacturers overpromised on the wonders of computers in
the 90s (and 80s) to get more boxes off the sales floor and into
homes.   But I'm not sure if that's the whole story.  If it were, it
would be the marketing success of the century.  But I think there must
be other factors too, although I'm not sure what they are.

It's one thing to have the application settings imported to Linux, but
there's also the FILE TYPES. For us, the deal-breaker has always been
CorelDraw.  There's no way to use our 15,000 CorelDraw files on Linux,
and none of the Linux applications can open a CorelDraw file.

Well, RJ - the question under discussion wasn't "why don't companies
adopt Linux more often" - large companies, government offices, and
entire countries <em>  are  </em> switching over in droves; you may have even
noticed that the pundits who used to loudly proclaim that "Linux isn't
ready for the Real World!" have quietly vanished away - or have switched
over to "Linux isn't ready for the desktop!" I'll admit that I'm not

current "Linux on the desktop" discussion, although I'd be interested to
hear your reasoning.

Having said that - I've worked for many different companies as a
consultant, and I disagree with your estimate of "most enterprises"
having a make-or-break issue based on filetypes; in fact, I'd say that
applies to a relatively small percentage of those who want to switch
over but decide that they can't, since many, many common filetypes are
handled within Linux apps.

Good point - it's not a direct connection. Corel runs under Wind0ws, and
it supports .cdr files; neither Wind0ws nor Linux support them directly.
However likely that point is to be elided in this sort of a discussion,
it's not really about Linux or Wind0ws - it's about Corel's software,
and its availability under a given OS.

"Regular people" meaning those who could not afford a $1000 license fee for
Xenix or BSDI.  But anybody who was interested in Unix at the time was not
a regular person.  "Regular people" or "desktop users", as the term is
commonly used, means those who cannot program or do sysadmin, and don't
want to learn.  That's precisely why Windows and NT became so popular,
because Microsoft gave the illusion that it didn't require configuration
or troubleshooting, you could just use the friendly dialogs and wizards
and avoid "programming".  Of course, that's a loaded term in itself.
Writing an Excel macro or setting the myriad dialog options comes pretty
close to de facto programming.

Okay, I see your point.  I guess I'm a "regular person" in terms of
automobiles, which I do not understand, could not fix if one broke
down, and don't plan to learn.  But I just figured if you can use the
three "basics"  -- office suite; email; and web browser -- on an
operating system, it's "ready for the desk top."  Open Office or the
KDE Suite, Firefox, and Thunderbird (or the GNOME equivalent --
Simian?)

Yes, all those programs are adequate.  Where people get into trouble are
the thousand things that can go wrong or require computer-specific
configuration -- things we don't even think about but stop a "desktop
user" cold.  E.g., X doesn't start, your mouse pointer doesn't move, your
printer produces gibberish (unconverted Postscript or double-escaped
Postscript), you have to mount a disk, you have to learn and run a shell
command (which implies learning the Linux directory structure, etc), you
have to edit a config file (better not use OpenOffice), etc.  We all
learned these because we had a strong desire to learn Unix and we picked
up the skills gradually over years.  But sit Aunt Tilley or a secretary
before a Linux box without tech support and it's a whole different story.
I <EM>thought</EM> that's what everybody meant by "Linux isn't (or is) ready for
the desktop".  The need to set your preferences and bookmarks in Firefox
is minor compared to this.  I certainly didn't mean to suggest that
OpenOffice, Firefox, Thunderbird, KDE, GIMP, etc, aren't full-featured
stable substitutes for their Windows counterparts.    The only thing
they're not adequate for is when you need precise compatibility with
complex Office documents, like Word documents with tables or Excel
spreadsheets with form macros.

From there, it was up to "regular people" to
do what they wanted with it.  Considering that nearly any type of
application, from Word-processing suites, to Photoshop-type image
processors, (Gimp), Vector Graphics, heavy-gui email and web browsers,
in addition to the "standard" GNU and other Unix-like scripts,
languages, filesystems etc. all for free or a low price and a lifetime
of free upgrades are offered on the PC desktops and notebooks of
"regular people" the world over, I'd say the writer of this article has
very little idea of what he's talking about; merely a pre-conceived
notion of what type of Windows monopoly "regular people" might be
willing to accept.

No, I think he <EM>does</EM> have an idea of what he's talking about: "We
learned this lesson in the Mozilla world. It wasn't until we implemented
a very capable migration system in Firefox, which carried over the
user's IE favourites, cookies, history, passwords, etc, that regular
people started moving over in serious numbers -- and staying (and
bringing others over)."

to add that sometimes peoples problems seem to lie in them "requiring" a
system to work in a way they are used to.

Sure.  But there's a difference in requiring and demanding, which is
what the author of the article bordered on.  Requiring something often
has certain levels of flexibility associated with it.  The software
engineering process, when developing software undergoes two things:
validation and verification.  That's where requirements are met, and
their limitations taken into account with the people whom will
ultimately end up using the software.

My point was that some of the time the "requirement" is not actually a
requirment, just a "desire" of the user.  In some cases that I have seen
it's been shear narrowmindedness to the point of,

There are plenty of people who feel a need to do business presentations, but
find the present offerings of presentation software somewhat scary.  Why?
because they are complex - they didn't start that way, but they got that way
over time, because the power users who thought up interesting things to do
were also the ones vocal enough to Fuel Demand (in other words, to tell
companies that they would part with hard earned cash, if the app did
$feature).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
This sort of creeping featurism seems to apply to many varieties of app.  In
the open source world, the burden of a complex app drives some developers to
stomp off and write a "better" one that meets their desire for a simpler app.
So we've a splash of email clients at varying levels of either complexity or
resemblance to a UI popular elsewhere, because "simpler" is in the mind of
the beholder.  The same thing happens in the commercial world too, leading
to a pile of apps named $brandname Express or Lite, and trial editions
containing the most popular 2 tasks out of 5 things you might really want to
do with it.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Searching for the app that only does what you want and no more is just
another complexity.  In order to even attempt it, you have to want something.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Power users of a given app have learned its language, as much as Ben and I
have learned perl whilst Jim learned Awk and Mike groks what parts of Python
actually contain more magic.

We're spoiled though - in our techie culture, while it's a burden to take
some time to learn a new language, we sometimes take it as an adventure,
and do it, because we want the special abilities offered when it's done.
A less adventurous soul looked twice at MS Word and clung firmly with both
fists to the Word Perfect he already had - and thinks exactly the same
of OpenOffice.  They no longer care about <EM>simple</EM> - they care about not
losing features, and not losing too much time during the learning curve.
They find reviewers who aim at "is it simple enough" just as frustrating
as we do, because it's not <EM>simplicity</EM> that dogs their learning curve, it's
<EM>familiarity</EM> and that can only be earned with some time behind the wheel.
What he wants is to know that he's not wasting his time.

Whilst in a business
environment time is money and time spent learning a new system will cost
the company money, it seems as if people are not open-minded enough to
see that there may be a better solution to a problem.

But it comes back to the same question:  "which interface is right?".
There is no knowing what's familiar to any groups of users, let alone
intuitive (although it could be argued that intuitiveness is not a
necessitate of something unfamiliar in this context.)  Read Mike's
article and my comments about Schneidermann to realise that it's a
<EM>huge</EM> field.  Personally, though, a business will always have some
training skills involved with software.

I take on board your exact point here about which interface is right,
but firmly believe that if the interface is flexible enough then the
problem is less of an issue.

Many problems

Well, that depends on the solution.  There are quite a few things in
Linux that are more cumbersome to do, than if I had to do it in
Windows.

Again, I agree here that both os's have advantages and disadvantages, I
tend to use which ever I need for whatever task I'm trying to achieve,
but it is frustrating to hear people complaining about an operating
system day in, day out, when they are not ready, "mentally", to consider
an alternative.

Certain differences between
the linux and doZe os, have firmly rooted in my mind which side of the
fence I'm on, not to mention the ethical and moral standings.
I hope people can see what I'm getting at here
