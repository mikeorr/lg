Scientific Software Packaging Feedback
</H3> 
<P> 
Date: Fri, 3 Apr 1998 07:19:12 -0700 (MST)
<P>
<B>Purpose?</B> 
<P>
     We at Kachina Technologies, Inc. are very excited about the tremendously
increasing popularity of our SAL (Scientific Application on Linux) web site.
Based on encouraging user feedbacks, we want to go the extra mile to provide
more services to the Linux and the Scientific and Engineering communities.
<P>
<B>What is SAL?</B> 
<P>
     SAL (Scientific Applications on Linux) web sites collect thousands of
software links for scientists, engineers, and Linux ethusiasts.  There is no
doubt that SAL has become one of the most important, popular, and exciting
software resources for the Linux and UNIX community.   SAL was developed by
Dr. Herng-Jeng Jou, along with many others at Kachina Technologies, Inc.
<P>
     While most system/network level applications are packaged by Linux
distributors and provided on their CD-ROM distributions, most commonly used
free scientific packages are still provided in source code format. Although
many users contributed packages which are often found in /contrib directories
on Linux distributors' FTP sites, lack of version tracking and centralized
control hinder the appreciation of these individual efforts. We are facinated
by the team work and coordination of GNU/Debian Linux people and want to
pursue the same goal in software packaging for the Scientific and Engineering
community.
<P>
     Our initial goal is to archive Debian (.deb), RedHat (.rpm), and simple
binary tree (.tgz) used by many distributions including the popular Slackware
distribution. At the same time, SAL's website will function as a repository
and users can download the packages and install them on their systems
immediately.
<P>
     However, we'd like to listen to your opinions on the best policies and
procedures to get this job done correctly.
<P>
     Please tell us what scientific and engineering software (those with free
source codes that are available of course) you would like to see packaged.
<P>
     Please email us at sal@kachinatech.com and simply include:
<ol>
<li>Software name(s)
<li>Preferred packaging format (RPM, DEB, or others)
</ol>
     Although this is just a survey, we are quite serious and excited about
doing this. The established packages will be available through SAL.
<P>
     Currently, there are 14 SAL sites installed worldwide, and their URLs are:

This is the announcement for Version 1.3 of Poppy.  It is a simple Perl
script that allows you to view only the headers of messages from a POP3
server and then allows you to selectively view, save, or delete each
message.  It is ideal for limited resource systems.
<P>
A simple perl script to retrieve mail headers from a POP3
server and individually view, save or delete them. Requires
perl.  Simple mail reader which relies on the POP3 server
to do most the work.  A good use is to delete or to skip
over huge emails on a POP3 server when on a slow link.
You may also view only a specified number of lines from
a message to see if you would like to download the whole
message.

Blender 3d beta release
</H3>
<P>
Date: Thu, 16 Apr 1998 19:20:29 GMT<BR> 
NeoGeo is happy to announce the Beta release of a Linux and FreeBSD
version of Blender.
We expect the first Beta users to help us complete testing and evaluating,
especially for the various PC configurations.
An official version will be released 4 to 6 weeks later.
<P>
Blender is the freeware 3D package - up until now only available for SGI -
that has become very popular with students, artists and at universities.
Being the in-house software of a high quality animation studio, it has
proven to be an extremely fast and versatile design instrument.
Use Blender to create TV commercials, to make technical visualizations,
business graphics, to do some morphing, or design user interfaces. You can
easily build and manage complex environments.
The renderer is reliable and extremely fast. All basic animation principles
are well implemented.

dancing_linux - a rendered 3D-Linux-animation / eyecatcher
</H3>
<P>
Date: Fri, 17 Apr 1998 08:06:23 GMT<BR> 
The animation shows a nice linux-logo, consisting of the
five letters and additional artwork. Everything is in motion and
is twisting around (glass-, metal-, and light-effects!).
It has a black background and is VERY suitable as an eyecatcher
for shopwindows or your own linux-box.
<PRE>
=================================================
Format:         *.flc movie
Resolution:     320*200, 8bit color
                120 frames (about 20 fps)
Renderplatform: Linux-Povray 3.01  (of course)
Rendertime:     15 min/frame on a P133
=================================================
</PRE>
The movie may also be viewed with xanim, but it looks _much_ better
fullscreen! I included John Remyn's SVGA-Player "flip" (binary).
<P>
