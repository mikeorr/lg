So say you want to test how fast your disk does writing operation. You
might do this:
<pre>
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mount/point/of/your/partition/testfile bs=4K count=256M
</pre>

<p>
It will write 1GB file to the target partition. But one thing you
might don't know is that the filesystem system do it in so called
"write back" style. In this mode, data actually transit in temporary
cache before actually being flushed to the disk. As the result, you
get faster I/O speed.
</p>

<p>
How to get the real number then? Try to add "oflag=sync" as the option
of dd. Then repeat the test, possibly by combining "dd" and "time" to
get real/sys/user time statistic. This way, writing will be done
synchronously i.e a block of data will be pushed to the disk before
next blocks are going to be written.
</p>

<p>
Other benchmark program also provide you the same mode. Check the
related documentations so you really know the meaning of the numbers
you get. Also, as the rule of thumb, write something bigger than your
L2 (or L3, if you have it) cache size, so I/O is done mostly between
RAM and the disk, not originated CPU cache. Cache is thousands time
faster than RAM, which also gives you another layer of "speed
illusion".

Depending on your RAM size this might not be sufficient due to caching.

<p>
I usually use 
<pre>
hdparm -t -T 
/dev/md5:
 Timing cached reads:   1276 MB in  2.00 seconds = 637.36 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  488 MB in  3.01 seconds = 162.26 MB/sec
</pre>

<p>
if I'm in a hurry and want some numbers (will only do read).
</p>


<p>
If I want a more comprehensive disk performance I use bonnie or bonnie++ 
</p>

<p>
To reduce caching effects It uses twice your RAM as test file size and
it will run not only block-access but also rather inefficient character
wise access to assess seek performance (as an aside: SD-cards have
almost the same performance per char as per block). You also get read,
write and rewrite performance as well as massive random seeks from bonnie.

<p>
%CP is CPU usage to see if disk or CPU is maxed (typically in Chr mode only).
</p>

<p>
Funny enough -- this 2 disk-raid0 is better in writing than reading.
Then the hdparm result is close to the write throughput of 160MB/s.
light system load in the write? Guess just shows how fickle disk
performance measuring can be <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">

<p>
I'm not sure that I/O flag you mentioned is sufficient to stop all
caching, manpage/source of bonnie was mentioning lots of problems to
get accurate numbers.

Hi <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
First of all, thank you for adding some thoughts...

Absolutely correct, I should mention it too.

<p>
Correct again. Anyway, I skipped about hdparm since I assume many
people already knows about it.
</p>


<pre>

</pre>

<p>
yeah, dd is too simple. Maybe I should clarify my tip as "no brainer
way to get disk I/O speed" :D
</p>

<p>
correct, rewrite case is also important to watch since there is a
chance some data are already cached in hard disk internal cache.

yeah, been there done that too actually when I wrote about I/O
benchmarking for SysAdmin Magazine. Initially, I think disk benchmark
was damn easy...but later I found myself completely wrong.

Yup, shame on me <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> So, I hope the reader read it with many grains of
salt <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> Mr Okopnik, anything you want to add? (At least, if it's not
going to 2 cent tips, it is worth to be mentioned in mailbag)
