Hello
I went to look at the kernel messages with dmesg today, but surprise!
All that I got was line after line of this:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>keyboard: unknown scancode e0 64
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG><CODE>
dmesg and /var/log/messages are just about useless, flooded with that.
</CODE></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
It's the same scancode every time too.
the command showkey -s shows that my wireless keyboard does send an
extra scancode after each key along with the normal scancodes. This is
apparently some kind of status notification. I was surprised that the
keyboard worked at all since it required a special driver under Windows
so I almost expected something like this.
</STRONG></P>

You did not tell us which distribution you are running. Not that it
really matters, but each distribution has a slightly different way of
handling console keymaps.

You should ensure, regardless that:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>/etc/console/bootmap.gz
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
is correct, but I suspect it is since you were able to write us the
e-mail.

If you're running debian, it is just a case of doing:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>dpkg-reconfigure console-data
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
However, your errors are usually indicative that your keyboard mappings
are off. The only thing I would have suggested is that you used loadkeys
and dumpkeys, and if that doesn't work to define the keycodes yourself,
via keymaps and setkeycodes(

Strange, there is no directory called <TT>/etc/console</TT> here. I'm sure my
keymap is good though. Other than the warning the keyboard works
flawlessly and it doesn't happen when I use a standard keyboard. I
prefer my wireless one though.

Well -- I've no idea how to change the keymap -- but if the keyboard is
basically working and the only annoying thing is the flooded syslogs how
about dropping these messages? As what kind of syslog messages are they
logged? kernel? info level or higher? The old syslogd has restricted
options to accept or dump messages of a particular type (not content
filter).  I know that <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> 9.x offered a new improves syslogd as an
alternative -- so that might even be able to do some fancy filtering on
the message content (and dump your keycode warning). Won't help for the
boot-log but <TT>/var/log/messages</TT> won't be floded anymore.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
To read the boot log <TT>/var/log/boot.msg</TT> without the garbage you can run
grep with negative filter like:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>grep -v "your keycode" /var/log/boot.msg | less
</pre></blockquote>

The keyboard works but I don't like my log being made
so huge by all that junk.

I just had a similar problem, although it wasn't a flood as it is for
you; perhaps 10 of these messages every hour. Before I could get around
to fixing it, I upgraded my kernel from 2.6.3 to 2.6.5 - and the problem
went away. So, even though I can't take credit for finding the solution
(or even the exact problem), there it is.

The "scan codes", as far as I could tell, were being generated by some
kernel driver seeing a signal from a piece of hardware with which it
wasn't completely familiar and spitting out the unknown signal as a
"scan code". In my case, I'm pretty sure that it was the new Synaptics
touchpad - which definitely required a new driver.
