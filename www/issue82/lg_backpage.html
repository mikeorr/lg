I finally changed the header and footer decorations as I've been meaning to
for months.  The main purpose was to shrink the vertical space the header
takes, to fit more of the article content on the first screenful.  This isn't
the last change; we'll make minor adjustments and maybe get a stylesheet one 
of these months.

The headers are similar to Klez in that the "From:" address is completely
different from the "From " address.  Unlike Klez, the ostensible domain
name in the last "Received:" header before it reached our server was not
a single word consisting only of random consonants.

Of course, the funniest part is that the ostensible domain is so

Thanks.  The problem we had with the answerguy address was that a lot
of sites linked to it without explaining what it was for.

<P> Hmm, do you have "The Advice People" in your town?  It started several
years ago in New York and then and then one of the members established
it here in Seattle.  They set up a couple chairs and a sign certain
Friday and Saturday evenings in a pedestrian area (Broadway in Seattle)
and invite people to ask them any question they want.  They don't claim
to have any particular qualifications except "62 years combined
experience living on this planet".  The only topics they refuse to
discuss are politics and religion.  I don't remember whether they do it
for free or charge a token 25 cents.  Often a small crowd will gather
and listen to the questions and answers.
</P>
<P>
One year I was there the weekend before Halloween, and people would
ask for ideas on what to wear on Halloween.  The girl who was the 
coordinator came up with some original ideas like, "You could dress up as a
bowl of fruit.  Or maybe you could be a line of coke."
</P>
<P>
I'm not sure if they're still around.  I haven't seen them for a few
years.  I think there's a book written by the Advice People's founder, but I
don't remember the title or the author.

My name is Dr. Henrique Sessenou, a medical doctor and
the sole proprietor of the above specialist hospital.
I understand that through Internet is not the best way
to link up with you because of the confidentiality
which the transaction demands. However, I have already
sent you this same letter by post one month ago, but I
am not sure if it did get to you since I have not
heard from you, hence my resending it again. I have a
widow here in my hospital who is on a political
assylum in Lome - Togo refugee camp. She has 
been so ill for some couple of months now.

<P> This woman confided in me based on the free medical
attention I have been giving to her and her children.
She had revealed to me of her life history and about
her late husband who was a top military officer in one
of the west African country (Sierra-Leone) before his
death during the civil war and the fortune she
inherited from her late husband. She has asked me to
source a credible and trustworthy partner abroad who
will manage her funds for investment, the sum of
Twenty Eight Million US Dollars (US$28m) which her
late husband deposited in a safe fiduciary agent in
Europe through a security company based in Lome -
Togo. I wish to chose you for this venture and I
believe you will be in the position to assist in
managing this large sum in a profitable ventures and
also to help create a safe haven for her and her
children by making a residence arrangement for them in
your country.

<P> After she had disclosed this information to me, I saw
the reason to request from her all the documents
relating to this deposit of which she did, now I have
the documents covering the deposit which I will not
hesitate to fax to you the copies as a proof for your
confirmation as soon as I receive your response via
e-mail. I am obliged to assist this lady knowing too
well that she has a limited knowledge in the business
world and as such she cannot manage this funds
herself, and in order to avoid any trace of her by the
government, I will need from you a mutual
understanding and then we shall make plans on how the
funds would be secured into an account in your name;
after which you will arrange and travel immediately to
meet with the security company's Agency in Europe for
clearing.

<P> This amount is contained in a sealed trunk box and it
is registered and declared as containing family
treasures, so even as I am writing you now the
security company and its agency are not aware that
there is cash money in the trunk. Let me assure you
that this transaction is 100% hitch and risk free;
from my discussion with her, she has agreed to give
you a reasonable amount of percentage for your
involvement in this deal, and this has to be discussed
upon the receipt of your quick response.

<EM>Mike ("Iron") is the Editor of <I>Linux Gazette</I>.  You can read what he has
to say in the Back Page column in this issue.  He has been a Linux enthusiast
since 1991 and a Debian user since 1995.  He is SSC's web technical
coordinator, which means he gets to write a lot of Python scripts.
Non-computer interests include Ska/Oi! music and the international language
Esperanto.  The nickname Iron was given to him in college--short for Iron Orr,
hahaha.</EM>
