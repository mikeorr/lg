<p>
I have a glitch that's stumped both me and my sysadmin.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to know which hosts a particular file that needed updating was on and 
I thought this simple loop would answer that question.
</p>

<p>
$ for n in `seq 1 25`; do ssh host$n ls -l /path/to/file; done
</p>

<p>
This worked for the first 4 hosts, ten it got to the 5th host where it 
displayed the banner and hung. Trying it directly as a simple command;
</p>

<p>
$ ssh host5 ls -l /path/to/file
</p>

<p>
also hung after displaying the banner.
</p>

<p>
$ ssh host5
</p>

<p>
allowed me to log in normally and
</p>

<p>
$ ls -l /path/to/file
</p>

<p>
showed that the file did not exist on host5.
</p>

<p>
Next I tried 
</p>

<p>
$ ssh echo foo 
</p>

<p>
which worked normally, so I tried 
</p>

<p>
$ ls -l /bin/sh
</p>

<p>
which also worked normally.
</p>

<p>
$ ssh host5 strace ls -l /path/to/file
</p>

<p>
didn't hang either and I couldn't see anything that struck me as odd in the 
output
</p>

<p>
$ ssh 'host5 ls -l /path/to/file 2&gt; /dev/null' 
</p>

<p>
did not hand ang modifying it to 
</p>

<p>
$ ssh 'host5 ls -l /path/to/file 2&gt;&amp;1' 
</p>

<p>
allowed me to see the error message.
</p>

<p>
The problem seems to be related in some way to the handling of standard error, 
but I can't think of anything that would cause it to behave like that. I have 
a workaround that gets me the information I need, but I would like to resolve 
the underlying problem. Do any of the gang have any idea what could cause 
this sort of behaviour?

I agree with you - it seems to be some kind of STDOUT/STDERR bug. The
two questions that would pop up for me would be 1) is the shell being
used the same one as on the other hosts, and 2) has someone managed to
crawl into my system and replace the shell with something just a little
different? Little bits of misbehavior like that can be indicative.
