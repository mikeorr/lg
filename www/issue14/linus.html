Linus Torvalds, considered the "Father of the LINUX Operating System", 
has been selected by the UniForum Board of Directors to receive The UniForum 
Award. The Award will be presented to Torvalds on Thursday, March 13th, as 
part of the morning Keynote Session at UniForum '97, being held at the Moscone 
Convention Center in San Francisco.

The UniForum Award, presented annually since 1983, goes to individuals or 
groups whose work has significantly advanced the cause of open systems over 
time, or has had an immediate and positive impact on the industry with long 
term ramifications. The UniForum Board of Directors considered a number of 
nominees for this year's awards, and voted unanimously in their selection of 
Linus Torvalds for his breakthrough work on the LINUX kernel and for his 
pioneering efforts in making his work available at little or no cost to anyone 
wishing to develop on it. 
<P>
Linus Torvalds is the creator and chief architect of the Linux operating 
system.  At the University of Helsinki in the spring of 1991, frustrated 
with the price of 
Unix operating systems, Torvalds began writing some software code to handle 
certain computing chores on the 386. 
&quot;I noticed that this was starting to be an operating system,&quot; he 
says. 
Since then, he has traveled all over the world promoting Linux. 
Although developing Linux has been almost a full-time job for him,
he recently accepted a job at Transmeta in Santa Clara, California.
He and Tovi Monni recently celebrated the birth of their baby daughter,
Patricia Miranda Torvalds.

<P>
The UniForum Board also selected a second Award winner this year: James 
Gosling of JavaSoft, and his development team, for their work on Java. Gosling 
will receive his Award at the Wednesday, March 12th Keynote session at 
UniForum '97.
<P>
