<blockquote><font color="#000066">As I initially planned to go after this with the Editors' 
Scissors I couldn't decide quite what to snip without having to put my own nickel's
worth in at multiple places.  Leaving it intact is a better example of

</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">I'll suffice to say that I favor his attitude, but fear 
the sort of people who already have even heard of <EM>Linux Gazette</EM> might be above his
"level 1" threshold, and he is not in the least bit clear where to draw
dividers for his other 4 levels.  He also shows a bit of intelligence
and may be beyond "level 1" himself, too.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">Many commercial distros come with "quick start" guides 
geared for the discs in the package.  If you need that, I urge you, it's worth spending
the money.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">Beyond a fairly minimum start, what's a spreadsheet if 
you won't put numbers in it, an email program if you can't decide who to send mail
to ... do we know any mail programs that will tell you why not to
spam before letting you use them?   There is more to life than simply
being told, step by step, which button to push.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">On the other hand, the big name distros at this point 
have so many applications in them that a "level 1" manual covering each would get so
huge no level 1 personality would dare crack it, or the set of them, open.
We used to have it as a cartoon on the wall back when I was in tech
support:  "I can tell I'm getting to this guy.  I heard him open the
shrink wrap on the manual."
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">But we will cheerfully point a News Byte entry at 
resources that make some effort to divide up the world of Linux info along the lines of
how much experience you have.   And yes, Mr. Larsen, that will require
us to point you at a website somewhere.  The weapon, should it come
to exist, is no good if we truly keep it a secret.

<P>
This mail is about making an even better manual -and help system, which
ordinary endusers can understand, and read and USE.  <em>smile - positive -
friendly - but not clever</em> 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</P>
<P>
I am sorry, that I try to pass my idea around to various people by
e-mail, but I have not yet found out the perfect way to do do.
</P>
<P>
I hope, that my ideas would saw an even better idea, because I am not
that clever.
</P>
<P>
I am running my private "war" <EM>laugh</EM> to make Linux user friendly.
</P>
<P>
And this is my contribution to the Linux Project, I mean this idea.
</P>
<P>
If you don't like me, just scrap this letter 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</P>
<P>
There is sitting so many ordinary people out there, surfing the
internet, using windows, and having lots of problems. So it is for me. I
have worked with win3.11, 95 and now win 98. The screen freeze, programs
cannot work together and so on. You probably know?
</P>
<P>
Therefore I now find that "D-day" has come, to attack.       <EM>joking</EM>
</P>
<P>
It is time to make the millions og people, surfing the Internet, shift
from windows to Linux.
</P>
<P>
But in order to accomplish this, it is needed with a campagn called:
"Now Linux has become really userfriendly to install, use and surf the
internet with", or maybe a better name ?  
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</P>
<P>
Therefore my idea goes towards making e.g. 5 levels of help manuals.
The total easy manual could be level 1. The levels for the professionals
2 - 5 <EM>hi</EM>
</P>
<P>
Keep -and continue developing Linux and its help -and manualsystem as
is.
</P>
<P>
This level 1 manual should be made, by letting a completely newbie sit
next to an Linux expert. Then they together shall install -and use
Linux, and the necessary programs. Then let's say, a journalist shall
write alle the stupid questions down into a manual. Just like the
conversation goes on. It must be completely simple, only ordinary words.
</P>
<P>
E.g. "You take the Linux cd called binary 1, and put it into the cd box"
and so on !!  
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
The whole way, like this.
</P>
<P>
Then the same thing with all the important everyday programs. I mention:
Start and log into Linux
Connection to the internet - set up same -browser - mail program - news
program - text editor - spread sheet - zip program - backup program -
pgp program - wine - direct cable - real player - scandisk - webcopier
(wget) - how to install a new program - and to remove it - and probably
some more. Those are my minimum windows programs.
I just mention those I use. I mean just the minimum number of programs.
All above programs shall have this minimum level 1 manual, so people can
start using Linux and more important open the individual program and
immediately start using it.
Only the minimum points, so you do not have to read pages and pages, to
make it work.
And please lots and LOTS OF EXAMPLET. That is the simplest way.
</P>
<P>
Keep all the existing (man - info - howto etc) as is. They belong to
level 2 - 5 !!  
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
They shall be used as cross reference. But here also is needed a
complete Linux reference book, covering about everyting, because Linux
now is so extensive.
</P>
<P>
I know, because I was at one point working with the High Pack surveying
program. It came with huge manuals. Nobody was able to read it, og had
the time. Then I made a manual of some a4 pages. I just wrote down just
what I did, which buttons I pressed.
</P>
<P>
If you do not change attitude towards the paedagogic principles,
concerning using computer programs, one do not move much towards getting
people using Linux.
</P>
<P>
Only the minimum programs and their level 1 manuals, so people can begin
using Linux. Then they later can fiddle into the more extensive matters,
if they want to, or are able to.
</P>
<P>
Also, tell the programmers, to make their user programs simpler, and not
having so many possibilities. Because it confuses normally people.
</P>
<P>
I say, make it SIMPLE and "talking" normally language, Do not call
things devices, but floppy, cd, etc. because people do not understand
it, and they then just stick to windows, because they have been
brainwashed to use this!
</P>
<P>
Hope you get my message???

I repeat, keep the existing as is, but make this simple manual, as the
secret weapon of Linux.
I shall here in the end just mention, that I gave above idea to Bill
Gates. But he just told me to approach him with a lawyer. He was afraid
to be sued by me. But that is not my idea. Just giving a suggestion.
</P>
<P>
Maybe you can get just a tiny new thinking from this letter.
</P>
<P>
I am an old pensioner, and I can only give this idea, as my contribution
to the Linux Project, which I find fantastic. But I still have
difficulties in getting my Linux work. I cannot remember all I read. And
please also free us from this phrase: "just go to this and this
website". It is ok on level 2 - 5.
</P>
<P>
I am wondering, that now data programs has existed for so long, but
still one is using this ridiculous complex manuals. I think programmers
has been brainwashed by windows manuals/help system, which really is no
good.
</P>
<P>
I think that the closest way to get enduser using Linux in buried in the
help system, which has been neclected, I think ! I think this clever
programmers are buried in the very programming, and are missing the link
to the end-user
</P>
<P>
An example of what I mean:
Word Perfect is a program, which main purpose is to be used to write a
letter:
In order to use the program do the following:
1. To open the program do so and so....
2. To write a letter do so and so....
3. When you have written the letter you should save it to both a harddisk and a floppy disk. Do so and so....
4. To print the letter do so and so......
5. And so on......
All the smart gadgets with the program is not necessary to show.
</P>
<P>
I mean, that the important thing is, to be able to use the various
programs immediately.
</P>
<P>
Then if you want to do the more complex things with the program, use
level 2, 3, 4 or 5.
<EM>smile a lot</EM> ( I think, that even my older sister would be able to
understand!)
</P>
<P>
If you can get lots of people going surfing the Internet and writing
letters, as a minimum, using Linux, maybe a part of them slowly will
begin digging into other parts of Linux. And that would be good, at
least I think so!  
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":-)"

Maybe, even that was your ultimate goal?

[argh.  stop that, it's a serious waste of bits. For a oneliner question

Where can i find myself a copy of PC-MOS?

<P>
We don't know.   The fact that the Answer Guy, Jim Dennis, took a best
shot at poking around the internet a number of years ago, to answer a
question about it, is the best we've got.  PC-MOS itself appears to have
disappeared and all that remains may well be all the search engine
entries that point to our dusty little tidbits on the topic.
</P>
<P>
But if you've got a Linux question, or you got a thing you were trying
to do with PC-MOS and wonder if some flavor or other of Linux is up to
doing that for you... please, feel free to ask in more detail!

<P>
I have a 40 GB hard disk.
I have Redhat 7.2 installed
with all the features on the hard
disk taking about 2GB.
I used the grub boot loader.
</P>
<P>
Now I have done a minimal redhat(7.2) installation
on my hard disk.I could not go below 275
mb though.
I edited my old grub.conf
that is with the first installation and
added this new redhat minimum installation
paths.
</P>
<P>
During the boot when i select minimum version
i got an error saying bios wasn't able
to reach my new installation because of
the cylinder limit.
So I made a work around by specifying
the boot of the old installation(
both of them are same versions)
and changed the root to my new installation.
This worked and i was able to boot into my
new installation.
</P>
<P>
Now after booting into my new minimum installation
i deleted all the docs and man pages and further
reduced my installation size from 250 mb
to about 135 mb.
After this i used the dd command to image
the new installation to another linux partition
which i created and having a size of only 200mb.
I copied only the first 135 mb
from the source partition to the target partition.
</P>
<P>
I added another label in grub.conf to point
to this partition and tried to boot.
But after some initialisation messages
it stopped after showing the message kernel panic.
I saw a message stating that "attempt
to access block beyond reach" and showed
the block limit on the partition and
the block which was tried to access.
Obviously the block it was trying to
access was beyond the limit.
</P>
<P>
I am doubting whether this is some kind of
fragmentation problems.Whether the first 135
mb of the source disk
doesn't contain all the installed data.
Could it be that this data is scattered
all over this partition and i cannot image it
directly into another partition.
If that is the case what can i do about this?
Is there any defragmentation tools available
under linux?
</P>
<P>
My aim is to reduce the linux installation
size and to make an image of this reduced
installation on a seperate 200 mb disk
and to be able to boot  and work on it.
</P>
<P>
I actually don't know whether this method
works.This is a sort of experimentation.
</P>
<P>
Are there any other way of achieving this aim?
</P>
<P>
thanx
</P>

Hi,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have a problem trying to setup Linux to access the servers at the
University of Phoenix. The servers (Microsoft IIS) require a "log on
using Secure Password Authentication" under Microsoft Outlook Express. I
understand that this requires a email and news reader to authenticate
using the WindowsNT Challenge/Response (NTCR) protocol [a really bad use
of the http protocol]. The school does have a website to get to the
email and news groups but it is timed and is very particular and seems
to like rejecting Netscape Navigator access. The UOP Tech group's pat
answer is that they only support Outlook Express under Windows, I want a
Linux answer.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Is there any program or daemon that I could run to allow me to
authenticate using this protocol so I could use Linux based email and
news readers? I have tried using pine, staroffice, and leafnode and
several others which are common under <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A>/RedHat 6.2.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks,
</STRONG></P>

I am using linux to try to connect to UOP now and have not found an

There's just one thing I'm missing: there was a column for Emacs - fans, a

It's as powerful and customizable as emacs, but much lighter and easier to

<P>
I'm proud to say that I've been a Linux user since
July 2002 and I've enjoyed my new found computing
freedom very much.  I've also learned a lot, too.
</P>
<P>
I began my Linux experience with my purchase of
Mandrake 8.2, a great distro. for a beginner, like
myself.  I also started out using <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> as my desktop
manager, but have now found new liberties with the use
of Window Maker.  Which brings me to my submission to
you today.
</P>
<P>
Linux itself has the wonderful Tux as its
representative.  KDE has a dragon-like lizard, and
Gnome has a footprint of a gnome, I'm assuming.  After
reading from the Window Maker web site, I learned that
Window Maker has chosen a Panda as it's mascot.  So, I
decided to make a contribution to the line up of cute
and cuddly cartoon PR "toons" with this
drawing of Amanda, the Window Maker panda:

<P>
Now, don't you just want to start using Window Maker?
:o)
</P>
<P><em>
Nope.

		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> But then, I'm an "icewm" junkie from way back.

coming!  I enjoy them very much.

An explanation sidebar might be inline about what a PNG is, why GIF,
and now JPEG, are Bad Ideas, and why Internet Exploiter 5 doesn't know
how to deal with PNG's.  At least not as URLs; maybe it gets them right
as inlines...
-- jra
</P>
<P><em>
The only problem I've seen with PNG is that Netscape 4 displays a solid filled
rectangle instead of the image <EM>if</EM> the image contains any transparency.
</em></P>
<P><em>
As for JPG, I've heard conflicting information on whether any patent applies to
it, but the last I heard was that there wasn't a problem.  Have you heard
differently?

JPEG is fine.  The so-called JPEG patent is bogus, and if Forgent
tries to use it, they will lose it (like BT and the hyperlink patent)

<P><em>
In any case, PNG and JPG have quite different uses.  PNG is good at compressing
line art but bad at compressing things with lots of colors (e.g., photographs),
whereas for JPG it's the reverse.  Whenever somebody sends a GIF to LG, I convert
it to both PNG and JPG, and take whichever one has the best compromise of small
size and color brilliance.  It's not always one or always the other.  Sometimes
the sizes are hugely different, as in one being four times the size of the other.

Email address will not be published.  It shows up in this correspondence,
but there's no public archive of this list.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
We do publish addresses for Mailbag items and 2-Cent Tips, but not for Answer
Gang questions.  That's Heather's choice as the TAG Editor Gal.  If I were
doing it I'd publish addresses in the Answer Gang column too, because why
should that column be different?  In any case, you don't know which of the
three columns your letter might appear in.  A lot of it has to do with whether
it produces one or two short replies or a long discussion.
</P>
<P>
So the only way a reader can guarantee his/her address won't be published
is to specifically ask us not to.
</P>

This mailing list (The Linux Gazette Answer Gang, which makes its home
at <A HREF="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net"
	>tag@lists.linuxgazette.net</A>) is not a confidential location.  It is
a mailing list filled with a medium sized handful of Linux folk, who
expect as their main pay a bunch of warm fuzzies and the knowledge that
a really juicy answer can be published for the readers of our monthly
magazine.  Opinions are likely to run rampant, conclusions may or may
not occur (we guarantee nothing) and attachments in HTML are often
ignored or grumbled about unless you're defending a foreign character
set (yes, we have translators).  It's a good idea to actually dust off
your sense of humor because we definitely use ours.
</P>
<P>
If you need an answer in some business-like fashion, you'll have to
consider a consultant instead.  LinuxPorts has a good list of them.

<P>
If you want an answer in a "Making Linux a Little More Fun" fashion
you'll at <EM>least</EM> need to provide us a real question, and if this
sig block of yours is automatic, a disclaimer that supercedes it and
grants publishing permission.  We have examples in our "Ask The Gang"

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Red Hat 5.1 is quite ancient...

RedHat is up to 7.3 in production release, and there's a beta 7.4 out
there somewhere, I think, rotting people's cats' teeth.

<blockquote><font color="#000066">They [Red Hat] are
mirrored in a number of countries so it should be possible to find an

that downloading 650 MB can take a while, though.

<P><STRONG>
I was quite impressed with the capabilities
as listed in the advertisement, and I would like to learn some more
about the product. I am a student and we are studying about Linux and
this is the reason why I want to learn more about the product.

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Running older versions of Linux for experimental purposes, or studying
what was claimed of Linux a few years ago to see how it has grown, are
both valid student projects.

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Linux Gazette is only available as a webzine although that leads to some
unusual "subscription" models in the form of Sitescooper, debian
