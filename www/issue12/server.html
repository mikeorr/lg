<p>This article is basically a summary of my experiences of setting up
a web server under Linux. I will start with where/how to obtain Apache,
then move on to installation, configuration, and finally how to get things
running. This article is written from the point of view of my system, which
is a Red Hat 4.0 system with v2.0.25 of the kernel. However, a &quot;generic&quot;
installation or a similar setup should apply as well. </p>

<h3><a name="WHERE">Where To Get Apache </h3></a>

<p>The obvious place to get the latest version of Apache is off of the
Apache web site: <a href="http://www.apache.org">http://www.apache.org</a>.
The source distribution file is <i><a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/apache_1.1.1.tar.gz">apache_1.1.1.tar.gz</a></i>
while the Linux ELF binaries is <i><a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/binaries/linux/apache_1.1-linux-ELF.tar.gz">apache_1.1-linux-ELF.tar.gz</a></i>.
Grab what you find is necessary... </p>

<p>If you are running Red Hat Linux 4.0 like I am, during the installation
process you are allowed to select whether or not you want to install a
web server. If you do, Red Hat 4.0 includes the latest Apache and installs
everything automatically with a default configuration. This default configuration
even <b>RUNS</b> correctly without any modifications! However, even in
this case, please read my notes and preferences regarding installation
in the next section. </p>

<p>Typically, unless you need to add special modules or features, the binary
distribution or the default Red Hat installation should be fine. However,
let's say you wanted to run Apache as a proxy server. In this case, you
would need the source so you can compile the proxy module as part of the
binary. </p>

<p>(Note: I have heard rumors that the binary included with Red Hat 4.0
has some bugs. I have yet to encounter any myself, so take that rumor with
a <b>big</b> grain of salt.) </p>

<p>

<h3><a name="INSTALL">Installation </h3></a>

<p>I'm not going to cover compiling Apache since it's actually a fairly
painless process and pretty well documented. Given that, let's move on
to actual installation... </p>

<p>Personally, I like to group all the web server files together in a centralized
location. If you are installing this manually, then this is something you
can do from the outset, and I highly suggest doing this since it will reduce
administration headaches. </p>

<p>If you had Apache installed automatically as part of the Red Hat installation
procedure, then things will NOT be centralized! In fact, I thought the
file placement scheme was one of the most confusing I've ever encountered.
Here's what the Red Hat installation does: </p>

<table border>
<tr>
<td valign="top">web server binaries </td>

<td>/usr/sbin/httpd<br>
/usr/sbin/httpd_monitor </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>config files </td>

<td>/etc/httpd/conf/* </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>log files </td>

<td>/etc/httpd/logs/* </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">web server root<br>
(contains cgi, icons/images, and html files) </td>

<td valign="top">/home/httpd/* </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>I found this to be really disorganized, so I ended up putting mostly
everything under one directory (I left the binaries in /usr/sbin): </p>

<pre>    mkdir /httpd
    mv /etc/httpd/conf /etc/httpd/logs /home/httpd/* /httpd
    rmdir /home/httpd
</pre>

<p>You should end up with: </p>

<pre>    /httpd/
          /cgi-bin
          /cgi-src
          /conf
          /html
          /icons
          /logs
</pre>

<p>And then to preserve the original Redhat file locations: </p>

<pre>    ln -s /httpd /home/httpd
    ln -s /httpd/conf /etc/httpd/conf
    ln -s /httpd/logs /etc/httpd/logs
</pre>

<p>Finally, I added this link since I felt that it made more sense: </p>

<pre>    ln -s /httpd/logs /var/log/httpd
</pre>

<p>If you are installing and compiling Apache manually, you may want to
have the original source files also located under /httpd (or whichever
directory you have). </p>

<p>
<hr></p>

<h3><a name="CONFIG">Configuration </h3></a>

<p>Apache has three main configuration files: <b><i>access.conf</i></b>,
<b><i>httpd.conf</i></b>, and <b><i>srm.conf</i></b>. If you are running
Red Hat 4.0, these files will already be set with the correct directory
paths. If you centralized the locations of all these files, but made those
symbolic links as I mentioned above, things will still be fine since the
symbolic links preserves where Red Hat installed everything. </p>

<p>If you are doing a &quot;generic&quot; installation or have some other
setup, then you will need to do the following: </p>

<p>In <b><i>access.conf</i></b>, change/update these directory entries:
</p>

<pre>    &lt;Directory /httpd/html&gt;
    &lt;Directory /httpd/cgi-bin&gt;
</pre>

<p>In <b><i>httpd.conf</i></b>: </p>

<pre>    ServerRoot /httpd
</pre>

<p>In <b><i>srm.conf</i></b>: </p>

<pre>    DocumentRoot /httpd/html
    Alias /icons/ /httpd/icons/
    ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /httpd/cgi-bin/
</pre>

<p>Essentially, these are the necessary directives in the config files that
need to be updated with the new &quot;centralized&quot; organization. </p>

<p>For further configuration options, I will have to give the standard
statement, &quot;Please refer to the docs.&quot; :) </p>

<p>

<h3><a name="START">Starting/Running the Web Server </h3></a>

<p>To make a long story short, you simply to need to execute the binary
&quot;httpd&quot;. Typically, this is done when the system starts up, in
one of the rc files. </p>

<p>In Red Hat 4.0, it has more of a System V'ish startup style. In 
<b><i>/etc/rc.d/init.d</i></b>
resides <b><i>httpd.init</i></b>, which is the script used
to start and stop httpd.
You can also execute this by hand if you find the need. </p>

<p>For other systems (or a manual install), I suggest starting httpd after
most other services have started (i.e.: put it in <b><i>rc.local</i></b>).
A simple line such as </p>

<pre>    /usr/sbin/httpd &amp;
</pre>

<p>will suffice. </p>

<p>Obviously, it must start after tcp/ip networking has been started. :)
</p>

<h3><a name="FUTURE">What's Next</h3></a>

<p>
Needless to say, I didn't cover actual configuration options
and how to manage your web server.  The configuration options
I leave to the Apache manual.  Managing the web server itself
depends on what kind of web site you want to run.  My own system
does not run a "real" web site; in other words, I don't advertise
it for anything because it serves no real purpose other than for
my own experimentation.  However, you are more than welcome to
take a look at it since it does have a bunch of Linux related
links to it.  The URL can be found at the end of this article.
</p>
<p>
Other than that, I would love to hear any comments and/or
criticisms you may have about what I wrote.  Originally, my
plan was to write a monthly article about running/managing a
web server under Linux.  However, short of actually writing a
manual on configuring Apache (which the Apache documentation
is good enough as a reference), I don't know what else to
write about since there may not be all that much to write
about.
</p>
<p>
However, one idea for a monthly thing that might be good is
to collect hints, tricks, and other useful information related
to running a web server under Linux.  Think of it more as a
&quot;2 cent tips for a linux web server.&quot; If anyone is interested
in this, please drop me a note!
