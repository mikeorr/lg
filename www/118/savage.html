<h1>Snort Inline Part II</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/savage.html">Pete Savage</A></b></p>

<p>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>Last month, we danced around with joy at achieving our goal of
  compiling and installing snort_inline, the IPS modification to
  the common snort package. This month, however, we turn our
  attention to some of the maintenance tasks that will keep our
  Intrusion Prevention System running and up to date.</p>

  <p>This second installment will focus on the following tasks;</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Automatically updating snorts rules.</li>

    <li>Designing a script to enable snort to be restarted easily,
    and started at boot time.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In last month's article, we converted all of our snort rules
  from accept to drop. It is useful to peruse the logs from time to
  time, as there are always false positives being offered in the
  snort community. If you do discover that a rule is causing normal
  traffic to be dropped, you can always change the rules action
  type from drop back to alert.</p>

  <p>Whilst your snort_inline box at the end of last month may have
  been reasonably up to date, a lot has happened since then. Virus
  writers have been busy and shell coders have been feverishly
  coding. The world being the place it is, it is is important that
  you keep the rules on your snort_inline box up to date. This
  process can be performed manually, or with the help of a small
  package called OinkMaster.</p>

  <p>The snort.org website offers three different types of rule
  update downloads: subscription, i.e., payed for, registered, and
  unregistered. Since the unregistered rules are updated only at
  the time of the latest major release from snort.org, and
  subscription rules require payment, we have opted to use the
  registration rules for this article.</p>

  <p>You will need to create an account with snort.org, before you
  can continue. At the bottom of your user preferences page, click
  the add code button to generate your unique snort code. We are
  going to use a fictional code for purposes of this article,
  587cba039g9f03300f9e98b.</p>

  <p>You unique snort code is used to allow you to download the
  latest snort rules as a registered user. We will need to modify
  the configuration file for OinkMaster, for it to download these
  latest rules for us. Please follow the steps below to obtain
  OinkMaster, and begin configuration. For reference, we used the
  file <a href=
  "http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/oinkmaster/oinkmaster-1.2.tar.gz?download">
  oinkmaster-1.2.tar.gz</a>. As in the previous article, we will be
  assuming that all files will be downloaded to /home/snort/</p>

<pre>
mv /home/snort/oinkmaster-1.2.tar.gz /usr/src/
cd /usr/src
tar xzvf oinkmaster-1.2.tar.gz
cd oinkmaster-1.2
cp oinkmaster.pl /usr/local/bin/
cp oinkmaster.conf /etc/
</pre>

  <p>Above, we have moved the oinkmaster script to the
  /usr/local/bin directory. This can be moved to any location you
  desire, but, for the rest of this article, we will assume that it
  is residing in /usr/local/bin/. The same applies to the
  oinkmaster.conf file, except this has been moved to /etc/. We are
  now ready to begin editing the OinkMaster configuration file, to
  take advantage of our snort registration. Open the file
  /etc/oinkmaster.conf in your favorite editor. At around line 61,
  your should modify the line...</p>
<pre>
# url = http://www.snort.org/pub-bin/oinkmaster.cgi/&lt;oinkcode&gt;/snortrules-snapshot-2.3.tar.gz
</pre>

  <p>...and replace &lt;oinkcode&gt; with your newly acquired key from
  above. We will be using our dummy key from above, as an
  example.</p>

<pre>
url = http://www.snort.org/pub-bin/oinkmaster.cgi/587cba039g9f03300f9e98b/
	snortrules-snapshot-2.3.tar.gz
</pre>

  <p>This should now make OinkMaster able to download all available
  snort updates. We will perform one more modification, in order to
  make OinkMaster change all alert rules to drop rules. The
  implications of this have already been discussed previously.
  There may in fact be some rules that you do not want to be of the
  type "drop".</p>

  <p>At around line 292 in the oinkmaster.conf file, you should see
  the comment below:</p>

<pre>
# Example to make SID 1378 a 'drop' rule (valid if you're running
# Snort_inline).
# modifysid 1378 "^alert" | "drop"
</pre>

  <p>This makes a direct reference to our implementation of snort,
  and gives us an example of how to modify a rule from alert to
  drop. It is worth noting, at this stage, that all official snort
  rules come with an SID. This is a unique value used to identify
  the rule against others, and allow release notes for each rule.
  In this way, we can perform a modification to a specific rule. We
  will now add a line below this, to convert all of our alert rules
  to drop rules.</p>

<pre>
modifysid * "^alert" | "drop"
</pre>

  <p>The star in the line above tells OinkMaster to apply the
  modification to all rules it downloads.</p>

  <p>If we now create a temporary directory, we can test our
  OinkMaster configuration, and see if our rules have been
  downloaded and modified.</p>

<pre>
cd /usr/src/oinkmaster-1.2
mkdir temp_rules
/usr/local/bin/oinkmaster.pl -o /usr/src/oinkmaster-1.2/temp_rules/
</pre>

  <p>After issuing the commands above, you should see some output,
  similar to that below. This output has been abbreviated to save
  space.</p>

<pre>

    -&gt; bad-traffic.rules
    -&gt; chat.rules
...
</pre>

  <p>From the output above, we can tell that OinkMaster modified
  all 3190 rules, and added all rules that weren't already
  present: In our case, this was all of them. Now, issue the
  command below;</p>

<pre>
head /usr/src/oinkmaster-1.2/temp_rules/web-attacks.rules -n 20
</pre>

  <p>After some comments about licensing, you should see two rules,
  as below. Notice that the first word of each line is drop,
  indicating that our SID modification has worked.</p>

<pre>
drop tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -&gt; $HTTP_SERVERS $HTTP_PORTS 
	(msg:"WEB-ATTACKS /bin/ps command attempt"; flow:to_server,established;
	uricontent:"/bin/ps"; nocase; classtype:web-application-attack; sid:1328; rev:6;)
drop tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -&gt; $HTTP_SERVERS $HTTP_PORTS
	(msg:"WEB-ATTACKS ps command attempt"; flow:to_server,established; 
	uricontent:"ps%20"; nocase; classtype:web-application-attack; sid:1329; rev:6;)
</pre>

  <p>We are in a position to download these rules into our proper
  snort_inline rules directory from last month. I strongly advise
  that you take a backup of your rules directory, before continuing
  beyond this point. I also suggest you move all custom rules that
  you may have been experimenting with into a file called
  local.rules. This is because OinkMaster will remove any rule that
  is not in the offical release, unless it is present in a separate
  file. This will constitute a modification to the
  snort_inline.conf file, which we will perform in a little while.
  Issuing the following command will perform the same process as
  before, but will now modify our actual snort_inline rules.</p>

<pre>
/usr/local/bin/oinkmaster.pl -o /etc/snort_inline/rules/
</pre>

  <p>The output should be similar if not identical to that shown
  earlier. If we now run snort_inline, as we did previously, with
  the command...</p>

<pre>
snort_inline -c /etc/snort_inline/snort_inline.conf -Q -N -l /var/log/snort_inline/ \
	-t /var/log/snort_inline/ -v
</pre>

  <p>...you may receive the following error;</p>

<pre>
ERROR: FLOWBITS ERROR: The number of flowbit IDs in the current ruleset exceed the maximum
number of IDs that are allowed.  Fatal Error, Quitting..
</pre>

  <p>This is because the new rule set uses a rule where the number
  of flowbit tags exceeds snort_inline's configuration. Flowbits are
  used to keep track of the state of a TCP/IP connection. We can
  modify a line in the snort_inline configuration, to overcome this
  problem.</p>

  <p>Load /etc/snort_inline/snort_inline.conf in your favorite
  editor, and add a line reading:</p>

<pre>
config flowbits_size: 256
</pre>

  <p>If you now try running snort_inline again, you should be
  presented with the familiar;</p>

<pre>
        --== Initialization Complete ==--
</pre>

  <p>If so, you have just used OinkMaster to update your
  snort_inline ruleset to the latest available from snort.org.</p>

  <p>It would be beneficial, though, to have these updates happen
  automatically, so that the process is transparent to us. We are
  going to add this process to the cronjob routine and ensure that
  it happens every night. To do this, we will run the following
  command:</p>

<pre>
crontab -e
</pre>

  <p>This will open cron's nightly jobs for the current user, this
  being root. We are going to use a slightly modified version of
  the command line used previously to start OinkMaster. Usually,
  when running a process as a cronjob, any output from this process
  is emailed to the cronjob's owner. Whilst this can be useful, it
  can also be annoying to receive an email every night, saying the
  same thing. We are going to suppress the output from the
  OinkMaster process, in order to save on mailbox space. You will
  need to add a line similar to the following to your crontab
  file:</p>

<pre>
55 00 * * * /usr/local/bin/oinkmaster.pl -o /etc/snort_inline/rules/ &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 
</pre>

  <p>The line above will run the update at 00:55 every night. Since
  most people are asleep at this time (apart from the ones writing
  this article), this is a good time to perform maintenance tasks.
  The '&gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp; 1' appended to the end of this
  line routes all output to the /dev/null device, effectively
  ignoring it. On saving and exiting, you should see a line similar
  to the following:</p>

<pre>
crontab: installing new crontab
</pre>

  <p>This indicates that your new cronjob has been successfully
  installed.</p>

  <p>This would be a good time to try creating the local.rules
  file, and linking it in to your snort_inline configuration file.
  Follow the steps below to create a local.rules file:</p>

<pre>
touch /etc/snort_inline/rules/local.rules
</pre>

  <p>Edit this file in your favorite editor, and add the following
  line to it;</p>

<pre>
drop tcp any any -&gt; any 80 (classtype:attempted-user; msg:"Port 80 connection initiated";)
</pre>

  <p>This will function in much the same way as the test performed
  in Part I: It would be useful to refer back to this article to
  help you here. We must restart the snort process as before.</p>

  <p>To digress slightly from the topic at hand, it is worth noting
  that some portions of snort_inline are, as yet, not fully
  complete. I am referring to snort_inline's handling of certain
  shell-based connections. At the time of writing this article,
  there is a problem with, for example, telnet rule matching. The
  problem occurs because of the order in which the packets are
  processed. In the original snort, the network card is placed into
  promiscuous mode, allowing it to see all of the network traffic,
  but not alter it.</p>

  <p>This is analogous to watching a conveyor belt of items
  whizzing past a man with a clipboard. The man sits down and
  notes any items that he believes are defective or troublesome,
  and reports these to his supervisor. Once the parts reach the end
  of the conveyor belt, they are assembled together to make a
  complete item.</p>

  <p>In contrast, snort_inline actually interferes with the
  conveyor belt process. snort_inline picks the items up and
  examines them itself. This is where snort_inline does its content
  matching. The original snort also has a mechanism called
  stream4_reassemble. This is analogous to having a second man
  watching over the parts as they are assembled, at the end of the
  conveyor belt. This second quality-control checker can then
  check the whole assembly, to see if there are any problems.</p>

  <p>The problem is that snort_inline functions with only one man
  in the middle of the conveyor belt. This has the effect that
  connections like telnet, where each character typed is sent as a
  separate packet, can bypass certain rules.</p>

  <p>This occurs because dropping a connection when, for example, a
  user types 'to su root' (an actual snort rule, SID 715), would
  require the stream to be reassembled before the content matching
  can be performed. The man in the middle will just see, t - o - -
  s - u - - r - o - o - t, all of which seem perfectly acceptable.
  The original snort would see the finished stream at the end of
  the conveyor belt 'to su root', which would trigger an alert to
  the supervisor.</p>

  <p>It is because of this that some of the snort_inline rules do
  not actually work, even at an alert level. Some people have
  suggested running two versions of snort, one for dropping and one
  for alerting. How you choose to implement and overcome this
  problem is up to you. However, there is word that the developers
  of snort_inline are working on this. It would require the
  handling of out-of-sequence packets.</p>

  <p>Wouldn't it be nice if we could start, stop, and restart snort
  at the push of a button? Well, maybe we can't do it with just one
  button, but the current method takes too much time. It would be
  nice to have a startup script that would take care of loading
  ip_queue, creating the iptables rules, and starting the
  snort_inline daemon. I have written a very simple script to take
  care of this procedure. The script has been written with a Red
  Hat/Fedora system in mind. This being the case, it will not work
  on many of the other distributions. It is not difficult to create
  an init.d script. Use a current one as reference, and edit as
  necessary to learn the basics.</p>

  <p>Let us take a brief look at the script below, to determine
  what each portion does and how it relates to our usual process,
  for starting and stopping snort_inline. The first few lines, with
  a # in front of them are comment lines. These will be ignored
  when the script is run, but a few are required in order to put
  snort_inline into the boot sequence. There are two source
  commands that load standard libraries. The first line of real
  interest is:</p>

<pre>
[ -f /usr/local/bin/snort_inline ] || exit 0
</pre>

  <p>This checks to see if the snort_inline binary file actually
  exists. If the file is not present, the script aborts.</p>

  <p>The start function first checks to see if the ip_queue module
  is loaded. If the module is not present, then it uses modprobe to
  load the module. As you will see, most of the commands in the
  startup script are similar, if not identical, to those used in
  last month's article. The echo statements in this script are
  simply there to produce the [ OK ]/[ FAILED ] lines that are
  displayed when an init.d script is run.</p>

  <p>The next few commands differ from our standard procedure.
  Instead of simply creating a single rule for iptables, as we did
  previously, we are going to create an iptables group. This group
  will serve as a collection for all our iptables rules for
  snort_inline. Why you ask? When it comes to stopping the
  snort_inline service, we want our iptables rules to be removed as
  well. Instead of flushing the entire iptables rule set, we can
  simply flush our new group to remove our snort_inline rules.</p>
<pre>
        iptables -N ip_queue
        iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -j ip_queue
        iptables -I ip_queue -p tcp --dport 80 -j QUEUE
</pre>

  <p>These three lines accomplish the following;<br>
  Line 1: Creates a new iptables group called ip_queue<br>
  Line 2: Routes all tcp input to this new group<br>
  Line 3: Adds our default rule for port 80 to be sent to the
  ip_queue</p>

  <p>Last, the snort_inline binary is loaded via a fairly typical
  command line. Notice the word daemon has been added to the front.
  This starts snort_inline in background mode mode, detaching it
  from the terminal.</p>

  <p>The stop function performs all of this, but in reverse. In
  other words, first the snort_inline process is stopped, then the
  iptables rules are flushed before finally removing the ip_queue
  module. Notice the way the iptables rules are flushed.</p>

<pre>
        iptables -F ip_queue
        iptables -D INPUT -p tcp -j ip_queue
        iptables -X ip_queue
</pre>

  <p>Line 1: Flushes (deletes) all rules in the ip_queue group<br>
  Line 2: Removes the link from the INPUT queue to the ip_queue
  group<br>
  Line 3: Removes the ip_queue group</p>

  <p>As can be seen from the script below, there is also a restart
  function, which performs the stop function, quickly followed by
  the start function. This will make our life much easier from now
  on. We are now able to add snort_inline to the startup sequence,
  allowing it to be run at boot time. The script should now be
  copied from below, or from <a href="misc/savage/snort_inline.txt">this link</a>, and should be
  placed in the /etc/init.d/ directory, and should be called
  snort_inline. The file must also be chmod 755 and both owned and
  group owned by root, else service will not use it. If you are
  unsure how to do this, once the file is created in /etc/init.d/,
  run the following commands;</p>

<pre>
chmod 755 /etc/init.d/snort_inline
chmod root.root /etc/init.d/snort_inline 
</pre>

<p>You should now test the startup script, to make sure it is
running effectively. First, ensure that snort_inline
isn't running and that iptables rules have been
removed and ipqueue has been stopped. Then, run the following
command:

<pre>
service snort_inline start
</pre>

  <p>Your snort_inline box should then display the lines below:</p>

<pre>
[root@localhost ~]# service snort_inline start
Starting ip_queue module:                                       [  OK  ]
Starting iptables rules:                                        [  OK  ]
Starting snort_inline: Reading from iptables
Initializing Inline mode                                        [  OK  ]
[root@localhost ~]#
</pre>

  <p>Providing you see OKs down the line, you should be fine. If
  there are some [ FAILED ] remarks, you should run each command
  individually again. If you have typed the script out again by
  yourself, check for mistakes. If not, check to see if you have
  made any changes to directories, or last month's
  configuration.</p>

  <p>We are now going to allow snort_inline to be run at boot time.
  It is important that you remember to add the chkconfig and
  description comment lines, as these are required by chkconfig in
  order to add it to the startup sequence. Issuing the command
  below will add snort_inline to the services handler in Red
  Hat/Fedora;</p>

<pre>
chkconfig snort_inline --add
</pre>

  <p>This line adds snort_inline into the services database.
  Further, issuing...</p>

<pre>
chkconfig --levels 2345 snort_inline on
</pre>

  <p>...will instruct the init daemon to load snort_inline, in run
  levels 234 and 5. In order to test this, you are going to have to
  reboot the server. You should, during the boot sequence, see the
  output from before flash by, indicating that the services have
  been started correctly. Incidentally, the...</p>

<pre>
# chkconfig: 2345 20 40 
</pre>

  <p>...line determines the initial run levels in which snort_inline
  should be started, followed by the minimum start and stop
  priorities. These values work fine on this testing server, and
  shouldn't present a problem to you.</p>

  <p>Please note that this is a very simple script, and should not
  be taken as a definitive init.d script. It just takes care of the
  essentials, and allows easy restarting of the snort_inline
  process.</p>

  <p>As a final step, we will instruct crontab to restart the
  snort_inline daemon, once the downloading of the rules via
  OinkMaster has been completed. The OinkMaster script was set to
  run at 55 minutes past midnight. We will set snort_inline to
  restart half an hour later. Run the following command:</p>

<pre>
crontab -e
</pre>

  <p>Now, edit this document, putting the snort_inline restart line
  below the OinkMaster command, as shown below.</p>

<pre>
55 00 * * * /usr/local/bin/oinkmaster.pl -o /etc/snort_inline/rules/ &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 
25 01 * * * /sbin/service snort_inline restart &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
</pre>

  <p>The above lines redirect all of their output to the null
  process, thus basically ignoring it. It may be that you would like
  to see the output from these processes, in which case remove the
  '&gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1' from the lines above. You are quite
  welcome to alter the times, also. Indeed, for testing purposes,
  it is probably best that you do.</p>

  <p>Below is the script in its entirety:</p>
