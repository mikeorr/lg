<p>Following last month's horror story (<a href=
"../../../136/lg_launderette.html#mb-the_dog_ate_my_laundry">http://linuxgazette.net/136/lg_launderette.html#mb-the_dog_ate_my_laundry</a>),
I had an unexpected stress-reliever: one of my best friends, who
had been un- and under-employed for months, received a large
payment, and bought me a ticket to his hometown, Pozna&#324;, leaving
last Tuesday, returning Sunday morning.</p>
<p>Mostly, I did the tourist thing - Pozna&#324; is a beautiful city. My
friend took quite a lot of photos, and put them on the web:

<p>One of the most amusing things to happen on one of my numerous
walks around the city was when I happened to glance at a brochure I
had just been handed, and saw that it was for English lessons
<img src="../../../gx/smile.png" alt=":)" /></p>
<p>Spending St. Patrick's Day in Poland was an interesting
experience. Firstly, the first Irish pub I visited was owned by the
only other Irish person I've met who speaks Polish <img src=
"../../../gx/smile.png" alt=":)" /></p>
<p>The second pub was the most interesting part of the day. I had
my first green beer there, and it was the only drink I bought
there, because I was the only Irish person in the pub, and a lot of
people wanted to talk to me about Ireland - someone even produced a
map so I could show them where I live <img src="../../../gx/smile.png"
alt=":)" /></p>
<p>It was fitting that I met the nicest girl[1] I've met in a long
time that night -- I started learning Polish to talk to a Polish
girl, and one of my main stresses was that she LJBFed me[2].</p>
<p>The night I returned, I met two guys from Pozna&#324;, who wouldn't
believe I was there until I showed them some pictures on my phone.
I was hugged several times for such things as visiting a post-pub
sandwich kiosk, much beloved by all, and for knowing the chant for
the local football (that's "soccer", for any Americans...)
team.</p>
<p>[1] I found a note from her in my pocket the next morning on the
plane, telling me I'm sweet. What a nice thing to do! <img src=
"../../../gx/smile.png" alt=":)" /></p>
<p>[2] If anyone is interested (and although she told me in
English), the Polish for "Let's just be friends" is "b&#261;d&#378;my
przyjaci&oacute;&#322;mi" (well, "zosta&#324;my przyjaci&oacute;&#322;mi" in this
case), though to be fair, she seems to be genuine, and not just
feeding me womanese.</p>
