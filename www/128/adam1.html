<h1>Creating a Rudimentary Kiosk System using FVWM</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/adam.html">Thomas Adam</A></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>It is always interesting to see how and where Linux is used within the
wider community, especially where the general public are concerned.
Indeed, it is quite often the case for public libraries to use a batch of
computer terminals to offer a portal via their own intranet so that they
can do searches for books, renew overdue books, etc.</p>

<p>However, ensuring that those terminals only provide that specific
service can be something of a challenge.  Because they're public-facing
terminals, their functionality is likely to be limited to a specific subset
of the available applications.  Ensuring that these applications are the
only ones the user of the terminal sees, along with making sure that no
other application is accessible unless it's explicitly needed in such a way
that it doesn't break the system can be an interesting task, to say the
least.</p>

<p>This is where some sort of <em>kiosk</em> comes into play.  Note that
the concept is <a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Kiosk-HOWTO.html">nothing
new</a>, although the current HOWTO on the issue is somewhat out of date.
FVWM, which is mentioned in the above HOWTO, has advanced a lot since it
was written.  Of course, since then, desktop environments such as KDE have
also had a kiosk extension added to them.</p>

<p>This article will focus on using Firefox as the main and only
application the user will be using.  By using FVWM to manage this
application, it is possible to provide restrictions not only on the
application, but also the environment the user will be using.</p>

<p>The motivation for this article is mostly derived from a series of
e-mails I have been exchanging with someone who seems to be trying to setup
a kiosk system in a corporate environment. The actual content of the e-mail
that turned into this article (as a very odd coincidence) is born out of an
e-mail from another TAG member, who asked the same question.</p>

<p>Originally, I had planned to discuss how to lock down Firefox.  While
this is applicable within the context of this article, it's also somewhat
less restrictive, given that different people require different
circumstances.   Firefox itself has a series of extensions <a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/search.php?cat=7&amp;app=firefox&amp;appfilter=firefox&amp;type=E">dedicated
to kiosk browsing</a> that you can further use to lock Firefox down.  This
article will concentrate on getting a window manager (FVWM) to do the rest
of the work.</p>

<h3>Preliminaries</h3>

In the best case, what you'll probably want to do is something like the
following:

<ul>
  <li>Run the application maximized</li>
  <li>Possibly remove window decorations (run full-screen)</li>
  <li>Ensure that Firefox is the only application running</li>
  <li>Ensure that's the <em>only</em> application that can be run</li>
</ul>

<p>From first principles, here's what your ~/.fvwm/config file ought
to contain.  Note that any decoration changes for this are out of
scope for this article; if you don't like hideous pink borders, change
them.  (I'm going to suggest FVWM version &gt;=2.5.16; anything I
write here won't work on FVWM 2.4.X).</p>

<h3>Enter FVWM</h3>

<p>StartFunction is a function that FVWM runs at both restarts and init.
So, in this, all that's needed is to start your application.  Since there
are some crude preventative measures one can take to ensure this
application doesn't die once the WM has loaded, we'll just start this at
init time.</p>

<pre class="code">
DestroyFunc StartFunction
AddToFunc   StartFunction
+ I Test (Init) Exec exec firefox
</pre>

<p>That's that, all taken care of.  Next thing to consider is whether you
want any window decorations or not, for Firefox.  Let's assume for the
moment that you do want the title and borders, but want to restrict the
buttons that appear on the title.  That's fine; just set a style line for
it:</p>

<pre>
Style Firefox-bin NoButton 1, NoButton 2, NoButton 4, ResizeHintOverride
</pre>

<p><em>NoButton</em> removes a button from being displayed in the title.
<em>ResizeHintOverride</em> makes those column-dependent aware applications
not worry about it. The number buttons are ordered thus, on a titlebar:

<pre>
+----------------------------------------------------------+
| .  .  .  .  .                              .  .  .  .  . |
+----------------------------------------------------------+
| 1  3  5  7  9                             10  8  6  4  2 |
|                                                          |
</pre>

<p>Typically (and as is the default), buttons 1, 2, and 4 are defined for
normal operations of displaying a menu (button 1) and minimising and
maximising an application (buttons 4 and 2 respectively).</p>

<p>The next thing to do is remove any possible mouse bindings on the
title bar that could disrupt its operation, or that could cause some
arbitrary operation to be performed on it.  This also includes bindings
for both the frame and the sides of the window.</p>

<pre class="code">
Mouse 1 SF A -
Mouse 1 T  A -
Mouse 2 SF A -
Mouse 2 T  A -
</pre>


<p>That's just an example.  You ought to do the same for key bindings,
although by default FVWM defines no key bindings other than bringing
up a popup menu.</p>

<p>So what happens once the application starts?  You'll presumably want it
maximised. Read the <a href="../127/adam1.html">FvwmEvent article</a> for
details of this. Essentially, the following could be used:</p>

<pre class="code">
DestroyModuleConfig FE-SM: *
*FE-SM: Cmd Function
*FE-SM: add_window StartFirefoxMaximised

Module FvwmEvent FE-SM
</pre>

<p>That sets up FvwmEvent using a module alias of 'FE-SM'.  It's listening
for the add_window event, and hence will call the
'StartFirefoxMaximised' when any new window is mapped.  As for what
StartFirefoxMaximised looks like:</p>

<pre class="code">
DestroyFunc StartFirefoxMaximised
AddToFunc   StartFirefoxMaximised
+ I ThisWindow (Firefox-bin, !Maximized) Maximize 
</pre>

<p>The function says that if the window mapped matches
"Firefox-bin" as either its window name, class, or resource (class in
this case), and it is not maximised, to maximise it.</p>

<p>And that's it, right?  Pffft, if only.  What if, by some means unknown
to us, the window were un-maximised?  That's not something we probably want
within this kiosk environment, much less allowing the window to be moved
once it has been maximised.  That's OK, since we can restrict this.  You
might think it's a simple case of adding to the style definition we defined
for Firefox earlier:</p>

<pre class="code">
 Style firefox  NoButton 1, NoButton 2, NoButton 4, FixedSize, FixedPosition, !Maximizable
</pre>

<p>But that's not quite true.  What happens here is that the style
preferences are applied before the add_window event is triggered.  Whilst
it is true that "FixedSize" and "FixedPosition" do exactly what we want
(i.e., doesn't allow resizing, or moving the window, or not allowing the
window to become un-maximized, respectively), we have to apply it
afterwards.  This is where the <em>WindowStyle</em> command can be
used.</p>

<p>The WindowStyle command works like Style, except that it pertains to a
specific window currently mapped and visible.  Under the hood, it just
assigns various struct events via the window's WindowId, but that's out of
scope, here.  Hence in the StartFirefoxMaximised function, we can now
expand upon this further:</p>

<pre class="code">
DestroyFunc StartFirefoxMaximised
AddToFunc   StartFirefoxMaximised
+ I ThisWindow (Firefox-bin, !Maximized) Maximize 
+ I ThisWindow WindowStyle FixedSize, FixedPosition, !Maximizable
+ I UpdateStyles
</pre>

<p>I mentioned earlier that you may or may not want any window
decorations.  If that's the case, then you can do the following
to turn them off:</p>

<pre class="code">
Style firefox !Title, !Borders, HandleWidth 0, BorderWidth 0
</pre>

<p>That's a bit better, right?   Well, maybe.  There's still a few other
considerations that should be taken into account.  When a window is
mapped, it is put into a layer (layer 4 by default, which can be changed
using the <em>DefaultLayers</em> command).  This is fine, but means
some windows can cover up this window.  This is unlikely to happen
here, given that it's unlikely you're going to be running any other
application, but, for the theoretical concept alone, it's best to
perhaps put this window into a much higher layer than normal.</p>

<pre class="code">
Style Firefox-bin  NoButton 1, NoButton 2, NoButton 4, Layer 8
</pre>

<p>FVWM (like several other window managers) has virtual desktops.  Wooo.
You aren't going to need them here, so ditch them.  You can do this using
the <em>DesktopSize</em> command, and perhaps the <em>DesktopName</em> 
command , to define how many desks you want.</p>

<pre class="code">
DesktopSize 1x1
DesktopName Main
</pre>

<p>Hence the DesktopSize command restricts us to one page defining a single
desk, whose name is "Main".  I also alluded to earlier ensuring that you
turn off all mouse bindings.  This is also true of the root window that
might bring up any menus.</p>

<pre class="code">
Mouse 1 R A -
Mouse 0 R A -
Mouse 2 R A -
</pre>

<p>Again, it's unlikely to much of an issue, given the application runs in
some sort of full screen mode, but it's better to cover one's bases than
not at all.</p>

<p>There are two more things that need mentioning.  Ensuring that the
Firefox window is the only running instance can be a little tricky.
We could prepend some stuff to the StartFirefoxMaximised function to
try and enforce such a policy.</p>

<pre class="code">
DestroyFunc StartFirefoxMaximised
AddToFunc   StartFirefoxMaximised
+ I ThisWindow (!Firefox-bin) Close
+ I ThisWindow (Firefox-bin, !Maximized, !Transient) Maximize 
+ I TestRc (Match) ThisWindow WindowStyle FixedSize, FixedPosition, !Maximizable
+ I UpdateStyles
</pre>

<p>...although that may or may not be overkill for some purposes.  It might
be the case, of course, that you only want to allow a certain subset of
applications to run.  This would presumably be via Firefox itself
(perhaps some filetypes spawn mplayer or RealPlayer), hence you could 
expand upon StartFirefoxMaximised even more.</p>

<pre class="code">
DestroyFunc StartFirefoxMaximised
AddToFunc   StartFirefoxMaximised
+ I ThisWindow (!"App1|App2|App3|App4") Close
+ I ThisWindow (Firefox-bin, !Maximized) Maximize 
+ I ThisWindow WindowStyle FixedSize, FixedPosition, !Maximizable
+ I UpdateStyles
</pre>

<p>'ThisWindow (!"App1|App2|App3|App4") Close' says something like the
following:  "If the window just created is <em>not</em> one of App1
<em>or</em> App2 <em>or</em> App3 <em>or</em> App4, then close it."  Thus,
in this way, one can conditionally place restrictions.</p>

<p>One final consideration.  How do you ensure that the Firefox window is
never closed?  Well, FVWM has a style consideration "!Closable" that when
applied means the application cannot be closed... almost.  It only goes as
far as trying to circumvent the various events generated.  It does not,
for example, stop xkill closing the application, or for some external
source to do so.</p>

<p>You could use some sort of script to monitor whether the application is
still running (which assumes this script also runs Firefox).</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh
firefox &amp;          
ffpid=$!      

while sleep 60; do
  [ kill -0 $ffpid ] || {
	# Spawn firefox
	firefox &amp;
	break
  }
done
</pre>

<p>But that's far from ideal.  You might be better off using FvwmEvent to
monitor when windows are closed, and to respawn them as apropos.  Hence
adding to the "FE-SM" definition from earlier.</p>

<pre class="code">
*FE-SM: destroy_window CheckWindowClosed 
</pre>

<p>Tells that module alias to now also listen for any windows closing and
take action.  The function CheckWindowClosed might look like
this.</p>

<pre class="code">
DestroyFunc CheckWindowClosed
AddToFunc   CheckWindowClosed
+ I ThisWindow (Firefox-bin) Exec exec firefox
</pre>

<p>That works, right?  Well, yes it does.  But what if there were more
than one instance of Firefox running?  What if we wanted to respawn 
this application only if the last remaining instance of this
application died?  That's no problem:</p>

<pre class="code">
DestroyFunc CheckWindowClosed
AddToFunc   CheckWindowClosed
+ I None (Firefox-bin) Exec exec firefox
</pre>

<p><em>None</em> will only work if there's no instances of the matched 
   window being asked for &mdash; in this case, "Firefox-bin".</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Some may argue that the use of a window manager is in itself
overkill, given that one could easily dispense with using one, and
just start Firefox in fullscreen mode as soon as X11 is logged into.
However, that's potentially disastrous, given that the windows aren't
controlled.   A transient window (such as an open dialogue box)
wouldn't be managed &mdash; if it were opened in an awkward place on the
screen, there's be no way of moving it.  Neither, of course, does not
using a window manager preclude the possibility of closing other
windows (applications) down that don't ultimately belong there.</p>

<p>In short, there is no real solution or easy answer to creating a
true kiosk system.  At best it can simply be managed by enforcing
certain rules specific to its environment.</p>

<p>I used to write the long-running series "The Linux Weekend Mechanic",
which was started by John Fisk (the founder of Linux Gazette) in 1996 and
continued until 1998.  Articles in that format have been intermittent, but
might still continue in the future.  I currently write occasional articles
for LG, whilst doing a few things behind the scenes for it.  I'm also a
member of The Answer Gang.</p>

<p> I was born in Hammersmith (London UK) in 1983.  When I was 13, I moved to
the sleepy, thatched-roofed, village of East Chaldon in the county of Dorset.
It is very near the coast, and Lulworth Cove, which is where I used to work.
Since then I have moved to Southampton, and currently attend University
there, studying for a degree in Software Engineering.</p>

<p> I first got interested in Linux in 1996 having seen a review of it in a
magazine (Slackware 2.0). I was fed up with the instability that the then-new
operating system Win95 had and so I decided to give it a go.
Slackware 2.0 was great. I have been a massive Linux enthusiast ever
since.  I ended up with running SuSE on both my desktop and laptop
computers.  Although I now use Debian as my primary operating system.</p>

<p>I am actively involved with the <a href="http://www.fvwm.org">FVWM</a>
project, writing documentation, providing user-support, writing ad-hoc and
somewhat esoteric patches for it.</p>

<p> Other hobbies include reading. I especially enjoy reading plays (Henrik
Ibsen, Chekhov, George Bernard Shaw), and I also enjoy literature (Edgar Allan
Poe, Charles Dickens, Jane Austen to name but a few).</p>

<p> I am also a keen musician. I play the piano in my spare time.</p>

<p>Some would consider me an arctophile (teddy bear collector).</p>

<P> I listen to a <a href="http://edulinux.homeunix.org/music.rbx">
variety of music</a>.</p>
