I just set up a Kubuntu system with RealPlayer 10.0.8.805, and it
refuses to squack simultaneously with another noisemaker.  It sulks
silently if kaffeine/kscd/kmix is open, and silences them when it's
playing.  It's opening /dev/dsp directly rather than going through the
sound system.
</p>

<p>
The setup wizard says, "Alsa and esound drivers are not included in
this build.  The OSS device used for playback can be set using the
AUDIO environment variable. eg export AUDIO=/dev/dsp2."  But I've used
Real on Kububtu and Gentoo before without this problem.
</p>

<p>
I looked in the dialogs for an output device setting but didn't see
any.  KDE's sound system is usisng the "autodetect" audio device, and
KInfoCenter says, "Installed drivers: type 10 ALSA emulation.  Audio
devices: VIA 8237 (DUPLEX)".
</p>

<p>
gxine and kaffeine will play RealAudio files, but gxine distorts the
sound in an annoying way, and kaffeine crashes so frequently I forget
I'm not on Windows.  (It even hung the system once with gray vertical
bars on the screen.  I haven't seen that on Linux for years.)
</p>

<p>
Interestingly, when KMix is open Reaplayer is silent until I close
KMix and restart the audio clip a few times.  But if RealPlayer is
running and I open KMix from the volume control in the tray, I can
adjust the volume with KMIx's PCM slider.

There is a package called "alsa-oss" which preloads a library that
diverts these "open /dev/dsp" calls. There is probably some way to
enable "alsa-oss-by-default" by fixing the "realplay" startup script,
but in any case you can use the command
<pre>
	aoss realplay &amp;
</pre>
This will start RealPlayer using alsa devices. As long as you don't
close this app it will handle all requests to play the "real" mime
types.

I haven't found a solution to this one (except to not use KMix!).

Hope this helps,
