<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">A higher standard [of security]</h3>

<p> At the RSA2006 Security Conference, both Red Hat's Enterprise Linux 4
and Novell's SUSE LINUX Enterprise Server 9 [on IBM eServers] were cited
for achieving the Controlled Access Protection Profile under the Common
Criteria for Information Security Evaluation, known as CAPP/EAL4+. Sun also
revealed plans to apply for CAPP/EAL4 and also for the Labeled Security
Protection Profile (LSPP). </p>

<p>Rather than release another Trusted Solaris compilation, Sun will
leverage its Solaris 10 OS with the release Solaris Trusted Extensions [a
beta is due in April or May], which enhance the security features of 10 to
EAL4 levels.</p><hr>


<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Scott McNealy to HP's Mark Hurd: Merge HP-UX with Solaris 10?</h3>

<p>In a March 1st memo to HP CEO Mark Hurd [and sent by Sun to the media
and posted on its web site], Sun CEO Scott McNealy said HP should commit to
converging HP-UX with Sun's Solaris 10 Unix. This would allow HP customers
to use X86 servers with Intel's Xeon and AMD's Opteron processors.</p>

<p>HP currently uses Linux and Windows on its industry-standard X86 servers
but has only committed to supporting HP-UX on the 64-bit Itanium
architecture. McNealy pointed out that HP supports 64-bit Solaris 10 on
its Proliant servers.</p>

<p>McNealy called the move of HP-UX to Intel's Itanium system "...an
expensive and risky transition with an uncertain future."</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">DB Wars...</h3>
<p>
Oracle recently bought up its second Open Source DB engine by acquiring
the SleepCat Software and its Berkeley DB barely 3 months after snapping
up InnoDB, the innovative and highly touted transactional engine in MySQL
5. Broad reaction in the MySQL user community was down, dour, and
damning [see links].

<p>
In response, MySQL is closing a deal to purchase Netfrastructure, the
company behind the famed Firebird DB. This means DB guru Jim Starkey,
creater and developer of Interbase and co-creator of Firebird, will become
a MySQL employee. MySQL will continue to support Netfrastructure customers
during a transition period. Prior to this, Oracle held purchase discussions
with MySQL officials. [specifics were not released]

<p>
The Oracle purchase deftly controls key components of MySQL's offerings and
introduces uncertainty about future offerings from MySQL. The InnoDB
transaction engine was important because it is ACID-compliant. Hiring Jim
Starkey means MySQL will probably create a new transaction engine, perhaps
forking from the existing InnoDB source code.

<p>
Rumors abound that Oracle is also considering purchasing JBoss and Zend
Technologies. PHP-developer Zend featured prominently at the Oracle World
mega-conference this fall and Oracle held sessions at the much smaller PHP
Conference, clearly positioning itself as a major DB in the LAMP [or
LA-Or-P] stack. This is consistent with Oracle's pursuit of Linux and LAMP
as a platform independent of its competitors, especially Microsoft.

<p>
MySQL announced on Feb. 27 its hiring of Starkey, and also the hiring of
a new chief technology officer, Taneli Otala, the former CTO of SenSage.

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Coming Soon -- Oracle rootkits??</h3> 

<p>
"It's not about the infrastructure; it's about the data", says a worried Shlomo Kramer, 
CEO of Imperva, a database security company in California, about threats to DBs and data integrity. 
Alexander Kornbrust, of Red Database Security GmbH, is developing rootkit-like technology that uses the 
DB's system functions to mask and manipulate processes and data changes. Worse still, such DB rootkits 
would be OS independent.</p>

<h3>
<img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">AppArmor Now Open-Source</h3>
 
<p>Novell announced the creation of the AppArmor security project early
this year, a new GPL Open Source project dedicated to advancing Linux
application security. AppArmor is an intrusion-prevention system that
protects Linux and applications from viruses and malware. Novell acquired
the technology in 2005 from Immunix, a leading provider of Linux security
solutions.</p>

<p>AppArmor limits the interactions between applications and users by
watching for possible security violations from a tree of allowed
interactions. Unexpected behaviors are blocked. AppArmor builds its
application profiles by working with a system administrator; another
version includes predefined profiles for applications such as Apache,
MySQL, and Postfix and Sendmail email servers.</p>

<p>Novell AppArmor is already being shipped and deployed on SUSE Linux
10.0, Novell's community Linux distribution and its SLES (SUSE Linux
Enterprise Server) 9 Service Pack 3.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Novell - XGL and hardware acceleration</h3>

<p>ZDNET reported that Novell is releasing a new graphics package for its
SUSE Linux distro into the Open Source world. The package makes fuller use
of advanced computer graphics chips to manage desktop windows and the use
of 3D and semi-transparent objects. Based on the widely used OpenGL
libraries, XGL updates the interactions between XWindows software and
modern graphics hardware.</p>

<p> XGL makes better use of video memory for overlaps and screen redraws
and also supports vector graphics, which could replace many of the font
bitmaps used in most Linux distros. The source code was originally released
in January, but Novell is also adding a development framework for graphics
plugins. [The Fedora project has a similar effort underway called AIGLX
for 'Accelerated Indirect GL X'.]</p>

<p> The code and future releases will become part of the X.Org source tree
and thus could be used by any *nix in the future. It will premier in the
next release of SUSE, expected in the early summer. </p>

<h2>Software and Product News</h2>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">JBoss Acquires and Open Sources ArjunaTS Transaction Monitor</h3>

<p>JBoss(R) Inc. has acquired the distributed transaction monitor and web
services technologies owned by Arjuna Technologies and HP and will Open
Source them for the JBoss Enterprise Middleware Suite (JEMS(TM)). This
allows enterprise-quality middleware to be freely available to the mass
market. </p>

<p>The acquisition includes Arjuna Transaction Service Suite (ArjunaTS),
one of the most advanced and widely deployed transaction engines in the
world with a 20-year pedigree, and Arjuna's Web Services Transaction
implementation, the market's only implementation supporting both leading
web services specifications -- Web Services Transaction (WS-TX) and Web
Services Composite Application Framework (WS-CAF). This implementation is
also one of the few that has demonstrated interoperability with other
industry leaders such as Microsoft and IBM. The core Arjuna transaction
engine will be the foundation of JBoss Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).</p>

<p>As a co-author of the WS-TX and WS-CAF specifications, Arjuna has
developed an industrial-strength web services implementation that uniquely
supports both specs. In the web services area, a line is being drawn
between the specifications, with WS-TX supported by companies like Arjuna,
Microsoft, and IBM and WS-CAF supported by Arjuna, Oracle, and Sun among
others. With Arjuna's Web Services Transaction implementation as a core
product, JEMS bridges the gap between these two camps and remains
platform-independent.</p>

<p> JBoss expects to release ArjunaTS and Arjuna's Web Services Transaction
implementation as open source JEMS offerings in Q1 2006 backed by JBoss
Subscription services, training, and consulting. Like all JEMS products,
these offerings will run independently as free-standing products or on any
J2EE application server. For more information, visit <a

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif"> IBM Readies 9-way compiler for SPS-3</h3>

<p>IBM is readying a special compiler for the new Cell Broadband Engine
chip in the forthcoming Sony Play Station 3. That chip has a 64-bit PPC
core and 8 additional synergistic processor elements, or SPEs, for real
time processing of gameplay. Each SPE has 256 KB of local cache and can
read data into a 128-bit register, for single instruction, multiple data
tasks.</p>

<p>The Cell BE chip was developed in partnership with Sony and Toshiba
and is well adapted to running immersive simulations and also in scientific
and signal processing applications. IBM is offering the Cell as a
processor option on its BladeCenter H chassis later this year. </p>

<p>The Cell compiler currently runs on Fedora Linux installations on 64-bit
x86 computers. Porting Linux to Cell based computers is an unconfirmed
option.</p>

<p>The Cell BE compiler implements SPE-specific optimizations, including
support for compiler-assisted memory realignment, branch prediction, and
instruction fetching. It addresses fine-grained SIMD parallelization as
well as the more general OpenMP task-level parallelization. The goal is to
provide near super-computer performance in commercial and consumer
computers.</p>


<p>A report on the compiler and benchmarking the Cell is at this link : <a

<h2>Magical Realism... (non-Linux news of general interest)</h2>

<h3>
<img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Quantum Computation is... no computation?</h3>
[from: <a href="http://www.physorg.com/news11087.html">www.physorg.com/</a>] 

<p>By combining quantum computation and quantum interrogation, scientists
at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have found an exotic way
of determining an answer to an algorithm... without ever running the
algorithm.  </p>

<p>Using an optical-based quantum computer, a research team led by
physicist Paul Kwiat has presented the first demonstration of
"counterfactual computation," inferring information about an answer, even
though the computer did not run. The researchers reported their work in the
Feb. 23 issue of Nature.  </p>

<p>Quantum computers have the potential for solving certain types of
problems much faster than classical computers.  Speed and efficiency are
gained because quantum bits can be placed in superpositions of one and
zero, as opposed to classical bits, which are either one or zero. Moreover,
the logic behind the coherent nature of quantum information processing
often deviates from intuitive reasoning, leading to some surprising
effects.  </p>

<p>"It seems absolutely bizarre that counterfactual computation - using
information that is counter to what must have actually happened - could
find an answer without running the entire quantum computer," said Kwiat, a
John Bardeen Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Physics
at Illinois. "But the nature of quantum interrogation makes this amazing
feat possible." </p>

<p>"In a sense, it is the possibility that the algorithm could run which
prevents the algorithm from running," Kwiat said. "That is at the heart of
quantum interrogation schemes, and to my mind, quantum mechanics doesn't
get any more mysterious than this."</p>

<img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Paul G. Allen Launches PDPplanet.com Site</h3>

<p>Investor, philanthropist and co-founder of Microsoft Paul G. Allen
unveiled a new Web site, <a href="http://www.PDPplanet.com">www.PDPplanet.com</a>,
as a resource for computer history fans and those interested in Digital
Equipment Corporation (DEC) systems and XKL systems. From a PDP-8/S to a
DECSYSTEM-20 to a Toad 1, Allen's collection of systems from the late 1960s
to the mid-1990s preserves the significant software created on these early
computers.</p>

<p>Via the new Web site, registered users from around the world can telnet
into a working DECsystem-10 or an XKL Toad-1, create or upload programs,
and run them -- essentially stepping back in time to access an "antique"
mainframe, and getting a sense of how it felt to be an early programmer.
</p>

<p>Along with Allen's Microcomputer Gallery being at the New Mexico Museum
of Natural History and Science in Albuquerque (opening later this year),
and the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, PDP Planet
provides an important exploration of early computer technology. </p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Bounty on MS Windows critical flaws</h3>

<p>Its MS bug season! IDefense has offered a bounty of $10,000 for
uncovering major Windows flaws, but only if MS will identify them as
critical. Previously, TippingPoint offered bug 'bonuses' of $1,000-20,000
as part of its Zero Day Initiative [<a
href="http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/benefits.html">http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/benefits.html</a>].
</p>

<p>In an email made public, MS was critical of offering any compensation
for efforts now undertaken by computer security companies. "Microsoft
believes that responsible disclosure, which involves making sure that an
update is available from software vendors the same day the vulnerability is
first broadly known, is the best way to protect the end user."</p>

<p> NetworkAnatomy, a Northern California wireless communications company,
has taken the lead, on-line, in providing a low-cost [USD$175] reality
engineering education series via its monthly OnLine-CTO emagazine. The goal
is to overcome the lack of practical WiMax training in the US, where very
few WiMax projects have been initiated and there is only a small pool of
experienced engineers.</p> 

<p> NetworkAnatomy's effort offers "how to" installments, with reference
material and skill tests.  Click the blinking "New Service -- OnLine-CTO",
at the <a href="http://www.networkanatomy.com">www.networkanatomy.com</a>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">I, Robot....</h3>

<p>Robotics Trends and IDG World Expo announced in January that Carnegie
Mellon University's Robot Hall of Fame will hold its 2006 induction
ceremony at the 3rd annual RoboBusiness Conference and Exposition, the
international business development event for mobile robotics and
intelligent systems.</p> 

<p>The conference and exposition will be held in Pittsburgh, PA on June
20-21, 2006.  The event website is <a
href="http://www.robobusiness2006.com">http://www.robobusiness2006.com</a></p>

<p>According to Dan Kara, conference chairman and President of Robotics
Trends, Inc., "We are extremely pleased to announce that the 2006 Robot
Hall of Fame induction ceremony will be part of the RoboBusiness Conference
and Exposition. The Robot Hall of Fame induction adds a great deal of
excitement, energy, prestige and glamour to the RoboBusiness event. Past
inductees to the Robot Hall of Fame include some of the most significant
and well known robots in the world including Honda's Asimo, NASA's Mars
Pathfinder and Unimate, the first industrial robot arm that worked on the
assembly line. The Robot Hall of Fame jurors are an equally distinguished
collection of international scholars, researchers, writers, and designers
including Gordon Bell, Arthur C. Clarke, Steve Wozniak, Rodney Brooks and
others. With the addition of the Robot Hall of Fame induction ceremony, the
RoboBusiness event becomes even more impactful, and certainly more
entertaining." </p>
