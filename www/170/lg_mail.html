<p>
Hello everyone!
</p>

<p>
Im looking for a multi-process CPU benchmark to be run on linux (CLI
is even better), as I need to test how well a kerrighed cluster is
running. Anyone know of any of those programs?
</p>

<p>
Thanks
Deividson

<p>
Hello gurus,
</p>

<p>
I run a diskless, keyboard-less pc that boots into X11 (just plain twm 
as a window manager). The X clients I run remotedly, on a "database 
server". When someone switches off the Xserver PC (i.e. flips that big 
red switch), the X clients aren't killed - they remain on the "database 
server" forever (or at least 24 hours, that's for me the same as 
"forever"). Is there something that I could to to force them to die 
automa[t|g]ically?
</p>

<p>
Thanks in advance,
Petr
</p>

<p>

Hello TAG:
</p>

<p>
I know there are some 'hevea' users here. Could  you help ?
I am trying to convert this TeX article of mine into HTML and I run into:
</p>

<pre>
Giving up command: \text
Giving up command: \@hevea@circ
./octave-p2.tex:227: Error while reading LaTeX:
       End of file in \mbox argument
Adios
</pre>

<p>
The relevant lines in my LaTex file are:
</p>

<pre>
226 \begin{align*}
227         Minimize        f(x) = c^\text{T}x \\
228         s.t.    Ax = b, x \geq 0 \\
229         where           b \geq 0
230 \end{align*}
</pre>


<p>
What could be the problem ? I am using version 1.10 from Ubuntu repository.
</p>

<p>
Thanks a lot!
</p>

<p>
Best Regards,
Amit

<h3>Ubuntu boot problems</h3>

<p>
Earlier today, I had a problem with my almost-brand-new Ubuntu 9.10
install: my netbook suddenly stopped booting. Going into "rescue" mode
showed that it was failing to mount the root device - to be precise, it
couldn't mount /dev/disk/by-uuid/cd4efbe9-9731-40a5-9878-06deff19af06
(normally, a link to "/dev/sda1") on '/'. When the system finally timed
out and dropped me into the "initramfs" environment/prompt, I did an
"ls" of /dev/disk/by-uuid - which showed that the link didn't exist.
Yoiks... had my hard drive failed???
</p>

<p>
I was quickly comforted by the existence of another device in there, one
that pointed to /dev/sda5, a swap partition on the same drive, but that
could still have meant damage to the partition table. I tried a few
things, none of which worked (i.e., rebooting the system would always
bring me back to the same point)... until I decided to create the
appropriate symlink in the above directory - i.e.,
</p>

<pre>
cd /dev/disk/by-uuid
ln -s ../../sda1 cd4efbe9-9731-40a5-9878-06deff19af06
</pre>

<p>
and exit "initramfs". The system locked up when it tried to boot
further, but when I rebooted, it gave me a login console; I remounted
'/' as 'read/write', then ran "dpkg-reconfigure -plow ubuntu-desktop",
the "one-size-fits-all" solution for Ubuntu "GUI fails to start"
problems, and the problem was over.
</p>

<p>
NOW, Cometh The REALLY Big Problem.
</p>

<p>
1) What would cause a device in /dev/disk/by-uuid to disappear? Frankly,
the fact that it did scares the bejeebers out of me. That <em>shouldn't</em>
happen randomly - and the only system-related stuff that I did this
morning was installing a few packages (several flavors of window manager
so I could experiment with the Ubuntu WM switcher.) I had also rebooted
the system a number of times this morning (shutting it down so I could
take it off the boat and to my favorite coffee shop, etc.) so I knew
that it was fine up until then.
</p>

<p>
2) Why in the hell did changing anything in the "initramfs" environment
- i.e., creating that symlink - actually affect anything? Isn't
"initramfs", as indicated by the 'ram' part, purely temporary?
</p>

<p>
3) What would be an actual solution to this kind of thing? My approach
was based on knowing about the boot process, etc., but it was part
guesswork, part magical hand-waving, and a huge amount of luck. I
<em>still</em> don't know what really happened, or what actually fixed the
problem.
</p>

<p>
I'd be grateful for any insights offered.
</p>

<h3>Industrial PC booting issues</h3>

<p>
Allmighty TAG!
</p>

<p>
first, sorry for a longish post. I'm almost at my wit's end.
</p>

<p>
I have an industrial PC, equipped with a touch screen and "VIA Nehemiah"
CPU (that behaves like i386). The PC has no fan, no keyboard, no 
harddisk, nor flash drive - only ethernet card. It boots via PXE from my 
database server. The /proc/meminfo on the PC says, that the PC has 
MemTotal: 452060 kB. I'm booting the "thinstation" 
(<a href='http://thinstation.sourceforge.net'>http://thinstation.sourceforge.net</a>) with kernel 2.6.21.1. The PC uses 
ramdisk. I boot Xorg with twm window manager. Then I start client of the 
"Opera" browser on my database server and "-display" it on the X server 
on the PC. This setup has worked flawlessly for a couple of months.
</p>

<p>
Then my end-users came with complains, that the PC doesn't boot anymore
after flipping the mains switch. For the moment, I have found following:
</p>

<p>
1. The PC sometimes doesn't boot at all. The boot process stops with
the message:
</p>

<pre>
   Uncompressing linux... OK, booting the kernel.
</pre>

<p>
...and that's all. Usually, when I switch the PC again off and on, it 
boots OK, I mean I don't change anything, just flip that big button.
</p>

<p>
2. When it really <strong>does</strong> boot all the way into X, the opera browser 
isn't able to start properly. I tried to investigate further the matter. 
I modified the setup, now I'm booting only into X+twm. This works.
</p>

<p>
Now I tried to run following test on my database server:
</p>

<pre>
    xlogo -display &lt;ip_address_of_the_pc&gt;:0
</pre>

<p>
This works, the X logo is displayed on the screen of the PC.
</p>

<p>
Now I tried this test on the database server:
</p>

<pre>
    xterm -display &lt;ip_address_of_the_pc&gt;:0
</pre>

<p>
Result is this error message on the client side (i.e. on the database 
server):
</p>

<pre>
   xterm:  fatal IO error 104 (Connection reset by peer) or KillClient 
on X server "192.168.100.171:0.0"
</pre>

<p>
...and the X server on the PC is really killed (I can't find him anymore 
in the process list on the PC).
</p>

<p>
This is, what I have found in the /var/log/boot.log on the PC:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
------------ /var/log/boot.log starts here ----------------------------
X connection to :0.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).
/etc/init.d/twm: /etc/init.d/twm: 184: xwChoice: not found
twm_startup
twm:  unable to open display ":0.0"
------------ /var/log/boot.log ends here ------------------------------
</pre>

<p>
...and this is from /var/log/messages on the PC:
