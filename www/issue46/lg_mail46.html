<P> I just installed  Postfix  on Suse 6.1. It seems a much easier mailer to
install than any of the others I've read about in your recent issues (which
were great btw). There is an active newsgroup and the author of the program
responds VERY fast to stupid newbie questions. I speak from experience : )
From debian newsgroup postings it appears that Postfix is going to become their
standard. Check it out, I'd love to see an article on it since I'm trying to
move beyond the newbie stage and really understand this whole mail business.

<BR>Subject: VPN and Firewall with Linux

<P> Hi,

<P> We are considering investing in a firewall and VPN for our network at
work (a 3rd world aid organisation). We haven't deemed it necessary
until now when we will upgrade to Novell Netware 5 which is mainly
TCP/IP-based.
We have funds for investing in Novell BorderManager as well.

<P> However, we have been talking about having our own DNS server as well
as firewall. Also we would like to be able to connect our offices
around the world to the network by VPN. BorderManager has all these
facilities but for a price. Is there some comprehensive Linux source
(written, on-line, software) about these issues. Even a list of HOWTOs
would be OK.

<P> TIA,<BR>
Martin Sj&ouml;debrand

I am having a problem with my printer HP 693C.
I can print, but on every line of copy(words)after the

this is a linux driver problem.I am using the 550 C driver.
I am using Caldera 2.2 I used the graphical interface to

Any thoughts,guesses or ideas as to where to go

<BR>Subject: Help: printing problem.

<P> Hi,

<P> I'm having trouble getting a Solaris box to print on my Linux print
server. The Linux box has a printer set up that prints to a Netware
network printer. This works, I can print from Netscape, Star Office,
etc. I've set up a network printer on a Solaris 7 machine that prints to
this machine. This also works, for text files. But when I try to print a
page from Netscape, nothing happens, and the following appears in my
messages file (maas is my Linux machine with the Netware printer,
amazone.xpuntx.nl is the Solaris machine):

<PRE>
Sep  3 12:55:18 maas lpd[9788]: amazone.xpuntx.nl requests recvjob lp
Sep  3 12:55:18 maas lpd[9788]: tfA001amazone.xpuntx.nl: File exists

Sep  3 12:55:18 maas lpd[9789]: tfA001amazone.xpuntx.nl: File exists
</PRE>

<P> This repeats itself every minute. I checked, and the
tfA001amazone.xpuntx.nl file really does not exist anywhere on my
system. There is a cfA001amazone.xpuntx.nl file in /var/spool/lpd/lp
however, and if I remove this file the next time around it says this in
the messages file:

<PRE>
Sep  3 13:00:27 maas lpd[9854]: amazone.xpuntx.nl requests recvjob lp
Sep  3 13:00:27 maas lpd[9855]: amazone.xpuntx.nl requests recvjob lp
Sep  3 13:00:27 maas lpd[9855]: readfile: : illegal path name: File
exists
</PRE>

<P> This happens once. The next minute the four lines I gave earlier
reappear, and the cfA001amazone.xpuntx.nl file has reappeared.

<P> I hope someone can help me out here, this has got me stumped! Thanks in
advance for anyone who can shed some light...

<BR>Subject: 2gig file size limit?


<P> Greetings,<BR>
I have a box on my network running RedHat 6.0 (x86) that is going to be
used primarily for backing up large database files. These files are
presently 25 gigs in size. While attempting a backup over Samba, I
realized that the file system would not allow me to write a file &gt; 2gig to
disk. I tried using an large file system patch for kernel 2.2.9, but that
only allowed me to write 16 gigs, and it seemed buggy when it was doing
that even. Doing an 'ls -l' would show me that the file size of the backup
was about 4 gig, but the total blocks in the directory with no other files
there indicated a much higher number like so:

<PRE>
[root@backup ]# ls -l
total 16909071
-rwxr--r--   1 ntuser   ntuser   4294967295 Sep  2 19:45 file.DAT
</PRE>

<P> I am well aware that a 64 bit system would be the best solution at this
point, but unfortunately i do not have those resources. I know BSDi can
write files this big, as well as NT on 32 bit systems.. i am left
wondering, why can't linux?

<P> Thanks in advance.<BR>

<BR>Subject: Re: hello

<P> I was looking into CS software for linux, And one of the tools i was
looking into was software to graph the internet its etc map out the
registerd users on the arpnet.
I was woundering if u happend to have any infomation in any of your
magazines on this topic

<P> <STRONG>The <I>Linux Gazette</I> Editor wrote:</STRONG>

<P> No, I don't know of any such software.

<P> What is it you wish to do?  Find out who is on each computer?  
The Internet doesn't really have a concept of "registered user", because
the concept of "What is a user?" was never defined Internet-wide.  

<P> In any case, you'd have to poll every box to find out what it thinks its
current user is.  But this identity has no real meaning outside the local
network.  For Windoze boxes it may be totally meaningless, because users
can set it to anything they want.  And how would you even find the boxes
in the first place?  Do a random poll of an IP range?  That sounds like
Evil marketoid or cracking activity.  In any case, if the machines are
behind dynamic IPs, as is common with ISPs nowadays, there's no guarantee
you'll ever be able to find a certain machine again even if you did find
it once.


<P> <STRONG>Manuel replied:</STRONG>

<P> i was thinking of just pinging all the registerd users at some DNS
databases over a period of time.  And using some software to create a graphical
user interface for it, or such.

<P> <STRONG>The <I>Linux Gazette</I> Editor asked:</STRONG>

<P> Are you talking about a network analyzing program like those products that
show an icon in red or page the system administrator if a computer goes down?

<P> I assume by "user" you mean a particular machine rather than a user-person,
since the DNS doesn't track the latter.

<P> <STRONG>Manuel replied:</STRONG>

<P> hehe sorry for the confusion what i was trying to pass on what the notion
of a software that allows u to track out all the registed Boxes on the internet
and graph them into a nice graphical picture. so it looks something like this

<BR>Subject: Freedom from UCITA:  Free Software


<P>   In response to Ed Foster's many recent gripes about the UCITA and
  the risks associated with some proprietary software licensing.

<P>   I'm sure he's heard it before but Freedom from the threat of
  UCITA is only as far away as your local free software mirror site
  (FTP and/or web based).  Linux, FreeBSD (and its brethren) have 
  licenses without any such traps(*).  

<P> 	* (I've appended a brief note on the two most common
           software licenses to forestall any argument that
           they DO contain "such traps.")

<P>   If the quality of Linux and other free software didn't speak
  for itself, the UCITA would be an incentive for its adoption.

<P>   It's as though the major commercial software publishers are in
  their death throes and intent on getting in one last bite, kick 
  or scratch at their customers.

<P>   I'm not saying that free software and the open source movement
  is poised to wipe out proprietary software.  For most free
  software enthusiasts the intent is to provide alternatives.

<P>   Ironically it seems as though the major proprietary software
  interests will obliterate themselves.  The UCITA that they
  propose may pass and become the fulfillment of some modern
  Greek tragedy.

<P>   I just hope that free software enthusiasts can provide the
  improvements and new, free products that may become unavailable 
  if the commercial software industry annihilates itself.

<P>   There's much work to be done.
  
 
<P>   -----------------------  Appendix -----------------------------

<P>   Some software is distributed in binary form free of charge.  Some
  proprietary software is distributed with the source code
  available, but encumbered by a license that limits the production
  of "derivative works."  Those are not commonly referred to as
  "free software" or "open source" by computing professionals and 
  technical enthusiasts.

<P>   However, "free software with open source" permits free use and
  distribution and includes source code and a license/copyright
  that specifically permits the creation and distribution of
  "derivative works" without imposition of licensing fees,
  royalties, etc.

<P>   That, of course is a simplification.  There are extensive debates
  on USENet and other technical fora about the exact nature and
  definition of the terms "free software" and "open source."

<P>   However, that is the gist of it.

<P>   There are two major license groups for "free/open source"
  software: BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) and GPL (GNU Public 
  License).  

<P>   The BSD license was created by the Regents of the University of
  California at Berkeley.  It was orginally applied to a set of
  patches and software utilities to UNIX (which was then owned by
  AT&amp;T).  Since then the BSD license has been applied to many
  software packages by many people and organizations that are wholly 
  unconnected to UC Berkeley.  It is the license under which Apache, 
  and FreeBSD are available.

<P>   The BSD license permits derivative works, even closed source
  commercial and proprietary ones.  Its principle requirements are
  the inclusion of a copyright notice and a set of disclaimers
  (disclaiming warranty and endorsement by the original authors of
  the software).  Many advocates consider it to be the "free-est"
  license short of complete and utter abandonment (true public
  domain). 

<P>   The GPL is somewhat more complicated.  It was created by the
  Free Software Foundation (FSF), which was founded by Richard
  M. Stallman (a software visionary with a religous fervor and a
  following to match).  

<P>   The terms of the GPL which cause misunderstandings and debate
  revolve around a requirement that "derivative works" be
  available under the same licensing terms as their "source"
  (progenitors?).

<P>   This is referred to as the "viral nature" of the GPL.

<P>   Conceptually if I "merge" the sources to two programs, one which
  was under the GPL and another which was "mine" then I'm required
  to release the sources to my software when I release/distribute
  the derivative.

<P>   That's the part that causes controversy.  It's often played up as
  some sort of "trap" into which unwary software developers will
  be pulled.

<P>   One misconception is that I have to release my work when I use
  GPL software.  That's absurd, pure FUD!  I can use GNU EMACS (a
  GPL editor) and gcc (a popular GPL compiler) to write any
  software I like.  I can release that software under any license
  I like.  The use of the tools to create a package doesn't make
  it a "derivative work."  Another more subtle misconception is
  that I'd be forced to release the sources to any little patch
  that I made to a package.  If I make a patch, or a complex
  derived work, but only use it within my own organization, then
  I'm not required to release it.  The license only requires
  the release of sources if I choose to "DISTRIBUTE" my
  derivative.

<P>   One last misconception.  I don't have to distribute my GPL
  software free of charge.  I can charge whatever I like for it.
  The GPL merely means that I can't prevent others from
  distributing it for free, that I must release the sources and
  that I must allow further derivation.

<P>   The FSF has developed an extensive suite of tools. Their GNU
  project intends to create a completely "free" operating system.
  They provided the core "tool chain" that allowed Linus Torvalds
  and his collaborators to develop Linux.  That suite is released
  under the GPL.  Many other software packages by many other authors
  are also released under the GPL.  

<P>   Indeed, although the Linux kernel is not a "derived work" and
  its developers are unaffiliated with the FSF (as a group) it is
  licensed under the GPL.

<P>   There are a number of derivative and variations of these
  licenses.  Some of them may contain subtle problems and
  conflicts.   However, the intent of the authors is generally
  clear.   Even with the worst problems in "free" and "open
  source" software licenses, there is far less risk to consumers
  who use that software than there is from any software released
  under proprietary licenses that might be enforced via the
  UCITA.

<P> With great interest I got into and perused Linux Gazette. Any new stuff
beyond April 1997? and if so where is it.

<BR>Subject: Encyclopaedia Galactica != Foundation


<P> Re: September 99 Linux Gazzette, Linux Homour piece -

<P> Liked the operating
systems airlines joke, but surely the footnote about the Encyclopaedia
Galactica is in error? The only EC I know is the competitor work to the Hitch
Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy in Douglas Adams' novels, radio and TV shows, and
coputer games.

<P> Cheers.

<BR>Subject: Linux Gazette Archives CDROM

<P> I just wondered if there was, or if not has there ever been, any thought
to publishing a Linux Gazette Archives CDROM.

<P> Thank you for a great publication.
