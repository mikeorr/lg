<p>
The reason UUIDs do not help has nothing to do with Linus' article: this
is not a kernel vs. userland issue.
</p>

<p>
This is a kernel vs. BIOS device numbering issue. UUIDs don't help here
because GRUB doesn't interpret them. In fact it cannot even read them
because they're in the menu.lst file which grub cannot find in the first
place. Catch-22, anyone?
</p>

<p>
In fact you need to go grub's command line on the bare metal (i.e. after
installing it on a floppy), not from Linux. Otherwise there's no point.
Your article should mention that.

Some comments -
</p>

<p>
Section 8 - Configure your LAN machines
</p>

<p>
Use dhcp instead of trying to configure each machine individually.
</p>

<p>
Section 11 BIND DNS Server
</p>

<p>
another option is to use pdnsd as a caching nameserver.
</p>

<p>
Section 13 Samba file sharing
</p>

<p>
If you are only using linux boxes, you can also share using nfs.
Caveats:  it takes long time to mount large directories.
</p>

<p>
Section 14 TorrentFlux
</p>

<p>
Nice tip!
</p>

<p>
Thanks

Hi,
</p>

<p>
How would this be possible in computers running on leased IP addresses
via DHCP ?
</p>

<p>
Section 3 Secure Shell
</p>

<p>
. . . . . .
. . . . . .
</p>

<p>
The simplest way to do this is to go to each computer and copy these
files to a USB stick:
</p>

<pre>
   cp /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub /media/usb/&lt;ip_addr&gt;.rsa.pub
   cp /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.pub /media/usb/&lt;ip_addr&gt;.dsa.pub
</pre>
. . . . . .
</p>

<p>
/Ram

I just need to figure out which is easier:
</p>

<p>
- modifying a Live CD/DVD installation -- probably not the easiest to
change on the fly
or
- get a big enough flash drive to hold a reasonalbly functional
installation

To pick a nit..."Mozilla Firefox use up, 3.7% in 4 months in Europe" is
incorrect.  FF use was up 3.7 [percentage] <strong>points</strong>, not 3.7 percent.
The text under the headline gets this right when referring to a ~7 point
gain in the past year.

Entertaining and informative article, Rick, as always.  I hope I can
consider some of my recent floundering with whois and
linuxmafia.{com,net} as partial inspiration.
</p>

<p>
However, getting down to the picture at the .sig block, shouldn't you
be doing more long distance bicycling?  I always pictured you as one
of those ca. 150 lb., wiry joggers gorging yourself on tofu.  Instead,
the picture shows you're either a sumo wrestler, a linebacker (a geek
linebacker?!?), or you need to avoid burger joints more often.  Oh,
and that perl book behind you is pink.  Doesn't that need an upgrade?
</p>

<p>
My perl books are pink too, and they suit me just fine (damnit).  Sorry
for the crack about the picture.  I'd just prefer that folks like you
outlive me (I'm a selfish that way).
</p>


<p>
P.S. Ben, looks like we need to fiddle with pinehelper.pl again.  It's
     ignoring the bit in parens in the subject line, making "Subject:
     Talkback".  Crap.
</p>

<p>
     My version of your pinehelper.pl attached.  This is pinehelper.pl
     called by FF 2.0.0.4 (Debian stable/Etch Iceweasel), fwiw.
</p>

<p>
     I've also just installed flashplayer-mozilla, which appears to
     handle swf better than swf-player, so maybe I can actually read
     the cartoons this time.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">

&gt; I'm emailing about the following article:
&gt; <a href="../116/okopnik1.html">http://linuxgazette.net/116/okopnik1.html</a>
&gt; I'd like to know, for what version of knoppix is this (i tried with
&gt; 5.1, it didn't work), and then also where you could get an old version
&gt; (I've searched for Knoppix 3.8 which was the latest version of knoppix
&gt; at the time but I can't find a download anywhere).
</pre>

<p>
Well, that's exactly the problem. Shortly after I wrote that article,
the Knoppix folks stopped using the "boot.img" method and switched to
using "isolinux". If you can get hold of 3.3 - the version that I used -
it should work fine. Otherwise, well, the kernel is just too big -
period.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; If this fails, would it be possible that the script could be rewritten
&gt; for knoppix 5.1 or that I could be sent the image to be written onto
&gt; floppy?
</pre>

<p>
It's not a question of the script; the problem is that the kernel itself
- even before you add any modules, libs, etc. - is just too big to fit
into a boot.img image (1.44MB). That pretty well shuts off the
possibility.
</p>

<p>
You could approach it the other way, though: try downloading Puppy
Linux, or Damn Small Linux. Either of those should fit on a flash drive
just fine - and Puppy Linux definitely had a "boot from a flash drive"
description on their site the last time I looked.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; PS. I tried emailing the tag email address which didn't work.
</pre>

<p>
I assume you got it from some old resource. Try
tag@lists.linuxgazette.net - we've been using that one since May 2005 or
so.

<p>
Hi, I wonder if you'd like to put this in Talkback or 2-Cent Tips in the
next issue:
</p>


<p>
Since writing the article, I found a couple of minor problems.
</p>

<p>
One was that the sound sometimes fails in such a way that is not
detectable by the NSLU2 (for example the speaker is not connected
properly), and to mitigate the possible consequences of this, I set my
NSLU2 to start playing a recognisible tune using its internal speaker if
an important alarm is not acknowledged.  I wrote a script that can
convert any MIDI file into commands for Johnathan Nightingale's "beep"
utility (which is available in the "beep" package on the NSLU2 Debian
distribution), and my "MIDI to beep" script is available at
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://people.pwf.cam.ac.uk/ssb22/mwrhome/midi-beeper.html">http://people.pwf.cam.ac.uk/ssb22/mwrhome/midi-beeper.html</a>
</p>

<p>
The other is that the NSLU2 may sometimes hang if the USB connection to
its primary disk is somehow jolted; use of its built-in hardware
watchtog helps, but it's best if the watchdog is used in such a way that
a disk hang will be noticed by the watchdog (which might not happen if
the process that's writing to /dev/watchdog is constantly in RAM), so
rather than running a watchdog program I decided to do it in root's
crontab:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
* * * * * echo &gt;/dev/watchdog;sleep 20;echo &gt;/dev/watchdog;sleep 20;echo &gt;/dev/watchdog
</pre>
i.e. write to /dev/watchdog 3 times a minute (the system will reboot if
it's not written to for a whole minute).  Doing it this way rather than
in a self-conained process should result in a watchdog failure if the
primary disk gets pulled out (resulting in it being unmounted) because
bin/sleep will become unavailable.  This is so even though it will
normally be cached in RAM and incur little or no disk activity.  The
cron job is quite lightweight, since the code for "bash" can be shared
with any other bash scripts that are running at the same time and
therefore should not take up much of its own memory.
</p>

<p>

I have gone through this article regarding plotting the data-labels in R. I
found quite helpful functions but didn't find what i required. I have
already plotted two matrices against one another and wish to label them I
want to label the data-points plotted on the scatter-plots. Can you tell me

&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Okopnik,
&gt; 
&gt; An article of yours from the April 2000 Linux Gazette may have just
&gt; saved me from hours of beating my head against my desk. Granted, I'd
&gt; already spent about 12 hours beating my head against my desk, so
&gt; further damage (if possible) has been averted.
</pre>

<p>
Heh. I've left the imprint of my forehead on at least a few brick walls,
so - yes, that sounds like a positive effect.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; See, I was doing some basic security changes on several hundred
&gt; systems. My Expect powers are not yet strong enough to automate this
&gt; task, but that's an aside. I've spent the last several days running
&gt; find commands with various -exec, and as it turns out, I managed to
&gt; annhiliate a RHEL4 Selinux system with the following:
&gt; 
&gt; find / -user root -perm -o+w -exec chmod 0600 '{}' \;
&gt; # I forgot "-type f" eek!
</pre>

<p>
('-type f' wouldn't have helped much, I'm afraid. It would have stopped
you from messing up, say, the entries in '/dev' - but that's about it.)
</p>

<p>
Ouch! You've "discovered" (and I use that in the most sympathetic way
possible) the power of the 'find' command. It's very similar to a
Milwaukee "Hole Hawg" drill: it <strong>will</strong> drill any hole you want it to -
whether it's through concrete, steel, or your leg...
</p>

<p>
(See this love paean to a Super Hawg:
<a href="http://www99.epinions.com/content_246549155460">http://www99.epinions.com/content_246549155460</a>)
</p>

<p>
Unix tools are kinda like that. Huge amounts of power - and the safety
is assumed to come from experience and forethought. Experience, however,
is what you get when you didn't have enough experience and forethought!
</p>


<pre>
&gt; For hours afterwards, nothing would execute even when I restored
&gt; execute permissions (on binaries only) from a Rescue CD. Your article
&gt; pointed out the need for +x on some (if not all) shared libs, and that
&gt; allowed me to rescue the machine.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you. Thank you. I owe you one, two, or ten beers.
</pre>

<p>
[smile] Thanks, Garrett. I probably shouldn't say this - it's likely to
lose me a beer or two - but if I was in your place, I'd actually
reinstall the system from scratch; at the very least, I'd run a
comparison of everything in '{,/usr}{/bin,/sbin,/lib}/' against a
"normal" system. Given that you now have an uncertain set of
permissions, all sorts of security vulnerabilities and possible future
problems seem likely. The fact that your system works now gives you some
breathing room time-wise - but I wouldn't call it a closed case.
