 to find documentation on how to setup a firewall. 
</ol>


<h3>
<a NAME="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
The Ricochet modems are wireless modems that let you connect your computer
to the internet through an ISP provider that is hooked up to the
wireless network. It is only available in 
<a href="http://www.ricochet.com/about_us/coverage_maps/index.html">certain areas</a>. 
<p>
None of the ISPs support Linux. They officially only support crappy
horrible operating systems are not good for a technical person or
a real programmer. Naturally, Linux, FreeBSD, and other good quality
operating systems are ignored. It makes sense from profit point of view. 
Call the ISPs and let me know you want them to support real operating systems. 
<p>
The modems will connect at 80 Kbps with a serial port and 128 Kbps for a USB
connection. I only use the serial port connection, for now, and it seems
faster and more stable compared to a normal dial-up over the phone. Sometimes
it crawls, but overall, I am very happy with the modem. 


<h3>
<a NAME="getting"></a>Getting Ricochet</h3>
None of the ISPs support Linux. <a href="http://www.wwc.com">Wireless Web Connect</a>
seems to be more liberal, so I choose them. All the other service providers
seemed to have staff that had no clue what Linux was and they had a big
corporate feel, which I usually try to avoid. I bought my modem through
the service provider for around $100, which apparently was a special price, 
but I have noticed that special prices tend to become the normal prices
over time in the ISP market. 


<h3>
<a NAME="install"></a>Installing the Ricochet modem</h3>
Installing the modem was really easy after I found the right webpage. 
<a href="http://phobos.illtel.denver.co.us/~abelits/metricom/">Metricom modems support in Linux</a>.
<p>
It was this simple on a RedHat 6.2 system (when am I going to switch to Debian for good?),
<ol>
<li> Start the control panel with the command "control-panel" in Xwindows.
<li> Click on the Network Configurator.
<li> Click on the "Interfaces" button. 
<li> Click "Add".
<li>  Choose the PPP option and continue.
<li> Type in "3333" for the phone number, and the username and password. Select
   the PAP option. 
<li> After you have added the ppp interface, click on the interface, click
  on the Edit button and type in "noipdefault" where it says "PPP Options". 
  Then click on "Done".
<li> Save and quit the control-panel. 
</ol>

Now you need to follow the specific instructions the above article talks about. 
You need to modify /etc/resolv.conf for the DNS and edit /etc/ppp/pap-secrets as described
 in the article. 
<p>
Overall, it was simple once I knew what to do. 
<p>
If you have tried to figure out how to setup the modem, and you cannot, 
and you have read this article and the other article mentioned above, then
send email to <a href="mailto:articles@gnujobs.com"> GNUJobs.com at
articles@gnujobs.com</a> and perhaps I can point you in the right direction. 
If you attend the 
<a href="http://www.svlug.org">SVLUG</a> meetings in the Bay Area, bring your laptop and send
me email when you are attending the next meeting, and I can help out. 


<h3>
<a NAME="firewall"></a>Setting up a firewall for your network</h3>

I have a desktop computer and a laptop. I don't like using the touchpad on my
laptop, and since I have to use the serial port for my external mouse, I can't
use the Ricochet modem (unless I use the touchpad). Thus, I use my desktop
computer as a firewall. I connect
the desktop computer and laptop to a 100 mbit hub. Then I connect the Ricochet modem
to the desktop computer. 
<p>
The desktop becomes my firewall. I don't have any services running on it
except for ssh. All the other ports are closed. Please use the program 
<a href="http://www.insecure.org/nmap/">nmap</a> to 
scan your computers to find out which ports are open. I would also disable
the root account from logging in with ssh. 
<p>
If you wish to know how to setup a firewall, I 9have written many old articles
for the Linux Gazette about networking and firewalls. There are lots of resources
out there. Try linux.org also with their HOWTOS. 


<h3>
<a NAME="Why"></a>Why do this stuff?</h3>
As an independent consultant, having the ability to go anywhere and
be connected is nice. Not having to pay startup costs every time you want
to get a 2nd phone line in an apartment is nice. I really loathe the local
phone companies for hitting businesses with high phone bills. The wireless
modem ends up paying for itself after you combine a phone bill and an ISP bill. 
<p>
It isn't super fast, but for my needs it is just fine. I am still going to get
a DSL hookup. This will provide me with two alternate ways of connecting to
the internet should one route die for a day. That can be very bad for an 
independent consultant, so two routes are a must. 
<p>
I leave the modem on all day and the firewall on all day. It is nice
that it doesn't tie up a phone line and it is also nice that I don't have
wires all over the place. When I had to move to a different room because
the guy who was assembling my furniture kicked me out of my office, it was
nice that I could take the laptop with the Ricochet modem to another room. 


<h3>
<a NAME="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3>
The Ricochet modem is good for connecting to the internet and is a must
for a traveling independent consultant. I don't work for or get paid by
Ricochet or the service providers for Ricochet, so my opinion isn't skewed. 
It is easy to setup, with just a few modifications. If you cannot afford
it as a business expense, don't do it and get a DSL line instead for 
personal use because it is not going to be as fast as DSL and it can be more
expensive than DSL. There are bonuses and negatives to getting the Ricochet modem. 
If we ever get to the point where the speed gets upto 500 Kbps, then DSL
has no real advantage for me (except in the Bay Area getting a fixed ip address
with DSL seems to be $30 more a month which is a lot cheaper than what I paid
for to get a fixed ip address using Cable Modems in Columbus, Ohio).
