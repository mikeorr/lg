<P>
Hi
</P>
<P>
I've been trying in vain to do something very simple, but have been unable
to find the answer via excessive googling, so I'm hoping someone here can
point me in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
I am trying to configure my system so that I can utilise the TVout on my
graphics card.  I want to be able to display to the TV while still
retaining use of the desktop via a CRT.  Eventually I intend to run
MythTV on the TV screen (mainly for the movie and ogg playing
capabilities).
</P>
<P>
To this end I don't want <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> to bother running a window manager &amp; desktop
on the TV screen.  I have setup X such that I have :0.0 and :0.1 display
devices, with :0.1 being the TVout screen.  Unfortunately I end up with a
KDE desktop on the TVout, along with my usual KDE desktop on the CRT.
</P>
<P>
I can successfully run a movie on the TV screen using -
</P>

<blockquote><pre>$ DISPLAY=:0.1 vlc -f --video-on-top ./movie.avi
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
However, if I then try and run something on the CRT it steals the focus
from the vlc display on the TV (which in itself wouldn't be a huge
problem if the KDE panel didn't then put itself to the front on the TV
screen).
</P>
<P>
The only hint at a solution I've managed to find indicates that I <TT>/must/</TT>
run two instances of X, one for each screen, if I want to solve the
problem.  However, another person has managed to do this with one
instance of X (with MythTV on the TV) but runs WindowMaker as their WM,
which accepts a -display parameter when run so it limits itself to :0.0
</P>
<P>
First things first, my configuration:

<P>
I've managed to muddle through getting all the really nasty stuff
working...
</P>
<P>
OpenLDAP works
</P>
<P>
OpenLDAP directory contains appropriate user entries
</P>
<P>
Users can authenticate through PAM against their OpenLDAP records (and I can even control what they can log into using the authorizedService attribute, so, some users get FTP, some get SSH, some get SMTP, some IMAP, etc.)
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, I'm down to one thing I need to make work that isn't.
I need to get <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A> (2.0.53, Fedora Core 3) to authenticate
users against LDAP.  I think I know how to make the Apache
queries work and query the right things from the LDAP server
and such, but, here's the rub:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
Apache LDAP support is divided into two parts.  mod_auth_ldap which
seems pretty straightforward (at least after dealing with everything
else), and, mod_ldap (which unlike the rest of apache modules is
util_ldap.c instead of mod_ldap.c WHEE!!).
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
My problem is that mod_ldap is refusing to make SSL connections to the
LDAP server, and, my LDAP server (deliberately) won't allow
authenticated binds using cleartext passwords without SSL.
</P>
<P>
Any ideas how to make this all work together or know anyone who knows
this stuff cold and could help me?
</P>
<P>
Thanks,
</P>

I wasn't able to get sets working (if anyone knows appropriate set

I think that the missing step is that you are not repeating the "dd"
and "cp" operations every time you run lilo. After running lilo, you
have to transfer again the first 512 bytes of <TT>/dev/hda8</TT> to the file
bootsec.lin in <TT>/dev/hda.</TT>
</P>
<P>
If I may digress a little bit, I have to say that it is here where I
have found the greatest advantage between lilo and grub: this step is
not needed with grub.
</P>
<P>
I hope this helps. Best regards,

Pedro.

I am MOST distressed to hear you are trying to close down
linuxgazette.net by appropriating their name.  The fact that you HOSTED
them awhile back gives you NO RIGHT to the name.  And in fact you have
linuxgazette.com already.

I ENJOY reading BOTH linuxgazette.net, and my subscription to
"Linux Journal", to which I am a long-time subscriber (and bought the CD
of back issues).  There is room for BOTH of you in this big world.
Please lay off linuxgazette.net.   I'd hate to have to drop my
subscription to "Linux Journal" which I enjoy reading every month.

Jim -

<P>
Thank you very much for your support, and for restating our position
with regard to SSC's unwarranted attacks. Here at the Linux Gazette, we
believe that there is indeed room for both - and our actions have
consistently reflected that belief. SSC, via their hired guns, have
closed off all avenues for peaceful coexistence by their threats; we
shall simply continue to stand firm against their baseless accusations -
the law and the public sentiment happen to coincide in support of us.
</P>
<P>
Your support, and the support of all our readers who have written to us
in regard to the present situation, serves to underscore and reinforce
our determination to see this through. Thank you, Jim... thank you,
everyone.
