Unable to Open Console: After <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> "Custom" Install

<P><STRONG>
Greetings Once Again Honorable Guru,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
My newly acquired, but soon to be short-lived, reputation as a Linux sage is
in danger. I have been helping my friend set up Linux on his PC at home. He
was the one who waged the Winmodem battle I told you about. He is attempting
to duplicate my success at dual-booting Windows98 and Linux (RedHat 5.2).
When he uses the workstation install mode, everything works fine. But when
we attempt a custom install, which I have done successfully numerous times,
the install goes fine until the first reboot. Then the boot sequence stops
after checking his partitions, with a message that reads "Unable to open a
console".  We have done everything identically to the method I used on my
PC, which is a near duplicate of his PC. We have removed all the partitions
and OS's, including Windows, repartitioned and reformatted the drive,
verified that the available space equalled the size of the drive, and
reinstalled Windows and then Linux. Still, no joy. Same message. During the
custom install, we created a 300MB root directory, a 127MB swap file (he has
128MB RAM), and three 600MB (growable) directories (<tt>/usr</tt>, 
<TT>/home</TT>, and <TT>/opt).</TT>
As I said, everything formatted and installed without a hitch until reboot.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have searched the past Linux Gazettes for an answer to this problem, but I
came up dry. Any help would be appreciated.

Unable to open console after reboot suggests a problem in
your <TT>/dev</TT> directory tree.  If the <tt>tty1</tt> and other "virtual
terminal" device nodes are inaccessible (you tried to put
<TT>/dev</TT> as a symlink to some mounted filesystem or something
like that) then I'd expect this error message.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You can get similar problems (error messages regarding
utmp or wtmp files) if your <TT>/var/log</TT> doesn't get
mounted --- or doesn't exist.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, it could be some problem with the way you're structuring
your filesystems.  Boot from a rescue floppy and look
around.  Make sure that the <TT>/dev</TT> directory is on your
root filesystem and that the <TT>/dev/tty[0-2]*</TT> devices nodes
are there, and that the are proper character devices.  An
'<tt>ls -al</tt>' should look a bit like:

... note that I define 24 of these ttys --- that's because
I use twelve of them for logins and my X sessions (sometimes
up to three of them) are on the next few, a copy of
all 'syslogd' messages is on number 24, and I use the others
with the 'open' command, or as target for redirecting
'tail -f' output and other logging operations.  So I use
<EM>alot</EM> more ttys than most people.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now, the odd thing is that this is happening right after a
fresh install.  I almost always used custom (one of these
days I'll learn to use Red Hat's "KickStart" package ---
though every installation I do is different so it probably
wouldn't help much).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, I'd have to guess that somewhere you're forcing Red Hat
to skip the installation of some vital package.  It's
hard to imagine how you're doing that.  The only time I've
come close to that problem is when I was experimenting with
installing over FTP from a public Internet FTP site (that
was very unreliable in Red Hat 5.2).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The obvious workaround is to install using their
"workstation" profile and then to use the 'rpm' command to
add and remove the packages to your taste after the
intallation is complete and you've successfully rebooted.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
One way to get a full list of packages that you hvae
installed on a Red Hat (or other RPM based) system is
to use the command:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
rpm -aq
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... which you can redirect to a file, of course.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If just the package names aren't enough, you can use
a command like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
rpm -aqi
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... to get a full list of packages with short (one screen
full) describtion and some info about each.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, you could create a package list using:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
rpm -aq &gt; <TT>/tmp/plist</TT>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... then edit that to delete the names of all the packages
you want to keep.  You can refer to individual rpm -qi
screens for packages that you don't recognize by name
by simply issuing commands like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
rpm -qi zircon-1.17-16
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... (where zircon was a package name I picked at random).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(If you wanted to be clever you'd make a macro in your
favorite editor to pull in the description of any package
on which your cursor was sitting when you invoked it.
In '<tt>vi</tt>' that would be something like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BlockQuote><code>
:map S mcyypI:r!rpm -qi ^[o^[k"<A HREF="mailto:cD@c"
	>cD@c</A>^M^[`c
</code></BlockQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... (where S is just any key that you don't use much
in 'vi' command mode.  This macro sets mark 'c' and
fills paste register 'c'.  All of the <tt>^[</tt> are
literal escapes and the one <tt>^M</tt> is a literal carriage
return; those are entered in 'vi' by preceding them
with a ^v [Ctrl-V]).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, using this macro you'd move your cursor over any package
that you were wondering about, hit [S] (from command mode)
and this macro would extract the "info" by "querying" the
RPM database and insert the results into your editing
buffer.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Once you've removed all the package names that you want
to keep you could use a command like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
cat <TT>/tmp/delete.list</TT> | xargs rpm -e
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... to try "erasing" (un-installing) everything on
the list.  Here I'm assuming you make a copy of your
package list file to "delete.list" and edited that.
Obviously you can use any filenames you like.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This might result in a list of error messages about
how some packages could not be removed due to dependencies
with other packages.  There should be no harm done ---
so this command isn't as dangerous as it might look.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
After you've removed all the packages you don't want
you can select various packages that you do want to add
and simply use the '<tt>rpm -i</tt>' command to install each of
them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This would be most easily done in a shell (rather than
through an editor list).  To save on typing I'd
probably create a couple of shell aliases like 'q' and 'i'
to query and install packages.  Those would look like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BlockQuote><code>
alias q='rpm -qp '
<br>alias i='rpm -i '
</code></BlockQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course looking through a list of almost 600 packages
one could get boring.  You could narrow the list a bit
by generating a list of the package names on the CD and
comparing that to the packages listed in your database.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To do that can use something a bit like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BlockQuote><code>
rpm -qp &gt; /tmp/pkg.list
rpm -aq &gt;&gt; /tmp/pkg.list
sort /tmp/pkg.list | uniq
</code></BlockQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... since any package that is installed will be listed
twice (once from the -qp listing and once from the
-aq listing) the 'sort | uniq' step will leave you with
a list of packages that are <EM>NOT</EM> installed.  Note:
This trick only works since you have just installed
all the RPMs from this CD.  If you had fetched and
installed some RPMs from a different CD or from an
FTP site then you'd have to use a different approach
to weed out the "extras"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <BLOCKQUOTE> <CODE>
rpm -qa | sort &gt; /tmp/pkg.inst
rpm -qp | sort &gt; /tmp/pkg.dir
comm -23 /tmp/pkg.dir /tmp/pkg.inst &gt; /tmp/pkg.not
</CODE> </BLOCKQUOTE> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... this is a better technique overall.  The 'comm'
command finds lines "in common" between two files.
It normally prints three columns of output --- but
we just want the first column (the names of packages
in the "dir" that are <EM>not</EM> in the list of "inst"-alled
packages).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Incidentally using the command
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
comm -13 /tmp/pkg.dir /tmp/pkg.inst &gt; /tmp/pkg.not
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... or swapping the names of the files should give us
a list of all "3rd party" packages that we've installed.
That is that it results in a list of files that are
installed and for which there is no ".rpm" file in the
directory listing.  Obviously the fact that Red Hat stores
all of its package files in a single directory on its CDs
is pretty convenient here.  However, even when we're using
<A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">S.u.S.E.</A> CDs (with 
several CDs to a set and RPMs scattered
in number groupings) we can easily generate a single listing
of all the packages from as many directories as we like.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(You can then print a list of those, or you could be
even more clever, make a <TT>/tmp/pkglist/</TT> directory and
create a series of symlinks for each of the "not installed"
package).  Here's a command that will do that:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><pre>
cat /tmp/not.installed.txt | while read i; do
    ln -s <TT>/mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS/$i</TT> .
done
</pre></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... (execute this command from your tmp/pkglist directory!).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
No you can focus on these packages --- issuing your 'q'
and 'i' commands.  Or you could just use the 'q' alias to
read more about each package --- and remove the symlinks for
each that you don't want to install.  Then, when you're done
you could just issue a command like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
rpm -i *.rpm
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... to install every package that's still listed in your
temporary link farm.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course I've mentioned a number of other 'rpm' command
tricks in previous issues.  However, to save you the time
searching through the back issues of LG I'll recap a
couple of them here:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Verify" all the installed packages:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
rpm -Va
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... this produces a list of any file from any package
that is "missing" or has changed (checking MD5 checksums,
time stamps, ownership and permissions, etc).  Unfortunately
the output doesn't list the names of the packages from which
these files came.  You can get that by using:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
rpm -qf $FILENAME
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(for any of the files that were listed as modified or
"missing" --- or for any file that was installed by any RPM
on your system, for that matter).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The <tt>-qf</tt> option associates a file with the package that
"owns" it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This "Verify" compares your files to the installed
RPM database.  It's possible to keep back copies of your
RPM database on removable media (though they will typically
be too large to fit on a floppy, even compressed in most
of my cases).  You can use the '--dbpath' option to force
the 'rpm' command to use a database in some other location
(such as <TT>/mnt/ls120/backup</TT> or <TT>/mnt/zipdisk/rpmdb.bak/).</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Another trick is to verify a package installation against
the contents of a package file.  To do this you use the
command:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
rpm -Vp $PACKAGE_FILENAME
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... in a previous column I gave a script that would
verify <EM>any</EM> of your installed packages against any
RPM in the current directory.  However, it occurs to
me that this script was probably unnecessarily complex
--- I could use the 'comm' command to simplify it somewhat.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In this case we'd generate our to lists of packages as
before.   We also build an "index" of the packages (matching
the package names to the filenames) using a command like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><pre>
ls *.rpm | while read f; do
   echo $(rpm -qp $f) $f
done &gt; /tmp/pkg.index
</pre></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Then we'd use a command like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
comm -12 /tmp/pkg.dir /tmp/pkg.inst \
<br>| join - <TT>/tmp/pkg.index</TT> | cut -f 2 -d" " | xargs rpm -Vp
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... this may not look simpler --- but it is much more
elegant than the last version of this script that I posted.
(I often forget about 'comm' and 'join' --- and I
shouldn't).  The 'comm' command in this case is just
listing the packages in common (between our installed
list and our directory listing).  The 'join' command finds
those lines in our index file that correspond to any of the
package names we've listed  (remember, package names and
package <EM>FILE</EM> names don't have to match).  The '<tt>cut</tt>' command
then simply "cuts" the filename from each line (that's
"field" number two with a "delimiter" of a space; I could
have used <tt>-e</tt> and "<tt>\t</tt>" on my echo command when I was building
the "index" file to build it with 'cut's default delimiter
--- though it makes no difference).  Finally we pass the
list of package file names to '<tt>xargs</tt>' which builds a series
of one or more '<tt>rpm -Vp</tt>' commands by translating the
arguments from its standard input into lists of arguments on
the command lines it executes.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If we consolidate the code samples into a full script
it would total about a dozen lines or less.  (I think that's
half of what it took in my previous example).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've used a number of techniques like these to manage the
large numbers of packages that I have installed on some of my
systems.  I use 'sh' (actually 'bash') enough and on enough
different systems that I don't even keep most of these
scripts --- it's usually easier to just type them on the fly
then it is to remember where I have them and go fetch them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I think I'll put this one together and forward it to the
Red Hat team, to the maintainer of the Linux-Tips HOWTO,
and maybe post it on my website.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(It would be nice if someone generated a list of
comparable '<tt>dpkg</tt>' commands --- since I don't have the
experience with <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>, 
and I'd like to learn more about it).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
More importantly I hope I've given some nice examples of
shell scripting --- ways to use commands like '<tt>uniq</tt>',
'<tt>comm</tt>', '<tt>join</tt>', '<tt>cut</tt>', '<tt>xargs</tt>' 
and those ubiquitous '<tt>while read</tt>' loops that show up in 
so many of my scripts.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(Actually I should note that my use of <TT>/tmp</TT> for
all of this is atrocious --- since anyone using this in
a script on a multi-user system would be vulnerable to
horrible symlink attacks.  Usually I use ~/tmp for all
of these sorts of things).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It turns out that I've been asked to teach shell programming
at a local community college.  I've never done any
professional teaching before --- and only recently did my
first public lecture.  It's kind of exciting for a guy with
no college degree himself.

I'm working from my text terminal in the living room
tonight --- so I couldn't view this site's content (it
doesn't come across in '<tt>lynx</tt>').  I often use one of the
terminals in the living room while I'm watching TV, or
when I have friends over.  One of my friends decided to
drop by and do some programming on his laptop, and
Heather is working on something on her laptop.  My
