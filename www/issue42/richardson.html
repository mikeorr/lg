Red Hat proved once again that they can put on a good show for the
Linux community. Bigger and better than ever, Linux Expo again doubled in
size and attracted top speakers such as Dr. Peter Braam and Dr. Theodore
Ts'o. Big business was there too, represented by such companies
as IBM, Hewlett Packard and SGI (formerly Silicon Graphics), as well
as the usual Linux vendors, such as SuSE, Caldera, VA Linux Systems,
Enhanced Software Technologies, Cygnus and many others.
<p>
I talked to Dave McAllister of SGI about their involvement in Linux
and Open Source and found SGI to be much more committed to this community
than I would have suspected. They released their most robust and scalable
file system, XFS, to the community in an effort to aid Linux in reaching
what he called ``Enterprise level''. Whatever their reasons
for doing so, this is certainly something that was applauded by everyone
I talked to at the show.
<p>
One of the most exciting announcements before the show was
O'Reilly's and HP's sourceXchange.com web site. I
attended a discussion about this site, which is designed to aid in
getting needed open source developed by obtaining sponsors who will
pay developers to write the code they need and then release it to
the public. This is an idea whose time has come, as another group
has also started a web site for the same purpose--this one
is CoSource.com from a couple of independents, Bernie Thompson and
Norman Jacobowitz, who write for LJ. It's obvious that Bernie,
Norman and O'Reilly are committed to the community and wish to
drive open source development, but I was a bit suspicious of HP. When
I asked about HP's motives for involvement in this project, Wayne
Caccamo told me HP felt this project was inevitable and wanted to take a
leadership role in it <i>and</i> they wanted to ``ingratiate''
themselves to the Open Source community--talk about honesty! After
that remark, I was ready to believe anything. I'm looking forward
to seeing how both these sites work out. (For more on this subject,
see Doc Searls' article on the <i>Linux Journal</i> web site
at http://www.linuxresources.com/articles/conversations/001.html and
Bernie Thompson's article in this issue, ``Market Making in
the Bazaar''.)
<p>
There were the usual fun things to do, such as a chili pepper
sauce contest and a paintball contest pitting vi against Emacs
once more--and once again vi won, proving it is the best editor
available--or that its advocates are the best shots. More than one
group bought blocks of tickets to a local showing of <i>Star Wars-The
Phantom Menace</i>. The ALS (Atlanta Linux Showcase) group invited me
to go along with them. Fun movie, but not as compelling as the first
one--then again, who expected it to be?
<p>
I especially enjoyed my booth time talking to current and future readers
and authors. In particular, it was a pleasure to finally meet Alan Cox
and Telsa Gwynne.
<p>
Alpha Processor, Inc., a Samsung company, announced they were
joining Linux International, and Guy Ludden presented a check to Jon
``maddog'' Hall. I got the picture and then took several
others of Jon, including one with a people-size Tux, who was roaming
the show floor.
<p>
Compared to LinuxWorld, Linux Expo came across as more polished, more
``we've done this before successfully''. LinuxWorld had
a lot of glitz--electricity and energy filling the air--that
just wasn't there at Linux Expo. I think this had mostly to do with
the fact that it wasn't the first time for these guys--the
experience showed. The speakers all like Linux Expo better, as the Expo
paid their travel expenses while LinuxWorld left them to get there on
their own. LinuxWorld had more people and more vendors, but they also
have the advantage of being in Silicon Valley.
<p>
Evan Leibowitz described the Expo as ``the show where Linux lost
its innocence'' due to two unpleasant situations that arose. One was
Pacific HiTech's being kicked out for passing out t-shirts without
buying booth space. The other was the use of the Red Hat trademark
without permission, by LinuxCare on their poster parodying a Palm Pilot
ad. No matter which side you took on this incident--the calling of
lawyers certainly signals the ``end of innocence''.
<p>
The show was a definitely a success. I talked to Bob Young on the last
day, and he certainly seemed pleased with how it had turned out. See
my interview with Bob in this issue. For more vendor announcements,
see ``Linux Kernels''.
