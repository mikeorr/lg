[Jimmy] 
First off, I've never had to mess with grub before, and I'm only
guessing here, but I'd say the problem is that you're trying to run an
older kernel version from the same partition as a newer version. Sure,
modules from the different versions will live happily together, but do
you have a version of modprobe for both 2.4 and 2.6? Does your
modules.conf have settings for 2.6 that don't work for 2.4?

<P><strong>
Hi,
</P>
<P>
I have a number of issues with tcsh (not my choice..) shell scripting
I need help with.
</P>
<P>
Basically I'm writing a shell script that automates a long setup
procedure. This top-level script is in bash, however the bulk of it is
comprised of commands that are fed to a program which is, in essence,
a tcsh shell. I've achieved this by using the &lt;&lt; redirector. I need
help on two points:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
1) Is there any way of suspending input redirection, taking input from
the keyboard, and then resuming input from the tcsh script?
</BLOCKQuote>
</strong></P>

<p>
[Ben] 
There is, but it is Fraught With Large Problems. I'm not that familiar
with TCSH, but I've just had to do that in Perl - essentially, I was
writing a Perl version of 'more' and had to answer the question of 'how
do you take user input from STDIN when the stream being paged is STDIN?'
It requires duplicating the STDIN filehandle... but before you start
even trying to do it, let me point you to "CSH Programming Considered
Harmful" - Tom Christiansen's famous essay on Why You Shouldn't Do That.
If it's not your choice, then tell the people whose choice it is that
They Shouldn't Do That. The task is complex enough, and has enough
touchy problems of its own, that introducing CSH into the equation is
like the Roadrunner handing an anvil to the Coyote when he's already
standing on shaky ground over a cliff.
</p>
<p>
To give you <em>  some  </em> useful direction, however - the answer lies in using
'stty'.
</p>
<P><STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
2) There comes a point towards the end of the script when two shell
scripts are run simultaneously. These shell scripts open up individual
xterm windows to run inside. I'm wondering, is there anyway of having
the tcsh script monitor stdout of one xterm, and upon the output of a
certain piece of text, echoing a command into the stdin of the other
xterm?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</STRONG></P>
[Ben] 
Why not 'tee' the output of the script - one 'branch' into the xterm and
the other into a pipemill (or whatever you want to run 'grep' in)?
<P><STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Any insight or knowledge on the matter would be very much appreciated.
I hope I have provided sufficient details.

Okay guys (and gals) ... I've been lurking for too long and have to ask
a question 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I've got a HP Laser 2550 connected via USB. Using Mandrake 2005LE which
has a 2.6.11 kernel. Using CUPS for the printer.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Karl-Heinz] 
I've some networked lasers and one on the parallel port here...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
The printer works fine ... but, sometimes (after a fairly long uptime)
printer commands just hang. Of course, this usually happens when my wife
is the room and I'm trying to impress her with the power of Linux, etc.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Karl-Heinz] 
...and see occasionally the same. In our case the printer get's
into some error state and cups automatically disables the queue
but still accepts new jobs. Usually it's enough to to restart/reenable
the cups queue by going to the web-configuration <A HREF="http://localhost"
	>http://localhost</A>:631/
and disable/enable the printer or on commandline (maybe as root) with
<TT>/usr/bin/enable</TT> printername . You can't use just "enable" as that's a bash builtin which will not
affect your printer at all (great command naming that!).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
I always have to remind my students in the shell scripting classes that
"<TT>/usr/lib/rsh</TT>" is the correct invocation for the restricted shell in
Solaris; plain "rsh" is the "remote shell" from the "r" utilities.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Back in those early days, all good *nix program names were four
characters long; assuming the standard naming convention, in which only
lower-case letters, numbers, and the underscore character are valid, you
were restricted to 37^4 possibilities (gosh, only 1874161 possible
programs - THAT must have been an incredible disappointment to new
programmers trying to break into this highly restrictive field!) Now,
however, with 255 characters for length and almost everything except '<TT>/</TT>'
usable (although not necessarily a good idea!), when you could have
program names like
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>This is the gadget that I use to write letters and send them to my Grandma
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I find that kind of behavior somewhat boggling.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Was this a *nix restriction, or just a convention for lazy people who
really didn't want to use ANY extra keystrokes?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
Y'know... I'm not sure. I think it was a sort of a generally agreed-upon
convention, like "thou shalt name all your resource configuration files
with a name ending in 'rc'" rather than a technical restriction. Anyone
have input on this?

Also, according to Wikipedia's article

The files do end up in the cups spool directory. But, just sit there.
The 3 or 4 times this has happened I've just rebooted and all is fine.
But, that's a pretty dirty way to do this.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Karl-Heinz] 
Could you check if it's just cups or the actual USB layer? What's in
<TT>/var/log/messages</TT>, <TT>/var/log/cups/*</TT> ?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
I do use a camera and mp3 player as well. But I really haven't seen a
correlation between the printer problem and other USB usage. I sort of
suspect that USB ports are being reassigned behind my back, but the
printer is always powered on ... so that doesn't make sense.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Any ideas?

<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Karl-Heinz] 
If it's really the USB layer you should find some hints in the logfiles.

In issue 101, Avinoam Levkovitch published an article entitled "Home Folder
Server For WIndows Clients".  Unless there's another way, his script looks
like a good solution for me, as I'm trying to automatically create users on a
sendmail server from entries in a Windows 2003 Active Directory.  I can't
locate the author, am by no means a coder, have a couple of questions, and so
thought I'd ask.

1.  My windbind separator is "\".  However, I don't want that (that is, the

want it to be the username.  Does the script strip out the domainname, or
must I tweak it?  If so, how?
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
2.  There are certain users for whom I don't want to create home directories.
These include all system accounts and those ending in $.  How can I
accomplish that?

does not work anymore since 3.8 (you did this in March with 3.7 didn't you?)
because the kernel image alone is now larger than the whole floppy capacity.

That's what I understood; one of our authors, Edgar Howell, was trying
to do what I described, and reported exactly that.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

In 3.9 there is not even a choice between 2.4 and 2.6 within the

there is only one minirt.gz and one linux kernel image, no

</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Anyway this trick was just more or less a duplicate of the mkbootfloppy
script from Klaus Knopper which
created TWO boot disks (one for primary booting, one for rebooting from
a CD or CD image via an initrd).
Given that the floppy space is now too short he didn't even bother to
port it since 3.8

I wonder if it's possible to make up a boot floppy that just fires up

So how do you handle BIOS updates?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Sluggo] 
I've never updated my BIOS.  I get a new motherboard every few years to go with a faster chip.  I've only had a floppyless computer since December, when I upgraded from 450 MHz to 2.88 GHz.  Now that I can compile Gentoo in a few days, run <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> with reasonable speed, and boot any distro I want, I don't know what would induce me to upgrade again.  Especially now that the power consumption/heat rates have begun to catch up with the CPU speeds.  I don't get peripherals until a couple years after the technology comes out (and often much longer), so who knows when I'll need something my motherboard can't handle.  There are two annoyances with this motherboard:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockQuote><ol>
<LI>I had to jumper my 40 GB hard drive to a compatibility size to get the BIOS to recognize it.  This was surprising given how new the motherboard is.  I resigned myself to live with it, then happily discovered that Linux sees the whole 40 GB anyway.


<LI>It won't boot with GRUB.  But that's the case with a lot of motherboards, and LILO still works fine even if it's not as cool.
</ol></blockQuote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Jason] 
Hmmm...what is a case where you'd want to update your BIOS? What is the
BIOS used for these days other than bootstrapping?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[John] 
You might be surprised.  It's tied into the chipset of the mobo, so affects things like apic, and a host of other things that aren't necessarily configurable in the BIOS setup.  After flashing the BIOS on my laptop, both fans became functional, instead of just one.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Sluggo] 
Bootable CDs have been enough to
install/rescue Linux distributions.  I bought a USB stick for transporting
files, then gave it to my mom for backups and used my camera instead.  The
main problem is you can't just make somebody a floppy and let them keep
it; USB sticks are too expensive for that.  You can burn a CD but it's
less convenient than mount/cp/umount -- plus they have to throw it in a
landfill when they're through.  Hmm, maybe I should give them a CD-RW so
they can reuse it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Brian] 
The usual
culprit is a flash BIOS update that runs either as a windows executable
(sorry, I'm not going to entrust a BIOS update to Wine), or as a DOS-based
app from a custom boot floppy. Now I could go to the trouble to get the
image booted off of a CDROM, but if I do that ONCE per system, it costs me
more (in my time) than buying and installing the floppy to begin with. The
day I have to buy a motherboard without a floppy ... Well, I'll probably
end up with a USB floppy drive that I can shuttle system-to-system, and do
it that way. Or I suppose that an ELF executable wouldn't be out of the
realm of possibility, eh?

I have some across some USB floppy drives, and it
turns out they're not so useful in the linux context,
given that they show up as <TT>/dev/sda</TT> rather than
<TT>/dev/fd0.</TT> I guess a similar problem might affect
Microsoft software which hasn't been updated to cope.

So - after reading the site a bit more, it turns out that these are Not
Just Plain DNS servers; you've got to be running BIND in order to use
them, unless I missed something. Makes them less than useful to a fellow

As is all too common with Subversion, LG's repository got wedged with a
stale lock for the upteenth time.
</P>

<blockquote><pre>% svn update

<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
Due to the odd perms (particularly the 'group' settings), you can delete
the files, but can't "chmod" them. In the above case, there's usually
one file with the wrong UID or GID ('ls -l' shows the odd one); I just
copy it to my ~, then copy it back (overwriting the original), then run
'svnadmin recover'. I used to have a script to automate this
somewhere...
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><em><font color="#000066">Our host runs a cron job that tries to fix these things.

<P><STRONG>
Subversion 1.1 has a new file-based storage backend that's immune to the
BDB wedging problem.  Another site I use switched to it, and said it was
easy to dump the repository from the old system and restore it in the new
one with history.  Have TAGgers had any good/bad experiences with the new
FSFS?  Is it worth switching LG to it?

Might be nice; right now, it requires me to be available (or someone
else who is familiar with SVN's quirks) if anything breaks, and
minimizing SPOFs is always a good idea.

The bad part of it is that we don't have any location information on
people other than country (at best.) Those who are in trouble are not
likely to respond; those who can respond - and I don't mean to minimize
them, but net access <EM>isn't</EM> a survival necessity - are probably in a
lot less trouble than they could be. Perhaps we should start collecting
people's missile addresses, for future use...
