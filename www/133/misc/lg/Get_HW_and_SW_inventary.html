Hello everybody:
</p>

<p>
I'm a spanish girl in her last year at University studing computer
engineering.
I'm starting to look into linux to develope my end-degree project. The
project deals with the managing of a heterogeneous net, this means that from
a client (administrator)  I have to get a Hardware and Software inventary of
every computer and device in the net. The problem is that I just don't know
where linux keeps such information (Windows keeps it in the register). Could
any of you give a helping hand?
</p>

<p>
I mean to design the interface using J2EE tecnology, so I'll have to
interrogate computers using java (neither how to do this yet).
</p>

<p>
Another question I'd like to ask is the best linux distribution to work
with. I'll work with virtual machines so high requiriments do not represent
huge problems.
</p>

<p>
hoping someone reads this (and spends sometime answering it ;) ),
Galax

"A hardware and software inventory of every computer and device on the
net".  That isn't possible -- not even anywhere near so.  The problem
is that you're assuming there's a generic means to do so.  There
isn't.  Basic network management will tell you many things about how to
determine what computers are there.  You ping your interface's
broadcast address for that:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
ping -b XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
</pre>
(See the output from 'ifconfig' to ascertain it).  You can do all
manner of things to "count" them, if that's what you want.
</p>

<p>
As for software, this depends entirely on the distribution.  You can't
easily make any kind of guess for this, without knowing the OS, etc.
Not all distros have package managers (BSD, etc).  And then of course,
what constitutes "all" software?  What if some software hasn't been
installed via the package manager, for instance?  It's a rather silly
and unquantifiable means, which seems to have no end.
</p>

<p>
Have you looked at Nagios?

<p>
<pre>
&gt; I mean to design the interface using J2EE tecnology, so I'll have to

</pre>
</p>

<p>
J2EE is both boring, and complex.  If you don't know how to do this at
even the basic level using a three-tiered approach, you're screwed
trying to even hack it, quite frankly.
 
</p>

<p>
<pre>
&gt; Another question I'd like to ask is the best linux distribution to
&gt; work with. I´ll work with virtual machines so high requiriments do
&gt; not represent huge problems.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Any one will do.  I use Debian.  Again, what do you mean by "best"?

</p>

<p>
On each machine there's information about most of the hardware in the /proc 
filesystem. I don't know exactly what's where.  /proc/cpuinfo contains CPU 
info. /proc/ide contains info on ide devices, /proc/scis contains info on 
SCSI devices, etc. I'm sure Google can help you fill in most of the gaps.
</p>

<p>
For software, you can usually tell what's been installed via the package 
managers. Different distributions may use different package managers. The 
major distributions tend to use either APT or RPM. Again Google will be a 
great help in learning more about these.
</p>

<p>
Of course any software that has been installed in other ways (e.g. compiled 
from source) will be invisible to the package managers.

Linux keeps that information in the package database, which is much
easier to query than the Wind0ws registry; however, there's a problem in
both cases. If, for example, I have PuTTY on that Wind0ws machine, your
registry search will never show it - since it creates no registry
entries. There are a number of other Wind0ws programs that omit that
step, too.
</p>

<p>
By the same token, any Linux programs that are installed without using
the package database - e.g., tarballs or locally-written programs - are
not "registered" and can't be enumerated.
 
In anything other than tightly-controlled system with full
accountability (e.g., a TCSEC B1-rated system), there's <em>no</em> way to
determine a full "software inventory" - especially given the broad
meaning that's assigned to the term "software".

One of the biggest mistakes you can make is to decide on the tools
you're going to use before you've determined the scope of the problem
you're trying to solve. If I was trying for a "best-fit" solution for
the problem you've stated, I'd probably use Expect and SSH, in much the
same way that I previously used them for my 'sshtool' script.

For that matter, the content and format for the "package database" on two of

<p>
1) /Is/ there a complete repository of /all/ installed software (including 
shell scripts, perl scripts, etc.) available on each of her systems?
</p>

<p>
2) Is this repository queriable? Do the results make sense? Can results from 
different systems be compared?
</p>

<p>
3) /Is/ there a complete repository of all hardware installed on each 
system? Is this repository queriable, etc?
</p>

<p>
4) What sort of API can be used to query the hardware and software inventory 
mechanisms? Is there a common API? Are the results in a common form?
</p>

<p>
5) What sort of reporting will be necessary? What sort of details need to be 
reported? What reporting mechanism?
</p>

<p>
6) Can a common server implementation resolve the differences between systems?
</p>

<p>
7) How to install an inventory server on each affected system
</p>

<p>
8) How to query and consolidate the results from each server, so that the 
reporting requirements are satisfied.

<p>
Well, of course they're different.  Slackware doesn't have a package
management system per se.  It completely depends upon the distro as to
the underlying method used.  Again, even if you could ascertain it being
an RPM-based system, for example, that's no guarantee of anything,
either.  It's a complete waste of time, and a rather stupid exercise to
even try and do.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Only on a limited scale.  RPM systems are slightly better in this regard
in that they associate files created by programs post-installation as
being part of a package, whereas dpkg will not, and cannot associate
arbotrary files created post-installation that weren't part of a
package.  The "enumeration" you refer to is only a heuristic to a much
larger problem.

<p>
<pre>
&gt; 1) /Is/ there a complete repository of /all/ installed software (including

<p>
Even if all the computers were identical in terms of their OS -- the
fact that they're going to all have different usages, with different
ways of working is <strong>still</strong> no guarantee of the software on them.
 
</p>

<p>
<pre>
&gt; 2) Is this repository queriable? Do the results make sense? Can results from

<p>
Depends if it's Linux.  Some of it will be available via /proc
</p>


<p>
<pre>
&gt; 4) What sort of API can be used to query the hardware and software inventory

<p>
That's secondary to even making sure the data can reliably be
ascertained.  Given it's likely to be J2EE there's various EJBs which
allow for this.
</p>


<p>
<pre>
&gt; 6) Can a common server implementation resolve the differences between systems?

<p>
Nope.  Not without going through circular hoops.

<p>
I'm not clear on the precise argument that you have with my statement,
Lew. Is it just semantic nitpicking because I used the word "the", or
are you simply unfamiliar with the various types of package-tracking
systems in the various distros?
</p>

<p>
Yes, it is possible to create a "distro" which does not keep track of
what is installed - there's nothing to stop you from doing so, although
I think the meaning of the word "distro" would be strained beyond its
limits at that point. However, very few if any people would bother to
use such a gadget - why would they want to? It would be like buying a
car without seats when every other type of car comes with them
preinstalled.

</p>

<p>
Do you have more than one on your system? I certainly don't, and I've
never heard of any distro that does. I meant "the package database", and
so I said "the package database".
</p>

<p>
As to the variety of querying tools... if I had a number of systems that
I needed to poll, I'd install a script on them - named something like
"query_all_packages" - that would run the appropriate tool. Conversely,
I could write a script that would try the tools in succession and use
whichever one was appropriate. That particular problem presents little
to no difficulty.
</p>

Your certainty is completely unwarranted - there are plenty of programs
outside of the standard directories. My statement is accurate as
originally made.

This is, indeed, the question to which my original statement was

</pre>
</p>

<p>
As far as I know, only partial solutions - other than manual accounting,
which is 180 degrees away from what Ada is trying to do - are available
there, as well ('lspci', etc.)
 
</p>

<p>
<pre>

ACPI is supposed to be(come) such an API. It is not, alas, quite ready

&gt; 
&gt; 8) How to query and consolidate the results from each server, so that the

<p>
In other words - and similar to my conclusion - the only results that
can be extracted from a best-case attempt would be partial ones. In my
opinion, the project is a bit too ambitious in its stated goals.

Hi Ada,

&gt; I'm a spanish girl in her last year at University studing computer
&gt; engineering.
&gt; I'm starting to look into linux to develope my end-degree project. The
&gt; project deals with the managing of a heterogeneous net, this means
&gt; that from a client (administrator)  I have to get a Hardware and
&gt; Software inventary of every computer and device in the net. The
&gt; problem is that I just don´t know where linux keeps such information
&gt; (Windows keeps it in the register). Could any of you give a helping hand?
</pre>
</p>

<p>
We deal with this problem on a regular basis.
I manage a large network of linux servers (300+) with different hardware
and software.
We using scripts and software to determine what is in and on our servers.
</p>

<p>
Linux keeps a large amount of detailed hardware information in both
/proc and /sys
The presence of the /sys part is dependent on kernel version, so you are
not guaranteed to have that one present.
</p>

<p>
The easiest way to query for hardware info in such a network would be snmp.
But due to the configurable nature of linux this may or may not be
present on a server.
The presence of a snmpd is a decision that is up to the individual
system administrator.
</p>

<p>
The software part is much harder, there is no standard repository of
installed software on windows or linux a.f.a.i.k.
I remember to be able to install multiple software on windows without
causing a change in the registry.
</p>

<p>
If you are from the J2EE world this will probably sound familiar to you ;-)
</p>

<p>
There is no standard way in linux to determine what software is installed.
RPM-based systems (RedHat, Mandrake, SuSe and others) have a rpm
database which holds all installed rpm-packages.
This is absolutely no guarantee that there isn't any other software present.
</p>

<p>
Debian and derivates (f.e. Ubuntu)  have a different package system that
holds the same information, with the same guarantee of completeness.
</p>

<p>
The only advice I have to offer there is that you need to limit the
scope of your research assignment to a defined way of installing
software, or maybe to a class of software.
It is fairly simple to query a server for active network software such
as apache (webserver) or squid, dns etc.etc.
</p>


<p>
<pre>
&gt; I mean to design the interface using J2EE tecnology, so I'll have to
&gt; interrogate computers using java (neither how to do this yet).
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Take a good look at existing opensource software before you settle on
something or start writing something from scratch.
There are  monitoring software packages out there that might help you,
we're using nagios to monitor our servers, It's also capable of queying
snmp.
You might save yourself a lot of work by extending an existing package
instead of recreating one from scratch.
That is also a prime example of the beauty of open source and it's
power, you actually can extend any opensource package.
</p>

<p>
I would be interested in the end-result of your reseach, will you post
(a link to ) the results ?
</p>

<p>
<pre>
&gt;  
&gt; Another question I'd like to ask is the best linux distribution to
&gt; work with. I´ll work with virtual machines so high requiriments do not
&gt; represent huge problems.
&gt;  
&gt; hoping someone reads this (and spends sometime answering it ;) ),
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Pick any, it's probably more related to personal preference then
capabilities.
I hope this helps.
</p>

<p>
Good luck
</p>

<p>
Ramon

hi!!:
</p>

<p>
thank you all for your answers, everyone of them have been pretty useful. I
feel there's one item i did not ask properly. It's the following:
</p>

<p>
"Another question I'd like to ask is the best linux distribution to work
with. I'll work with virtual machines so high requiriments do not represent
huge problems."
</p>

<p>
what I meant was that which distribution has the easiest way to access
packages,  or which has packages?
</p>

<p>
thanks again,
Ada
</p>

<p>
You're still asking a meta-question -- which will inevitably give you a
biased response.  The answer is simple:  none of them will, and all of
them will, depending on which distribution you're <strong>*familiar*</strong> with.
</p>

<p>
Again, I use Debian.  YMMV, as others will chime in with their $DISTRO
of choice.  To be honest, if you have to actually <strong>ask</strong> this question,
I question whether or not your project is best suited to you.  You gets
some points of perseverance, but there is such a thing as scope...

hi:
I have not used linux too much, so I'm familiar with none distribution,
that's why I asked, but as usual I=B4ll learn as much as needed to suceed
it, moreover I chose this project particulary because I was going to
learn a lot.
So I think I need a distro for begginers which has RPM package managing.
</p>

<p>
thank you,
Ada
