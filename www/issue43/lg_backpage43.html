<P>
I want to give a <FONT SIZE=+2><STRONG>big thanks</STRONG></FONT> to our
authors this month for giving us such a substantial issue.  This issue has
almost twice as many articles as last month, and I learned a thing or two 
from some of them.

<P> This issue is a little milestone for me.  It marks my first time publishing
an ezine without outside help.

<P> Dealing with the one letter where we didn't have a common language to
communicate with got me thinking about my interest in 
<STRONG>Esperanto</STRONG>.  Because if we all had a common, simple auxiliary
language to fall back on (one much easier to learn than English!), these things
wouldn't happen.  Are there any <EM>Gazette</EM> readers who speak Esperanto?
If so and you'd like to chat, write me.  <EM>Cxu estas iuj ajn legantoj je la
</EM>Gazette<EM>, kiuj parolas Esperante?  Se jes, kaj se vi volus babili,
skribu al mi.</EM>
<P> 
<P>
Have fun!
