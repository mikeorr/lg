Subject: Thanks for your DNS articles in LG
</pre>
Hi Rick,
</p>

<p>
I just stumbled upon your DNS articles in Linux Gazette and although I first 
though this topic is not that interesting for me it turned out to be really 
really interesting!
</p>

<p>
I found out that the dns I used to use (dns from my university) was horribly 
slow and seemed not to use any caching mechanism - first request 200-300ms, 
second request 200-300ms :/
</p>

<p>
Then I checked out other dns servers like googles and opendns which were quite 
fast (1st -&gt;130  2nd -&gt;30ms). 
</p>

<p>
But as I don't like using google for everything (no googlemail account here <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> 
and I really dislike the "wrong" answer of opendns for nonexistent domains  
(as it breaks google search by typing into firefox url bar)
</p>

<p>
-&gt; I eventually installed Unbound and I'm really really happy with it.
</p>

<p>
Installation was really easy and the results are tremendous (especially given 
the fact that I surf most of the time on only a handful pages) - so speedup 
from 300ms to 0(for the second hit) - that's really nice. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>


<p>
The only minor drawback I see is that (as I have to run it locally on my box - 
yes I'm one of your oddballs <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> it looses its cache after reboot. - do you 
happen to know if there is something I could do against that?
</p>


<p>
Anyways - thank you for your great articles and improving my internet 
experience even further.
</p>

<p>
Kind regards,
Peter
</p>

[running a local copy of Unbound:]
</p>


<pre>
&gt; The only minor drawback I see is that (as I have to run it locally on
&gt; my box - yes I'm one of your oddballs <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> it looses its cache after
&gt; reboot. - do you happen to know if there is something I could do
&gt; against that?
</pre>

<p>
Yes, indeed, most recursive nameservers use RAM-based caches, and
Unbound certainly is among them.  That would indeed be at least slightly
irritating with workstations/laptops that get restarted frequently.
</p>


<p>
I can think offhand of two candidate solutions:
</p>

<p>
1.  dnscache from Dan Bernstein's djbdns package is the sole exception
I know of to that generalisation about RAM-based caches.  Instead, it
back-ends into an embedded copy of Bernstein's disk-based "cdb"
("constant database") package, <a href='http://cr.yp.to/cdb.html'>http://cr.yp.to/cdb.html</a> .  As I
mentioned in my article, there are four maintained forks of Prof.
Bernstein's package.  You could try one of those.
</p>

<p>
Prof. Bernstein's software tends to be... how shall I put it... a bit
eccentric in its design and operation, and I have only limited
experience with it, for a number of reasons.  Indeed, there's a certain
lovely irony in my recommending his software, having been among the
best-known critics of both his past licensing and some aspects of its
operation.  However, you might try it and see if you like it.
</p>

<p>
2.  It might be possible to use a recursive server with a RAM-based 
cache in conjunction with pdnsd
(<a href='http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Network_Other/dns-servers.html#pdnsd'>http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Network_Other/dns-servers.html#pdnsd</a>).  pdnsd
is a forwarder with disk-based cache, written specifically to service
workstations/laptops likely to getting rebooted.  From that perspective,
it's a pity that pdnsd is just a forwarder -- but my idea is to have
/etc/resolv.conf point to an instance of pdnsd (thus getting the benefit
of its persistent disk-based cache), and having pdnsd in turn point to a
full-service recursive nameserver such as Unbound.
</p>

<p>
Alas, I'm not 100% sure how one would configure such a setup, especially 
on a dynamic-IP workstation.  You would have to play with the software,
to see if that could be made to work.  E.g., it might be possible to 
make Unbound listen for queries on localhost port 9999 (picking an
example port number), and configure pdnsd issue queries to that same
host/port combination.
</p>


<p>
I hope that helps -- although I'm aware of my answers containing quite a
bit more handwaving than I'm happy with.

Dear Rick and TAG,
</p>

<p>
I liked Rick's article on the Village Lan (still to read the other
one).

I've been running pdnsd for a long time myself and after reading
the article I wondered a bit at the characterisation of pdnsd as an
iterative server rather than a recursive one.
</p>

<p>
It is <em>possible</em> to run pdnsd with only one server section which declares 
"root_server=on" and then lists all the known root servers.
</p>

<p>
In this case, I imagine that it does in fact do all the running
around gathering and caching authoritative information so it seems to
look less like Dwayne and more like Ralph ... but perhaps I'm missing
something (and I haven't checked the source!).
</p>

<p>
If running unbound would actually be better than doing this, I would
certainly like to know as I would start doing it right away!

<p>
That argues that it's not just a forwarder (which I already knew).  It
doesn't cast any light on whether it does iterative or recursive
service.
</p>

<p>
To be able to tell about that, you'd need to have your DNS client send
it a DNS query with the "RD" (recursion desired) bit set, and then
somehow (e.g., with a network sniffer) monitor the subsequent traffic.
If pdnsd comes back only once, with the end-result of pursuing the
delegation chain, _and_ assuming it didn't answer the query from cache,
then it was giving recursive service.  If the client is obliged to
follow up NXDOMAIN ("can't find that") answers with queries of names
higher up the chain towards the root, e.g., asking about linuxmafia.com
after getting NXDOMAIN on uncle-enzo.linuxmafia.com, or about .com after
getting NXDOMAIN on linuxmafia.com), then it's not recursing.
</p>

<p>
In writing my recent articles, and in compiling my bestiary of DNS
software for Linux
(<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Network_Other/dns-servers.html">http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Network_Other/dns-servers.html</a>) over the
years before it, one of the biggest obstacles has been lack of
information, and actual bad information, from the software authors about
what their codebases do and don't do -- with some notably honourable
exceptions, such as NLnet Labs, creators of NSD and Unbound.  In the
case of each package, I've spent considerable time reading available
documentation and some of the source code, to answer questions like the
one Kapil raises about pdnsd.  Does pdnsd do recursive service?  I
honestly cannot say for certain.  It's a pity the authors of such
packages don't make the answer clearer.  I can say only that I made my
best guess, where documentation didn't suffice -- as, sadly, it often
did not.
