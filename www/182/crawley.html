<h1>Protecting Your Linux Server from Root Password-Guessing Attacks</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/crawley.html">Don R. Crawley</a></b></p>

<p>
 Take one look at /var/log/secure on an Internet-connected server and
you'll immediately understand the need for securing your root account.	The
bad guys are constantly trying 'root' and other usernames, attempting to
login to your server using SSH or some other protocol.	If you use a simple
password, it's only a matter of time before your server is compromised by a
password-guessing attack. What can you do?
</p> 
 
<p>
 The best practice is to disallow SSH logins by root, thus eliminating a
big part of the risk.
</p> 
 
<p>
 The problem is that doing so also eliminates a lot of convenience for
sysadmins and complicates the use of tools such as WinSCP for file copy
from your Windows desktop or laptop to your Linux or UNIX server.
</p> 
 
<p>
 A fairly simple solution is to use public/private keypairs for
authentication.  The public key is stored on the Linux/UNIX server and the
private key is stored on your local Windows computer.  When you attempt to
connect to the Linux/UNIX server from your Windows computer, authentication
is done with the keypair instead of a password.  Password authentication is
actually disabled for root, so no amount of password guessing will work for
authentication.
</p> 
 
<p>
 Here's how to do it:
</p> 
 
<p>
1. Start by downloading the PuTTY Windows installer from <b>http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty-0.60-installer.exe</b>
.  Run the installer on your local Windows computer.
</p> 
 
<p>
 2.	Now, you must generate the keypairs.  The PuTTY Windows installer
you just ran installs an application called PuTTYgen that you can use to
generate the keypairs.	     The installer probably placed PuTTYgen (and
the other PuTTY applications) in Start&gt;&gt;All Programs&gt;&gt;PuTTY.
</p> 
 
<img src="misc/crawley/clip_image002.jpg"> 
 
<p>
 3.	When you run PuTTYgen for the first time, you must generate a new
keypair.  At the bottom of the PuTTYgen window are three parameters choices
including SSH-1 (RSA), SSH-2 RSA, and SSH-2 DSA.  SSH-2 RSA is the default
choice with a default key length of 1024 bits. Longer key lengths are more
secure, but require more processing power.  1024 bits is an acceptable
compromise at this time (late 2010), but may not be acceptable in the
future as computer processing power continues to increase.
</p> 
 
<img src="misc/crawley/clip_image004.jpg"> 
 
<p>
 4.	Click the button labeled Generate to produce your public and
private keys.  (You must move your mouse pointer over the blank area at the
top of the screen to generate some randomness for use in producing the
keypair.  Just move your mouse pointer in a cirular motion over the blank
area until the progress bar reaches the far right side and PuTTYgen
generates the keys.)
</p> 
 
<p>
 5.	You can now save the private key on your local laptop or desktop
computer and copy the public key to the remote Linux/UNIX server.
</p> 
 
<p>
 6.	Enter and confirm a passphrase to protect the private key in the
two fields in PuTTYgen.
</p> 
 
<p>
 7.	Click the button labeled 'Save private key' and select a location on
your local hard drive to save the private key.	     (Remember to protect
your private key by storing it securely!)  I also like to save my public
key as a text file to simplify using it in the future.
</p> 
 
<p>
 8.	Copy the gibberish-like text that is the public key (at the top of the
PuTTYgen window) and paste it into /root/.ssh/authorized_keys on your
server (you might have to create the .ssh directory and you'll probably
have to create the authorized_keys file.  Note also that the .ssh directory
is a hidden directory whose name starts with a period.)  If you saved your
public key as a text file in the previous step, you can simply copy the
contents of that file to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys.
</p> 
 
<img src="misc/crawley/clip_image006.jpg"> 
 
<p>
9. On your Linux/UNIX server, inspect /etc/ssh/sshd_config to ensure that
RSA authentication and public key authentication are both allowed by
modifying three lines in the sshd_config.  Depending on your system, you
will have to change "no" to "yes" or uncomment the lines to allow the
authentication.  Also, ensure that the path to the authorized_keys file is
set to "%h/.ssh/authorized_keys" and uncomment the line.  (I found the
three lines at approximately line 43 on a RedHat system and approximately
line 29 on a Debian system.)  When you're done, the lines should look like
this:
</p> 
 
<pre class="code">
RSAAuthentication yes
PubkeyAuthentication yes
AuthorizedKeysFile %h/.ssh/authorized_keys
</pre>

<p>
 10.  In order for the changes to be read into RAM, you must restart SSHD:
</p> 
 
<img src="misc/crawley/clip_image008.jpg"> 
 
<p>
 11.  If you attempt to log on now with the username root and the root
password, the logon attempt will be denied:
</p> 
 
<img src="misc/crawley/clip_image010.jpg"> 
 
<p>
 12.  You must now configure PuTTY to use the public/private key pair for
authentication.  Open PuTTY, in the left-hand menu area expand SSH and
select Auth.  On the right-hand side of the window, browse to the location
where you stored your private key or simply enter it in the field below
"Private key file for authentication:".
</p> 
 
<p>
<img src="misc/crawley/clip_image012.jpg"> 
 
<p>
 Again, in the left-hand menu, select Session (at the top of the list). On
the right-hand side of the screen, enter the IP address or hostname of your
Linux server and click the button labeled "Open".
</p> 
 
<p>
 13.  When PuTTY connects to the server, enter "root" for the username. 
You will be prompted for the passphrase you configured for your private
key.  Enter the correct passphrase and you should be logged on to your
server as root.
</p> 
 
<img src="misc/crawley/clip_image014.jpg"> 
 
<p>
 The benefit of performing the preceding steps is that it is nearly
impossible for an attacker to log on to your server as root by guessing the
password.  In order for the attacker to masquerade as root, she or he would
have to have your private key and know the passphrase associated with it.
