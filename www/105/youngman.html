<h1>Fine-tuning SpamAssassin</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/youngman.html">Neil Youngman</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>
SpamAssassin, as most of our readers will know, is a popular spam
classifier on Linux. This article assumes that you already have
SpamAssassin installed and working. If you are interested in running
SpamAssassin, but do not yet have it set up, there is a useful introduction at
<a href="http://linux.org.mt/article/killspam">http://linux.org.mt/article/killspam</a>.

<p>
When I set up SpamAssassin in Mandrake 9.2, it came very close to picking
up 100% of my spam. Over time, however, many of the spammers have figured
out how to fine tune their spam and bypass the default ruleset. I find the
default setup still picks up at least half the spam, maybe two thirds on a
good day, but too much leaks through.  If the spammers are tuning their
messages, I guess the only thing to do is to tune my scoring. There are at
least 8 possible ways of improving SpamAssassin's hit rate.

<ol>
  <li>Blacklisting known offenders</li>
  <li>DNS Blocklists</li>
  <li>Enable Bayesian filtering</li>
  <li>Reduce the point threshold for spam</li>
  <li>Increase the scores on existing rulesets</li>
  <li>Upgrade SpamAssassin to the latest version</li>
  <li>Install more rulesets</li>
  <li>Write your own rulesets</li>
</ol>

<h3>Configuring SpamAssassin</h3>
Fine-tuning SpamAssassin is, of course, done by editing the appropriate
configuration file. If the changes are just for your account, then you edit
~/.spamassassin/user_prefs. If you are making global changes, they go in
/etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf (and require root access.) I strongly
recommend testing changes in your local configuration before changing the global
configuration.

<p>
The options available in your configuration file are listed in <a
 href="http://spamassassin.org/doc/Mail_SpamAssassin_Conf.html">
http://spamassassin.org/doc/Mail_SpamAssassin_Conf.html</a>, as well as in
the relevant manpage (see "man Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf".)

<h3>SpamAssassin's Scoring Mechanism</h3>
In principle, SpamAssassin's scoring mechanism is simple. There are a
set of rules for identifying spam, scores associated with those rules,
and an overall threshold score. If the total score for all the rules
triggered by a message reaches the threshold, that message is marked as
spam.

<p>
Most of the complexity is in the rules, but it's rarely necessary to
roll your own SpamAssassin rules. Adjusting the threshold and the
scores associated with existing rules is much simpler and can be very
effective. If that's not enough, there are also additional
rulesets available to download. Of course, if you think writing you
own rulesets sounds like a fun thing to do, I've included a pointer
<a href="#rules">below</a> to get you started.

<p>
Most of the rules are listed in <a
href="http://spamassassin.org/tests.html">http://spamassassin.org/tests.html</a> 
along with their associated scores, but the scores listed did not match those in
my configuration files. They were probably from a newer release. You
will probably find the default scores for your configuration in
/usr/share/spamassassin/50_scores.cf, where there are 4 scores
associated with each rule. The rule chosen depends on whether Bayesian
analysis (see below) and network tests are enabled. Where only one
score is supplied, that score is always used. Other options, such as
relative scores, are described in the aforementioned documentation.

<h3>False positives, whitelisting, and blacklisting</h3>
No spam filter gets it right all the time, and there are 2 types of
errors. False negatives are bad, because that means a spam was missed
and allowed to slip through the net. False positives, however, are worse,
because you may miss something you should have seen, which has been
tagged as spam. No spam filter should ever be configured to automatically
delete email without human review. Spam should always be dropped into a
quarantine area, which should be reviewed at frequent intervals to ensure
that genuine emails aren't missed.

<p>
Regular reviews are even more important as you tune your settings. No
matter how careful you are, there is no guarantee that any change to the
settings won't cause some collateral damage.  Even with the default setup,
you will see some false positives, e.g. newsletters from <a
href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/">The National Trust</a> and <a
href="http://www.roh.org.uk">The Royal Opera House</a> get marked as spam,
so a key part of managing your spam - especially in the beginning -
involves reviewing the hits and determine which senders you need to
"whitelist".

<p>
Whitelisting is usually done with the settings <code>whitelist_from</code> and
<code>whitelist_to</code>. These can be repeated as many times as you like. Simple
<em>globbing</em> patterns (see "man bash" and search for "Pattern
Matching" for a description) are used to specify wildcard matches. E.g.,
'?' matches a single character and '*' matches any number of characters
(including zero.) <code>whitelist_from</code> and <code>whitelist_to</code>
subtract 100 points from the score, making it very rare for matching emails
to reach the spam threshold.

<pre>
whitelist_from nice.but_clueless@example.net
whitelist_from *@importantclient.example.com
</pre>

Also available are options <code>more_spam_to</code>,
<code>all_spam_to</code>. According to the documentation, &quot;There are
three levels of To-whitelisting, <code>whitelist_to, more_spam_to and
all_spam_to</code>. Users in the first level may still get some spammish
mails blocked, but users in<code>all_spam_to</code> should never get mail
blocked.&quot;

<p>
You should consider using <code>all_spam_to</code> for postmaster
addresses. It's very annoying if someone tries to report a spam and has
their report blocked or rejected as spam.

<p>
You may sometimes see a large number of emails slipping through from a
particular sender. Usually sender IDs are forged and chosen
randomly. There is little point blacklisting most senders, but sometimes it
can be worthwhile. A more useful option is blacklisting based on
recipients. If your email address is a.white@example.com you may see a
lot of spam with nearby addresses, such as a.wharton@example.com and
a.winter@example.com in the cc list and these recipients can be
blacklisted. 

<p>
According to the documentation blacklisting is done with the settings
<code>blacklist_from</code> and <code>blacklist_to</code>, but you may find
that<code>blacklist_to</code> doesn't work on versions of SpamAssassin
older than 2.6.0.

<pre>
blacklist_from *@evilspammers.example.org
blacklist_to a.wharton@example.com
blacklist_to *.wi*@example.com
</pre>

There are a number of other settings for blacklisting and whitelisting.
Global settings can be overridden locally by <code>unwhitelist_from,
unwhitelist_to, unblacklist_from</code> and <code>unblacklist_to</code>.
Please read the documentation to find out more about these and other
available settings.

<h3>DNS Blocklists</h3>
DNS Blocklists are another form of blacklisting. They are externally
maintained lists of mail servers which have been identified as sources
of spam or open relays. These are sometimes referred to as RBLs
(Realtime Blackhole Lists).

<p>
SpamAssassin checks the headers to see if the email has been relayed
through any hosts with matches in certain blocklists. This is known
not to work with a number of configurations because it only checks the
first DNS entry in resolv.conf; if this does not point to a working
DNS server, it will not work. This is a known problem under Mandrake
9.2.

<p>
DNS Blocklists can be disabled with the option skip_rbl_checks.


<h3>Enable Bayesian filtering</h3>
Bayesian analysis is a statistical technique in which the frequency of
words in emails are analysed, according to how often they appear in
spam and how often they appear in other emails. The content of
incoming emails is then analysed to assign a probability of the email
being spam.

<p>
Bayesian analysis is a feature of recent versions of SpamAssassin and
I find it very effective. Some work is required to build and maintain
the database, but it is well worth the small effort involved.

<p>
To configure SpamAssassin to use Bayesian analysis you add the line

<pre>
use_bayes	1
</pre>
to your user_prefs file.

<p>
You won't see any matches for Bayesian analysis yet. The algorithm
requires at least 200 spam emails in it's database before it will
assign any probability to your emails. To get to this point collect
your spam emails in a separate mailbox and run

<pre>
sa-learn --spam --mbox ~/Mail/spamtrap 
</pre>

Often you will see that the number of emails it has learned from
(analysed) is less than the number that appear to be in the mailbox it
is learning from. This is because it has detected that some emails are
duplicates of emails it has seen before.

<p>
You should also give it your "ham" emails to learn from using the command

<pre> 
 $ sa-learn --ham --mbox ~/Mail/inbox
</pre>

Once it has learned from more than 200 spam emails you should start
seeing matches in the headers like

<pre>
BAYES_90           (4.5 points)  BODY: Bayesian classifier says spam probability is 90 to 99%
</pre>

Don't stop feeding it data when it starts to work. The more data it
has, the more accurate it should be. If you are short of disk space,
you should bear in mind that the database can get quite large. Mine is
about 10MB.

<p>
If at any time you accidentally classify a message incorrectly this
can be corrected. Move the message to a temporary folder, then use the
command

<pre>
sa-learn --forget --mbox ~/Mail/temp 
</pre>

then move it back to the correct folder and classify it as usual.


<h3>Reduce the points threshold for spam</h3>
The simplest approach to catching more spam is just to reduce the
points threshold. This can be quite effective. The default is to mark
a message as spam when it scores 5 points or more. Reducing this will
catch a lot more spam, but it will also increase the risk of false
positives.

<p>
In my experience a threshold of 3.0 or 3.5 will increase the amount of
spam caught dramatically, but won't produce significantly more false
positives. This is achieved very simply by changing or adding the
required_hits setting, e.g.

<pre>
required_hits	3.5
</pre>

If you have been using SpamAssassin for a while you can use grep to
assess the level at which you are likely to see a significant increase
in false positives. This is done by searching your mail folders for
X-Spam-Status header lines with different scores.

<pre>
$ grep 'X-Spam-Status: .* hits=[5-9]\.' ~/Mail/inbox | wc -l
      1
$ grep 'X-Spam-Status: .* hits=[34]\.' ~/Mail/inbox | wc -l
      4
$ grep 'X-Spam-Status: .* hits=2\.' ~/Mail/inbox | wc -l
     10
$
</pre>

The first command shows that there is only 1 mail in my inbox that has
scored between 5.0 and 9.9 points. The second that there are 4 mails
that scored between 3.0 and 4.9 points and the third that 10 mails
scored between 2.0 and 2.9 points. It should be borne in mind that
this ignores all emails from before setting up SpamAssassin and all
emails that you have deleted since that time.

<h3>Increase the scores on existing rulesets</h3>
After you've got Bayesian analysis working and you've decided on the
threshold that's appropriate for you, there will no doubt still be
some spam getting through. It's time to delve into the headers and
find out what rules need higher scores.

<p>
Before we start, I should say that the default scores have been tuned
using a <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/GeneticAlgorithm">genetic
algorithm</a>. Should you trust your judgment against that algorithm?
My opinion is that spam is evolving. Many of them are tested
against the default SpamAssassin rules and fine tuned until they
pass. Also everyone's spam problem is different. Statistically, what
works for a large database of spam, possibly going back years, isn't
necessarily the best for your current spam problem. If you find that
your tuning efforts make the problem worse, you can always go back to
the defaults.

<p>
Incoming messages should have some headers that indicate which rules
were triggered. These look like:

<pre>
X-Spam-Status: No, hits=3.0 required=3.5
	tests=BAYES_50,USER_AGENT
	version=2.55
</pre>

These headers will not normally be displayed, but any decent mail
client will have an option to display all headers. In kmail this
option is View-&gt;Headers-&gt;All.

<p>
If you do not see these headers when you have all headers displayed,
take a look at the section "Other Options" at the end of this article
for the option controlling headers.

<p>
Looking at the matches given above, Bayesian analysis has given the
mail a 50-60% probability of being spam. I have sufficient confidence in
the Bayesian analysis to make anything with a probability of 50% or
more spam, so I set the scores for those rules to my current
threshold of 3.5.   

<p>
Here's another one that sneaked in under the radar.

<pre>
X-Spam-Status: No, hits=1.6 required=3.5
        tests=HTML_20_30,MIME_HTML_ONLY,USER_AGENT
        version=2.55
</pre>

The USER_AGENT rule isn't very interesting. Most mail has a user-agent
header and this scores 0.001. We'll leave that alone. The other tests
seem to contradict each other, one apparently saying that that the
message is all HTML and the other that it's 20-30% HTML. I would guess
that the 20-30% is the ratio of HTML tags to text, so it can be all
HTML, but not all tags.

<p>
So, how should we adjust the scoring? HTML_20_30 matches 6 times in 8
months of legitimate email, but it matches a third of the mail
currently in my spam folder, so it should be scored highly, but not
highly enough to be conclusive on it's own. It seems to be scored at
1.47, which may be a bit low, but it's not far wrong. MIME_HTML_ONLY
matched 1 legitimate email, but matches 95% of my spam. Strangely this
only scores 0.1. I'm going to treat it as almost conclusive and score
it at 3.0, requiring only another 0.5 points to trigger a match on my
threshold of 3.5.

<p>
Another email got through with these matches:

<pre>
X-Spam-Status: No, hits=1.5 required=3.5
        tests=GET_IT_NOW,HTML_10_20
        version=2.55
</pre>

Looking at my email, I find that HTML_10_20 matches a lot of legitimate
email, as well as spam and GET_IT_NOW only matches 1 spam.

<pre>
$ grep HTML_10_20 ~/Mail/spamtrap | wc -l
     19
$ grep HTML_10_20 ~/Mail/inbox ~/Mail/mailing-lists | wc -l
      8
$ grep GET_IT_NOW ~/Mail/inbox ~/Mail/mailing-lists | wc -l
      0
$ grep GET_IT_NOW ~/Mail/spamtrap  | wc -l
      1
$
</pre>

In this case I can't justify changing the scoring for either rule.


<h3>Upgrade SpamAssassin to the latest version</h3>

<p>
If, like me, you aren't running the very latest distribution you may
find that you are a little behind the curve. The standard rulesets are
always evolving and just running a more recent version should help to
catch more Spam.

<p>
As I write the latest stable version of SpamAssassin is 2.63 and 3.00
is under development. The latest versions can be downloaded from <a
href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/downloads.html">
http://spamassassin.apache.org/downloads.html</a>.


<h3>Install more rulesets</h3>
There are <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/CustomRulesets"> custom
rulesets</a> available on <a
href="http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/"> the 
SpamAssassin Wiki</a>, <A HREF="http://www.rulesemporium.com" > the SpamAssassin
Rules Emporium (SARE) </A>
and elsewhere.

<p>
I have not installed any of these rulesets and I am not recommending
any of them. You should read the documentation and evaluate their
suitability carefully before installing any new rulesets and monitor
the results once they are installed.


<a name="rules"></a><h3>Write your own rulesets</h3>

<p>
Rolling your own SpamAssassin rules is likely to be a minority
interest, but I guess it will appeal to some of our readers. If you
spot a pattern in your spam that there doesn't seem to be a rule for,
or you are just terminally curious then read <a href="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/mkettler/sa/SA-rules-howto.txt">
"A straightforward guide to writing your own add-on rules for
SpamAssassin"</a>, by Matt Kettler.

<h3>Other Options</h3>
As well as adjusting the scoring, there a a range of options with
which you can modify various aspects of SpamAssassin's behaviour. Here
are descriptions from the documentation for some that I consider
useful.

<pre>
    rewrite_subject { 0 | 1 } (default: 0)
        By default, the subject lines of suspected spam will not be tagged.
        This can be enabled here.

    always_add_headers { 0 | 1 } (default: 1)
        By default, X-Spam-Status, X-Spam-Checker-Version, (and optionally
        X-Spam-Level) will be added to all messages scanned by SpamAssassin.
        If you don't want to add the headers to non-spam, set this value to
        0. See also always_add_report.

    always_add_report { 0 | 1 } (default: 0)
        By default, mail tagged as spam includes a report, either in the
        headers or in an attachment (report_safe). If you set this to option
        to 1, the report will be included in the X-Spam-Report header, even
        if the message is not tagged as spam. Note that the report text
        always states that the mail is spam, since normally the report is
        only added if the mail is spam.

        This can be useful if you want to know what rules the mail
        triggered, and why it was not tagged as spam. See also
        always_add_headers.

    spam_level_stars { 0 | 1 } (default: 1)
        By default, a header field called "X-Spam-Level" will be added to
        the message, with its value set to a number of asterisks equal to
        the score of the message. In other words, for a message scoring 7.2
        points:

        X-Spam-Level: *******

        This can be useful for MUA rule creation.

    spam_level_char { x (some character, unquoted) } (default: *)
        By default, the "X-Spam-Level" header will use a '*' character with
        its length equal to the score of the message. Some people don't like
        escaping *s though, so you can set the character to anything with
        this option.

        In other words, for a message scoring 7.2 points with this option
        set to .

        X-Spam-Level: .......
</pre>
