Subject: Newbie Needs More Definitive Article on Parallel Port Tape Drives

<p>The various leads which can be followed from the parport home page tend 
to indicate that it's just not worth all the hassle to try to operate a 
tape on the parallel port, unless you are an expert and maybe want to 
program it yourself.  I just cannot believe that it is that difficult.

<p>I would appreciate it if you were to provide an article which, in simple, 
newbie language, tells how to do it.  The article should include 
definitive solutions for every brand of parallel port tape drive which is 
commonly available.  Mine is  an HP-1000 travan-1.  My system is Redhat 
4.1.

One can imagine that some linux devotees enjoy the abstruseness of things 
new and difficult and exclusive.  Contrary to that viewpoint, I believe 
that we all should strive to make linux easier and more available to the 
relatively uninformed.  Probably you share my feeling.

That's as close as I can come to a flaming request right now.  I really 
appreciate all the good stuff in the Gazette.

<p>Thank you,<br>

Subject: Please help me....


<p>Recently, ever since I upgraded to Slackware 3.2/Redhat 4.1, I have
noticed that my modem has been behaving rather erratically. My modem is a
Motorola ModemSurfr 28.8. Now, when I type 'ppp-on' to initiate a ppp
session, many times, the modems TR led lights up, and then nothing happens,
until the computer times out 45 seconds later and aborts the ppp session.
Normally, when I type 'ppp-on' the modem almost immediately begins dialing
up my isp, and connecting, but most of the time, it would just sit there,
until I killed the process and tried again, it may take up to twelve or
more tries
for the modem to dial, but sometimes it will dial on the first try. 
This erratic behavior only began occurring (from what I can tell, I'm not
sure) ever since I upgraded to redhat 4.1, and now slackware 3.2. My modem
does work fine in windows 95, and also if I use DIP, or minicom to try and
connect. So I was wondering if this may be a timing error somewhere in the
ppp-on script. Has anyone else had similar problems? I myself tried
tweaking some of the abort timeouts, but that didn't help. 

<p>Someone please help me!
Thanks for any help suggestions...<br>

Jari

<p>I'm trying to install linux red hat 2.0.x in a machine with an

The problem is that the bootdisk does not recognize the host adapter,

may be the problem is that the driver aic7xxx is old and doesn't work

I always thought, but take a look at this:

fakeuser:x:1005:100:Nobody:/home/fakeuser:/bin/bash
% chown fakeuser ChownTest
chown: ChownTest: Operation not permitted
</pre>
<p>I've tried it on various systems and it turns out that I can't make an
ybody
the owner of my files when I'm a user (root obviously can). Why? I'd b

Subject: Firewire and DV

<p>Hi,<br>

I've nearly got my brother converted to Linux, except he's interested
in using firewire cards and whatever software to edit video from
a DV camera. After some web-searching, and a several sites, it
seems that there are no firewire drivers or spiffy DV software for
Linux.

<p>Even worse, Adaptec, who manufacture what appears to be becoming a
very popular card, are only supporting MS and Mac platforms. To add
insult to injury, their FAQ, in response to a question about the
possibility of drivers for Un*x, etc., contains the single word "No",
no explanation or euphemisms, just "No".

<p>At this point in time, horror of horrors, it looks like I'm going
to wind up with my brother using NT. Frankly, I'd rather have a
sister in a whorehouse than a brother using NT. Check out Mitch
Stone's excellent site at <a href="http://www.vcnet.com/bms">http://www.vcnet.com/bms</a> for why.

<p>Does anybody know different? Are there any plans afoot in this
direction? Maybe somebody in a position of influence could lean on
some firewire card manufacturers to make their driver software
available for porting to Linux? Maybe the Linux community could
email <a href="mailto:sales@adaptec.com">sales@adaptec.com</a> or <a
href="mailto:support@adaptec.com">support@adaptec.com</a> asking them to 
reconsider making drivers available?

<p>Any information about the possibility of DV editing software or 
firewire drivers would be most appreciated. I'll help if I can.

<p>Thanks,<br>

Emmet.

<p>Do you have any idea what the longest uptime on a linux system is?  I have
a system with over 14 months of uptime, and am wondering if its heading
for some kind of record.  I've been told that with the 1.2.x kernels,
uptimes longer than about 16.4 months are thought to be impossible due to
jiffy counter wrap.

Subject: Re: Changing video modes

<p>A friend of mine wants to know how to change video modes without
restarting X, and I noticed you say you can do that on your Linux page.
How can this be done? (I'm using XFree86, he's using MkLinux)

<p>Just changing *modes* is easy:  use ctrl-alt-gray+ and ctrl-alt-gray-
to cycle between the resolutions defined in your XF86Config file.  I
have the following defined:

<pre>Modes   "1280x1024" "1536x1152" "1600x1200" "640x480" "800x600" "1024x768"
</pre>
To run multiple X servers is a little trickier, and I've been meaning
to write up a Linux Gazette or Linux Journal article on that.  Assuming
you use startx instead of xdm, the basic trick is to do something like
this:
<pre>startx -- :4 -bpp 32 &</pre>

My default (16-bit mode) command is this:

<pre>startx -- :1 -bpp 16 &</pre>

You can switch between them via ctrl-alt-F7 through F10, typically--
F1 through F6 tend to be normal text-mode Linux consoles.

<p>It's really best to alias these things and make sure the screen numbers
(:0 or :2 or whatever) don't collide; if they do, the second X server
will "steal" the number from the first, and you won't be able to start
any more windows or even restart the window manager under the first
server.

<p>The special 320x200 game mode is even more complicated, and I won't
even try to explain that here.  It can be done with a second XF86Config
or with additional lines in the main one under some circumstances.

<p>I don't know how AccelX and XiGraphics and MetroX handle these things.

<p>Check out the Linux SMP page at 

<a href="http://www.uk.linux.org/SMP/title.html">http://www.uk.linux.org/SMP/title.html</a>

and get a new distribution.  I think that SMP became part of the
standard kernel at 2.0, so 2.0.?? might be a good choice (check out the
SMP page, I think some patch levels are broken with respect to SMP).

<p>If you are pretty good a Linux installs (and from the multiplicity of
your OS's is sounds like you are), you could pick up a RedHat
distribution for less than USD $10.  I can't help you with availability
in Sweden, but check out Caldera, RedHat, Craftworks, SuSE and Yggdrasil
(sp?), I think most of them support SMP.  If you need pointers to their
web pages, try <a href="http://www.linuxmall.com">http://www.linuxmall.com</a>, <a

<p><I>1.Will a Sony CDU926S burner work with xcdroast?
  Don't know about this one, but I may have to find out soon.  I'd like to
  create a CD full of graphics tools, but I've never tried to do anything
  like this before.  If I do find info I'll probably write it up in my
  Graphics Muse column in the Gazette.</I>

<p><I>2. What is a good, but cheap flatbed scanner to use? (Good means 24 bit
  color and &gt;= 300dpi optical resolution.) What software (in Linux) 
  supports the scanner? </I>

<P><B>Answer</B>: Check my March 1997 <a href="http://www.xxc.com/lg">Graphics 
Muse column</a>. 
I did a review of the scanners
currently supported (at that time).  A good place to look (which is
listed in that issue of the Muse) is the SANE Project.

<P><I>3.I can't afford one, but... Are there any 35mm slide scanners on the
  market with Linux support? </I>
<P><B>Answer</B>:I haven't seen any announced yet.  I get info like this alot due to my
  work with Graphics Tools for Linux, but so far no one has pointed out any
  web pages or ftp sites for such drivers.

<P><I>4.And as long as I'm asking dumb questions... Does Linux have support
  for any digital cameras yet? </I>
<P><B>Answer</B>:Don't waste your money on these just yet, even if a driver exists (I
  haven't seen one of these either).  Even the vendors have been saying
  this technology is too new and they haven't established the "rules of the
  game" for standards or formats.  Many are using ordinary JPEG formats, but
  getting the data to your PC is variable and depends on the makers choice of
  protocols, connectors and so forth.

Subject: Interfacing Genius Color Page-CS Scanner
<p>You asked about using your Genius Scanner with Linux.  I don't know if a
driver is available although in a survey of scanners I did for the Graphics
Muse Column (March 1997, Issue 15) of the Linux Gazette there was info on
the Genius GS-B105G, Genius GS4500 and probably the GS4000 and GS4500A.
Also, there is work being done on generic scanner support for the GIMP and
other Linux applications via the <a
href="http://www.azstarnet.com/~axplinux/sane">SANE project</a>.

<p>I suggest you either look for the author of the Genius scanners to see if 
support for your particular scanner is forthcoming (assuming yours is from 
the same manufacturer as his).  You should also check with the SANE Project
to see if they have any ideas.  Both should have pointers on how to write
drivers and get info the specs for that scanner if they don't already have
it.

<p>One other place to look is http://tummy.com.  This is the site for XVScan,
a front end to xv that primarily supports HP scanners.  They can also write the
driver for a fee.  XVScan is a commercial product.

Subject: Descent 3 for Linux?

<p>Linux has always been the perfect platform for games, it's just
very few developers (id and Crack.com are the only two worth mentioning
that I know of) know that.  Interplay and Parallax are developing the
third game in their Descent series, and they're accepting ideas, so I
think the Linux community should inform them of the benefits of
supporting a Linux version.  There have already been several (last
estimate I heard was 90) people who have suggested that they support
Linux, and they probably will if they're convinced enough people would
buy it, so if you're interested in having the best DOS game ported to
Linux, see <a href="http://www.interplay.com/descent/ideas">http://www.interplay.com/descent/ideas</a> and suggest Linux
support.
