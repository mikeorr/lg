&gt; dear linuxgazette,
&gt; 
&gt; i've read about migrating mail server to postfix/cyrus/openldap, , ,
&gt; 
&gt; i've tried u'r tutorial, , ,

<p>
Who's "u'r"? I'm pretty sure it was Rene Pfeiffer who wrote that
article, not "u'r".

<p>
HINT: please use standard English, and preferably standard punctuation
as well. As you already know, your English isn't of the best; please
don't make it any more difficult by adding <strong>more</strong> levels of obscurity to
it.

<pre>
&gt; but i've some error when execute the perl script,,
&gt; 
&gt; i've attach the screenshoot of the error  and the script, , ,
</pre>

<p>
Next time, please just copy and paste the error. It's plain text, so
there's no need for screenshots.
 
The error - which I've had to transcribe from your screenshot (an
unnecessary waste of time) - was
</p>

<pre>
Communications Error at ./cgate_migrate_ldap.pl line 175, &lt;DATA&gt; line 225.
</pre>

<p>
Taking a look at line 175 of the script shows a pretty good possibility
for where the possible problem might be:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
173 --&gt;  # Bind to servers
174 --&gt;  $mesg = $ldap_source-&gt;bind($binddn_source, password =&gt; 'ldapbppt');
175 --&gt;  $mesg-&gt;code &amp;&amp; die $mesg-&gt;error;
</pre>

<p>
That is, you're trying to bind to a server using the same password that
Rene had used in his article. Unless you're using that password, the
connection is going to fail.

If you use correct language you also decreased the probability of ending
in spam folders. Both filter systems I use trash illegible e-mails on
sight.

<p>
I'd suggest the same. Your error is most probably from a failed bind
attempt.

<p>
Best,
Ren?.
