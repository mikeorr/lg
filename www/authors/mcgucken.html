<em>

Dr. Elliot McGucken currently leads UNC Chapel Hill's Artistic
Entrepreneurship Initiative, where he teaches New Media Arts, Technology,
and Entrepreneurship 101.

<p> Born in Ohio, Dr. E grew up outdoors except for when he was sitting in
front of a computer.  He received a B.A. in physics from Princeton and a
Ph.D. in physics from UNC Chapel Hill where his dissertation on an
artifical retina for the blind received several NSF grants and a Merrill
Lynch Innovations Award.  The retina-chip research appeared in
publications including Popular Science and Business Week, and the project
continues to this day.

<p> In 1995 Elliot founded Classicals & jollyroger.com LLC as a technological
tribute to the Great Books, and he recently spoke at the Harvard Law
School concerning his authena.org project for Open Source software for
managing digital rights for artists.  Elliot, known as "Dr. E" to his
students, has taught physics and programming at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, and has published a poetry book, a novel, a
collection of essays, several scientific articles, and poetry in The Wall
Street Journal. The New York Times deemed jollyroger.com "simply
unprecedented," adding that the site "teems with discussion, the kind that
goes well beyond freshman lit 101." The Los Angeles Times referred to the
classical portal as "a lavish virtual community known as The Jolly Roger."

<p> His two latest projects, authena.org and 22surf.org, seek to empower indy
artists, authors, musicians, and creators with Open Source Content
Management Systems. Dr. E harbors a vast respect for the indy author and
artist, for the entrepreneur and visionary, for the giants of yesteryear
whose shoulders we all stand upon. He hopes that authena and 22surf might
be of some use to fellow artists and hackers alike.

<p> His latest novel, Autumn Rangers, is being developed as a book,
screenplay, and video game at autumnrangers.com.
