<H3>Buoys (and the Netherlands, and music)</H3>

<P>
<STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
CBC's <I>As It Happens</I> did a story about Dial-a-Buoy, an experimental
program that lets boaters and kayakers call a phone number and get a
computer-collected hourly report of weather and ocean conditions from
any of ten buoys floating off the coast of Maine, Massachusetts, Nova
Scotia and Newfoundland.

<LI> <A HREF="http://www.gomoos.org/news/dialabuoy.html">GoMOOS, Gulf of Maine Ocean Observation System</A>
  </UL>

But the radio talkbacks for the next three days focused not on this
technology or its uses, but on the proper pronunciation of buoy.  Some
argued "boo-ey", others "boy".
Yours truly has always heard boo-ey, but the most interesting call came
from a mariner in Nova Scotia who insisted the word came from Dutch
and should be pronounced boy.
(Webster accepts both.  OED Online wants $29.95/month to reveal the
true answer.)

<P>
<STRONG>[Frank Rodolf (Frodo)]</STRONG> 
While I don't know the exact pronunciation in English, I can confirm that
the word does come from Dutch. The Dutch spelling is "boei", and has two
meanings. The first being "buoy", the other being "shackle" (as used to
hold wrists or ankles in place, in old prisons).

<P> In Dutch, it is pronounced like boy, but with a "longer" o. So, kinda like
"booy".

    A lot of yachting terms (and quite a number of nautical terms in
    general) come from Dutch. After all, they started the whole yachting
    thing by giving a "jacht" ("hunter" - it was a fast-sailing ship
    designed to catch smugglers), "Mary", to Charles II on his restoration
    in 1660.

    <P> &lt;grin&gt; I only go with the best, of course. "Ulysses" was built in
    Holland (Hardewijk). 

    <P>
    <STRONG>[Frodo]</STRONG> 
    These days, the word "jacht" is used for just about any sail ship,
    longer than about 10 meters or so.

    <P>
    <STRONG>[Ben]</STRONG> 
    <grin> A friend of mine told me that the difference between a boat and a
    yacht was that yachts have a barbecue grill on the stern. I guess
    "Ulysses" is a yacht, then.

    <P>
    <STRONG>[Frodo]</STRONG> 
    Just a shame you call it Holland.

        &lt;blink&gt; I'm familiar with the term "Netherlands", but I wasn't
        aware that there was any reason to prefer one over the other. IIRC,
        Geert refers to the country as "Holland". Story, please?

        <P>
        <STRONG>[Frodo]</STRONG> 
        K - the short version...
        Netherlands is the official name of the country. Holland is part of the
        Netherlands.

        <P> Basically, Holland consists of two of the 12 Dutch provinces,
        although - in the past - the name was often used to indicate the "7
        provincien" (7 provinces), who were working together in the 17th and
        part of the 18th century[*], against the Spanish and other countries
        that for some reason or other wanted to take them over.

        <P> Nowadays, you will find that most people that say Holland instead of
        Netherlands are from those 7 provinces. I, being from Limburg, know
        better though.

        Ah! OK, thanks. I've got a Flemish friend who gave me
        about a 20-page lesson on Flemish history when I asked what the
        difference was; wonderfully interesting, as European history tends to
        be.

        I got a (friendly) lecture from a Luxembourgish oi singer when I made the
        heinous mistake of calling his band a German band on my web page.

        <P> I told him I'd been to Luxembourg City once and described this
        beautiful bridge, and he said he lived in the very same district.  I
        said I had seen screensavers with "unique letters" on them, i-umlaut,
        etc.  He said Luxemourg became independent when the Luxembourgers
        realized the various occupiers couldn't understand a word they were
        saying.

        <BLOCKQUOTE><!-- begin LUXEMBOURG HISTORY -->
            <P>
            <STRONG>[Frodo]</STRONG> 
            LOL - Actually, it is a bit different... In 1815, after Napoleon
            was finally sent away, what is now the Netherlands, Belgium and
            Luxembourg became one kingdom, under king William I.

            <P> In 1830, Belgium separated from the Netherlands, after a war,
            and became a separate kingdom. Luxembourg still had the Dutch
            monarch as its grand duke.  Only in 1890, when king William III of
            the Netherlands died, and left behind only a daughter, no son, did
            Luxembourg became a separate country.  In Luxembourg then only men
            could be the grand duke.  Luxembourg then "switched" to another
            branch of the house Nassau.

            <P> Till about 50 or so years ago, most Luxembourgeois still at the
            very least understood Dutch. Now only some old (read: over 80)
            people sometimes still understand it.
        </BLOCKQUOTE><!-- end LUXEMBOURG HISTORY -->

        <P>
        <STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
        We also made a joke about "Luxembourgish" (as he said it) vs 
        "Luxembourgeois" (as printed on French brochures, which has an, ahem,
        unintended connotation in English).

        <P>
        <STRONG>[Frodo]</STRONG> 
        Uhm... Okay, it is clear I know too well, how it is pronounced in
        French... I have no idea how it would have an unintended connotation in
        English... lol


        <P>
        <STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
        The last part looks like "bourgeois", which means, well, ask Ben.
        Capitalist oppressors, enemy of the proletariat, that sort of stuff.

I always thought this was another AE (boo-ey) vs. BE (boy) issue.

It could be.  That would explain why Canadians go back and forth.
Do any Americans pronounce "boy"?
Although I do think buoyant is universally pronounced "boy-ant".

It just reflects the difference in the usage at sea. Of boys, I mean. <IMG ALT=":)" SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="24">

Is that where that's from?  I knew it from "Frigging in the Rigging" 
from the soundtrack to the Sex Pistols film.

<P>
<STRONG>[Ben]</STRONG> 
Shanteymen were singing that one long before the Sex Pistols were born.
 And the first verse does indeed say something about "Frigging in the
Rigging". Last Thursday or so, I was over at a local pub singing
shanties with "The Bilge Rats", the finest group of local singers that
ever banged a beer mug on a table.  (One of'em is from Lunnon-town, and a
damn fine fellow.)

<P> I should look up that film - it would be interesting to see the Sex Pistols
doing that one!

<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
They only did it as filler; Johnny Rotton had quit by then <IMG ALT=":)" SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="24"> I was 
pretty disappointed when I got that; though they do a good cover of 
"(Not Your) Stepping Stone". The film's called <I>The Great Rock 'N' Roll

I never got into the Pistols, but it's now at least a small checkmark on

In the early 80s Oi! was hijacked by the BNP in Britain, and for a long 
time was firmly associated with racism.

<P>
<STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
... in the media's mind.  But many oi fans and bands hotly resented the
hijacking.  Is the Union Jack fascist just because the BNP abused it too?
The National Front even tried to claim *Madness* as one of its own,
against the wishes of the band, saying that white bandmembers = white
power.  Madness not only denied the charges but played in the
"Rock Against Racism" concerts.  

<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
The media pounced on punk in general, as far as I can remember. I can't say I'd
heard that about Madness before though. They must've really been clutching at
straws to come up with that!

<P> I presume nobody else listens to metal, but the essential albums are:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
[metal]
Slayer: Reign In Blood
Metallica: Master of Puppets
Megadeth: Rust In Peace
Carcass: Heartwork
Opeth: Blackwater Park
In Flames: Clayman
Sepultura: Chaos A.D.
Nine Inch Nails: The Downward Spiral
Ministry: Psalm 69
Tool: Lateralus
Helmet: Betty

<P>
<STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
I don't like metal, but I will admit to having listened to it in junior
high (early 1980s).  Black Sabbath, Dio, Iron Maiden, Ozzy Osbourne, Judas
Priest -- that must all be music to Jimmy's ears.

<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
Ew, no. I hate all that 80s hair metal crap.  I started off with grunge
(1993), moved on to punk, then hardcore, then metal.  First I got into Nirvana,
then the Sex Pistols. I bought a punk compilation, and fell in love with
Discharge.  At that point, I hated metal. Then I listened to Pantera - "Fucking
Hostile" is a hardcore punk song and Sepultura - Chaos AD is as even a mix of
hardcore and metal you'll ever find.  I mostly stick to metal where the punk
lineage is still in some way present (e.g., Carcass' guitarist started off in a
Discharge-influenced band, Napalm Death started as a punk band etc etc).  At
first I started listening to death metal to improve my guitar playing, but now
I actually like it. I've started trying to play jazz guitar recently, but I
still can't listen to most of it!

<P> Even with metal, which is commonly derided as idiotic, you get
stuff like death metal, thrash metal, melodic death metal, black metal,
symphonic black metal, NWOBHW, grunge etc etc.

<P>
<STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
"symphonic" metal?  "melodic" metal?  Aren't those oxymorons?

<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
That's symphonic black metal and melodic death metal. Black metal is an
even faster version of death metal, with overtly Satanic lyrics.
Symphonic black metal is black metal using orchestras.

<P>
<STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
Metal using orchestras???  Mendelssohn and Schubert must be turning over
in their graves.  I may have to hear this once in my life.

<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
Black Sabbath were a blues band.

<P>
<STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
Blues???  "My honey won' come home, my honey won' come home, I ain't
married no more" blues?  Very vaguely maybe.

<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
It's true. Listen to "Planet Caravan".

<P>
<STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
Metal was too satanic.

<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
Heh. As Ozzy Osbourne said, "The only black magic you'll find us messing
with is the chocolates".

<P>
<STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
<EM>[Reading several Wikipedia articles linked under
"<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music">heavy metal
music</A>".]</EM>  It says metal is a progression from psychedelic rock (the
Beatles "Sergeant Pepper" and "Helter Skelter", Jimi Hendrix) and hard rock
(Led Zeppelin, AC/DC).  That seems to pull in a lot of things that we
considered totally separate from metal in the 80s.  I guess if you consider
metal and hard rock as two subgenres of "non-danceable rock", it makes sense.

<H3>The next day...</H3>

<P>
<STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
I was listening to Frontline Assembly last night and realized
themes and cover art of them and Skinny Puppy do have a strong resemblance to
Iron Maiden, and the chords/distortion too.  But what I like about industrial
and not about metal is the way the chords are clipped (stacatto) rather than
whiny (a la Hendrix).  Then I remembered that "Murders in the Rue Morgue" had a
similar clipped style.  Darn it Jimmy, now you've made me say I appreciate Iron
Maiden!

<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
If it makes you feel better, they were possibly the first metal band to
take a punk influence. Given that they also had a huge prog rock
influence, you may scoff at that, but most of their riffs have
punk-like, simple progressions.

<P>
<STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
That does make me feel better.  Interesting that I gravitated toward a similar
sound years before I got into punk.

<P>
Since I don't know what "prog rock" means, I don't know whether to scoff or
not.  Is that a typo?

<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
Progressive Rock. Pink Floyd, Yes etc. I think Rush are prog rock, but
I've never heard them.

<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
You haven't heard Rush???  Well, I haven't heard at least half the bands you
mentioned.  Rush is known for the excellent drumming and perceptive
double-metaphor lyrics of Neal Peart.  The first four albums (1974-76) were
hard rock, or you might call it metal with clipped chords and without the
gratuitous satanism (never mind the burning pentagram on <I>2112</I>).  Geddy
Lee screamed like the metalheads but the music was much more interesting.  But
they always did their own thing rather than pandering to market expectations
(or so they claimed).

<P> Then with the ninth album <I>Signals</I> (1982), Rush totally changed
direction.  Gone was the screaming, the hard rock, the flirting with metal.
The sound was much more poppy, but again unique.  <I>Grace Under Pressure</I>
is good.  "Between the Wheels":

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
You know how that rabbit feels sliding under your spinning wheels
Bright images flashing by like windshields toward the fly

We can fall from rockets' red glare to "Brother can you spare

Wow. Those are some of the best rock lyrics I've ever seen. I generally
don't pay attention to lyrics (it's a guitarist thing), but Tool have
lyrics of a similar calibre (I've seen Tool cite Rush).

<H3>Epilogue: editor's note</H3>

<P> When I reviewed Jimmy's 
<A HREF="oregan.html">article about Songwrite</A> for this issue, I
followed the link to <A HREF="http://magnatune.com/">magnatune.com</A>,
the record company that isn't evil.  (All their songs are available as free
MP3s, you can buy higher-quality sound files for $5/album, they give the artist
50% off the top, and they don't demand an exclusive license to sell.)  I browsed 
around and found several good ambient bands: Rapoon, Paul Augerinos, and
Psychetropic.  The Wretch (industrial) and Pizzle (punk) also deserve
mention.  Be warned that many of their "punk" stuff is misclassified.
