<h1>Mutt configuration</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/brownss.html">Silas Brown</a></b></p>

<p>The Mutt email client is very useful,
especially for dealing with large volumes of
mail, but it might need careful configuration.
This article explains a few points about
configuring Mutt.</p>

<H2>mutt's BCC problem</H2>

<P>The first problem I'd like to address is the
Mutt+Exim BCC privacy leak.  By default, mutt
relies on the MTA (mail transfer agent) to
remove the BCC (blind carbon copy) headers from
messages.  Some MTAs such as Exim will not do
this by default, or at least not the way Mutt
calls them.  Therefore, it is possible that
your BCC headers will be visible to all
parties.  In some circumstances this could be a
major privacy leak.  Moreover, your Mutt might be configured
to hide BCC headers on <EM>incoming</EM> mail, so
if you think you're safe because you sent
yourself a test message and didn't see its BCC
header, think again!  Check the <em>full</em>
headers for BCC lines.  Your correspondents on
Yahoo and GMail et al <EM>will</EM> see them if
they're there.</p>

<p>I know a university that actually removed
Mutt from its Linux systems due to the potential seriousness of
this problem, but there are several possible workarounds:</P>

<H3>Solution 1: Don't write BCC headers at all</H3>

<p>This is what most <tt>.muttrc</tt> writers
seem to do and it's the easiest. Set
<tt>write_bcc=no</tt> in your <tt>.muttrc</tt>
and BCC headers will never be written to
messages at all (but the blind carbon copies can
still be sent).</p>

<p>The documentation for mutt's write_bcc option
(which defaults to YES) is slightly confusing,
because it says "Exim users may wish to use
this".  To me, "use this" means "leave it set to
YES", but what they actually mean is "Exim users
may wish to <em>change</em> this" i.e. set it to NO.</p>

<p>The problem with <tt>write_bcc=no</tt> is it
will leave you with no record of who you have
BCC'd in your messages.  (When you browse your
copyself or sent-mail folder, mutt will not by
default show the BCC line anyway, but it will if
you examine full headers by pressing
<tt>h</tt>.)</p>

<H3>Solution 2: Use Exim's -t option</H3>

<p>By setting Mutt to use Exim's (or Sendmail's)
<tt>-t</tt> option, you can tell Exim to take
the delivery addresses from the message itself
not the command line, and also to strip BCC
headers.  However, there are two problems to
work around:<p>

<p>Firstly, Mutt's "Bounce" message command will no
longer work: it will just resend the message to
its original set of addresses.  So I suggest
disabling the <tt>b</tt> key to stop you from
running the "bounce" command by accident:</p>

<pre>
bind index b noop
bind pager b noop
</pre>

<p>Secondly (and more importantly), when running
Exim with the <tt>-t</tt> option, Exim defaults
to interpreting the command-line addresses as
addresses to <em>remove</em>.  Since mutt puts
all the delivery addresses on the command line,
Exim will end up not delivering to any of them!</p>

<p>Most websites tell you to change your Exim
configuration to get around this, but that
requires root privileges which you might not
have, and it may also break things if some of
your users have other mail clients.  But there
is a way to get around the problem without
changing the Exim configuration.</p>

<p>Basically, what we want to do is to stop mutt from
putting the email addresses on the command
line.  There doesn't seem to be a way of telling
mutt not to do that, so let's try to make sure
that those command-line addresses don't get as
far as Exim.  That can easily be done by writing
a shell script that calls Exim, and get Mutt to
call our shell script (and our shell script can
ignore the arguments that Mutt puts on its
command line).  However, it turns out that you
don't even have to write a shell script; there's
a way you can do it from within <tt>.muttrc</tt>
itself.</p>

<p>What we want to achieve would be something like</p>
<pre>
WRONG: bash -c sendmail -t #
</pre>
<p>(I put <tt>WRONG:</tt> besides that in case
anyone's skimming through the article and only
looking at the examples.)  What that's supposed
to do is, get the <tt>bash</tt> shell to call
<tt>sendmail -t</tt>, and add a <tt>#</tt>
(comment) character so that any email addresses
that mutt adds to the command line will be
ignored.</p>

<p>The above command won't work though, because
bash's <tt>-c</tt> option requires the entire
command to be <em>in one argument</em>
i.e. quoted; any other arguments go into its
<tt>$0</tt>, <tt>$1</tt> etc.  But it's no good
quoting the command in <tt>.muttrc</tt> because
mutt's code wouldn't know how to interpret the
quotes (if you say <tt>"sendmail -t"</tt> to
pass the single argument <tt>sendmail -t</tt>,
mutt will pass <tt>"sendmail</tt> as the first
argument and <tt>-t"</tt> as the second argument
which will not help).</p>

<p>However, bash does have a built-in variable
<tt>$IFS</tt> which defaults to space. So if we
write <tt>$IFS</tt> instead of space, we can
make it work.  We don't even need the comment
character <tt>#</tt>, because only the first
argument after the <tt>-c</tt> will be actually
interpreted by <tt>bash</tt> (the others will go
into <tt>$0</tt> etc, which will be ignored by
the command we're going to give).  The only
thing we need to be careful of is to make sure
that mutt does not try to expand the
<tt>$IFS</tt> itself (<tt>$IFS</tt> is a
"special" variable, not usually a real
environment variable, so if mutt tries to expand
it then it will likely end up with nothing).  To
stop mutt from trying to expand the
<tt>$IFS</tt>, we must use single quotes
<tt>'</tt> rather than double quotes <tt>"</tt>
when setting the variable:</p>

<pre>
set sendmail='/bin/bash -c $1$IFS$2$IFS$3$IFS$4 bash /usr/sbin/sendmail -oem -oi -t'
</pre>

<p>(The <tt>-oem</tt> and <tt>-oi</tt> options
are what Mutt uses by default.)</p>

<H3>Solution 3: Use a helper MTA</H3>

<p>BCC headers are always removed by Exim when a
message is submitted via SMTP.  Mutt cannot
submit messages via SMTP itself, but you can use
a small MTA like <tt>msmtp</tt> to do so, and
get Mutt to run <tt>msmtp</tt>.  This can be
done even if you don't have root privileges on
the system; just compile <tt>msmtp</tt> in your
home directory if necessary, and configure it to
send all messages to the real MTA via SMTP.</p>

<pre>
set sendmail=$HOME/msmtp/bin/msmtp
</pre>

<p>This method has the advantage that everything
works: BCC information is still stored in
sent-mail, the Bounce command still works,
<em>and</em> BCC is removed from outgoing mails.
Additionally, it does not require root
privileges or Exim configuration.  The only
problem is it requires the additional setup of
<tt>msmtp</tt> rather than being a
self-contained solution within <tt>.muttrc</tt>.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>After setting things up, I highly recommend you test that BCC headers have indeed
been removed.  Try sending yourself an email
and BCC'ing another address (which doesn't have
to exist; just ignore the delivery failure), and
then inspect the headers of your email when it
is delivered to your inbox.  Remember though
that Mutt might not be showing BCC headers on
incoming email anyway, so press <tt>h</tt> to
view the full headers.</p>

<p>If you want Mutt to show BCC headers on incoming messages (and in your
own sent-mail), put this in your <tt>.muttrc</tt>:</p>

<pre>
unignore bcc
</pre>

<p>And you can optionally change the order of headers as well:</p>

<pre>
unhdr_order *
hdr_order From Date: From: To: Cc: Bcc: Subject:
</pre>

<p>but mentioning Bcc: in <tt>hdr_order</tt> is not sufficient; you need the
above <tt>unignore</tt> directive as well.</p>

<h2>Disabling unconfirmed quit</h2>

<p>A second "gotcha" of Mutt is the "unconfirmed quit" key, <tt>Q</tt>
(that's a capital Q).  I like to automatically delete messages marked for
deletion when leaving a folder (the alternative is to lose the deletion marks, so might as well):</p>

<pre>
set delete = "yes";
</pre>

<p>but with this setting, pressing Q by mistake will act as an unconfirmed
delete-messages-and-quit. The problem? A <em>lower case</em> q is used to
quit out of individual-message view and go back to folder view, and the
"undelete" key is by default available only from folder view.  So if you
accidentally hit D to delete a message, then want to undelete it, but you
are in message view and need to first go back to folder view before you can
use the undelete command, so you press q to go back to folder view, then
what happens if you left Caps Lock on by mistake?  Goodbye, messages! 
(Leaving Caps Lock on by mistake is not so easy from a desktop, but it's
surprisingly easy from a PDA or phone with an SSH client on it.)  Therefore
I recommend disabling the capital Q keypress:</p>

<pre>
bind index Q noop
bind pager Q noop
</pre>

<h2>Making search more useful</h2>

<p>A Mutt "simple search" (as opposed to a full-text search which takes
longer) defaults to looking in the From and Subject fields.  It's more
useful if it also looks in the To field, so you can use your sent-mail
folder like an extra address book:<p>

<pre>
set simple_search = "~f %s | ~t %s | ~s %s";
</pre>

<h2>Viewing complex messages</h2>

<p>mutt can be set to automatically display HTML etc using mailcap filters if possible:</p>
<pre>
set implicit_autoview = 'yes';
</pre>

<p>but more generally, sometimes you get a message that warrants viewing in
a Web browser (for example it might be written in a language that your
terminal doesn't display).  Mutt can be made to do this in several ways. 
Since I never print email from Mutt, I set the Mutt "print" command to be a
"send this message to a Web browser" command, using the program
<tt>mhonarc</tt> to format the message for the browser:</p>

<pre class="code">
set print = 'yes';
set print_decode = 'no';
set print_split = 'no';
set wait_key = 'yes';
set print_command="cd $(mktemp -d ~/public_html/mailXXX);sed -e $'s/\\f/From \\\\n/'|LANG=C mhonarc -;[ a\$WEB == a ]&amp;&amp;export WEB=$(hostname -f);echo;echo http://\$WEB/~$(whoami)/$(pwd|sed -e 's-.*/--')/maillist.html;echo Then rm -r $(pwd)";
</pre>

<p>Note that the above <tt>print_command</tt> <em>cannot</em> be made much
longer, because some versions of mutt will truncate it.  That truncation
happens <em>after</em> expansion of environment variables, which is why I
escaped some of those $ characters.  If you need to do more, then make a
separate script and call that.</p>

<p>The above command allows you to set the WEB environment variable to the
webserver's name if it's different from your hostname.  This is useful in
some setups if your home directory is mounted over NFS and the Web server is
on another machine.</p>

<p>If your MHonarc mangles UTF-8 messages, you might have to set the
environment variable M2H_RCFILE to a file containing the contents of
<A HREF="http://www.mhonarc.org/MHonArc/doc/rcfileexs/utf-8-encode.mrc.html">http://www.mhonarc.org/MHonArc/doc/rcfileexs/utf-8-encode.mrc.html</A></p>

<h2>Message sort order</h2>

<p>It seems that different versions of Mutt
default to different sort orders, but you can
set it in your <tt>.muttrc</tt>.  I usually use
reverse date:</p>

<pre>
set sort=reverse-date-sent;
</pre>

<h2>Using maildir</h2>

<p>Mutt is one of the few mail clients that
supports the maildir format.
I highly recommend the maildir format, which
puts each message in a separate file on the disk.</p>
<pre>
set mbox_type = 'maildir' ;
</pre>
<p>Having each message in a separate file means
not so much disk activity when changing just one message
(i.e. it's faster, and if you're using a flash
disk then it's also less wear on the disk).
It's also easier to archive old messages etc just by
using shell utilities; there's more than one way to do this
but I usually use the <tt>archivemail</tt> program.
Furthermore there are many scripts available
on the Web which will write new messages to a
maildir folder; you can adapt one of these to
your mail filtering system and have it add
messages to all your folders in the background
even while Mutt is accessing them for search etc.
(I used Yusuke Shinyama's public-domain
<A HREF="http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/python/pyfetchmail.py">pyfetchmail.py</A>
and adapted it to fetch IMAP instead of POP by
using Python's <tt>imaplib</tt> module.)
</p>

<h2>Other configuration options</h2>

<p>You should probably look through
<A HREF="http://www.mutt.org/doc/manual/manual-6.html">Section 6 of the Mutt manual</A>
(and perhaps chapter 3 as well), to check if there are any other options you'd like to set.</p>
