<p>
hello,
</p>

<p>
I have been facing a couple of "weird" issues on Debian 4.0
</p>

<p>
1. Every time (on a new boot) I have to "listen" to a video song, I
have to run "alsaconf". I can see the video and listen to audio files
but not the video songs until i run "alsaconf"
</p>

<p>
2. GCC reports linker error while using "sin", "cos", etc. However it
is solved when i append a "-lm" during compilation
</p>

<p>
Waiting for some insights!
</p>

<p>
Thanks
</p>

<p>
You are including the maths libraries when you compile your program
with "-lm" (think Link Maths)
</p>

<p>
You can include this line in your source file file to do the same
(omit the -lm flag in this case)
</p>

<p>
#include &lt;math.h&gt;
</p>

Er... you can and maybe should put that include in your source, but it
is NOT a substitute for linking with the correct library.
</p>

<p>
as this page ...
</p>


<pre>
&gt; More can be found here: <a href="http://aplawrence.com/Linux/c_compiling_linux.html">http://aplawrence.com/Linux/c_compiling_linux.html</a>
</pre>

<p>
actually mentions...
</p>

<p>
... And there may even be more to do. Look at this:
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;
main ()
{
printf("pi = %.5f\n", 4 * atan(1.0));
}
</pre>
We looked up the atan function and found it needs math.h. We've told the
compliler to include it. Trust me, the program is right. But..
</p>

<pre>
$ gcc -o pi pi.c
/tmp/ccLmoMxc.o(.text+0x33): In function `main':
: undefined reference to `atan'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
</pre>
What we need here is a special compiler flag:
</p>

<pre>
gcc -o pi -lm pi.c
</pre>
"lm" tells it to link in the math libraries. Math libraries? Sure, you
didn't think C by itself knows how to do arc tangents, did you? C by by
itself doesn't know much. Most of its functions - the things you can use -
come from external libraries that get linked in. How would you know when
you need to use a special library? It's just something you have to learn.
Usually, if there is a special linker flag, the man page will have told
you. In the case of atan, it does not, so you just need to remember that
you need "-lm" when you see "#include &lt;math.h&gt;" mentioned."
</p>

<p>

Hi Jim,
</p>

<p>
thanks for the clarification, I should really have read more of the
link I mentioned.
</p>

<p>
It's been years since I did anything in C and I thought I knew the answer.
</p>

<p>
On reflection, I included the information needed to access the
libraries - the header file, but not told the linker to include them
at compilation. Doh!

<p>
Well, yes, C basically means "yeah, I can take care of all the details".
First thing I do when writing C is to create the Makefile. Here's an
example from a little tool named "dailywtlpg" I am working on:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
CC =3D colorgcc
CFLAGS =3D -I. -I/usr/local/pgsql/include -DDEBUG -g
LDFLAGS=3D -L/usr/local/pgsql/lib -lpq -lpcre
 
# For Intel ICC and Core 2 Duo use:
# /opt/intel/cc/9.1.042/bin/icc -I. -xP -DDEBUG -o dailywtl dailywtl.c
 
DEPS =3D dailywtlpg.h
OBJDAILYWTL =3D dailywtlpg.o
 
%.s: %.c $(DEPS)
	$(CC) -S -o $@ $&lt; $(CFLAGS)
 
%.o: %.c $(DEPS)
	$(CC) -c -o $@ $&lt; $(CFLAGS)
 
dailywtlpg: $(OBJDAILYWTL)
	$(CC) -o $@ $^ $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)
 
all: dailywtlpg
</pre>
The first lines define CC, the compiler, and the flags being used for
the compiler and linker runs. Put all desirable include paths into
CFLAGS and put the paths for the corresponding libraries into LDFLAGS.
Both will be used when calling the compiler.
</p>

<p>
DEPS lists all dependencies, OBJDAILYWTL lists all object files. "%.s"
defines a rule to create .s files (assembler listings, I am curious ;),
"%.o" defines a rule for creating object files. The last two rules
explain how make should create the dailywtlpg binary and what needs to
be done when "make all" is executed.
</p>

<p>
Best,
Ren&eacute;.
</p>

Do you know, sometimes getting an answer just allows you to think of
more questions. I'm off to look into C programming again all because
of one little email and make as well.

It's a very common misconception. Actually including the header files
doesn't really "access" the libraries. It generally simply includes the
library function prototypes, and any macros/defines that the library
writer documents or requires as useful for calling the library functions.
These files are simple C code text files in /usr/include (usually) - take
a look at say /usr/include/math.h - there is no C code - just a bunch of
(admittedly complicated) #defines and typedefs.
</p>

<p>
The functions are in the library object files and the c compiler has to be
told which library to link into the program with the '-lxxx' compiler
flag. The precompiled library will be found in one of a series of
"prefined" library directories, usually /lib /usr/lib , as the file
"libxxx.so" or for non-shared libraries "libxxx.a".

I last programmed in C on my old Amiga - just little bits and pieces
so it's been a while. Sadly it's all coming back to me <em>now</em>  <em>after</em>
I chewed my foot for a bit ;)
</p>

<p>
I may just have to go off and take a look at those headers now my
curiosity has been nudged. I used to read the Amiga reference manuals
almost daily, it's a bit sad that I've forgotten so much.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; More can be found here: <a href="http://aplawrence.com/Linux/c_compiling_linux.html">http://aplawrence.com/Linux/c_compiling_linux.html</a>
&gt;
&gt; actually mentions...
&gt;
&gt; "
&gt; ... And there may even be more to do. Look at this:
&gt;
&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
&gt; #include &lt;math.h&gt;
&gt; main ()
&gt; {
&gt; printf("pi = %.5f\n", 4 * atan(1.0));
&gt; }
&gt;
&gt; We looked up the atan function and found it needs math.h. We've told the
&gt; compliler to include it. Trust me, the program is right. But..
&gt;
&gt; $ gcc -o pi pi.c
&gt; /tmp/ccLmoMxc.o(.text+0x33): In function `main':
&gt; : undefined reference to `atan'
&gt; collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
&gt;
&gt; What we need here is a special compiler flag:
&gt;
&gt; gcc -o pi -lm pi.c
&gt;
&gt; "lm" tells it to link in the math libraries. Math libraries? Sure, you

&gt; you need "-lm" when you see "#include &lt;math.h&gt;" mentioned."
</pre>

<p>
Funny it is, I have been programming C using GCC for past 4 years or
so, this is for the first time I am using a trigonometric function and
I learn that I have to link the math library "-lm" to be able to
actually use them. {Moron me <img src="../gx/frown.png" alt=":("> }
</p>

<p>
By the way, is "pow ()" also defined in "math.h" ? If yes, then it
compiles correctly  for me without adding the "-lm".
</p>

<p>
Consider the following program :
<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;
 
int main(){
printf("%d\n",pow(3,2));
return 0;
}
 
OUTPUT:
 
amit@etch-desktop:~/junk$ gcc MathDemo.c
amit@etch-desktop:~/junk$ ./a.out
0

Could some one please explain the above output?

<p>
Using "-Wall" is a good habit when calling the compiler (as much as
using "strict" when coding Perl):
</p>

<pre>
lynx@agamemnon:/tmp $ gcc -Wall math.c=20
math.c: In function =E2=80=98main=E2=80=99:
math.c:5: warning: format =E2=80=98%d=E2=80=99 expects type =E2=80=98int=E2=
=80=99, but argument 2 has
type =E2=80=98double=E2=80=99
lynx@agamemnon:/tmp=20
</pre>
pow() returns floating point data, but your format string expects an
integer type, so I suspect that the conversion inside printf() fails
because it isn't considering all the bits. If you change the format
string to "%f\n" everything's fine.
</p>

<p>
If you're doing C, then most functions take your instructions literally.
Make sure that you always use matching types when putting variables into
function calls. The GCC option "-Wall" is a good thing to use in order
to catch some errors. Also if you have Intel's C Compiler "lying around"
you can "crosscompile" your code with it. ICC is a lot more picky about
C constructs than GCC.

I have written these lines some time ago when I was playing with
Assembly on Linux. I still want to play with them, but I am far from
actually doing that. Blame it on a busy schedule which does not leave
time for having fun <img src="../gx/frown.png" alt=":(">

&gt; Funny it is, I have been programming C using GCC for past 4 years or
&gt; so, this is for the first time I am using a trigonometric function and
&gt; I learn that I have to link the math library "-lm" to be able to
&gt; actually use them. {Moron me <img src="../gx/frown.png" alt=":("> }
</pre>

<p>
I checked the man page on my (slightly old) debian box, and while it
mentions including math.h, it makes no mention of linking with libm
which I would expect it to do.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; By the way, is "pow ()" also defined in "math.h" ? If yes, then it
&gt; compiles correctly  for me without adding the "-lm".
</pre>

<p>
Well it doesn't for me.

<pre>
pwr.c<img src="../gx/frown.png" alt=":(">.text+0x50): undefined reference to `pow'
</pre>

<pre>
&gt; Consider the following program :
&gt;
&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
&gt; #include &lt;math.h&gt;
&gt;
&gt; int main(){
&gt; printf("%d\n",pow(3,2));
&gt; return 0;
&gt; }
&gt;
</pre>

<p>
why are you telling printf to print an integer (%d) when you are giving it
double? Use one of the double conversion specs. %e or %f or %g, see
man 3 printf for the gory details.

The man page on Debian etch mentions it.

Hi Steve,
</p>

<pre>
&gt;
&gt; You are including the maths libraries when you compile your program
&gt; with "-lm" (think Link Maths)
&gt;
&gt; You can include this line in your source file file to do the same
&gt; (omit the -lm flag in this case)
&gt;
&gt; #include &lt;math.h&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Actually I had already included the header file before I reported the error.
</p>

<p>
Thanks,

You're confusing 2 different things here. 
</p>

<p>
Including math.h does not remove the need to link in the math library, it 
provides the declarations of the functions to the compiler, allowing it to 
check that the module using the functions is passing the correct parameters 
and the return type is assigned to a compatible variable.
</p>

<p>
The actual function is then linked in at the linking phase or the load phase. 
</p>

<p>
Dynamic linking is the norm, in which case the link phase does not actually 
include the functions in the resulting binaries, but it does check that they 
are present in the linked libraries. I believe it does include some 
information in the binary indicating which libraries contain the relevant 
functions, but I wouldn't be confident of that. Check for yourself if you 
wish to be sure. If static linking is used, the relevant modules from the 
library are actually included in the code that is generated. Either way 
the -lm flag is still required.
