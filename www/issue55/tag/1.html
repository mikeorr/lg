Those sound like MS Windows problems.  You're system has been
infected with the infamous and widespread "Redmond" virus
and you should wipe out the whole system and install Linux.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Alternatively you should contact a vendor that support
Microsoft products.  I don't.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(BTW: VXD is the extension used for "virtual extension drivers"
or something along those lines.  The were introduced in MS Win 3.1
or so IIRC.  The AGP stuff is some sort of "advanced graphics
port" <TT>---</TT> a type of slot in newer PC motherboards.  I presume
that this error is to tell you to install a new video driver).

<P><STRONG>
Dear Answer guy!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Why is it that, whenever I send a word document file to one of my many
contacts, the file is received on his end as a winmail.dat file? I am using
Microsoft outlook and I am sending a word Document. Please Help?
</STRONG></P>

First, let me contratulate you on NOT sending me a 'winmail.dat'
file.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
winmail.dat is a file attachment that Microsoft's Outlook mail
client attaches to most mail so that it can contain any of
MS' extensions to mark up the text of your mail.  So the basic
text of your message, with no highlighting or special formatting
is supposed to comprise the main body of your e-mail, while
'winmail.dat' is supposed to contain all of the formatting and
other fluff that makes it look the same to another MS Windows user
as it did to you.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I personally find winmail.dat files to be mildly annoying.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, I find that mail sent to me in proprietary formats
(such as MS Word .doc) to be highly irritating.  Basically people
have to pay me to read those.  If you're not a customer or my boss
and you send me something as an attachment in any format that I
can't readily read <TT>---</TT> your mail goes into the bit bucket faster
than you can say "delete."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course it would be unfair to single out Microsoft in this
regard.  I don't like Netscape's "vcard" attachments any less
obnoxious than "winmail.dat" and I find Netscape's previously
default behavior of appending HTML formatted copies of the
body text to all outgoing e-mail to be almost as bad as appending
.doc or other binary formats.  (At least I can read between the
tags if I care to).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course I'm a curmudgeon in this regard.  I think that plain
old unadulterated text is a fine tool for communications and I
don't like to see a lot of formatting fluff to confuse the
issue.  I still use Lynx for most of my web browsing, and I
still work from text mode consoles more often than not. (Although
I've made it a point to stay in X most of the time on my new
laptop, mars, and on my latest home desktop client, canopus.  I
still use a big xterm running a copy of 'screen' for almost all
of my work).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Anyway, If you want to learn how to send mail that is likely to
be most effective and least irritating to the broadest range of
correspondents, then eschew all of the fancy formatting, and
learn to write!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As for configuring your mail client to behave itself, I don't know.
I don't use any MS products and certainly wouldn't use a GUI mail
client.  Perhaps Microsoft offers some sort of support with their
products.  Last I heard they run a 900 (pay-by-the-minute)
telephone service.  Perhaps that could answer your questions more
thoroughly for a few quid.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(On the other hand, you could switch to Linux, which would make
Outlook basically unavailable to you.  Then you'd also be protected
from the next few outbreaks of the "Melissa" and "Love Bug" viruses
among others.  Indeed you'd be immune from that whole class of
plagues).

CD Problems

<P><STRONG>
Hi, I purchased a 1998 Chrysler Town &amp;  Country van recently that has a cd
player.  When I try to put a cd in, it immediately comes back out.  Someone
told me another cd must be stuck in there.  How can I find out, and how do
I get it out?
</STRONG></P>

Thanks.

I know this is going to sound shocking, but did you look in the
owner's manual or contact a factory dealership?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><DL><DT>
I suppose you could try the "Ask Chrysler" CGI program at:
<DD><A HREF="http://ask.chrysler.com"

</DL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Or take it down to your favorite neighborhood car stereo shop and
have them take a look at it.   Of course all of those venues will
try to sell you a new CD player, or a new car, or something.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I won't try to sell you anything.  I just answer Linux questions
for this online magazine called the "Linux Gazette."  They picked
"The answer guy" as a name for my column which is presumably how
you got tricked into mailing this question to me.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
O.K. I lied.  I'll try to sell you something.  You could try
replacing that CD player with an automotive MP3 player.  That would
mean that you'll "rip" your CDs on you home computer, download
them into a little computer in your car and use that to play them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Here's a few links on that idea:

Perhaps they offer some sort of customer service with the product
