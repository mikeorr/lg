Heather got started in computing before she quite got started learning

<P> Heather is a hardware agnostic, but has spent more hours as a tech in
Windows related tech support than most people have spent with their computers.
(Got the pin, got the Jacket, got about a zillion T-shirts.)  When she
discovered Linux in 1993, it wasn't long before the home systems ran Linux
regardless of what was in use at work.

"strange systems" at a (then) 90 million dollar company.  Moving onwards, it's
safe to say, Linux has been an excellent companion and breadwinner... She 
took over the HTML editing for "The Answer Guy" in issue 28, and has been 
slowly improving the preprocessing scripts she uses ever since.

<p><strong>My hardware is a nice Pentium Coppermine 550 I've had for ages.
The Tyan motherboard I have is not quite up to match it - the CPU used to
be part of a dual pair, but that motherboard failed and the twins were split
up.  By not up to snuff, I mean that I have 1 Gig of memory in it, which
would suit the CPU fine, and it works, but the mb is only rated for 768Mb.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Still, on 2.4.x kernels it has always been sturdy;  on 2.6.x it
was crashy and I'd always end up going back.  I tried 2.6.5, 2.6.8, 2.6.10.
I also wanted to get a few simple objects all happy at the same
time:</strong><p>

<ul>
<li>sound - Ensoniq 5880, uses the es1371 drivers.
<li>USB - I use a small wacom graphire II.  Also occasionally a thumb drive.
I used to scare bugs out of USB all the time by having my stuff plugged into
the hub on my monitor, and turning my monitor off at night.  I don't do that
anymore.  It eats USB numbered nodes up quick, and my monitor (a big LCD)
seems to prefer to stay on anyway.
<li>CD burning - I burn a <b>lot</b> of discs.  If this can't behave without
making coasters, I don't care how new the kernel is.
<li>Ext3 - obviously this should work.  Before people go leaping that
$other_journal is better, my criteria is being able to see the fs no matter
which rescue disc or test disc I'm booting - and when it's shutdown clean
this acts like ext2.  However I do lots of dev work and my disks haven't
been small for awhile now;  tack on a journal and I'm not forced into a
lunch break as punishment for my coding follies.
<li>my low end Radeon video card.  RV100 QY according to lspci.  A measly 64
Mb.  It's not up to the snuff of my monitor either, but the price was right
when I was eager to enjoy my new glory.  It prefers framebuffer, but in the
2.4 series it drives the radeonfb bonkers, so I get stuck in vesa.  I'd
prefer some higher octane  in my video gastank 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)"
                height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</ul>

<p><strong>I get heisencrashes.  At times it will lock up for apparently no
reason.  After my speedy reboot, no disk farts in the logs, no shuddering of
a webserver process, no clue to the heart attack.  Shall I blame the CPU?
Ah, but if it were failing hardware wouldn't it get worse?  Or the kernel's
changes have no particular effect?   But the newer kernels send the
boogeyman away - almost for long enough for me to believe that whatever it
is, they nailed it.  Hooray!  I go on my merry way hacking insanely huge
graphics in Gimp, compiling kernels or X or whatever in background while
juggling chat windows and pondering an article for some future 
issue.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Of course it'd be handy if I could provoke it.  For awhile I
almost thought I could... it was more fragile after I discovereed ayttm,
webcam support for Yahoo.  But there'd be days on end it did nothing even
when I played with that heavily, others, </strong>pow kerblooey<strong> out
it goes.  One night it was late and I left it at its console prompt (I don't
startx unless I feel like it) and it hung overnight.  I haven't crashed in
awhile (a few weeks I think) on my 2.6.11 kernel - but I *have* crashed this 
way on it, and I wasn't doing coding at the time, so I can't take the blame
myself for that one.  The truth is out there -- somewhere.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Now the techsupport type in me says "and, Heather, what sort of
Doesn't Work does it <em>do</em>?  Glad you asked.  I'm buzzing along
typing, clicking, getting some work done - or goofing off - and the
keyboard's not working.  I think my mouse slipped... but moving the mouse
doesn't get any effect. clicking it does toggle my wacom pad's signalling
light - but the computer isn't dealing with the interrupt. hyperspace.  Ah!
I hope, I'll just ssh in from the sparc or my laptop.  Nope, net's dead too.
Magic SysRq? (not that this is any help if I was in X.)  nope. dead as a 
doornail.  
</strong><p>

<p><strong>I'm going to be adding a serial console soon - as soon as I find
table space for some more cords.  More ideas, and especially any idea of
what to look <em>for</em> are quite welcome.  -- Heather</strong></p>

<P><STRONG>
Good Afternoon Neil.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Good morning Andrew
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I am a very novice administrator, who has had a Spam Assassin box thrust
at me recently.  My knowledge is very limited with regards to linux and
though I have been searching the web I have not been able to find out
how to release quarantined email.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Hmm. Not much information to go on. A SpamAssassin box, eh? I assume we're
talking about a standard box with a mail server and SpamAssassin?
</P>
<P>
Which mailserver are you using? The interface to SpamAssassin can vary
according to the mailserver in use. What does the part of the configuration
for SpamAssassin look like?
</P>
<P>
Even the Linux distribution could be a clue? Do you know if it was installed
from your distribution's package manager or built from source to a local
configuration? If it was installed from the package manager, what packages
were used?  If it was built locally how was it configured?
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I have found the mail, have even been able to discern the contents but
not been able to figure out how to get it from there back into the queue
for it to be delivered again.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Again not much information. The location you found it in could be a clue.
</P>
<P>
I assume that you're working from a command line and not a web interface?
</P>
<P><STRONG>
If you have a moment and could point me in the right direction I would
very much appreciate it.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
It's hard to give you much of a pointer without more clues.
</P>
<P>
Have you tried googling for SpamAssassin and quarantine? It throws up a lot,
but I don't have enough information to tell what might be relevant to you. It
could be narrowed down a lot by adding the name of your mailserver (e.g.
sendmail or exim).
</P>
<P>
I've CCed this to the Answer gang. Answer gang discussions can be published
in the Gazette, so let us know if that's a problem.
</P>
<P>
Please read <A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html</A>, which should give
you some idea of what information would be useful to help us answer your
questions.

When I read about your shell script called "google" I thought
that you might be interested in a program called surfraw
(<A HREF="http://surfraw.sourceforge.net"
	>http://surfraw.sourceforge.net</A>). Surfraw does what your google
script does and it also does it for many different search
engines and types of search engines too.

Thanks, Grurp; I'm familiar with "surfraw", mainly through installing it
and then finding out that 'google' suddenly worked differently.

Well, I guess that would require a 'while' loop, and perhaps an 'if' clause
since it says "it <EM>may</EM> take a while". But then I have no idea what the

I thought it'd just let you all know
that I am going to be without Internet access for at least a month.
</p>

<blockquote><font color="#1F1F1F">Yow - poor Thomas. I don't know how you're going to survive, poor lad...
we'll have to snail-mail you some SSH modulus strings, or maybe the
contents of /dev/random, to keep you from falling apart completely. -- Ben
</font></blockquote>

<p>
After that, I might have some, but it will be very intermittent, to not
at all, at best.  Perhaps in October I will have something more
stable... I can't say.
</p>

<blockquote><font color="#1F1F1F">We'll miss you! -- Ben
</font></blockquote>

<p>
So it means my time working on LG is going to have to take a break for a
while.  Obviously I'll do what I can as and when I get Internet access.

<p>Nothing quite as luxurious, alas.  It's the end of the academic year

academic year, which starts in October.  Due to the logistics of things,
that's the earliest time that I can see myself being able to get
internet access.

I'm teaching a Sun class right now, and the response from my students
was uniformly sceptical: "They're just trying to stay in the game." I'm
just going to note that Apple has been playing exactly the same game -
kinda-sorta release some-but-not-all of the source, maybe - and it
hasn't done very much for them.

However, of course, the OpenSolaris codebase apparently (as everyone
suspected) includes quite a lot of binary-only, proprietary "secret sauce"
components.[2]  How useful the CDDL (and other open source <TT>/</TT> free-software)
portions would be without them is an open question.  My own expectation
would be "Not very; probably even substantially less than the
corresponding case with Apple Darwin."

The only thing I remember seeing mentioned specifically is drivers, which
is understandable--too many NDAs. IIRC, Sun has a compiler that recompiles
Linux drivers for Solaris--device support isn't one of great plusses of
Solaris that Sun have been cheerleading in any of the blog entries I've
seen (DTrace this, DTrace that :)

One of the big things in Open Solaris is that services can start in
parallel at boot time. Finito (<A HREF="http://web.isteve.bofh.cz/finito"

something similar for Linux.

<P><STRONG>
Heh. I think there will be a lot of public contributions to the code, if
only to clean it up. I never really understood why so much research goes
into code comprehension (well, aside from the fact that C lecturers write
some of the worst C around): open source projects <EM>need</EM> to have code that's
as clear as possible, otherwise noone can contribute. Heck, even Wine,
which (of necessity) has some of the most cryptic code I've ever seen
(self-modifying blobs of x86 binary code, C emulations of C++ exceptions
and classes, etc), is a model of clarity, as far as it can be.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Not so Open Solaris. Their tar implementation is one 182k .c file; their
nroff implementation uses the original Unix naming convention for files
(n1.c etc). I'm sure they'll get plenty of clean-up patches from people
cringing on Sun's behalf :)

I didn't have much time to really look into this yesterday (but I did
get some really good coding done, and had the very satisfying experience
of solving a thorny problem that's been bugging me for a couple of
years!); today is a new day, and I'm wasting^Wspending my morning
checking out the buzz on this. Fascinating - it looks and smells real.
In fact, reading Tim Bray's blog and the link tree that branches out
from it - thanks, Raj! - I'm slowly growing convinced that Sun has
finally clued in, bought the stock, drank the Koolaid. All I can say, in
stunned admiration, is "Bravo" - I had not expected it, and was actually
rather cynical about it, having built my expectations based on what I
saw from my little corner of the Sun culture. It seems I was wrong.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The interesting bit about this is that the Solaris kernel has been a
strictly "hands-off" affair since time immemorial; you could tweak some
user-space settings to influence its operation in some mild ways, but
that was about all (and learning to do even that required a three-day
class and using ADB [shudder].) As well, some of the operational
algorithms - e.g., the exact process of deciding how to accept/reject
TCP connections - were generally hinted at but the details were
<em> intentionally  </em> shrouded in mystery (security through obscurity, even
though Sun showed itself to be totally aware, in other places, that this
is not a useful approach.)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
There's also the fact - and I'm <em>  not  </em> snarking at Sun in the least, but
applauding their moving with the times - that Solaris installations are
growing far fewer percentage-wise; this latest change may just be a
simple recognition of fact and adaptation to it. I've spoken to many
people in the large corporate culture, in many places and many different
companies, and have heard the story/complaint/simple fact repeated many
times: "so this new guy comes into IT, and before anybody knows it, he's
got 30 Linux boxes up in one day..." Cost of software: zero. Cost of
machines: hauled out of a closet where it was stored due to being old
and unusable. That's a <EM>hard</EM> combination for a commercial machine+OS to
beat, stony hard - and companies that _aren't_ having to spend a million
bucks a year on buying new are starting to notice. Many of them -
including banks, the traditional stronghold of conservatism - are
quietly dropping their "no non-commercial OSes" policy.

Sun is an <em>  excellent  </em> hardware company; the cost of their gadgets is
quite high as compared to the commodity PC, but the quality and the
reliability that you get from the stuff can be absolutely stunning to
someone who's never experienced them. I've never had Sun stuff "fight"
me the way, e.g., a PC SCSI card has; the documentations was always
available, and the relevant setup was as obvious as it could be made and
robust. Solaris, seen in that light, has always been a house divided
against itself - and Sun appears to have finally resolved the ambiguity.

Bravo; bravo indeed. The Open Source world has grown - and it's quite
the growth spurt. Not that we needed validation, but this is an
unlooked-for bit of big-leagues legitimacy that does not hurt at all.

The "patents" comments are tautologically true -- but would be so
<em> regardless  </em> of licence.  That is, <em>  any  </em> codebase adversely encumbered
by patents is non-free/proprietary, irrespective of what licence
provisions would otherwise apply.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
That other bit about fixed attributions making a work
non-free/proprietary is one reason why, although I'm a long-time
subscriber to debian-legal, I only rarely read it, in order to safeguard
my blood pressure:  Author attributions may not be stripped in
derivative works by <em>  default action of copyright law ,</em>  so it is utter
lunacy to assert, as poster Garrett and numerous others do, that clauses
to that same effect make the work non-free through it "failing the
Chinese Dissident Test".

That licence requirement could be met by "Module foo.c was contributed

I tend to take an optimistic view of these things that look like naivete
from a certain perspective - any move in the direction of Open Source by
the historically-proprietary software companies is good for us. One of
the many underlying reasons for that is what I like to call "time in
grade": the longer these people spend using Open Source methods - to
whatever degree - the more these get embedded in their culture and the
environment around them. After a while, they're impossible to eradicate.
As for "the abyss looking back at you", I rely on the GPL and its ilk to
keep the resulting influence on the world of Open Source to a tolerable
minimum.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
(Yes, the sum total of all the influences and issues here is far more
complex than this. However, abstracting this bit and staring at it for a
while contains its own lessons, and they're interesting ones.)

Hi, all -
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Got a curious Linux problem here that I'm trying to puzzle out, and
after struggling with it for a bit, I remembered that I'd heard of this
thing called The Answer Gang... :)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I'm trying to boot Linux on my fiancee's laptop, a Sony VAIO F590K -
something that she'd be quite happy to see, since her opinion is that
Micr0s0ft should have stopped when the going was good - i.e., DOS5.0
Simple, right? Uh, well... the only problem is that it's got a dead
CD-ROM drive. She's going to order a new one soon, but until then...
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The VAIO doesn't support booting from USB. However, I've managed to load
Puppy Linux onto a 1GB USB FlashDrive and burn the appropriate disk image
(provided by Puppy) to a floppy - it's an ingenious system (the floppy
boots FreeDOS, which searches for and boots the FlashDrive) that could
probably be easily adapted to boot other distros... if I only understood
exactly what to tweak and how.
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=" :) " 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> I'm afraid that I've met my match (at
least for the moment) in trying to understand the whole shebang.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I've looked at many LiveCD distros in the past few days. A number of
them can be run from USB - but require that the machine boot from the
USB, not an option here. I've even carefully studied the "Booting
Knoppix from USB" HOWTO, which assumes the same thing, to see if I could
somehow mingle Puppy's floppy boot and Knoppix on a USB stick... no
luck.

Use Knoppix boot.img on a floppy and copy the KNOPPIX directory to the
USB stick. This should work provided the kernel+initrd on the boot.img
supports USB---I think it does but there may be a kernel boot option.

The Knoppix boot mechanism is:

I think puppy uses Xorg and also possibly the vesa driver only. You may
have better luck with Knoppix.

Oh, and PXE booting is out as well: the F590K does support network
booting... however, PXE does not (yet) speak PCMCIA.
</STRONG></P>

So, given all of the above - what do you folks think? Have any of you
had experience in booting something like this, or do you have any ideas
that I've perhaps missed?

hibiscus...)

Puppy failed to recognize the video hardware in the VAIO. Key factor
I neglected to mention.

Ooops. Seems like Knoppix stopped using "boot.img" at v3.4 (I've got
3.7) - they use "isolinux" these days. There seems to be a bit of
discussion on the Net that mentions using the "boot.img" from the v3.3
CDs - I've seen reports that it Just Works - but I don't have one
available, and won't be able to download 3.3 until I get to a high-speed
connection. Would anyone here happen to have such a thing handy?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
If someone happens to have a Knoppix 3.3 image, let me save you a bit of
time (obviously, you'll have to change the ISO image name to whatever it
actually is, and "<TT>/mountpoint</TT>" to some existing directory that you don't
mind using as a mountpoint for a few seconds.)

Short intro into bittorrent: data is packed into small chunks. You download
a chunk on your machine and the next user that wants also this chunk
downloads it from your machine, thus relieving the main server of the high
load since the load is spread over all downloading (and uploading) clients.
The download doesn't have to be sequential, packets come in from different
downloading and uploading parties. Even after you got everything your
machine keeps uploading for others - this is one thing to watch out for.

more in the range of 128 (smaller than what shm has, whatever that means on
winblows) and I think the error message in the pic also came from an error
of theirs but hey, it's close.

<blockQuote>
Well, I guess (haven't looked at this again) that the japanese knoppix
developers that made this image made some config error somewhere. I mean,
you essentially have the knoppix image, it's only still on the cd... And you
have qemu. On linux this works then like this:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><CODE>
qemu -cdrom=/dev/cdrom -boot d
</CODE></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
and there you go. Where is the device under win? That's the problem there.
You did notice that I ran the knoppix in an emulated win session? :)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
BTW: qemu with kqemu (the kernel module he has now on linux) gives really a
speedup to ~70% native cpu speed. Awesome (that's why win4lin pro uses qemu
underneath)

uncompress a DOS executable, transparent to DOS, after being loaded by the

(Basiclinux 3.3) based on <A HREF="http://www.slackware.org/">Slackware</A> 4.0 (libc5) with the Slackware 7.1
kernel and modules (kernel 2.2.16) because the source code would not work
with glibc2.  A version I downloaded from somewhere for Slackware 7.1
(2.4.9) told me 'No playback device found'.  I have no midi device other
than sound card and speakers so I typed playmidi -f for FM synthesis
because -e for external midi device is default.  'No playback device
found' either way.

I am using OSS sound, sb.o, Vibra16 AWE32 card which works perfectly in
DOS and has two 4MB 30-pin SIMMs.  My DOS players appear to load sound
libraries automatically.

<blockQuote>
To compile without X or GTK or svgalib I commented out the lines in the
Makefile referring to splaymidi, xplaymidi, etc. because there was no
--without-X type option in the configuration program.  I configured to use
SB AWE32 as the default device.  I installed the developers' ncurses
package when it complained about not finding the right ncurses files.  It
appeared to compile.

audio mixer and sndstat to play wav and mp3 files with).

<blockQuote>
I tried to use playmidi in Basiclinux 3.3 where I compiled it dynamically
(it needs libc5 and libncurses, both there) and if I typed playmidi -f
(for FM synthesis) test.mid 'No playback device found'.  Without the '-f',
using the default AWE32 which I compiled for, I presume, it gives me a
message about AWE32 and the author and looks like it should be playing but
there is no sound.

You ought to be using 'modprobe' (insmod only loads the device you tell

IRQs are transferrable.

Thanks.  The precompiled package I found for playmidi does not seem to

atexit and glibc2 (that is libc6) is a classic case of "oops, this

Some things (like
Opera) don't come in source code so you are stuck with their choice of
library, meaning I also had to upgrade glibc2.  The problems occur when
they have dependencies other than libc (libpng, for instance) and you have
to specify to use the libc5 not the libc6 version when you have both of
them.  I have a little script for that.

I have been using libc5 mainly just to run programs that I don't have
working with libc6, such as this playmidi, and also a few other things
that our basiclinux list members have compiled for libc5, or specifically
for the setup we have which uses it (files are in sort of odd places) such
as Abiword.  I can chroot between the two linuxes to wordprocess but
playmidi ought to work in both since I added libc5.

Our 'basiclinux' started as a 2MB download, with just insmod.  We have
busybox versions of many things which don't always work as required, and
have to install the full versions.  I just pick out a file or two from a
package, to keep things small.  We also have Xvesa (about 1MB) instead of
a larger X.  Sometimes these busybox versions are what keeps things from
compiling.  Playmidi may not have liked my minimal X, which is why I
removed it from Makefile.

work in DOS (or probably therefore in linux) because awe will still not
initialize even after the card starts working with standard settings.

I also learned that I can set my ISA SB16s to use standard settings by
disabling USB in CMOS, running SB16 diagnose in DOS (which no longer
complains that IRQ5 and DMA0 and DMA1 are taken), then reenabling USB (on
one computer - on the other I have to leave it disabled or the conflict
comes back).  Would a PCI sound card avoid this problem?

Time to wander again.  The computer with the AWE64 card, which was working
fine in Windows and almost fine in DOS and linux (no midi, would not
initialize awe), suddenly stopped being able to boot Win98FE after I
changed the ethernet card (to another PCI model) and put in an internal
PlugNPlay modem (which is the only other plugnplay card in there) because
I needed the external modem for a computer with fewer ISA slots.  Removing
the modem did not help, nor did disabling onboard USB (which uses an IRQ,
and which helped previously to get sound to work, and I could then
reenable it and sound kept working).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Removing the ISA sound card fixed the problem.  With  PCI sound card (SB
Live, of which I now have two) Win98 boots.  I don't have drivers for it
for DOS, linux, or Win98 and will have to work on that problem for a
while (it is not SB16), or figure out how to get a SB16 ISA to work in
there again, maybe a different one, before continuing with playmidi and
awesfx.  My other computer is in pieces.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have no free IRQs.  The DVD-ROM drive can't even find one and disables
DMA (I was told there is a way to do this with hdparm but maybe I need DMA
to play DVDs?).  I am using a SCSI CD-ROM drive to read CDs.  I put a scsi
card in here, and ethernet, and ISA modem, MGA (disabled the parport to
free up an IRQ) and sound.  The PCI video card also wants an IRQ.  So to
free up IRQ5 for the ISA sound card (instead of IRQ7, which it took away
from the printer port) I disabled USB onboard, then was able to run DOS
SB16 diagnose, which reset the ISA sound card to standard settings, then
when I reenabled USB the sound card still worked with standard settings.
Is there a better way to do this?  I have hwinfo, which tells me which IRQ
and DMA settings are being used by what.  I will keep hunting around the
CMOS setup for ways to set IRQ and DMA to be used by legacy devices but
this is not the BIOS I am used to (it has little icons - AMI instead of
Award or vice versa).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Do some devices also work even without IRQ and DMA and can I disable their
use of them manually in BIOS?

longer.  The modem (pnp) was working in another computer without

I just acquired a second Soundblaster Live, which also accepts sound fonts
using this same program.  Win98FE, which suddenly stopped booting with the
AWE64 ISA card (after I changed PCI ethernet cards and added MGA), boots
with this one but the driver needs SE not FE (which would imply they don't
support DOS).  Linux OSS worked perfectly (soundcore.o and emu1k10.o - ?)
and this PCI card also cured my problem of the DVD-ROM drive not finding a
free DMA and IRQ.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
So I am set to compile awesfx and test it on a card which I am certain
does not need isapnp because it is not isa, and then on an AWE32 with and
without initialization in DOS, to see if it really needs to be DOS or
isapnp initialized.  Supposedly the sb driver initializes the card itself.
The mad16 definitely did so for the opti 931 and a cs4232 appeared to do
the same (but no sound came out).

I replaced the ethernet card with PCI.  The ISA sound card is a Crystal
which I could not get to make sound when I manually insmodded with what I

The SB Live card is since yesterday working with OSS in a different

insmod emu10k1 did it.  Replacing the SB awe64 ISA card with the PCI card
also let Win98FE start booting again, and fixed a problem with the DVD-ROM
drive, which no longer has to disable DMA access or wait for IRQ to time
out.  I had three ISA cards in there, now only two.  And PCI video,
ethernet and scsi.  I think the awe64 was grabbing DMA 0 and/or 1, which
the DVD-ROM drive needed.  I am losing track - at one point I also had an

I am not using ALSA, but OSS.  I compiled playmidi myself to use AWE32 as
default.  The later version (5) of awesfx works with ALSA, version 4 does
not but will work for OSS.  awesfx is said to work with awe32/64 and Live

I have done some more experimenting on the ISA AWE cards.
I have a Vibra16 CT3930 which has jumpers (not pnp) and it is the only one
that initializes AWE32 in DOS and plays AWE in DOS.  I have two CT3600s
one of which is AWE32 and has 512K free RAM and the other SB32 without the
free RAM, but all three cards have two SIMM slots (with 2x4MB) - one had a
jumper to enable this RAM, the others did not.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The CT3600s and two AWE642 (4520) play awe in a DOS box under Win98, which
means Windows is initializing the awe part.  They play all but AWE in
plain DOS.  I have not yet tried the Vibra16 in linux with playmidi.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
None of these cards needed sound banks loaded in DOS or Windows (unless
Windows loads its own automatically) so I don't think that is my problem,
I think it is initialization.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I got Creative's CTCU.ZIP (at the pipeline driver site) and played with it
for a long time.  I was able to get both CT3600's working in a computer
where they had conflicts by resetting the MPU IRQ and DMA with CTCU and
then running CTCM.  The AWE32 retains these settings permanently, the SB32
has to have them reset every time.  I also had to disable the gameport by
running ctcu and ctcm (and possibly the IDE secondary controller) to get
them to work - otherwise DIAGNOSE (SB16 - similar to CTCM but cannot
disable things) cannot find a free address on one card or a free IRQ on
the other card.  They both came set to MPU 300 and IRQ 10.  One is now
IRQ5.  I can now use these cards in linux with the same settings that work
in DOS, except for AWE, which works in neither despite being set
(apparently) by CTCM (from ctpnp.cfg file, which I edited manually).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The two AWE64s refuse to permanently change their IRQ settings and
Diagnose tells me IRQ5 is taken - by the card, somehow, perhaps for the
second 32 voices?  I have not managed to disable whatever takes up IRQ5
and they won't work at all on this computer but work on other computers.
(One is lacking FM synthesis, so who cares).  But they ought to work in
linux where the PCI cards are more polite about grabbing IRQs, if I can
get AWE initialized, probably with isapnp.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
With the remodeled CT3600 AWE32 in this computer, Win98FE boots correctly
and makes noises, and the DVD-ROM drive is no longer complaining about
IRQs and DMA.  IRQ5 DMA 1 and 5.

plain SB16 card said that FM synthesis is broken.  I remarked out a bunch
of lines and parts of lines referring to things I did not want, so I
would not have to install GTK and other libraries related to producing
a fancy graphical output rather than just sound, and probably also broke
the AWE part.  There is a precompiled playmidi that worked for other
people but not for me which I can also try to get working.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
At the same site as the awesfx utilities for loading sound banks
(awesfx-0.5.0d.tar.gz source - 94K)), I found an alternative midi player
in the package awemidi-0.4.3c.tgz (366K) which I will attempt to compile
(hopefully it can be configured NOT to need the GTK-based interface or
someone here can suggest how to modify Makefile properly to avoid it).
The player is 'drvmidi'.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The author suggests that if you have a pnp card you can initialize it in
DOS and then use loadlin.  I have four pnp AWE cards.  I downloaded some
more AWE32 drivers, which are available at a Finnish site - 130-AWE1.ZIP
through 4.ZIP, and also awe_REV4.zip (all from 1995) and some more faq and
info files, and will try to get these cards playing AWE in DOS.  I also
found sbldos.zip - DOS sblive drivers, for my two PCI (non-pnp) cards with
a similar EMU80?? awe chip.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
There is also an sb64basic.exe (the site was not working when I tried)
and, likewise inaccessible yesterday, 700031A.exe through E.exe for AWE32
(hopefully for DOS not just Windows), A being drivers and C utilities.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
You cannot initialize these cards in Win98 and then reboot to DOS and keep
them initialized - I tried that too.
</STRONG></P>

PLAYMIDI PLAYS MIDIS NOW!!!!! (So does drvmidi).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Short summary to date:  Playmidi was playing silently on my AWE32 card.
I suspected that I had compiled playmidi wrong (FM synthesis was said to
be broken, and I compiled by remarking out anything in Makefile referring
to X, gtk, or ncurses).  Someone at your list said I needed to load a
sound bank with sfxload.  I thought it was not really needed for the card
that worked in DOS without me loading anything into it.  I was also told
to initialize my pnp cards, so I tried first with the only jumpered AWE3(2
I have (CT3930 Vibra16), which does not need initialization and works in
DOS (the others do not yet, won't do AWE initialization in DOS).  aweutil
<TT>/s</TT> initializes the card - won't play AWE without that.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I was indeed getting silence because I had not loaded any sound banks
(fonts) into my AWE card.  See below for the details.  Drvmidi is much
easier to compile without GTK or ncurses than is playmidi, and does not
require libc5 like playmidi did but both work now.

I compiled awemidi-0.4.3c.tgz (which is only 70K - very simple
Makefile.sample could be edited to remark out all references to both
ncurses and gtk/X11, unlike playmidi which insisted on them) and got
drvmidi which also played silently.  I downloaded the source code for
awesfx-0.50.d and it would not configure because it wanted alsa, so I got
version 0.4.4 and it compiled perfectly (just type make, no configure
needed for this version).  All the files compiled statically by default
except for needing glibc/libcm/ldlinux.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I found in the DOS package (s64basic.exe - just run it to install SB16
with AWE support then delete the windows directories) along with
aweutil.com one sound bank synthgm.sbk.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
sfxload synthgm.sbk  (other sound banks are at the driver site)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Now both drvmidi and the playmidi that I compiled play midis now with
awe, that sound just as good as the DOS players.  SB16 must have been
loading this sound bank without me knowing it.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The precompiled playmidi apparently predated the AWE addition and works by
default on an external midi device.  Only other options were gravis
ultrasound or FM synthesis.  THis is why it played silently, and the
playmidi I compiled DOES work for AWE but needed the sound bank installed.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Thanks for this suggestion.  I have learned a lot along the way.  I still
need to try the other AWE cards (that won't work yet in DOS but do in
Windows) with linux.
</blockQuote>
<HR width="10%" align="left"><blockQuote>
I am successfully playing midi files in linux without any need for isapnp.
The solution was to get newer versions of ctcu.exe and ctcm.exe
(Creative's ISA configuration utility and manager) as found in
ctcmbbs.exe, which comes inside s64basic.exe.  I had replaced those files
with files from ctcu.zip because of a corrupt download of s64basic.exe in
which those two files would not work.  The good ones are from 1997.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
To get this going in DOS, run s64basic.exe and follow instructions to make
a ctcm directory.  (If you don't actually plan to use the card in DOS, it
can be separate, otherwise within SB16).  Run ctc -- modify any settings,
test them - A220 I5 D1 H5 E620 worked for me and I was able to pick an
audio configuration with no midi port at all (300 or 330) and to disable
game port and controller) followed by ctcm.  Copy ctpnp.cfg to the sb16
directory.  Run diagnose and let it edit autoexec.bat and config.sys.  I
remarked out what it puts into config.sys and anything about ctcm in
autoexec.bat and instead aded to autoexec.bat the line c:\ctcm\ctcm (with
or without <TT>/s</TT>).  Leave the set sound and set blaster and other settings,
and diagnose, mixerset, and aweutil <TT>/s</TT>, which initializes awe32 (tho it
did not used to do so).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
After exiting ctcu, run ctcm to load the new settings.  If you have a
separate ctcm directory, copy ctpnp.cfg to the sb16 directory.  Diagnose
sets up DOS to run from SB16 directory.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I was then able, on both AWE32 and SB32 cards, to play AWE files with the
'diagnose' utility and with three DOS midi players in AWE mode.  (One of
them refused to play with io set to 240 but worked at 220).  PMB MSP and
CDP.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I booted into linux with loadlin and insmodded the usual sb modules, and
then awe_wave, which loaded for the first time.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I used sfxload to load synthgm.sbk (it needed the path to find it) and
then drvmidi to play it.  I used the vol control on the radio which I am
using as a speaker (aux input) to adjust volume.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
In both DOS and linux, the radio makes regular clicking noises when I am
not playing a midi file but otherwise it all works perfectly.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I have posted awesfx and drvmidi packages for glibc2.2.5 (statically
compiled otherwise) at <A HREF="http://keesan.freeshell.org"
	>http://keesan.freeshell.org</A>.  s64basic.exe can be
found at several places on the web (search by name) including pipeline in
Australia.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
This was not yet tested on AWE64 and I have not yet attacked the PCI card
SB Live, for which Creative also provides DOS drivers (sbldos.zip).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If you do not set up SB in DOS first, you will have to deal with isapnp.
I tried for a couple of hours to edit the isapnp.conf file produced by
pnpdump (isapnp <TT>/etc/isapnp.conf</TT>) but kept getting IRQ or DMA or IO
conflicts since I don't know what I am doing.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I think only the AWE part of SB (and maybe FM synthesis) needs to be
initialized (in DOS with ctcm or in linux with isapnp) because I was able
to play wav and mp3 files in linux after I booted DOS without system
files.  I was also able to play wav and mp3 files on an Opti 931 (mad16)
and an ESS 1868 (sb) in linux without initializing the sound card first.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The ES1868 has an IDE controller which would have to be disabled somehow
if you want to use the onboard secondary controller in linux as hdc/hdd
instead of hdf/hdg.  So do many other older isapnp cards.  The non-pnp ISA
cards have jumpers to disable things with, much easier.

Bah. Neither approach the professionalism of classic X desktops.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Okay, in most respects they do, but one thing really annoys
me about both KDE and GNOME is the way they still don't handle
applications running from different machines and home directories
properly at all.  They make the assumption, time and again, that
all the apps on the screen are running on the one display with prefs
in the one home directory. If I wanted that, I could get a fucking
Macincrap.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Older X applications used the xrdb, so that UI configuration
was a property of the display. All your resource db-supporting apps
could look just how you wanted them, no matter which host they
were running from.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Then 10000 Windows-developer-weenies apparently jumped ship to Linux,
bringing an incoherent mess of files stuck in the home directory and
slagged off xrdb while completely missing the point of it, so we have
things like the  unadulterated horror of GConf.  A few did eventually
grasp what xrdb brought, and I acknowledge that xrdb would need heavy
tweaking bordering on rearchitecting for "modern" preference datatypes,
but they really threw the baby out with the bathwater by forsaking its
core ideal of dynamic, server-brokered preferences.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
P.S. See "man Xaw" for an interesting hack: you can now specify the
vector-drawing commands used to draw a widget in the "displayList" xrdb
resource of an Athena widget...

The reason I asked the question was not because I wanted to know the
best "distro", I wanted to know what was the best "64-bit" distro.
Given that 64-bit chips are still fairly new to the average user, I
wasn't sure how well the 64-bit distros stacked up.

It's a reasonable concern.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Part of the problem is that AMD64/EM64T (collectively: x86_64[1]) are
sufficiently new that they're relatively new to many long-time Linux
people, too.  Some will have had recent experience with one x86_64
flavor; few will be in a position to compare and contrast them very
well.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Another part of the problem is that there are some subtle migration
(32/64) problems, which, speaking for myself, aren't easy to master, let
alone know where all the ported distros stand on them.  (Some are a
problem for all of the distros roughly equally, e.g., the lack of a
native OO.o, Macromedia Flash interpreter, <A HREF="http://www.winehq.com/">WINE</A>, Win32 codecs, etc.)
Basically, after booting an x86_64 Linux distribution, running apps
provided only in binary IA32 form requires a IA32 environment, which can
be either a chroot (in what is otherwise dubbed a "pure64" OS build,
with the disadvantage of chewing up disk space with all the duplicated
libs, applications, and utilities) <em>  or  </em> a set of separate 32-bit libs
known to the dynamic linker and in a parallel directory structure
(reserving "lib" for IA32, using "lib64" for x86_64), a category of
solution termed a "multiarch" OS build -- which has the disadvantage (if
I understand correctly) that compiling and installing <em>  new  </em> 32-bit apps
and libs is difficult.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
A good survey of x86_64 distributions would start with classifying each
as to whether it uses the pure64 or multiarch approach.  And not even
Distrowatch seems to have attempted that, so far.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Of course, you can also ignore the CPU instruction set extensions and
run a regular old IA32 ("x86") distro[2] -- bringing with it the
relatively smaller memory map, but simplifying software support -- but
what fun would that be?  ;-&gt;
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
[1] The nomenclature is hopelessly confused:  AMD say that "x86_64"
(their original term for the extended architecture) is now deprecated
and that everyone should say "AMD64", but that of course would make an
awkward way to encompass Intel's compatible EM64T implementation that
competes with AMD's.  A minority in the Linux community, such as the
Debian Project, call the architecture "amd64"; I follow the most-common
usage and say "x86_64", since the term is vendor-neutral.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
[2] This level of backwards compatibility is the architecture's salient
advantage over Intel's still-exotic and incompatible IA64
Itanium/Itanium2 (dubbed "Itanic" by TheReg) architecture -- whose
existence hints at one of the problems with "lib64" directories: the
namespace collision with Itanium.

This is definitely the truth.  For example, I'm using a GeForce 5500
video card.  SUSE Linux doesn't ship with the 3D drivers, so I
downloaded (or so I thought) the appropriate driver from the nVidia home
page.  It was the one for x86_64.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Imagine my surprise when, upon trying to run it, the shell script
complains that the architecture is incompatible with the drivers....

Today I sent this email to the netfilter list, but I've had no

<P>
Since writing this email I have started graphing how many lines are

maximum according to <TT>/proc/sys/ipv4/ip_conntrack</TT> is 32768 so I don't
think my connection tracking table is overflowing..

Although having said that I haven't experienced the abrupt

dramatically at that time of day.

<BR>Question on netfilter mailing list (netfilter from lists.netfilter.org)

<P>
Hi,
</P>
<P>
This is rather a long email and so I hope that someone who knows
about netfilter, bridging and possibly Xen will have patience to
read it all the way through.
</P>
<P>
I have a server that I run Xen
(<A HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen"
	>http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen</A>) on, with 6 xen
user domains (virtual machines).
</P>
<P>
For those unfamiliar with Xen, the dom0 (host machine) has a virtual
network interface for each user domain and each of those virtual
interfaces are bridged onto xen-br0, along with the machine's real
eth0.  In each user domain, the virtual interface appears as eth0.
</P>
<P>
In dom0 I have iptables running, with the eb-nf support of linux
2.6.11 and the physdev module loaded so that I can match traffic
coming in to each of my user domains.
</P>
<P>
Part of my ruleset looks like this:
</P>

<pre>        $IPT -A FORWARD -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

        $IPT -A FORWARD -m physdev --physdev-out vif+ -j domu_forward_in
        $IPT -A FORWARD -m physdev --physdev-in vif+ -j domu_forward_out

        ######################################################################
        # strugglers.net
        ######################################################################

        $IPT -A domu_forward_in -m physdev --physdev-out vif-struggler.0 -j domu_forward_in_strugglers
        $IPT -A domu_forward_in_strugglers -p tcp --syn -j domu_forward_in_strugglers_tcp
        $IPT -A domu_forward_in_strugglers_tcp -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
        $IPT -A domu_forward_in_strugglers -m limit --limit 1/s -j LOG --log-prefix "FWD DROP: "
        $IPT -A domu_forward_in_strugglers -j DROP
</pre>
<P>
Now, I have noticed that while this works most of the time, for
reasons unknown to me, some TCP connections just seem to stop being
tracked and hit the DROP rule.  Even though they have been tracked
fine for several hours.  This happens on every user domain to all
kinds of TCP connections, but I have pared the ruleset down to just
the one domain (strugglers.net) and SSH to demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
If I add a rule in domu_forward_in_strugglers to allow all TCP to
port 22 regardless of state the I have no problems.
</P>
<P>
This does not seem to affect the INPUT table where I have a similar
set of rules.
</P>
<P>
Today I decided to take a tcpdump while I was ssh'd in up until when
it kicked me out.  I ssh'd in at approx 13:07 GMT and got kicked out
at approx 15:32:49 GMT.  Here is a selection of what got logged on
the console of dom0:
</P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/wanted/andy.dom0-console-log.txt">andy.dom0-console-log.txt</a></tt></p>
<P>
At the same time I see a lot of TCP connections suddenly being
denied to a number of other user domains, so I suspect that all TCP
connect tracking was purged then for some reason.
</P>
<P>
Although I was kicked out, I was able to reconnect straight away (as you would
expect from the above ruleset, it allows the SYN to port 22 and away we go)and
in fact that is how I am typing this email to you now.
</P>
<P>
Here is the bridge setup:

Anyone have any ideas?  I can give up on connection tracking for my

issue with using a bridge?

That is likely.  Mind you, I have experienced the same symptoms, even
when my tracking table was full but not hitting the upper bound.  There

I suppose it <EM>could</EM> be the result of your bridge, but I doubt it.  I

monitor/log their process, that might help.

<h1>Automatic creation of an Impress presentation from a series of images</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/herrmann.html">Karl-Heinz Herrmann</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>

<h3>Why would I want to use a command line tool to generate a WYSIWYG/GUI Document?</h3>
<p> Well, I don't know about you, but I am not very keen on
extremely boring and repetitive clicking through some GUI if the
task at hand doesn't need individual care for every page
done. Specifically, I had a presentation created with <a
href="http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/">LaTeX/beamer</a> in
PDF format and "boss" wanted to have a PowerPoint file. Or you
have your paper accepted at this great/important conference and you
find out they will <b>only</b> accept PPT files for a talk: no
PDF, no Impress, no own laptop.

<p> So, I found myself importing a series of identically-sized images into
a PowerPoint presentation once too often (i.e. once) and got
<b>extremely</b> bored. So bored that I started investigating if I could do
it any other way, even if it took me a week to write the program. For me,
the "perfect" solution would be to have a list of image files (e.g.,
created by '<code>ls *png &gt; file</code>'), run a script and
--<em>voila</em> -- get a PPT file, each slide containing exactly one of
the images filling the whole slide.


<h3>Finding the tools</h3>
<p>A Google (re)search showed nothing on automatic generation of PPT
files, since their internal structure is too obscure to reverse-engineer.
However, I <b>did</b> find information on the inner structure of OpenOffice
files. These are simply compressed XML files and the DTD of the XML
structure <a href="http://xml.openoffice.org/xml_specification.pdf">is
published</a>. After fast-forwarding through the 571 pages I was seriously
hoping somebody else might have done some work on this already. Indeed,
adding my favorite programming language Perl to the Google search words
produced some interesting links:

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://ooolib.sourceforge.net/doc/ooolib-0.1.5-doc.html">ooolib</a></li>
  <li>The <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jmgdoc/OpenOffice-OODoc/OODoc/Intro.pod">OpenOffice::OODoc perl Module</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I decided to give the OpenOffice::OODoc module a try.


To get the modules installed on my system I went to CPAN
(the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) by typing as root ([...] 
signifies unimportant left-out parts):

<pre class="code">
# <strong>perl -MCPAN -e shell</strong> 

cpan shell -- CPAN exploration and modules installation (v1.7601)
cpan&gt; install OpenOffice::OODoc

  /usr/bin/make install  -- OK
cpan&gt; <strong>quit</strong> 
</pre>

<p>The cpan shell realized that a prerequisite, the module XML::Twig, was
missing for OpenOffice::OODoc. It offered to fetch it automatically, which
I asked it to do. Both Twig and OODoc asked some questions during the
install, and I selected the defaults every time. After that, I had
OpenOffice::OODoc and all the prerequisites on my system and could start
reading the documentation.

<h3>The code</h3>

<p>After glancing at the <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/~jmgdoc/OpenOffice-OODoc/OODoc/Intro.pod">Introduction</a>
and some man pages, I started checking out the examples that came with the
module. I found it interesting to find a solution for the reverse of my
problem -- extracting all images from an OpenOffice Document -- since there
is another simple method to get the images out: Just run
'<code>unzip</code>' on the *.swi, *.sxw or any other OpenOffice document.
They are nothing but a zip-file containing the content, meta files and (in
the <em>Pictures</em> subdirectory) all images of the document.

<pre class="code">
<strong>unzip -t img2ooImpressExport.swi</strong>
Archive:  img2ooImpressExport.swi
    testing: mimetype                 OK
    testing: content.xml              OK
    testing: meta.xml                 OK
    testing: styles.xml               OK
    testing: settings.xml             OK
    testing: META-INF/manifest.xml    OK
    testing: Pictures/Seite_1.jpg     OK
    testing: Pictures/Seite_2.jpg     OK
No errors detected in compressed data of img2ooImpressExport.swi.
</pre>


<p>After some digging around in the documentation I came up with the
following <a href="misc/herrmann/img2ooImpress.pl.txt">Perl code</a>:

<pre class="code">
use OpenOffice::OODoc;

# start a new document
my $document = ooDocument
  (
   file            =&gt; 'outputfile.swi',
   create          =&gt; 'presentation'
  );

$document-&gt;createImageStyle("slide");

# loop over image file names (open is outside of this snippet)
my $i=1;
while (my $imgfile=&lt;IN&gt;){
  chomp($imgfile);


# start a new page/slide
  my $page = $document-&gt;appendElement
    ('//office:body',0,'draw:page');

# include the image at full size
my $image=  $document-&gt;createImageElement
    (
     "Slide".$i,
     description     =&gt; "image ".$i." filename:".$imgfile,
     page            =&gt; $page,
     position        =&gt; "0,0",
     import          =&gt; $imgfile,
     size            =&gt; "28cm, 21cm",
     style           =&gt; "slide"
    );

$i++;

}

$document-&gt;save;
</pre>

<p>The <a href="misc/herrmann/img2ooImpress.pl.txt">complete script</a>
includes some file-handling and reads the image list. The hardest part was
figuring out how to add a new page in an Impress presentation, since I
could only find examples which modified a document (inserting an image
after some text, etc.) but none that created new pages. Some digging in the
other man-pages and the doc-folder (if you have '<code>locate</code>'
installed and ran '<code>updatedb</code>' after the OODoc installation,
'<code>locate OODoc</code>' will find all of them) started me in the
right direction.

<p>In the created *swi file, the very first slide is left blank (named
"First Page") and every other page contains one image, named
consecutively "Slide N". I didn't bother figuring out how to drop that
first page. Also OpenOffice seems to have changed the file extensions
between versions: Impress files could be *.swi or *.sxi. The script
takes either one or two arguments: The necessary file with the list of
images (one filename each line) and an optional output filename
(default img2ooImpressExport.swi).  The images are automatically
aligned, so animations in the PDF (each animation step is a new page)
will play out smoothly in Impress/PowerPoint. That was one of the most
annoying things with manually importing single images into PPT --
realigning and rescaling so the images won't jump from slide to slide.


<p> If you would like to add a title or other text to the slides you
could just modify the position and size specification in the
createImageElement block. The page specification adds the image
anchored to the page. The <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/~jmgdoc/OpenOffice-OODoc/OODoc/Intro.pod#Manipulating_graphics">
Info page</a> gives an example where an image is anchored to a new
paragraph. The Intro page is also accessible by:

<pre>
man OpenOffice::OODoc::Intro
</pre>

<p>Other examples that came with the Perl module create spreadsheets from
*.csv files ('<code>oobuild</code>') or create swriter files from text
source ('<code>text2ooo</code>').

<h3>So what about PPT?</h3>

<p>Impress is quite capable of opening and then exporting the created
file to PPT-format, and PowerPoint will not even be able to turn Vector
arrows into letters, much less mess about with text colors and other
annoyances I see regularly at conferences.


<h3>How to convert from LaTeX/PDF files</h3>

<p>A cheap way of converting a LaTeX-created PDF presentation (e.g., <a
href="http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/">beamer</a>, <a
href="http://prosper.sourceforge.net/">prosper</a> or (limited in
animation capabilities) <a
href="http://texpower.sourceforge.net/">TeXPower</a>) is to convert
every PDF page into an image and run the images through img2ooImpress.pl.
The PDF-to-image conversion can be handled by ghostscript (gs). '<code>gs -h</code>'
will show some useful options and a list of formats it can export
to. Look for pngalpha, png16m, and jpeg as useful image formats. If
pngalpha (PNG with antialias rendering) is available, you can run
something similar to:

<pre>
gs -dNOPAUSE -g1024x768 -r205 -sDEVICE=pngalpha \
 -sOutputFile=Talkimg_%d.png  -dBATCH Talk.pdf
</pre>

which creates 1024x768-sized, antialiased PNG images, consecutively
numbered Talkimg_1.png to however many pages were in the PDF. The -r205
specifies the resolution which fits PDF files produced with
'<code>pdflatex</code>' and the beamer class. For other PDF files you will
want to change the resolution so you fill the 1024x768 pixels as close as
possible. '<code>gs</code>' either pads with white or just clips your pages
if the '-r' does not match the '-g' option. With pages rendered exactly at
destination resolution no additional scaling will occur and the images
should look good on the screen. Alternatively, you can generate the images
too large and let Impress do the scaling (image size is set to full page in
the script) so they will fit on the slide, e.g.:

<pre>
gs -dNOPAUSE -r300 -sDEVICE=pngalpha \
 -sOutputFile=Talkimg_%d.png  -dBATCH Talk.pdf
</pre>

which again is OK for a beamer-class PDF file as the slides are rather
small. For a PDF document in A4 landscape, 300 dpi is way too high (-r
specifies the dpi resolution for which '<code>gs</code>' should render the
image). Switching from page to page will get really slow if the images are
much larger then the actual resolution.

<pre>
ls -rt *_1024.jpg &gt; imglist
img2ooImpress.pl imglist MyTalk.swi
</pre>

then converts the images into an Impress file.  Since the '<code>gs</code>'
image is generated without padding zeros, i.e. 1, 2, ..., 10, 11, ..., the
"ls -rt *png" reverse sorts by file modification time and gets the page
sequence right. For some reason, this doesn't work right on all systems and
the file list is still not sorted properly.

There are several methods to create the filenames with enough left hand
zeros so they can be used in "alphabetic" order. If you have "mmv"
installed, and you used a file name structure like File_[num].png, you could
use:

<pre>
mmv "*_?.png" "#1_0#2.png"
</pre>

Here "mmv" will replace #1 with whatever the first wildcard matches and
will add one zero left of every single digit number. #2 will become the
number before the change. It's straightforward to extend this to more
padding zeros.

Another option is a Perl-based renaming script as in the <a
href="http://www.unix.org.ua/orelly/perl/cookbook/ch09_10.htm">perl
cookbook</a> or a slightly <a
href="misc/herrmann/rename.pl.txt">modified version</a> which lets you
test a regular expression until you tell it to actually do the rename
by adding as first option "-x", i.e.:

<pre>
rename.pl -x 's/(\d+)/sprintf "%03d", $1/e' Talkimg*png
</pre>

which pads left-hand zeros so all images have three digits. A simple
'<code>ls "Talkimg*png" &gt; list</code>' will now create the properly
sorted list for '<code>img2ooImpress.pl</code>'.


<h3>Drawbacks</h3>

<p> The one major drawback is that any navigational link in the PDF
('<code>beamer</code>' can add a full clickable table of contents in a
sidebar) is lost. Text changes can only be added in the Impress/PPT file by
overlaying boxes to hide the original text and adding new text on top of
that. However, with the suggested small modification in the size and
position specification, you could still create preformatted pages which
only need the additional title and/or text; then, you could easily choose
Insert-NewSlide, insert-Graphics-fromFile, align and resize to fit, etc. 


<h3>Other uses?</h3> 

<p> With the rise of digital cameras and the disappearance of color
slides (do you still have some?), why not create an Impress or
PowerPoint presentation from your latest holiday photos? (assuming Bash
usage):

<pre class="code">
cd your/image/dir
for i in *jpg; do
convert -geometry 1024x768 $i `basename $i .jpg`_1024.jpg
done
ls *_1024.jpg &gt; list
img2ooImpress.pl list img2ooImpressExport.swi
</pre>

You could then run '<code>soffice img2ooImpressExport.swi</code>' to see
the resulting presentation.

<p> The 'for' loop and 'convert' (from ImageMagick) scale the images down
to 1024x768 (most beamers won't use anything larger) and you could throw in
a gamma correction (-gamma x), watermark, added text, rotation, sharpening
or whatever (see "<code>man convert</code>" for details).

I'm a physicist working on magnetic resonance at the university hospital in
Jena, Germany. I started out with Linux as it made the leap to 2.0.0 and
have been running my home PC under Linux since then. The Laptop and an
AMD64 box also run under Linux. With computers, I started out in school
when they got Commodore PET 4040 boxes and later the very first PCs. Around
that time I picked up a Ti99/4a and did some assembler progamming (nice
16bit command set and relocateable registers) on that one since it was so
damn slow in BASIC. At the university I finally got my fingers on a SUN ELC
worksation and have tried to stay with Unix systems afterwards.

<h1>Booting Knoppix from a USB Pendrive via Floppy</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/okopnik.html">Ben Okopnik</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>

<p> There's a certain theme that runs through the Linux community, a sense
of invulnerability with which we endow our perception of our systems.
Terms like "bullet-proof" and "rock-solid", and phrases like "you could run
it on a toaster" abound - silly if considered in the bright light of day,
and dangerous when looked at from a certain perspective. What if someone
called you on it? Would you actually be able to set up a PC with Linux,
fire a 44-Magnum round at it, and expect it to bounce off? Would you expect
a PC to break in two along a cleavage line if you struck it with a
geological hammer? Do you <em>really</em> think that plugging a CD into the
bread slot of a toaster will make it pop up a cool GUI a few seconds later?
Of course not...
</p>

<p> ...but, well, <em><strong>still</strong></em>. There's <em>so</em> much
that Linux does so well, so many avenues that it opens that looked to be
permanently shut, that even in the hopeless cases we still harbor a bit of
hope.  Just a touch of a sense that maybe, just maybe, just possibly
there's some magic extra, some little advantage that will let us overcome
broken hardware, missing cables, outdated equipment... hey, don't some of
those Linux floppy firewall distros run without a monitor or even a hard
drive? If they can do it, why not us?
</p>

<p> The thing that keeps it going is that on a few occasions - not all, but
a few - there are those little successes that set us up for the next time.
Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing, I refuse to judge; I'm as much
of a success junkie as most other geeks, and am unrepentant about it - am,
in fact, always happy to boast about the fact (although, as they say, "it
ain't boasting if you can do it".) All the more so if recounting the
experience can help others learn a fun new method, or a cool way to
accomplish something useful. Hence, this article.
</p>


<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p> My fianc&eacute;e was interested in trying Linux - her opinion
regarding OSes being that Micr0s0ft should have stopped when the going was
good (that being defined as some time around the release of DOS 5.0.) Since
they hadn't, and since neither Micr0s0ft Bob nor the dancing paperclips had
lived up to their promise - which she hadn't believed anyway - she was
quite happy to try an OS that was bullet-proof and solid as a rock... erm.
Well, you know what I mean, anyway.
</p>

<p> However, there was A Problem. To be more precise, a long series of
problems, compounded by the circumstances. For one thing, her laptop - an
aging Sony VAIO F590K - did not have a working CD-ROM drive (goodbye, quick
and easy chance of booting Knoppix - or most of the other LiveCD
distros...) For another, she is the editor of a monthly newsletter for
space activists, and <strong>must</strong> have uninterrupted access to a
powerful graphic program as well as a DTP (desktop publisher program) -
having her computer out of service for any length of time was not an
option. What she really wanted was a chance to play with Linux on her
machine, where the feel of the keyboard and all the controls was familiar
and comfortable for her (and I heartily agreed, on the principle that, in a
properly-designed experiment, only the factor under test should change
while all else is held equal.) To complicate things a bit further, we live
on a <a href="http://okopnik.freeshell.org/img/ulysses.html">sailboat at
anchor</a>, and our Net access is therefore less than stellar - and is
quite slow. Things were looking pretty grim.
</p>

<p> By this point, I had considered a number of options, and had rejected
almost as many as I'd considered. What remained were some dim possibilities
- perhaps booting a minimal floppy-based Linux environment with a VNC
client while I ran a VNC server elsewhere on our LAN (clunky and restricted
by the artifacts of VNC itself), or maybe setting up the Cygwin X server on
Wind0ws (<em>Terra Incognita</em> to me since I'd never done anything with
Cygwin, along with a good bit of apprehension related to how it would work
and what kind of problems it would introduce into the process - on top of
those created by KDE's cluelessness with regard to the X networking
paradigm), or... or... wait, how about booting Knoppix from a flash drive?
I seemed to recall that I had read something about this, somewhere -
perhaps even a success story?  - and I was perfectly willing and able to
search the Net for an answer. The details of the necessary process were a
bit of a muddle in my head, but given time and resources, that would shake
out.
</p>


<h3>The Approach</h3>
<p>
Googling around the Web refined my list of remaining ideas even further,
knocking out several of the possibilities - as an example, several of the
live distros failed to include either the GIMP or OOffice, both of which
had been decided on as necessities - and focusing the choice down to
Knoppix and a few similar distros. Knoppix, as the most-commonly used
example of the genre, seemed to be the final answer - but how was I to get
it to the VAIO? The flash drive that I had, a 1GB Geek Squad pendrive,
would hold the image with room left over, but the machine had no option for
booting from flash - and a quick scan of Sony's site showed that there were
no BIOS updates to fix this.
</p>

<p> About that time, I recalled that someone in <a
href="http://linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html">the Answer Gang</a>
had mentioned <a href="http://www.goosee.com/puppy/">Puppy Linux</a> in the
recent past - and that the site had a discussion on how to make it boot
from flash by using a floppy. Hurrah!... well, Puppy doesn't contain GIMP
or OOffice (although it does have Scribus), but the fact that people are
booting USB-based Linux images via floppy was encouraging; this is what I
was looking for.
</p>


<h3>FLASH! Uh-huh...</h3>
<p> I read the FAQ very carefully, and got a very definite... headache. For
whatever reason, right at that moment my brain simply refused to accomodate
the necessary information - I'm sure that it had nothing to do with the way
it was presented, just that I didn't quite get it. More searching produced
the <a href="http://rz-obrian.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de/knoppix-usb/">Boot
KNOPPIX from an USB Memory Stick</a> FAQ - which helped a bit but still
didn't get me where I wanted to go. More research, including posting to The
Answer Gang (thanks, guys!)... and then I ran across Fabian Franz' <a
href="http://mailman.linuxtag.org/pipermail/debian-knoppix/2004-June/005340.html">script
for booting Knoppix 3.4</a>. It didn't work, of course - I didn't expect it
to, since Knoppix has changed quite a bit since those days - but by this
point, I understood the process and the structure of the Knoppix image well
enough that I could follow the logic all the way through.
</p>

<p> Combining the information from the above FAQ and the script finally
made it all click. The Knoppix CD consists of a number of files, of which
only one really mattered to what I needed: the "miniroot". To be exact, the
miniroot is a compressed bootable image within the Knoppix image - it is,
in fact, the part that makes the Knoppix CD bootable - so tweaking the
files inside it consisted of the following steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li> Mount the Knoppix image
<li> Decompress the miniroot into a temporary file
<li> Mount the miniroot
<li> Modify the files in it
<li> Recompress it
<li> Create a loop-mounted file
<li> Copy the miniroot into it
<li> Make it bootable
<li> Write it to a floppy
</ol>

<p>
Since the miniroot was larger than 1.44MB, the size it needed to be in
order to fit on a floppy, the easiest "diet" for it consisted of
mercilessly ripping out all the modules that were not needed for booting.
The SCSI modules could go... so could the CD-related ones... the important
thing to remember was that the miniroot's job is to simply boot a very
basic Linux environment and <em>immediately</em> turn control over to
Knoppix - which still had every bell and whistle it came with (the Knoppix
image itself remained untouched; the miniroot being tweaked was only a
<strong>copy</strong>.) If it became necessary, I'd get a crowbar and start
ripping out other bits... fortunately, this was not required, since
removing all modules other than the "usb"- and "hci"-related ones left the
miniroot below critical mass.
</p>

<p>
At this point, I ran into another problem... but this one was small enough
to be laughable. My laptop has no floppy drive, and the VAIO had nothing
resembling '/bin/dd' - and I couldn't think of anything other than DOS's
"debug.exe" that would write a raw image to a floppy. Yikes! Would I
actually have to remember that ancient command set to do this simple
job?... oh, right - the Debian project has "rawrite.exe" in its "tools/"
subdirectory. Whew. A few seconds to burn the floppy, and... that familiar
Knoppix logo glowed on the VAIO screen. <a href="#1">[1]</a>
</p>


<h3>No Wasted Effort</h3>
<p> After going through all this - it was an on-again, off-again project
that stretched over a number of weeks - I decided that there were other
Linux folks out there who would like to do this (<strong>NO,</strong> not
the struggle and the headache - the floppy/USB boot, of course!) The
traditional *nix method to propagate knowledge - notice that it worked well
in my case - is a script; the one presented below is a heavily-modified
version of the one by Fabian Franz. It allows you to specify a directory
containing the Knoppix image(s) as a command-line argument, or in the user
configuration section in the script itself, and creates a file called
"boot.img" that can be burned to a floppy to make a bootable environment
that passes control to a USB device. NOTE: I've tested it as thoroughly as
I could on my own machine, but make no guarantees in regard to anything
else. If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces. Yes, you are welcome to
contact me with suggestions or bug reports; no, I don't know how to fix
[pick issue of the day here] in Knoppix. I'm just a guy whose
fianc&eacute;e wants to play with the stuff. <img

<h1>Introduction to Shell Scripting, part 6</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/okopnik.html">Ben Okopnik</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<img src="../gx/reprint.png" alt="A Blast from the Past!">
<strong><em>Originally published in Issue 57 of Linux Gazette, September
2000</em></strong>


<h3>Random Wanderings</h3>
<p> Well, this should be the last article in the "Introduction to Shell
Scripting" series - I've had great feedback from a number of readers (and
thank you all for your kind comments!), but we've covered most of the
<strong>basics</strong>; that was the original purpose of the series. I may
yet pop up at some point in the future ("Oh, rats, I forgot to explain
XYZ!"), but those of you who've been following along should now consider
yourselves Big-Time Experts, qualified to carry a briefcase and sound important...
erm, <em>not</em>. :) At least you should have a pretty good idea of how
to write a script and make it work - and that's a handy skill.


<h3>A Valued Assistant</h3>
<p> Quite a while ago, I found myself in a quandary while writing a script;
I had an array that contained a list of command lines that I needed to
execute based on certain conditions.  I could read the array easily enough,
or print out any of the variables - but what I needed was to execute them!
What to do, what to do... as I remember, I gave up for lack of that one
capability, and rewrote the whole (quite large) script (it was <em>not</em> a
joyful experience). "eval" would have been the solution.

<p> Here's how it works - create a variable called $cmd, like so:

<pre>
Odin:~$ cmd='cat .bashrc|sort'
</pre>

<p> Now, you can echo the thing -

<pre>
Odin:~$ echo $cmd
cat .bashrc|sort'
</pre>

<p> - but how do you execute it? Just running "$cmd" produces an error:

<pre>
Odin:~$ $cmd
cat: .bashrc|sort: No such file or directory
</pre>

<p> This is where "eval" comes into its own: "<code>eval $cmd</code>" would
evaluate the string contained in the variable as if it had been entered at
the command line. This is not something that comes up too often... but it
is a capability of the shell that you need to be aware of.


<h3>Trapped Like a Rat</h3>
<p> One of the standard techniques in scripting (and in programming in general)
is that of writing data to temporary files - there are many reasons to
do this. But, and this is a big one, what happens when your users interrupt
that script half-way through execution? (For those of you who have scripts
like that and haven't thought of the issue, sorry to give you material
for nightmares. At least I'll show you the solution as well.)

<p> You guessed it: a mess. Files in "/tmp", perhaps important data left
hanging in the breeze, files thought to be updated that are not... Yuck.
How about a way for us to exit gracefully, despite a frantic
keyboard-pounding user who just <em>has</em> to run Quake <strong>RIGHT
NOW</strong>?

<p> The "trap" command provides an answer of sorts (shooting said user is
far more effective and enjoyable, but may get you talked about).

<pre class="code"> 
#!/bin/bash

function cleanup ()
{
	# Ignore 'Ctrl-C'; let him pound away...
	trap '' 2
	
	echo "Wake up, Neo."
	sleep 2
	clear
	echo "The Matrix has you."
	
	echo "He's at it again."|mail admin -s "Update stopped by $USER"
	
	# Restore the original data
	tar xvzf /mnt/backup/accts_recvbl -C /usr/local/acct
	
	# Delete 'tmp' stuff
	rm -rf /tmp/in_process/
	
	# OK, we've taken care of the cleanup. Now, it's REVENGE time!!!
	rm /usr/games/[xs]quake
	
	# Give him a nice new password...
	chpasswd $USER:~X%y!Z@zF%HG72F8b@Moron!&amp;(~64sfgrnntQwvff########^
	
	# We'll back up all his stuff... Oh, what does "--remove-files" do?
	tar cvz --remove-files -f /mnt/timbuktu/bye-bye.tgz /home/$USER
	# Heh-heh-heh...
	umount /mnt/timbuktu
	
	trap 2 # Set Ctrl-C back to normal
	exit        
	# Yep, I meant to do that...
}

trap 'cleanup' 2
...
</pre>

<p> There's a little of the BOfH inside every admin. &lt;grin&gt; (For those
of you not familiar with the "BOfH Saga", this is a <strong>must</strong> read for
every Unix admin; appalling and hideously funny. Search the Web.)

<p> DON'T run this script... yes, I know it's tempting. The point of "trap"
is, we can define a behavior whenever the user hits `Ctrl-Break' (or for
that matter, any time the script exits) that is much more useful to us than
just crashing out of the program; it gives us a chance to clean up,
generate warnings, etc.

<p> "trap" can also catch other signals; the fact is that "kill", despite
its name, does not of itself `kill' a process - it sends a signal. The
process then decides what to do with that signal (this is a crude
description, but generally correct). If you wish to see the entire list of
signals, just type "trap -l" or "kill -l" or even "killall -l" (which does
not list the signal numbers, just names). The ones most commonly used are
1) SIGHUP, 2) SIGINT, 3) SIGQUIT, 9) SIGKILL, and 15) SIGTERM (this last
one is the default for 'kill' when no signal name or number is specified.)

<p> There are also the `special' signals. They are: 0) EXIT, which traps on
any exit from the shell, and DEBUG (no number assigned), which can - here's
a nifty thing! - be used to troubleshoot shell scripts (it traps every time
a simple command is executed). DEBUG is actually more of an "info only"
item: you can have this exact action without writing any "trap"s, simply by
adding "-x" to your shebang (see "In Case Of Trouble...", below).

<p> "trap" is a powerful tool. In LG#37, Jim Dennis had a short script
fragment that created a secure directory under "/tmp" for just this sort of
thing - temp files that you don't want exposed to the world. Pretty cool
gadget; I've used it myself a few times since.


<h3>In Case Of Trouble, Break Glass</h3>
<p> Speaking of troubleshooting, Bash provides several very useful tools
that can help you find the errors in your script. These are switches -
part of the "set" command syntax - that are used in the shebang line
of the script itself. These switches are:

<ul>
<li>-n     Read the shell script lines, but do not execute
<li>-v     Print the lines as they're read
<li>-f     Disable wildcard expansion
<li>-x     Prints $PS4 (the "level of indirection" prompt), interprets, executes, and prints the command.
</ul>

<p> I've found that "-nv" and "-x" (and perhaps "-xf") are the most useful
invocations: one gives you the exact location of a "bad" line (you can see
where the script would crash); the other, `noisy' though it is, is handy
for seeing where things aren't happening quite the right way (when, even
though the syntax is right, the action is not what you want). Good
troubleshooting tools both. As time passes and you get used to the quirks
of error reporting, you'll probably use them less and less, but they're
invaluable to a new shell script writer.


<h3>Use The Source, Luke</h3>
<p> Here's a line familiar to every "C" programmer:

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</pre>

<p> - a very useful concept, that of <em>sourcing external files</em>. What
that means is that a "C" programmer can write routines (functions) that
are used repeatedly, store them in a `library' (an external file),
and bring them in as they are needed. Well - have I not said that shell
scripting is a mature, capable programming language? - we can do the same
thing!  The file doesn't even have to be executable; the syntax that we use
in sourcing it takes care of that. The example below is a snippet of the
top of my function library, "Funky". Currently, it is a single file, a
couple of kB long, and growing apace.

<p> There's a tricky little bit of Bash maneuvering that's worth knowing:
if you create a variable called BASH_ENV in your .bash_profile, like so:

<pre>
export BASH_ENV="~/.bash_env"
</pre>

<p> then create a file called ".bash_env" in your home directory, that file
will be re-read every time you start a `non-login non-interactive shell' -
i.e., a shell script. That's where I source "Funky" from - that way, any
changes in it are immediately available to any shell script. It can also be
sourced right from the command line.

<pre class="code">
calc () # Integer-only command-line calculator
{
    printf "$(($*))\n"
}

getch () # silently gets a char from keyboard, returns $GETCH
{
    OLD=`stty -g`
    stty raw -echo
    dd if=/dev/tty bs=1 count=1 2&gt;/dev/null
    stty $OLD
}

colsel () # Color selector - iterates through all the $TERM's color choices
{
trap 'echo -en "\E[$40;1m"; clear' 0	# Reset on exit
n=49	# Max foreground color value
while [ "$n" -ne 0 ]
do
	m=39	# Max background color value
	while [ "$m" -ne 0 ]
	do
		echo -en "\E[$m;${n}m"
        	clear
		echo "This is a test."
		echo -en "\E[$40;1m"
        	echo -n " $n $m "
        	read
		(( m-- ))
	done
	(( n-- ))
done
}
</pre>
<p> Not too different from a script, is it? No shebang is necessary,
since this file does not get executed by itself.  So, how do we use
it in a script? Here it is (we'll pretend that I don't source "Funky" in
".bash_env"):

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash
. Funky
declare -i Total=0
leave ()
{
    echo "So youse are done shoppin'?"
    [ $total -ne 0 ] &amp;&amp; echo "Dat'll be $total bucks, pal."
    echo "Have a nice day."
    exit
}

# Exec the 'leave' function on exit
trap 'leave' 0

clear

# Infinite loop!
while :
do
    echo
    echo "Whaddaya want? I got Cucumbers, Tomatoes, Lettuce, Onions,"
    echo "and Radishes today."
    echo
    
    # Here's where we call a sourced function...
    input=`getch`
    # ...and reference a variable created by that function.
    case $input
    in
	C|c) Total=$Total+1; echo "Them are good cukes." ;;
	T|t) Total=$Total+2; echo "Ripe tomatoes, huh?" ;;
	L|l) Total=$Total+2; echo "I picked da lettuce myself." ;;
	O|o) Total=$Total+1; echo "Fresh enough to make youse cry!" ;;
	R|r) Total=$Total+2; echo "Real crispy radishes." ;;
	*) echo "Ain't got nuttin' like that today, mebbe tomorra." ;;
    esac
    sleep 2

 done
</pre>

<p> Note the period before "Funky": that's an alias for the "source" command.
When sourced, "Funky" acquires an interesting property: just as if we had
asked "bash" to execute a file, it goes out and searches the path listed
in $PATH. Since I keep "Funky" in "/usr/local/bin" (part of my $PATH),
I don't need to give an explicit path to it.

<p> If you're going to be writing shell scripts, I strongly suggest that
you start your own `library' of functions. (HINT: Steal the functions from
the above example!) Rather than typing them over and over again, a single
"source" argument will get you lots and lots of `canned' goodies.


<h3>Wrapping Up The Series</h3>

<p> Well - overall, lots of topics covered, some "quirks" explained; all
good stuff, useful shell scripting info. There's a lot more to it - remember,
this series was only an <em>introduction</em> to shell scripting - but anyone
who's stuck with me from the beginning and persevered in following my brand
of pretzel-bending logic (poor people! irretrievably damaged, not even
the best psychologist in the world can help you now... :) should now be
able to design, write, and troubleshoot a fairly decent shell script. The
rest of it - understanding and writing the more complex, more involved
scripts - can only come with practice, otherwise known as "making lots
of mistakes". In that spirit, I wish you all lots of "mistakes"!

<p> Happy Linuxing!

<h1>User-Centered Design</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/orr.html">Mike Orr (Sluggo)</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>

<p>
Software developers are good at making programs that work.  We're less good at
making programs that do what the users want, or are convenient to use.  That's
because developers often misunderstand what users need, even when they try hard
to &quot;think like a user&quot;.  My development strategy is a common one: (1) get
requirements from management, (2) draw out a design, (3) code it, (4) debug,
(5) beta test, (6) rollout, (7) DONE!  (Except documentation and periodic
maintenance, of course.)  But the past few months I've been fortunate to work
with a woman who's getting a PhD in Cognitive Science and leads workshops in
user-centered design and usability testing.  I've been amazed at how well these
techniques identify missing features and misfeatures in programs, things
developers would not have considered.  I've also been fortunate to have
an enlightened management team willing to try these techniques in our projects.
So I wanted to share a bit about these techniques.
</p>

<p>
Usability testing is based on the premise that it will happen whether planned
or not.  Either the developers will do it in their labs, or the customers will
do it after they've bought the product.  The latter leads to frustrated and
angry users, and an expensive redesign down the road.  Either you build a
prototype and test it with typical users, or your version 1.0 is a de facto
prototype, a beta disguised as a final product.
</p>

<p>
It may surprise people that many these principles were already known in the
1970s.  Surprising because they still haven't trickled very far into
programming practice twenty-five years later, as anybody who has sworn at a
perfectly-running but incorrigible program -- or wanted to throw a version
1.0 off a cliff -- can attest.  One of the seminal research papers is <a
href="http://www.research.ibm.com/compsci/spotlight/hci/p300-gould.pdf">Designing
for Usability: Key Principles and What Designers Think</a> (PDF, 1.6 MB),
written in 1985 by John D Gould and Clayton Lewis, two IBM researchers.
The paper discusses three principles of user-centered design: (A) early
focus on users and tasks, (B) empirical measurement, and (C) iterative
design.  It shows how designers often don't do these even when they think
they are, and then presents a case where the principles were successful.
The paper has amusing 1980s assumptions; e.g., Wang word processors are
common, computers are mostly &quot;terminals&quot;, managers don't have
computers, the Apple Lisa was recent, etc.  The &quot;case&quot; was a
project to build a dictation system with a telephone interface.  That is, a
manager would call the service, press a few buttons, record his letter,
then later a secretary would later type up a paper copy and deliver it.
</p>

<p>
The first thing the developers did was to think about the users, as discussed
below.  They then invited users into the design process, to tell the developers
what they wanted.  The developers built prototypes and devised usability tests
to verify they were going in the right direction.  A usability test is an
empirical measurement; e.g., can 80% of users perform a specific task correctly
in X minutes with only Y type of help?  What mistakes do they make?  Do these
mistakes suggest defects in the design?  This process is <em>iterative</em>, meaning
feedback leads to changes in the prototype, which leads to more feedback, which
leads to more changes, etc.  Eventually the suggestions become fewer and more
trivial, meaning you are close to completion.
</p>

<p>
The prototype had a table-driven user interface so changes could be made
easily.  Keys are linked to API functions via a keymap, and some keys lead to
other keymaps (submenus).  Output messages are kept in another table.  This
allowed them to reorganize the user interface based on user feedback without
touching the underlying code, and they could also add additional user
interfaces for different types of users.  Another advantage was that when the
prototype was finally deemed acceptable, the work was done: the prototype <em>was</em>
the final product.  (&quot;How long will it take you to implement this for real?
---No time.&quot;)
</p>

<p>
This whole process led to major benefits which would not have been possible
otherwise.  Early usability tests showed that a &quot;dictation system&quot; was not
really worthwhile: the users didn't take to it and it was inefficient.  What
the users <em>did</em> like was the ability to listen to messages they or others had
recorded.  This was an unintended side effect but it became the primary
feature.  So a &quot;dictation system&quot; became a &quot;voice message&quot; system in an era
when voice mail was unknown.  This would never have happened in a linear
development process where the design was fixed at an early stage, as in my step
2 above.  Even if the users were asked at the beginning what features they
wanted, they could not have said.  They had to actually play with the product
before they knew what they wanted.  But by the time they saw the product in the
beta test it would have been too late, especially if I had not had the
foresight to make the user interface code isolated and flexible.
</p>

<p>
User-centered design doesn't replace the linear development model; it goes on
top of it.  Every stage includes user analysis and usability testing, and
occasionally discoveries require looping back to an earlier stage.  But you're
still going in the same general direction.  Just expect a lot of
build-test-refine-test-refine cycles.
</p>

<p>
The rest of this article is a cookbook of ways to evaluate the usability of
your product.  These are just a few ideas, the tip of the iceberg.  If you know
a usability expert, I would highly recommend sitting in on a design session or
hiring their services, because they have many ingenious ideas up their sleeve
that I am only beginning to explore.
</p>


<h3>General</h3>
<p>
When recording user feedback or brainstorming, it's helpful to write in two
columns.  On the left put observations; on the right put implications for the
product.  For instance, &quot;several users thought they were supposed to do X&quot; is
an observation.  &quot;Have a popup window that explains not to do X&quot; is an
implication.  Just list implications for later analysis; don't dwell on them
now.  Dwelling on implications takes time away from getting feedback, and may
distort the quality of the feedback.
</p>

<p>
If you're concerned about how long this will take, remember that usability
research can be done simultaneously with other development, especially if more
than one developer is available.  This initial stage may take longer, but the
results will be seen in the quality of the product, and you may even be able to
make up time by avoiding mistakes.
</p>

<p>
Also, keep in mind that it's OK to defer some features to &quot;phase 2&quot;.  At some
point you have to get a working product out the door.  Maybe production use
will uncover flaws more significant than the phase 2 features.  Or maybe the
users will decide those features aren't that important after all, and they'd
rather have something else in phase 2.
</p>

<p>
Once you've identified some questions and ideas that work, make them into a
checklist for future projects.  That will make ongoing design all the much
easier.
</p>


<h3>Who are the users?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Who will be interacting with the product most frequently?  E.g., data entry
operators, customer support representatives.</li>
<li>Who will use the product less frequently?  E.g., managers viewing quarterly
summaries, sysadmins creating user accounts or doing configuration.</li>
<li>Who does not use the product directly but is affected by those who do?  E.g.,
for a store checkout system, the cashier's customer.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Beware of know-it-all supervisors or buyers. If they aren't the main users
themselves, they probably understand less than they think they do about what
system would be the most productive and satisfying for the users.  Sometimes
this is difficult because the supervisors are your clients and won't allow you
to talk to the users. In this case, try to impress on them how essential
interaction with users and usability testing is for the quality of the product.
Or maybe it's a sign not to take that job, since the clients will no doubt
blame you for any shortcomings in the product.
</p>


<h3>Observing users</h3>
<ul>
<li>Observe users doing their daily tasks.  Which tasks are most frequent or most
important?  How do your product's tasks fit into the overall picture?</li>
<li>Is your product replacing an existing product? How do users interact with
the current product? Are they satisfied with it? What do they do when it's
broken?</li>
<li>Are the users enthusiastic about their job in general or just punching the
clock?</li>
<li>How do they deal with emergencies or unusual situations?</li>
<li>What constraints (lack of resources) do they have?  Is the room too small?
Not enough computers?  Are the computers maxed out in their performance?</li>
<li>What are the users' job types, professional levels, skill levels, education
backgrounds, language backgrounds, physical/mental disabilities?</li>
<li>Is it possible that future users will need more accommodation than current
users?  E.g., accessibility, simple instructions, online help.</li>
<li>Do the users like to explore new programs and figure out how to do things
(inductive), or would they rather get an overview and then learn the details
(deductive).</li>
<li>Did the users get formal training on the existing system?  Was the training
adequate?</li>
<li>How often will they use the new system?  How much turnover will there be?
Both of these determine what kind of instructions and help they will need.</li>
<li>Are the users required to use the system or is it a discretionary choice?  If
users don't find it easy and convenient, they won't use it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you can't observe the users in action, you'll have to use another means such
as interviews, written answers, secondary users, or managers.  But be aware
this information will likely be lower quality.
</p>

<p>
Sharing your impressions with the users and managers will often elicit further
suggestions.  It'll also impress the managers with your thoroughness and
insight.
</p>

<p>
Beware of underestimating the diversity of users.  Also beware of how difficult
a &quot;simple&quot; task can appear to a user, who doesn't have the developer's
background knowledge.
</p>


<h3>Identifying Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Who <em>should</em> be using the product (as opposed to who <em>is</em> using it)?  What
incentives can we give to those who should be using it but are not?  What
alternatives can we give to those who should not be using it?
</li>
<li>List step-by-step task sequences the users typically perform.  Is this the
most efficient sequence for the user?  Are there steps we'd like to drop or
let the computer perform automatically?  What constraints do users' tasks
place on the system?  E.g., features that must exist, accommodation for users
without web access or using a slow modem.
</li>
<li>For tasks that require multiple persons, who does what part?
</li>
<li>Does program input come from another program?  What format is it in?  Does
output go to another program?  What format does it have to be in?
</li>
<li>Have the user draw screens and write down what they expect to type or click
on at each step.
</li>
<li>List the nouns and verbs that represent the concepts the product needs to
support.  This can lead to a preliminary object model.
<blockquote>

<p>
E.g., in a doctor's office, a Patient object has attributes for name,
phone, insurance ID, and medical history.  A Drug object has the drug's
name, principal effect, side effects, indications (who should use it),
contraindications (who should not use it), interactions with other drugs, a
list of manufacturers/brands/prices, and the doctor's personal notes about
the drug's effectiveness. The doctor <em>logs in</em>, finds the
<em>patient</em> and his <em>chart</em>, writes <em>notes</em> in the
chart, browses the <em>drug</em> selection, and <em>writes</em> a
prescription.
</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Have users write short paragraphs on flashcards describing a &quot;usage story&quot;:
how they'd like to interact with the product and what it should do.
Lay the flashcards on a large table or pin them to a bulletin board, and move
them around into logical groups. (Fans of eXtreme Programming will like
this.)
</li>
<li>What measurable tests can the user think of that will show how well the
product is meeting its goals?
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Usability tests</h3>

<p>
Decide on a test that will measurably show whether the product is getting
closer to its goal.
</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Build a working prototype that fulfills the basic requirements, even if it
doesn't have all the features or a pretty interface.</li>
<li>If the requirements are too lofty to build a prototype in a week, break them
up into smaller pieces that can be tested separately.</li>
<li>Draw screenshots of what the program would look like, showing each screen the
user would interact with.</li>
<li>&quot;Play computer&quot;.  Sit in the workplace and have the users come to you and
tell you what buttons they'd press and what input they'd give, and you tell
them how the computer would respond.  Or have the users write down the keys
they would press.</li>
<li>Draw workflow diagrams showing what role each person plays in the whole.</li>
<li>Before writing the program, write the users' manual and ask for feedback.</li>
<li>Ask users to &quot;think aloud&quot; as they try to complete a task. This can provide
valuable insight regarding the program's navigation and layout. A user can
also keep a diary about their impressions.</li>
<li>Ask the user to read a section of documentation and summarize what it means.</li>
<li>Are the most frequently-used or important controls in a prominent location on
the first screen?  Does the layout guide the eye to them?  Do the dialogs
contain seldom-used or overtechnical text that distracts the mind?  Maybe
these should be banished to a separate screen and reworded, or maybe the
screen needs a &quot;legend&quot; page or an application-wide glossary.</li>
<li>Log calls to the help desk or the use of online help.  See which questions
appear most frequently.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For general open-source products like KOffice where there are thousands of
users worldwide, it may make sense to continue the practice of releasing alphas
and betas and having a bug-tracking database, but also send out more focused
surveys on what is good/bad about the product.
</p>

<p>
I hope this gives you a taste of what is possible, and perhaps piques your
interest in learning more about usability research.  There are several good
textbooks available from your friendly college bookstore, including <em>Human
Aspects of Computing</em> edited by Henry Ledgard, <em>Usability Testing and Research</em>
by Carol M Barnum, <em>User and Task Analysis for Interface Design</em> by JT Hackos
and JC Redish, and others.  These are the ones I consulted for the checklist
above.  Good luck and happy designing.

<h1>Transporting Files between Linux and Windows</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/raby.html">Dale Raby</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>

<p> A long time ago in a galaxy far... no
that isn't quite right. Well, it was a while ago, 1999 or so, as I
recall. In any case, it was at that particular Barbourian Now when I
finally decided to jump into "modern" times and abandon my old
Tandy 600 laptop for something that could actually "surf the web",
as it was known back in those innocent times. So I went out and
bought a used machine running Windows 95.
</p>

<p> Having been rather flush with cash at
the time, I also bought a Hewlett-Packard printer and an IBM parallel
port scanner. Shortly after this, I discovered what a really rotten
OS Windows of that era was. I think it was after the third or fourth
time I had to take the machine in for yet another fifty dollar repair
that I began to search for alternatives and discovered Linux. It was
a boxed copy of Mandrake 6.5... which was even packaged with a
ready-made boot disc.
</p>

<p> Unfortunately, Linux did not support my
scanner... and it still doesn't. I did without it for a time, but
eventually I got another Windows machine up and limping just so I
could have scanner capability. Transferring image files to the Linux
machine was a laborious process involving copying to an Iomega Zip
disk and then re-copying them to the Linux machine's hard drive, or
emailing them to myself from the Windows machine and receiving them
on the Linux machine. This was also a laborious task... especially
with the 28.8 modems I was using at the time.
</p>

<p> Eventually, I set up a LAN... which was
a terrifying prospect at first that I put off for several years until
I finally broke down. I had since acquired a Sony Mavica camera,
which was also not supported under Linux, though I had a workaround
in the floppy discs the Mavica could use. It was much easier and
faster to transfer the images from the Sony Memory Stick to the
Windows machine, however. 
</p>

<p> The LAN made it possible to transfer
files, from one computer to the other, though it was by no means
easy. I don't care what anyone says; SAMBA IS NOT simple to set up!
By this time, I had pretty much abandoned Windows for all uses except
supporting my legacy scanner and camera, and was getting to be fairly
comfortable with command lines in a Bash shell and the use of common
Linux applications like the GIMP.
</p>

<p>
<img src="misc/raby/cygsetup.jpg" name="graphics2" align="left" hspace="10"
vspace="10">
</p>

<p> I still had no easy way to get the files to my Linux machine,
even though there was no theoretical hardware limitation. I am many
things, but I am not by any stretch an IT professional. I was
however, blessed with a web-buddy of genius level IQ; one Mae Ling
Mak, formerly of the late Maximum Linux magazine. She dropped a few
terms I had never heard before; 'scp' and 'Cygwin'. Now, it being too
embarrassing for a studly alpha male type such as myself to actually
admit to an attractive young woman that I didn't know what those
terms meant, I went Googling. I find that I often do quite a bit of
Googling whenever I receive an email from Mae Ling Mak. 
</p>

<p> OK - Cygwin is, for all practical
purposes, a Windows application that gives you a Bash shell. Within
this shell, one can run many common Linux/Unix applications on top of
the Windows OS. When it is installed, one makes the choices of which
applications one needs. If you want Mutt and GnuPG, for example, you
simply check those boxes during the setup process, and they are
installed for you. 
</p>

<p> 'scp' is the "secure copy protocol".
It allows one to transfer files from one location to another
within the LAN or even to a server on the Internet. Using the '-r'
option, one can transfer entire directories intact with all their
embedded children. One of the nice things about 'scp' is that anything
sent this way is automatically encrypted so that nobody can read what
is sent. Read between the lines here.
</p>

<p>
<img src="misc/raby/cyg1.jpg" name="graphics1" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10">
</p>

<p> Now, using 'scp' from a Cygwin Bash shell will allow one to
transfer files from the Windows machine with obsolete non-Linux
supported hardware to the Linux machine using a command line. 
</p>

<p> Two problems then manifested
themselves; I was not familiar enough with the 'scp' command to
remember the procedure from one week to the next, and the Windows
directory hierarchy is complex and confusing to anyone used to
Unix/Linux. Also, as noted in the illustration, one cannot navigate
double-named directories with Bash, so my default Windows ME
directories My Pictures, My Documents, and Program Files, are still
unreachable with Cygwin. 
</p>

<p class="editorial">[ In fact, they are indeed reachable - but, just like
filenames that contain whitespace in *nix, they require a bit of twiddling.
Namely, surrounding the file or directory name with quotes - i.e.  <span
style="color: black">cd "My Pictures"</span>, etc. Conversely, you could
use wildcards: <span style="color: black">ls *Pictures</span> or even <span
style="color: black">ls My*Pictures</span> should work fine. -- Ben ]</p>

<p> By doing a little Googling, I got the
proper command sequence ironed out. Then Mae Ling jumped into my head
from a few years back when she wrote an article about scripts. After
a little consideration, I created a text file containing the command
sequence to transfer my files to the host computer called "beam".
</p>

<p> The simplest way to do this is to
invoke 'vi', as "vi beam", and paste the text below into it, suitably
modified to suit your own system. You will need to substitute your
own username on the Linux system, and you may be able to use the
domain name of the host computer, rather than the IP address I used,
depending on how you have your LAN set up. The '-r' option recursively
copies the entire specified directory and its contents - in this case,
that's "/home/dale/transporter" - to the host computer. The comments
are, of course, optional.
</p>

<pre> 
# this is an scp command file. To use it, transfer files to the
# &quot;transporter&quot; directory and then invoke the command line
# below or simply type &quot;./beam&quot; in a Cygwin bash shell.

scp -r transporter dale@192.168.1.12:/home/dale
</pre>

<p> Next, I created a new directory, thusly: "<code>mkdir
transporter</code>". Now I had a command file to "remember" the command
sequence for me, as well as a place to store documents I wished transported
to the host computer (the "transporter" directory). This directory can be
accessed using the Windows GUI, which sidesteps the double name problem.
</p>

<p> By simply typing in "<code>./beam</code>", one can initiate transport.
When you do this, you will be prompted for the password you set up on the
Linux machine and after entering it, the directory "transporter" magically
appears in your home directory on the host machine. Upon browsing it, you
will find all your files intact. 
</p>

<p> No fuss, no
muss. Now you can open all those .bmp images with the GIMP and alter
them to your heart's content.
</p>

<p> For proper
housekeeping, one must clear the transporter platform after every
use... on both ends! If you do not do this, you may have to dig
through a pile of tribbles to find what you just transported. Note
also, that any file of the same name will be overwritten by the
subsequent version of it. I usually access the files as transported
and after modifying them, use the "save as" option from the file
menu of most Linux applications to put them in different directories.
</p>

<p class="editorial">[ This kind of problem in *nix is traditionally
handled by creating a new, time-stamped directory at the "receiver" end
during each upload. This avoids conflict with existing files, but requires
occasional cleanup to conserve disk space. -- Ben ]</p>

<p> Then I do a "./jayne":</p>

<pre> 
#this script sends Jayne and Vera to &quot;clear&quot; the transporter platform.
rm -rf transporter
</pre>

<p>
<img src="misc/raby/jayne.jpg" name="graphics3" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10">
</p>

<p> You can use the 'jayne' command file only with caution, like
Adam Baldwin's character. 'jayne' is dangerous and will not care if
you forgot to move the files off the transporter platform... he will
simply kill them all and give them to the Reavers. You will not be
able to recover them. If you want to watch Jayne and Vera do their
evil work, you can use the '-v' option, and then you will see a listing
as Jayne makes each kill. 
</p>

<p> The 'jayne' command should not be used on the Cygwin end of things, as
it deletes the "transporter" directory. If you want to run a 'jayne'
command on both ends, you have to remember to "mkdir transporter" before
you can use the transporter again.
</p>

<p> If you want
to, I suppose you could make another command file and call it either
"scotty", or "kaylee", depending upon whether you are a
member of Star Fleet or the Browncoats. Scripts do indeed invoke a
certain amount of Serenity.

<h1>SEO and PHP</h1>

<p>

<p> In today's fast-paced world, the importance of <em>Search Engine
Optimisation</em> and usability has been thrust into the limelight. More
and more companies and employers are hearing the buzz that is SEO, and want
reassurance that their new Web site will deliver. They all want to
be top of the search engines, and we all know that that will rarely happen.
There are, however, things we can do to help the issue, and make life a
little easier for those lovable bots and spiders who crawl our pages.


<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p> Whether you believe the fact that search engines discriminate against ID
numbers in URL strings or not, the fact of the matter is that

<pre>
[1] http://www.a_mucky_page.com/products?id=00234987&amp;category=990003429
</pre>

will never look as nice to the end user, or search engines, as

<pre>
[2] http://www.a_nice_place_to_be.com/products-modems/speed-baud-5000.html
</pre>

<p> Getting rid of GET parameters is also an advantage, as some search tools
will discriminate against pages based on the number of parameters.

<p> This article is a primer to help overcome this problem, using
PHP/MySQL/Apache and a pinch of mod_rewrite thrown in for some spice. In
some cases, this may not be the best solution, but is always worth
considering, as mod_rewrite is an extremely powerful tool in your PHP
Web development toolkit.

<p> To begin with, you will need a Web server running Apache with
mod_rewrite installed. If you own the server, this is going to be easy.
If not, you may have trouble getting the administrators to install
mod_rewrite. The reasons for this are simple; the administrators are not
trying to annoy you, but one false move inside mod_rewrite code, and the
CPU load goes through the roof. This article assumes you already have
some knowledge of LAMP systems (Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP), and that you
have mod_rewrite installed.


<h3>Structuring</h3>
<p> Structuring your database is an important step in the process, and must
be carefully thought about; however, it may be that your database is well
enough structured already - in which case, well done. Keeping your data
tidy not only helps you but also will automatically make for a more SEO
(Search Engine Optimised) system. We are going to use the example of a
single-tier categorisation system. By that, I mean that products are
sorted into a single category that fits them best. We will have two
tables, one for categories and one for products. Their structure will be
as in the tables below. You can see that the product table is linked to
the category table through the category_id field.

<dl>
<dt><strong>Category</strong>
<dd>id
<dd>title
<dd>description
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Products</strong>
<dd>id
<dd>category_id
<dd>title
<dd>description
<dd>price
</dl>

<h3>Preliminary Coding</h3>
<p> Let us write some PHP code to pull out the record information based on
the URL line [1] above. We have the two parameters we need: product and
category. The customer wants the category information listed on the page
with the product. Code for this may look like the example below:

<pre class="code">
&lt;?php
//Setup Database
mysql_connect(127.0.0.1, blark_inc, my_password);
mysql_select_db(blark_inc);

//Get the GET parameters
$category=$_GET['category'];
$id=$_GET['id'];

//Call in data for category and products
$category  =  mysql_fetch_array(mysql_query('SELECT * FROM category
WHERE id=\"'.$category.'\"'));
$product   =  mysql_fetch_array(mysql_query('SELECT * FROM products
WHERE id=\"'.$id.'\"'));

//Output the information
echo 'Category Name : '.$category['title'].'&lt;br&gt;';
echo 'Category Description : '.$category['description'].'&lt;br&gt;';
echo 'Product Name : '.$product['title'].'&lt;br&gt;';
echo 'Product Description : '.$product['description'].'&lt;br&gt;';
?&gt;
</pre>

<p> So, in our simple example, the IDs of both tables are called with the
GET method, and their relevant information pulled from the database and
output to the end user. As stated previously, though, this method uses a
URL string that does not look pretty in the least; rather, it's hideous.
You may argue that the category ID does not need to be stated, and
while this is true for a single-tier categorisation system, other more
complicated types of system may well need this capability. Just imagine
if a product were to appear in more than one category.


<h3>Enter mod_rewrite</h3>
<p> It is now that we pick up our pot of spice, with mod_rewrite scrawled in
friendly letters on the site, and begin to add in that little bit extra. Up
until now, we have not really discussed what mod_rewrite does - we have
simply put it forward as an answer to all our problems. So, let us delve
a little deeper. mod_rewrite is an Apache module that will rewrite URLs
according to certain rules. In effect, a browser will request a file by
name, e.g., my-life.html, and may be returned a completely different file,
e.g., my-friends-life.php, but it all happens transparently: i.e., the user
will still think he or she is viewing my-life.html. It is similar to the
notion of symbolic links in Linux, but a lot more powerful. Let us look
at a few examples of how this could be used. Please note this is not
actual code, just basic examples.

<pre>
<strong>Change all .html to .php</strong>
blark.html would become blark.php
Would give the effect of a static site, all links would be .html.

<strong>Redirect requests pages under maintenance</strong>
index.php would become maintain.php
Could modify a specific filename to point to a maintenance page.

<strong>Use the page name as a GET parameter for another page</strong>
my-information.php would become pages.php?page=my-information
Useful for having one script to run the show.
</pre>


<p><strong>Note:</strong><br>

mod_rewrite will only modify the URL if Apache is used to collect the file.
It makes no difference to files stored on your Web server. For example,
includes in PHP will remain unaffected, as they do not obtain the file
through the HTTP protocol but use the local file system.

<p> It is the last one of these examples that is of interest to us. Let us
make a simple .htaccess file to test some of the examples we have
just written. The .htaccess file contains all the rules for mod_rewrite
within that directory, an example of which is below.

<p> RewriteEngine on

<p> #First example - modify all .html to .php
RewriteRule ^(.*).html$ $1.php

<p> #Second example - modify index.php to maintain.php
RewriteRule ^index.php$ maintain.php

<p> #Third example - Use pagename as a get parameter
RewriteRule ^(.*).php$ pages.php/?page=$1


<p><strong>Note:</strong><br> 

If you make a mistake in the .htaccess file, and the resulting code
that mod_rewrite finds is invalid, you will be alerted with an Internal
Server error page, Error 500. Do not worry; this is normal. Just alter
the line, and try again.

<p> The expressions' syntax can take some time to understand, and
indeed I had a rather long experience learning this, when someone forgot
to put a escape character '/' before the '?' in a tutorial.
The rules follow the format of

<pre>
RewriteRule What_I_am_looking_for What_I_want_it_to_become
</pre>


<h3>Mod_rewrite Xplained !</h3>
<p> The '^' means start matching the filename from the beginning of the URL
string after the host. For example, with
http://www.my-life.com/test.html, mod_rewrite will only look at what
comes after http://www.my-life.com/, i.e., test.html.
The '()' are used to catch data. Anything that matches and
falls inside these parentheses will be stored. This can then be recalled
by using a '$1' in the rewritten expression, as can be seen in the first
example. The '.*' within the brackets in the first example catches all
characters, and the '$' denotes the end of the URL string. In this
example, for a file to fit the criteria, it must be a set of characters,
followed by '.html' with nothing trailing on the end. When mod_rewrite
finds a match, it takes the value inside the brackets and puts it back
to work in the rewrite expression '$1.php'. $1 means use the data from
the first set of brackets. If you had another set of brackets in the
matching expression, then using the data from it would mean using '$2'
in the rewrite expression.

<p> The second example should be obvious now. It matches the term
index.php exactly with no variations, and rewrites it to maintain.php.

<p> The last example is the one that should prove of most interest to
us. We are matching anything before the '.php' and rewriting this as the
GET parameter of another file called pages.php. Please take careful note
of the '/' in front of the '?'. '?' is a special character in mod_rewrite
code, and must be escaped using the '/'.


<p><strong>Note:</strong><br>

<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html</a>.


<h3>Let's Bake a Product Database (Bleugh)</h3>
<p> We now have everything we need to make our search engine-optimised
product catalogue. All that is needed is to remove those harmful IDs and
to replace them with something else. Why not make a separate field in
the table that can hold a unique identifier of a product, but written in
text instead of numbers? It may sound like a tiresome task and
unnecessary, but it can help you out. We will add a separate field to
each table in our database, and call it mod_page. This will hold a
modified version of the product/category title, and this will be used as
a unique identifier. For example the product 'Speed Baud 5000 Enhanced
modem' may have a mod_page value of 'speed-baud-5000'. It is up to you
how you create mod_page. It may be that you want to type each one in
individually, or it may be that you use a simple PHP script to translate
one into the other.


<h3>Mod_rewrite to the Rescue</h3>
<p> We now have to create a mod_rewrite rule that will interface with the
code we wrote previously, as closely as possible. Obviously, now that we
are using mod_names instead of IDs to call records, there will have to
be some changes, but the structure of it should remain the same.
Referring to the above code, it should be clear that we are expecting two
parameters. One called 'id' and the other 'category'. Let us
sculp a mod_rewrite expression that fulfils these criteria.

<p> To make the URL user friendly I have chosen the format
www.blark_inc.com/products-(category name)/(product_name).html .

<p> RewriteRule ^products-(.*)/(.*).html$ products.php/?category=$1&amp;id=$2


<p> This expression will take two pieces of data: The first is the word, or
character string after the 'products-' and the second is the name of the
page in this phantom directory. Remember that the /products-whatever/
directory does not even exist. Rather, it is being used to fool the user
and search engines into thinking that the site is structured in that manner.

<p> To take our example from before,

<pre>
http://www.blark_inc.com/products-modems/speed-baud-5000.html
</pre>

<p> will be magically and transparently transformed into

<pre>
http://www.blark_inc.com/products.php?category=modems&amp;id=speed-baud-5000 .
</pre>

<p> See how easy it is !

<p> We now need to make a few changes to the products page code in order for
it to pull the records out of the database. All that needs to be changed
are the field names in the database query lines.

<pre class="code">
$category = mysql_fetch_array(mysql_query('SELECT * FROM category WHERE
id="'.$category.'"'));
$product = mysql_fetch_array(mysql_query('SELECT * FROM products WHERE
id="'.$id.'"'));
</pre>


<p> becomes

<pre class="code">
$category = mysql_fetch_array(mysql_query('SELECT * FROM category WHERE
mod_name="'.$category.'"'));
$product = mysql_fetch_array(mysql_query('SELECT * FROM products WHERE
mod_name="'.$id.'"'));
</pre>


<p> and thus the total code becomes:


<pre class="code">
&lt;?php
//Setup Database
mysql_connect(127.0.0.1, blark_inc, my_password);
mysql_select_db(blark_inc);

//Get the GET parameters
$category=$_GET['category'];
$id=$_GET['id'];

//Call in data for category and products
$category  =  mysql_fetch_array(mysql_query('SELECT * FROM category
WHERE mod_page=\"'.$category.'\"'));
$product   =  mysql_fetch_array(mysql_query('SELECT * FROM products
WHERE mod_page=\"'.$id.'\"'));

//Output the information
echo 'Category Name : '.$category['title'].'&lt;br&gt;';
echo 'Category Description : '.$category['description'].'&lt;br&gt;';
echo 'Product Name : '.$product['title'].'&lt;br&gt;';
echo 'Product Description : '.$product['description'].'&lt;br&gt;';
?&gt;
</pre>


<h3>Summary</h3>
<p> As mentioned previously, this is a nice way to make your site look well
structured, to both user and search engine. It has been mentioned that
mod_rewrite does take a little more CPU load to run than if there were no
mod_rewrite at all, but I personally have never had a problem with it.
Providing that it is used in the right way, and not used to solve every
mis-extensioned file, it should not be discounted, and should form a part
of your PHP toolkit.

<h1>Design Awareness: What Parachute Is Your Color?</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/seymour.html">Mark Seymour</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<p>Colors are, for all of us except those unfortunate enough to be
blind to them, much of the way we perceive the world. They are so
powerful that they've even made themselves part of our language, as
written on our very faces: green with envy, red with anger, gray
with pain.</p>

<p>We use them every day, almost without thinking, to create any of
the visual media: painting, photography, design. In traditional
forms, your eye and hand skills were all you had to create,
compare, and reproduce colors, and the number of colors you can
create from oil paints or watercolors, for example, is nearly
infinite. Computers have given us powerful tools to manipulate
color (<a href="http://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a> and <a href=
"http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/">Photoshop</a> are two
common examples), yet have forced us into ever narrower color
gamuts.</p>

<p><em>Gamut</em> is one of those 'techie' words many of us use
without exactly understanding its meaning. The earliest dated
reference I could find was "Gamut, the scale, or rudiments of
music" in a <!--

book</a> entitled <i>The Sacred Harp, A Collection of Psalm and
Hymn Tunes, Odes, and Anthems, Selected from the Most Eminent
Authors: Together with Nearly One Hundred Pieces Never Before
Published; Suited to Most Metres, and Well Adapted to Churches of
Every Denomination, Singing Schools, and Private Societies. With
Plain Rules for Learners.</i> It was published in Philadelphia in
1860, as a "New and Much Improved and Enlarged Edition", by B.F.
White and E.J. King, who knew a thing or two about writing titles,
if nothing else.</p>

<p>The Oxford English Dictionary gives this definition:</p>

<ol>
<li>the complete range or scope of something</li>

<li>Music: a complete scale of musical notes; the compass or range
of a voice or instrument</li>

<li>Historical: a scale consisting of seven overlapping hexachords,
containing all the recognized notes used in medieval music</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>from the Latin <i>gamma ut</i> (in sense 4): the Greek letter
<i>gamma</i> was used for bass G, with <i>ut</i> indicating that it
was the first note in the lowest of the hexachords <i>example:</i>
run the gamut; to experience, display, or perform the complete
range of something <a href="#1">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href=
"http://www.public.asu.edu/%7edetrie/pages/design_foundation/pages/glossary_g.html">
glossary</a> of the School of Design at Arizona State University
defines it as an "entire series of recognized notes" along with
numerous mathematic and geometric definitions, though oddly enough
without any color reference. The <a href=
"http://www.cs.rit.edu/%7encs/color/glossary.htm">glossary</a> at
the Rochester Institute of Technology defines it as "The entire
range of perceived color that may be obtained under specified
conditions", a delightfully vague academic definition. (I've
appended a <a href="#GlossaryList">list</a> of glossaries at the
bottom of this column; you may find them useful for other graphics
terms.)</p>

<p>So it appears the term began in the music world and then
purloined by the design world, but still means basically the same
thing: <i>the range of perceivable items</i>, whether notes or
colors. However, that's not the same as the range of everything we,
as observers, can visually perceive. It's the range of whatever
device (computer monitor, printer, ink system, film, camera CCD,
etc.) we're using can perceive. And they, lamentably, are all
different from each other and from our eyes.</p>

<p>There have been many color-definition systems set up, each with
its own gamut, in an attempt to standardize and codify the use of
color. Few in this industry are old enough to remember printing
prior to the development of the <a href=
"http://www.pantone.com/aboutus/aboutus.asp?idArticle=51">Pantone</a>
system of printing inks, but imagine trying to tell your printer
exactly what green you wanted to use: "Sort of an Irish mossy
green, with just a hint of lemon, really, and a touch of blue like
that cloudless sky I saw when I went to New Mexico and got drunk
and fell down last summer." This sort of ambiguity led to endless
rounds of 'ink drawdowns' (a quaint and now almost-unheard-of
practice of actually mixing a little can of ink to your nebulous
specifications, rolling it out onto high-gloss proof paper, drying
it, and sending the sheet over to your office for approval and
revision: "No, no, a little more yellow") and arguments over
exactly what color any particular color actually was. (Try
'matching' a color to an object before there were scanners!)
Fortunately, in the early 1960s the Pantone Matching System (thus
the phrase 'PMS color') was released to printers and designers, and
things pretty much settled down until the advent of the
Macintosh.</p>

<p>Oh, there was the constant struggle to 'match' a PMS color to
its rough equivalent in CMYK inks (the first of many gamut
disparities), but Pantone and other ink systems like <a href=
"http://www.toyoink.com/ibhp.htm">Toyo</a> (though to view a
classic example of the worst of Japanese design see their <a href=
"http://www.toyoink.co.jp/en/index.html">Japanese web site</a>,
where a flying cartoon lion first paints in their logo on-screen
and then goes to sleep and blows snot bubbles; <i>would I kid you
about a thing like that?</i>) soon issued their official 'cracks'
of their colors, and you became pretty much stuck with whatever
they showed.</p>

<p>But the gamut compatibility problem really got going when you
began to display color in RGB on color monitors, and the argument
heated up over what color you were really looking at versus what
color would appear when the file was either output to film (and
thus converted to CMYK) or, worse yet, output on some other device,
like an ink jet or laser writer printer.</p>

<p>Let's look at the differing gamuts we commonly work with, and
see why this <b>gamut war</b> is still on-going and may never be
resolved.</p>

<p>You're reading this on a computer monitor which displays
information in RGB (red, green, and blue, the colors originally
generated by the phosphors activated by the electron beam in a
television). This column was created using Adobe GoLive on a
Macintosh flat-screen LCD monitor. GoLive allows me to define the
color of objects on the screen in RGB (the 'native' gamut for
monitor-based material), CMYK (the gamut for process color printing
inks), HSB (hue, saturation, and brightness), and HSV (hue,
saturation, and value); the latter two gamuts are derived from
classic color theory and use color 'wheels' <font color="black">to
describe color:</font></p>

<div align="center">
<p><img src="misc/seymour/HSBwheel.png" alt="" height="170" width=
"224" border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/HSVwheel.png" alt=""
height="170" width="224" border="0"></p>
</div>

<p>Photoshop, like other graphic design software, also provides a
wide range of color pickers including, along with the Pantone and
Toyo colors, the ANPA, DIC, Focoltone, HKS, and Trumatch systems.
(It also has a 'Lab' color picker, which I confess to not
understanding at all, try as I might. If anyone out there does,
send your explanation along.)</p>

<p>No matter what gamut you pick, however, it limits you to
significantly different numbers of colors:</p>

<ul>
<li>Toyo inks come in 1050 colors</li>

<li>Pantone inks provide 1114 standard colors, and even their
'hexachrome' system (CMYK + hexachrome orange + hexachrome green),
while supposedly "meeting or exceeding the RGB gamut", has only
about 2000 numbered colors:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<div align="left">
<p><img src="misc/seymour/PMSbooks.png" alt="" height="56" width=
"106" border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/PMShex.png" alt="" height=
"90" width="83" border="0"></p>
</div>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>HSB and HSV each allow a gamut (<i>360x100x100</i>) of
3,600,000 colors</li>

<li>RGB gives a wider gamut (<i>256x256x256</i>) of 16,777,216
colors</li>

<li>CMYK provides the broadest gamut (<i>100x100x100x100</i>) of
100,000,000 colors (and don't be fooled by software; while the
sliders for CMYK in GoLive show 256 steps for no apparent reason,
your printer can only differentiate between 100 steps
per color, and you'll be lucky if they can hold a standard within
2% either side of a particular ink percentage)</li>
</ul>

<p>Yet browsers navigating the Internet are limited by the
convention of HTML to 216 'web-safe colors', from FFFFFF to 000000.
Is it any wonder that designing for multiple mediums (print &amp;
web) can be a pain? Let's say you have a logo that you want to
print in PMS 123, a nice golden yellow:</p>

<div align="center">
<table width="50" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"
height="50">
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#FFCC33">
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>Yet, what is that color <i>really</i>? Pantone says it's simply
ink number 123 on coated stock. Easy enough to specify, and easy
for the printer to mix and print. But let's say you want to print
it in a brochure along with color photographs, thus you need its
equivalent in process (CMYK) color to make it cheaper and easier to
print. The 'crack' for that color in Photoshop (I'm trusting them
here; I didn't check my Pantone book) is 0C 24Y 94M 0K (which I
will now translate into the unpatented SeymourCMYK system
nomenclature, 0.24.94.0, which we will use henceforth), yet that
color isn't available in web-safe colors for use on your web site,
so we have to nudge it to 4.21.87.0, which translates in hex to
FFCC33. While PMS 123 is defined as 255.196.36 in the RGB gamut in
Photoshop, when entered as such via the RGB picker in GoLive it
displays as the non-web-safe hex color FFC424. Resetting it to
FFCC33, per our Photoshop definition, it becomes 255.204.51 in the
RGB gamut. Worse yet, the CMYK sliders equate that to 0.51.204.0,
which no one will ever understand.</p>

<p>So, what color are you using? Depends. If
you take the exact same PMS color and attempt to reproduce it in
Photoshop, InDesign, and GoLive (hey, I've got friends at Adobe,
what can I say?), let alone the Apple applications, you'll come up
with completely different colors. Here are screen captures of what
several different applications generated as PMS 123, for
comparison; the distinction is subtle, but obvious:
</p>

<div align="center">
<p><img src="misc/seymour/123inGoLive.png" alt="" height="50"
width="50" border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/123inKeynote.png"
alt="" height="50" width="50" border="0"> <img src=

"0"> <img src="misc/seymour/123inPhotoshop.png" alt="" height="50"
width="50" border="0"></p>
</div>

<p>Let's attempt to look at using color, now that we've thoroughly
confused ourselves as how to define it, to describe objects or
feelings or states of being. Because that's what we really do in
design, isn't it? Some one says they want their logo to be a nice
apple red. Do they mean the red of an apple you buy in the grocery
store (and which variety, and is it ripe or not ripe?), or do they
mean a nice Apple red? Back in the day, the logo of Apple Computer
used to be PMS 185, which looked a lot like this (on my screen, at
least) when printed:</p>

<div align="center">
<table width="50" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"
height="50">
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#F60000">
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>Yet that color red is 0.255.255.10 in the GoLive CMYK picker,
while PMS 185 is defined as 0.91.76.0 in the Photoshop CMYK picker,
which looks like this color when you set the equivalent
(0.233.195.0) in GoLive:</p>

<div align="center">
<table width="50" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"
height="50">
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#FF163C">
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>Do we go with what looks right (and to whose eye, and on what
monitor, and when was the last time you calibrated it and to
what?), or do we go by the numbers? Depends. Are you just
displaying it on someone's monitor via the web, or are you trying
to match a printed color? If it's web-only, and especially if you
can test it across a suite of CPUs and monitors, so much the
better. If you're trying to match something printed, whether it's a
PMS color or a CMYK color, that pretty much hopeless, as we've
seen.</p>

<p>We'll go with what looks right, and hope it looks 'right' on
your monitor as well. (For those of you benighted people viewing
this on a CRT monitor running Windows, good luck.)</p>

<p>Choose an object or a feeling to mimic in color. Something
difficult to describe. Something subtle. That sultry blonde you saw
on the beach during your vacation in Brazil, say. (If you find
yourself tasked with creating a travel brochure, you can bet that's
what the client is seeing in <i>his</i> head...) Or the cool blue
tones of a fresh snowfall. (Remember our work with Alpine Gear?) Or
a delicious dark bar of chocolate. (Milk chocolate? Semi-sweet?
With nuts or without? Almonds or peanuts? See how hard this is?)
Even the "golden yellow" we were trying to imitate with PMS 123
isn't really gold, but trying to represent the color of the actual
metal, whether printed or on-screen, is nearly impossible:</p>

<div align="center">
<p><img src="misc/seymour/Gold.png" alt="" height="100" width="100"
border="0">
</p>
</div>

<p>Worse yet, try and combine these disparate things and see where
the string of adjectives leads you:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a sultry, tan Brazilian blonde, in a bikini the sea-green color
of shallow Bahamian waters, eating a thick bar of Swiss milk
chocolate while standing on gold-plated skis in the midst of an icy
Norwegian glacier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, you can see her <i>in your head</i>, but try deciding
which colors you should use to represent that image... (For those
whose gender identification requires it, please substitute 'blond'
for 'blonde' and 'his' for 'her'.)</p>

<p>But we're idiots, we designers, so we'll try. And we'll do them
all in the HSB gamut (just to be a nuisance), leaving the
conversions for someone else:</p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="margin-left: 100px">
<tr height="25">
<td bgcolor="white" width="150" height="25">her tan</td>
<td bgcolor="#C86113" width="100" height="25">
</td>
</tr>

<tr height="25">
<td bgcolor="white" width="150" height="25">her blonde hair</td>
<td bgcolor="#FFEA37" width="100" height="25">
</td>
</tr>

<tr height="25">
<td bgcolor="white" width="150" height="25">her bikini</td>
<td bgcolor="#C7FF13" width="100" height="25">
</td>
</tr>

<tr height="25">
<td bgcolor="white" width="150" height="25">the chocolate</td>
<td bgcolor="#9A3011" width="100" height="25">
</td>
</tr>

<tr height="25">
<td bgcolor="white" width="150" height="25">the skis</td>
<td bgcolor="#FFC809" width="100" height="25">
</td>
</tr>

<tr height="25">
<td bgcolor="white" width="150" height="25">the glacier</td>
<td bgcolor="#C3FFF4" width="100" height="25">
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Nice, but not quite the picture you formed in your head, is it?
But they are certainly evocative colors, and you could play around
endlessly with tweaks to the formula to find some that were closer
to that bikini-clad, chocolate-eating skier you (or the client)
were imagining.</p>

<p>Applying this palette to your client's <a href=
"misc/seymour/chocolate.html">brochure for chocolate</a> (or
bikinis or ski equipment or resort travel), you can now hope that
every design feature (headlines, tables, text blocks, leader lines,
color backgrounds) will somehow evoke the tantalizing picture that
inspired the choice of these colors.</p>

<p>But now let's try and pick colors to represent a real Brazilian
woman standing in real Brazilian water (and what intelligent
Brazilian woman would ever find herself on a Norwegian glacier,
even to eat chocolate?):</p>

<div align="center">
<p><a href="http://www.domai.com/main.html"><img src=
"misc/seymour/Brazil.png" alt="" height="200" width="200" border=
"0"></a>
</p>
</div>

<p> Much harder, isn't it? (And that's why
photography replaced artwork early on. Look back at ads from the
1950s, with their painted and airbrushed illustrations: flat colors
and simplified forms. Yet it's considered very retro to mimic that
today.) So which part of her, precisely, shall we pick to stand for
'tan'? Should wet hair or dry hair represent 'blonde'? Which of the
several colors of her suit cry out 'bikini'? What part of the surf
would say 'ocean'? What part of the sky might mean 'sunset'? Tricky
business, this color.
</p>

<p> Where does this all leave us, besides pissed off and frustrated
with the vagaries of color systems, software programmers, ink
manufacturers, and the limitations of technology in general? With
the notion, first of all, that no amount of technology or software
gimmickry can truly replace a good eye. If you have one, bless you
and use it well. If you don't, and not every designer does, you'll
have to decide where your strengths lie and work around them. For
instance, I can't open Photoshop and 'paint' an image any more than
I ever could with a box of crayons. Actually, I do better with the
crayons. But if you think we've come a long way since we were kids,
remember that HTML can handle barely twice as many colors as
Crayola:</p>

<div align="center">
<p><img src="misc/seymour/Crayons.png" alt="" height="82" width=
"137" border="0">
</p>
</div>

<p> The parti-colored images and Flash animations flooding the web
these days will never come out of my box of tricks. But I can, if I
work at it, come up with a color way for a logo, a brand, or a
product that can be utilized effectively across print and video and
the web. By analyzing the needs of the piece, so can you. But
turning those colors into artful designs that entice the viewer and
sell the product (and thus please the client), that's what will
separate you from a guy or gal who can just turn on the computer
and double-click the Photoshop icon. Solving the what-color-is-this
problem? Perhaps not fixable. My suggestion is to determine where
the majority of the work will be seen, whether web or print, and
choose your gamut accordingly. CMYK, of course, if you're going
mostly to print, and use the official Pantone (or other patented
color system) 'crack' to represent its flat colors in CMYK. You can
reproduce the CMYK fairly easily in any web-content generator. RGB
if you're going web, and do the best you can to represent that in
CMYK for any print that results. Remember, no matter how good the
software, no ink-on-paper version will ever have the luminosity or
depth of colors displayed on a good computer screen, even
black.</p>

<p>I hope this has inspired you to wrestle with the complexities of
color. It's worth the battle, unless you like to see the world this
way:</p>

<div align="center">
<p><img src="misc/seymour/BrazilBW.png" alt="" height="200" width=

<p>As ever, let me know what design issues you'd like explored.</p>

<p>[1] Not to be confused with "running the gantlet", let alone the
often-misused "running the gauntlet", like the <a href=

<em>
<p> I started doing graphic design in junior high school, when it was still
the Dark Ages of technology. Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were both eleven
years old, and the state of the art was typing copy on Gestetner masters.
I've worked on every new technology since, but I still own an X-acto knife
and know how to use it.

<p> I've been a freelancer, and worked in advertising agencies, printing
companies, publishing houses, and marketing organizations in major
corporations. I also did a dozen years [1985-1997] at Apple Computer; my
first Macintosh was a Lisa with an astounding 1MB of memory, and my current
one is a Cube with a flat screen.

<p> I've had a website up since 1997, and created my latest one in 2004. I'm
still, painfully, learning how web design is different from, but not
necessarily better than, print.

Af far as I can overview the connections between all this:
The Software patents are most successfully lobbied with the European
commission and the Comission is the instance that waved them through.
The EU Parliament was opposed and even in the Comission a recent poll
would not have been in favour of the latest SP draft. The constitution
would strengthen the parliament in comparison to the comission.

Microsoft is cooperating with China's government to censor MSN's Spaces

words as <EM>democracy</EM>, <EM>human rights</EM>, and <EM>Taiwan independence</EM>.  5 million

You know. Those Little Annoying Things about Windows that make you think that
this time, maybe you just will switch OSes. Or rather, in the rhetoric of the
*nix cadre, "start using a real OS". You didn't think those things about
Windows were inherent, did you? Oh, no, it's clearly a conspiracy where the
*nix cadre sneak onto the machines of the Windows faithful to infect our
machines with Linux-pixies.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Like the one that made my Windows box refuse to connect to the hotel's wireless
connection. There's my beloved, editor of Linux Gazette and a longtime *nix
whiz, happily toodling around the 'net, grabbing his e-mail, doing who knows
what else while I'm poking and prodding at panel after panel of interfaces for
the wireless card and the web browser and the net connection wizard. I've done
everything I can do based on the little standup info card the hotel has
helpfully left on the desk. Calling tech support will be next. I've already
asked Mr. *Nix Whiz to see what he can do, and his first few passes haven't
fixed much.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Tech support wants me to go down the hallway, disable my wireless card and then
re-enable it, so that it'll connect to the proper channel. It seems that either
Windows or my network card or both are too stupid to configure themselves
properly through any less drastic measure.

My in-house Linux wizard did something that made all the obstacles vanish,

It helps to have read Richmal Crompton's "Just William" British boys'
novels as a sprog, and to have read <em>  Paradise Lost  </em> as a teenager.  I
thought <em>  Good Omens  </em> was a hoot even though I never saw the dreadful

Hmmm. This was actually June's cover story in Scientific American.
There's quite a bit more to it than "zombie dogs". They were trying to
replicate some of the effects of extreme de-oxygenation that allow
multi-year "hibernation" or dormancy (think sea monkey (brine shrimp)
embryos) and some "ice-water" drowning victims to be recuscitated an
hour or more after clinical death.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Interesting stuff, and closely related to the sorts of
hibernation/anti-g stuff that Joe Haldeman used in the Forever War.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Additionally, of interest in the SA article, there were experiments with
inflicting injuries on hibernating and non-hibernating arctic ground
squirrels. Upon autopsy three days later (after euthanizing), it was
found that the level of cellular damage other than the immediate injury
was minimial in the hibernating animal, by contrast with a wide area of
damage caused by inflammation in the non-hibernating animal.

A quick trip back to the dictionary later: fire is ogien'. I bought a
Russian phrase book a while back (there's a <EM>lot</EM> of Central and Eastern
Europeans moving to Ireland these days), and the difference between
Russian and Polish seems about the same as that between Irish and Welsh:
mostly the same words, but with different spellings and pronunciation

The best example I saw is 'stol'. In Polish, that has an o acute and an
l slash. When you're just using the nominative, it's pronounced 'stoo',
but in the genetive the o acute becomes an o, and the l slash becomes an
l before adding the genetive ending ('em' in this case).

Heh. Babelfish is... odd, and amusing. Yeah, you're pretty close -
"khvostik" would be a little tail. I don't know what the Russian term is
for the diacrit above, say, the Russian "i-short" letter is, but I could
definitely see 'ogonyok' as being a candidate. When I was taught Proper
Cursive back in first grade (yeah, yeah, I had a trilobite for a pet and
Chicxulub had just happened the week before), we were taught to actually
form that mark as a sort of a short vertical tilde.

My Russian teacher used to ding people for not using the cup, saying

That's not how I was taught to write it. I've seen it that way, yeah,
but your teacher's preference isn't necessarily the One True way - just
a preference. A quick review of the fonts on my system shows a fairly
random mix: a couple of the 10646 fonts have it as a breve, but many
others - e.g., "-ttf-tl help
cyrillic-medium-r-normal-regular-0-0-0-0-p-0-iso8859-1", use an accent
mark (the "forward slash" type) over it, while yet others use a short
horizontal bar. (You really don't want to know what Kirillica and Lavra
do to the poor thing. Old Slavonic - on a <EM>computer</EM>

Ah, OK. My argument was with your calling it a breve - I'd always
thought of it as more of an accent-shaped diacrit. Yeah, there's a big
difference in using it vs. not; almost exactly like using an 'i' instead
of a 'j'.

That's one of the reasons I like Vim. ":dig" shows you the list of
available digraphs (I'm using UTF8, so I've got the whole kit); Russian
letters are almost all encoded as '&lt;sensible_transliteration&gt;=', so that
the Cyrillic 'n', for example, is 'n='. Oh yeah - you have to hit
'Ctrl-K' to insert a digraph.

<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
"Pretty soon, having a mail server available for redelivery of mail to

unfenced swimming pool in a neighbourhood full of children."
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I either missed that, or let it pass unscathed as it traversed my inbox.
Most likely I'm so absorbed in making sure I learn the lesson that Rick
so effectively teaches that I neglected to pay attention to the humorous
(but in a deadly serious sense) possibilities in that line.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
This problem first came to my attention when we were living at the
corner of Mary and Remington in Sunnyvale, some years back. The building
maintenance people had been tasked with blocking off every opening
larger than 4" wide from "outside" to the pool area in each of the
buildings. The people whose doors opened into the pool area were to look
out for themselves, one presumes.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I watched them doing this work, and commented on their contravention of
the positive application of Darwin and Wallace's discoveries to the
improvement of the human species. When they prevent children that are
inquisitive enough to crawl through spaces smaller than their skull in
order to jump in some water and drown, they remove opportunities for
genetic improvement in the species.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Floyd looked at me and remarked, "You don't have kids, do you?"
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
"Nope. But that doesn't matter. All kids do stupid things. You did, I
did. But we survived, which is the very first qualifier for reproductive
excellence. If a being doesn't survive until reproductive age, then
something which might have been passed on to future generations has been
nipped in the bud."
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Now I'm not suggesting that people actually send their children out to
play in traffic. Well, some people probably should, but that's another
topic, I guess.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Anyway, I consider an unfenced swimming pool in a neighborhood full of
children as a fun thing for children who manage to enjoy themselves
without drowning, and a complete <EM>public good</EM> for those children who do
manage to drown themselves.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Besides, more children, in an urban environment, is counter-productive.
In an agrarian society, children are the ultimate unpaid labor -- the
more kids you have, the more land/animals you can handle. In an urban
setting, children are only assets if you're welfare farming.

Doesn't matter either way. Expediency has no relation to morality. I'm
not saying you're wrong. People often give away safety in favor of
other things. For instace: motor vehicles. 42,065 people[1] died in
1996 in car accidents. Fourty two thousand people who would probably
still be here today, fourty two thousand souls who would still be
laughing at books that say "Complete works. Volume I" on them, fourty
two thousands people going to work, buying food, running fast and
jumping high. All that, gone.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Now, what should we, who supposedly care about innocents dying, do
about this? There's a couple things that could be done, none of which
will ever be seriously proposed or acted upon because it's not
"practical" for Americans.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
One would be just to stop driving and just go to public transit,
biking and walking. Americans wouldn't do this. We love our cars
literally more than life itself.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Or harsher penalties for reckless driving. If you're at fault, and you
killed somebody, while drunk or not, would the death penalty be too
far out of line? No, seriously?
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
But nobody thinks about it, and nobody talks about it, because those
deaths are nessesary to live life that way we want to. It sounds harsh
to say it that way, but that's the way it is.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Now, is it really wrong? You could make the counter-argument, and
claim that emergency services saved at least that number of people in
that year.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I'm not proposing that any of those things actually be done. I'm just
saying, it's worth considering the questions, "Is this worth it?". And
nobody asks, or cares, because in America (and most other places as
well), we have plenty of means, but few ends. Drive to work, drive
back, don't ask why.

I found myself in agreement with the general sentiment of your mail
until I hit the above paragraph, the word "crawl" in
particular--children still at crawling age are not generally familiar
with the fact that a swimming pool is not a solid surface, hence the
need for fences. You could, of course, argue that these children have no
business near a swimming pool in the first place (and I could possibly
resist the urge to be trite and say "Exactly! Put a fence around it"),
but you'd be surprised how far a toddler can crawl in the blink of an eye.

I <EM>am</EM> so aware, but there's only so much that can be done in the name
of protecting children from themselves, and they were closing up 8" wide
openings at a height of 4' off the ground. But if I lived in a complex
with [un|under]protected swimming pools, then I'd be responsible for a
toddler gate at MY door. So, once the little rascal got out of the
burlap sack, through the triple-bolted bedroom door, and into the front
room, well then, by golly, if she could pick the Ilco brass lock, then
she's fit to drown herself, walking or crawling.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
You see, at this particular complex, families with babies <EM>were</EM>
permitted to rent units that opened onto the pool area directly. This
fencing kept non-resident and other-resident children from drowning
inappropriately.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Hmmm. Since it comes down to the parent wanting to protect the children,
then it's up to the parent. Good parenting skills will propogate, too,
neh? Bad parenting skills could (should???) be "punished" by both
removing the child from the shallow end of the gene pool, and training
the parents to be more careful in the future.

They would occasionally, just for experimentation's sake, pour a 10-lb.
bag of cement into the oil fill and a gallon of molasses into the gas
tank. The result would, of course, be the car's fault - because they

<blockQuote>
They would rip off the carburetor "because it was making that annoying
noise". They would smash the low-oil and alternator lights "because
the red glow was distracting". They would hacksaw the airconditioning
pump out of the engine compartment (letting out all the refrigerant as
well as cutting the fuel line and the electrical harness in the process)
"because I'd read that Freon was harmful to children." The result would
be towed to the garage and blamed on the mechanic because he had
replaced a fuse six months before.

<blockQuote>
They would let the village idiot - as long as he spouted
automotive-sounding gibberish - do anything he wanted to the car,
including using it as a toilet. When the mechanic hinted that this was
not the wisest thing to do, they would get huffy and tell him it was
"only his opinion".

That other bit about fixed attributions making a work

to that same effect make the work non-free through it "failing the

However, of course, the OpenSolaris codebase apparently (as everyone
suspected) includes quite a lot of binary-only, proprietary "secret sauce"
components.[2]  How useful the CDDL (and other open source <TT>/</TT> free-software)
portions would be without them is an open question.  My own expectation

I don't mean to derogate the benefits to some of Sun's move -- just to

I tend to take an optimistic view of these things that look like naivete
from a certain perspective - any move in the direction of Open Source by
the historically-proprietary software companies is good for us. One of
the many underlying reasons for that is what I like to call "time in
grade": the longer these people spend using Open Source methods - to
whatever degree - the more these get embedded in their culture and the
environment around them. After a while, they're impossible to eradicate.
As for "the abyss looking back at you", I rely on the GPL and its ilk to
keep the resulting influence on the world of Open Source to a tolerable
minimum.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
(Yes, the sum total of all the influences and issues here is far more
complex than this. However, abstracting this bit and staring at it for a
while contains its own lessons, and they're interesting ones.)

Heh. I think there will be a lot of public contributions to the code, if
only to clean it up. I never really understood why so much research goes
into code comprehension (well, aside from the fact that C lecturers write
some of the worst C around): open source projects <EM>need</EM> to have code that's
as clear as possible, otherwise noone can contribute. Heck, even Wine,
which (of necessity) has some of the most cryptic code I've ever seen
(self-modifying blobs of x86 binary code, C emulations of C++ exceptions
and classes, etc), is a model of clarity, as far as it can be.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Not so Open Solaris. Their tar implementation is one 182k .c file; their
nroff implementation uses the original Unix naming convention for files
(n1.c etc). I'm sure they'll get plenty of clean-up patches from people
cringing on Sun's behalf

I didn't have much time to really look into this yesterday (but I did
get some really good coding done, and had the very satisfying experience
of solving a thorny problem that's been bugging me for a couple of
years!); today is a new day, and I'm wasting^Wspending my morning
checking out the buzz on this. Fascinating - it looks and smells real.
In fact, reading Tim Bray's blog and the link tree that branches out
from it - thanks, Raj! - I'm slowly growing convinced that Sun has
finally clued in, bought the stock, drank the Koolaid. All I can say, in
stunned admiration, is "Bravo" - I had not expected it, and was actually
rather cynical about it, having built my expectations based on what I
saw from my little corner of the Sun culture. It seems I was wrong.

The interesting bit about this is that the Solaris kernel has been a
strictly "hands-off" affair since time immemorial; you could tweak some
user-space settings to influence its operation in some mild ways, but
that was about all (and learning to do even that required a three-day
class and using ADB [shudder].) As well, some of the operational
algorithms - e.g., the exact process of deciding how to accept/reject
TCP connections - were generally hinted at but the details were
<em> intentionally  </em> shrouded in mystery (security through obscurity, even
though Sun showed itself to be totally aware, in other places, that this
is not a useful approach.)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
There's also the fact - and I'm <em>  not  </em> snarking at Sun in the least, but
applauding their moving with the times - that Solaris installations are
growing far fewer percentage-wise; this latest change may just be a
simple recognition of fact and adaptation to it. I've spoken to many
people in the large corporate culture, in many places and many different
companies, and have heard the story/complaint/simple fact repeated many
times: "so this new guy comes into IT, and before anybody knows it, he's
got 30 Linux boxes up in one day..." Cost of software: zero. Cost of
machines: hauled out of a closet where it was stored due to being old
and unusable. That's a <EM>hard</EM> combination for a commercial machine+OS to
beat, stony hard - and companies that _aren't_ having to spend a million
bucks a year on buying new are starting to notice. Many of them -
including banks, the traditional stronghold of conservatism - are
quietly dropping their "no non-commercial OSes" policy.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Sun is an <em>  excellent  </em> hardware company; the cost of their gadgets is
quite high as compared to the commodity PC, but the quality and the
reliability that you get from the stuff can be absolutely stunning to
someone who's never experienced them. I've never had Sun stuff "fight"
me the way, e.g., a PC SCSI card has; the documentations was always
available, and the relevant setup was as obvious as it could be made and
robust. Solaris, seen in that light, has always been a house divided
against itself - and Sun appears to have finally resolved the ambiguity.

Bravo; bravo indeed. The Open Source world has grown - and it's quite

Well, though Sun want to hype up the release by saying "Solaris is open
source now", their own roadmap says otherwise.

But regardless of the usefulness of the software, at least the code has
already yielded some amusing comments

Another tried his hand at predicting the future of system speeds. "As of

Religion was a common theme in the code. "Oops, did not find this

And I got a $1 CD from a thrift shop this weekend that looked like punk
from the cover but was metal, ugh.  A black-and-white cartoon of a chick
with boxing gloves punching out a dude.  But I can't complain; I got nine
CDs for $9, so the two that I liked cost $4.50 each.  One is Global
Communication's ambient album, which I already have but I got a second
copy for when the first one breaks.  I had this album originally when it
came out in 1994, but all my CDs were stolen in 1998.  Then I forgot about
it until a roommate moved in who was an electronic DJ, and I started
remembering all the ambient stuff I used to like.  But GC vanished without
a trace after putting out one album, which wasn't popular but to me is the
best ambient album ever.  So I looked for two years for a copy, then
finally found one last year at a used record store.  But I really distrust
CDs, you never know when they'll self-destruct for no visible reason.
I've gone back to vinyl for everything that's available on it, because if
it skips you can <EM>see</EM> what the problem is, and if it has no visible
scratches it'll play on any record player, period.  Contrary to my CD
player which sometimes plays certain disks and sometimes won't, and won't
play disks my computer plays perfectly, and won't play CD-R's at all.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The other CD I got was Buck O'Nine.  I remembered the name but couldn't
remember what they sounded like.  But it was from Taang Records (a little
oi label in LA) so I figured it must be at least passable.  Turned out to
be a third-wave ska group.  Mediocre but OK.

"What started out as an election contest between Democrat Christine
Gregoire and Republican Dino Rossi may be turning into a fight between
Democratic felons and Republican felons.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
In the ongoing dispute over Gregoire's 129-vote victory over Rossi in
the governor's race, the state Democratic Party said yesterday it has
sent the GOP a list of 428 felons who apparently cast illegal votes in
the election.
</STRONG></P>

Eventually, state Democratic Party Chairman Paul Berendt said, his side

On the other hand, the vast majority of people are seething mad the
parties got the courts to overturn the blanket primary system (where
people could vote for any candidate regardless of party).  The parties
(R, D, and Libertarian) claim they have the right to choose candidates
without interference from non-members.  The people say they have the
right to ignore whatever the parties want, and view it as a power grab
by the parties to gain influence.  Curiously, the parties can't prevent
self-proclaimed Rs and Ds from getting on the ballot even if the party
disapproves, haha.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have to say, Gregoire was fully ready to concede if she lost.  Rossi
(and moreso the GOP chairman) are acting like elections are only
legitimate if they win.  One side takes pains to enfranchise all
qualified voters; the other side worries about felons voting.  (Hint:
the side that's more concerned about felons than enfranchisement is the
same party Jeb Bush belongs to.)  And they wonder why we question their
commitment to democracy....

I think both parties have about the same level of disrespect for
democracy/rule of law. I hate the concept of a recount. We're going to
count the votes over, using the exact method we used the first time, and
the results are somehow going to be more accurate. It would probably
work better if we said "no recounts, coin flip in case of ties".
Seriously. If you have a tie, what's a fair way to break it? Flipping a
coin is as good as any other way I can think of.

Nobody has dared touch the issue of why are felons prevented from voting
anyway?  Are people afraid they'll vote for candidates who'll overturn
the laws they were convicted on?  Puh-lease, there aren't enough felons
to make a difference in that.  I suppose a more likely scenario is a
governor courting the "felon vote" and then pardoning them all, but even
that's ridiculous.  One "Politician for the Cons" headline and they'd be
creamed at the polls.  As for arbitrarily restricting felons' rights to
make life uncomfortable for them, there are rights and there's the
fundamental characteristic of democracy.  Which part of
d-e-m-o-c-r-a-c-y don't they understand?  Have they not heard of

Well, everybody pays taxes, through inflation and the higher prices they
cause. I'm 17, working (part-time), paying taxes, and I can't vote. Is
that so wrong? I don't really think so. The nation as a whole is
probably better off without the under-18 crowd voting. But it's hard to
talk like that. Would 16 be a better voting age? 21? We've essentially
said "Everybody has the right to vote, except for..." and then proceed
to exclude those who we feel would abuse the privledge. And trouble is,
we're right. Think if literally everyone could vote. Can you imagine a
6-year-old kid trying to understand the issues involved? So we take
blocs of the population and tell them they can't vote 'cause they're not
smart enough. I'm not sure if that's okay or not, but I think the
alternative is worse.

This makes a lot more sense when you come to realize that most Roman
political structures were designed so that you couldn't get ahead by
stabbing your colleague. Given some of their early (pre-Republican)
history, this is not in the least surprising.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The weakness of this system was, of course, demonstrated when you had
two consuls who hated each other (Gaius Julius Caesar, everybody's
favorite fair-haired boy-hero, was paired up with such a critter during
one of his terms, but - as usual - managed to work his way around the
obstruction); nothing would get done due to constant deadlocks.
However, most Romans - at least those who got to that exalted position -
cared enough about their prestige (<TT>/dignitas/</TT> and <TT>/auctoritas/</TT> both)
that they would try to at least work out some sort of compromise for the
good of Rome.

Usenet thread in question (cross-posted between rec.sport.cricket and
comp.lang.python) features some amiable railery about regional accents
and cultural perception thereof, e.g., traditional jokes about
unsophisticated Kerrymen in Eire, the West Country and Yorkshire in the
UK, "Ockers" in Australia.  (The latter term is not regional but denotes
a rough-hewn, rustic working man, and is taken from the name of a
character played by Aussie comedian Ron Frazer on the satire programme
"The Mavis Bramston Show", 1965-68.  It's a variant form of "Oscar".)

I'd forgotten about this one, having moved back to the USA so many years
ago, and adopted Yank pronunciation in most matters:  In American usage,
silent-h "herb" denotes a plant leaf used for food or medicine,
distinguishing it form hard-h "Herb" as a given name.  In Commonwealth
English, the h is always pronounced.

Taken either from Greek "basilikon" = royal or Latin "basilisk".  Either
way, the American hard-a departs further from the historic pattern.
Interesting to note that, again, Yanks use different pronuncation for
the given name "Basil", to distinguish it from the herb.

I heard it from a Greek Orthodox priest.  The word basileus (now
pronounced "vossil-EFS") is used all over in the hymns and New

how they anglicize it: Basile?), and one of the three liturgies is named
after St Basil the Great.

Against this background he said basil was
so-named because it was considered the "king" of herbs.  So I guess
basil has a long and honorable history in Greek.  As for basiliscus, it
seems to come from basileus too.  "dict basilisk" says:

I'm no authority on regional usage, since travel has made me hopelessly
heterodox.  (Mrs. Alexander, from the Fourth Form, Peak School,
Victoria, Hong Kong Royal Crown Colony, would be dismayed to hear me
no longer say "aeroplane", and almost never pronounce "schedule"
or "zebra" correctly, any more.)  But my recollection is that the noun
meaning a type of self-service meal is pronounced very close to the
original French, in all English-speaking countries.

Incidentally, when I was growing up in the 1960s and 1970s, we lived
in several US states.  Though it may have just been one of those bizarre
results of chance, it wasn't until the late 1970s that I came across
"buffet" to refer to a self-service meal.  Prior to that, the only word
I'd ever encountered for that was "smorgasbord."  (central California,
Florida, Tennessee)  Since 1980 or so, I've seen the word "smorgasbord"
at a restaurant only once, as far as I can remember.

I've never heard "smorgasbord" used for an actual meal, only buffet.  Bay
Area 1966-72, Seattle 72-onward.  Half the Seattle natives are Norwegian
to some degree (as I am), so you'd think they'd have lots of smorgasbords.
But no.  "Smorgasbord" seems to be more an abstract term, meaning "lots
of different food together".  Buffets require a dedicated serving table,
but smorgasbords don't.  A large dining table with people around it and a
wide variety of food in the middle is also a smorgasbord.  But smorgasbord
also connotes "sandwich fixin's" -- little slices of bread, cold cuts,
cheese, sliced vegetables.  A typical family-style dinner (meat, potatoes,
salad, cooked vegetables) is not a smorgasbord.  A Thanksgiving dinner,
maybe.

"dict smorgasbord" has an amusingly precise definition (WordNet):  "an

Dear Word Detective: English is not my mother tongue, and sometimes I
find words in a dictionary which my American colleagues have never heard
before, so I simply stop using them. One of such words is "smorgasbord."
Could you please tell me something about its meaning and origin (if it
exists in English at all)? -- Ivana.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
"Smorgasbord" does indeed exist in English, and I'm surprised that your
co-workers don't know it. A "smorgasbord" is an offering of food,
ranging from simple hors d'oeuvres to a full dinner, presented as a
serve-yourself spread on a sideboard or table separate from where diners
are seated. Granted, "smorgasbord" started out as a Swedish word, but it
has been used frequently in English since the late 19th century, long
enough to qualify as an English word as well.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The roots of "smorgasbord" speak to its origins as an assortment of
simple appetizers set out for dinner guests. "Smorgas" in Swedish means
"slice of bread and butter" (the "smor" is related to the English
"smear"), and "bord" simply means "board," or in this case "table."

'gas' means goose.  "butter goose table".  I always took that literally
and assumed Scandinavians ate lots of goose.  But Wikipedia claims it's
figurative:
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smorgasbord"

Thus, "butter butter table"!  (I suppose butter can have "geese" the same
way dragons can have "crowns".)

Today, however, the term is usually taken to mean a full and often
elaborate assortment of dishes, and any host who led his guests to
expect a "smorgasbord" and presented them with naught but bread and
butter might well end up on the evening news. Since the late 1940s,
"smorgasbord" has also been used in a metaphorical sense to mean "a wide
variety or range," as in "The defendant faces a smorgasbord of charges
ranging from mopery to vote tampering."

If
your friends are unfamiliar with the word, it's probably because they
know the "serve yourself" dining arrangement as a "buffet," a meal, like
a "smorgasbord," served on a sideboard or separate table. "Buffet" is an
imported French word of unknown origin for a side table, common in
English since the early 18th century. "Buffet" dining in the U.S. today,
aside from dinner parties and the wretched "breakfast buffet" offered in
many motels, is usually found in all-you-can-eat emporiums where
customers can (and, from the looks of some of them, do) graze until the
cows come home.

Isaac Asimov (an accomplished biochemist before he became Master
Explainer to the world) once lavished one of his very engaging essays,
entitled "The Mispronounced Metal", in _The Magazine of Fantasy and
Science Fiction_ (Oct. 1973, reprinted in <em>  Of Matters Great and Small ,</em> 
1975) on this question:  He pointed out that Humphry Davy, discoverer of
the element, at first used "alumium" for the element in 1808, but soon
thereafter changed that to "aluminum" (current American usage), to match
the Latin root.  As he discovered and named other elements, though,
those tended to get "ium" suffixes:  potassium, sodium, magnesium,
calcium, strontium.  So, he agreed in 1812 to change element 13 to
"aluminium" in the name of uniformity.  Americans at first used this
form, but then went back to "aluminum" in the late 1800s.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Asimov provided a scholarly but very entertaining explanation (which I
can no longer recall) of why the chemistry and physics of the element --
even if not spelling uniformity with other Davy-discovered elements --
strongly favours "aluminum", not "aluminium".  I can't find the essay
online (no surprise), but did find this citation of its opening
paragraph:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
What do you call that nice, shiny white metal they use to make
sidings and airplanes out of? Aluminum, right? Aluminum, pronounced
'uh-LOO-mih-num', right? Anybody knows that! But do you know how the
British spell it? 'Aluminium', pronounced 'Al-yoo-MIH-nee-um'. Ever
hear anything so ridiculous? The French and Germans spell it
'aluminium', too, but they're foreigners who don't speak
Earth-standard.  You'd think the British, however, using our
language, would be more careful.

Potassium Aluminum Sulfate was known by the Romans as "Alumen", a
word which seems to be related to the Greek for "bitter".
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
In 1746 Johann Heinrich Pott obtained a "simple earth" (compounds which
did not dissolve in water, melt in fire, or burn in air) from alumen.
Following the practice of the day, he called it "alumina".

<blockQuote>
By 1790 Lavoisier had established the present system of chemical
nomencalture, which was becoming internationally accepted.  In
that system, metals had names ending in -um.  Hence platinum,
molybdenum, and tantalum.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
When Humphrey Davey believed he had isolated a metal from alumina, he
called it "aluminum".  However, due to the chance vagaries of
language, many metals were prepared from compounds ending in "i", and
became therefore ----ium.  The momentum of the times carried aluminum
with it.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Until 1880 no element had an English name with more than four
syllables, except aluminum in Britain.  Even now, those that do are
not common.

Rome canonised him in 1622, even though the man spent a huge amount of
the Society of Jesus's wealth trying to convert the Japanese, with only
about 1% success for their pains.  Xavier's biggest problem, fatal to
his ambitions, was that he hadn't a clue about Japanese internal
politics, wasn't aware that the emperor he pinned all his hopes on was a
figurehead, and wasn't aware that he himself was a pawn in Japan's
ongoing civil wars.

heard even a dozen people use "nukular" in a serious fashion.  As to
"ath-uh-leet" - although I don't think it gets used the same way as
"nukular", to me it implies at least a lack of linguistic
sophistication. IMO, it's a regional variant, generally in the South:

That one, along with "an't", <em>  is  </em> listed in "gcide" and others - and
denoted as "[Colloq. &amp; illiterate speech]".

FWIW, I say 'nuke lee ar', but that's still two syllables

There's a town near Seattle called Puyallup.  Everybody pronounces it
pyoo-AL-up (short a) even though some people claim it's "supposed" to be
poo-YAWL-up.  But I had a college friend (from Texas) who used to say as
a joke: "pull-y'all-UP".

Heh. I tried the Tagalog and Polish samples, because I work with native
speakers of both, and none of the samples sounded anything like the
people I work with. In fairness, though, the samples seem to be of
people who have been speaking English for a fairly long time - the
Polish samples had 'th' sounds (the people I know generally go with 'd'
for the 'th' in 'brother' and 't' or 'f' for the 'th' in 'things' (apart
from one girl, who manages to say 'tf' there)) and the Tagalog samples
have 'f' and 'v' sounds (most of the guys I know can't manage either,
except when they're saying 'for fuck's sake', in which case they say it
with a fairly thick Irish accent

From <em>  Realtime Interrupt  </em> by James Hogan, chapter 5.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
[About a virtual reality experiment gone horribly wrong, but in this
scene the protagonist Corrigan is a bartender in Pittsburgh talking to
one of the waitresses Sherri about a customer Delila.  Some extraneous
details removed.]
</STRONG></P>

<TABLE WIDTH="95%" BORDER="1" BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC"><TR><TD>
<p align="center">...............</p>
<P><STRONG>
"I don't know how you stand that woman the way you do," Sherri said.
"She's so gross with her 'I've got this' and 'I've got that' all the
time.  But you can just stand there and say 'that's nice' like you do.
You'll have to teach me how to do it.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Corrigan smiled wryly.  "Oh, that's an old Irish story," he said.
"You'd have no problem if you knew it."
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
"Well, tell me, then," Sherri invited....
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
"It's like this," he said.  "Two woman are sharing a hospital room in
Dublin, you see.  One is from Foxrock.  That's south of the city, where
all the money is -- she'd be one of your Delilas.  The other's the
complete opposite: bottom end of the social spectrum--what we'd call a
roight auld slag."
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
"You mean like parts of the South Bronx?"
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
"Maybe.  Anyway, Delila wants to make sure there's no mkstake about who
she is, see.  So she says to the other..."  Corrigan mimicked a prim
tone:  "'Ah, I hope you don't imagine I am accustomed to sharing like
this.   Usually, I go to the private wing.'"
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
He changed to a shrill, coarser accent.  "'Oh, yiss?' says the other,
who we'll say was Mary.  'Dat's noice.'
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
"'I'll have you know,' says Delila, 'that my husband is an extrememly
successful man and takes very good care of me.  The last time I was a
patient, he took me on a Carribean cruise to recuperate.'
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
"'Dat's noice.'
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
"'And on the occasion before that, he bought me a diamond pendant to
compensate me for the discomfort.'
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
"'Dat's noice.'
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
"'Out of curiosity, does <EM>your</EM> husband show such consideration when
you are confined?'
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
"'Oh, yiss, o' course 'e does,' says Mary.  'When we 'ad our last one,
'e sent me fer elocution and etiquette lessons.'
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
"'*What!?*  *Elocution?*  How would somebody like <EM>you</EM> even know what
that word means?'
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
"&quot;E did, too.  See, at one time, whenever oi 'eard people tellin' me a
load o'buillshit, oi used to tell 'em ter fuck orf.  Now oi just smiles
at 'em all proper, like, and oi say, "Dat's noice."'"

I remember a friend telling me he met a really nice (small &amp; frail looking)
thai lady in Thailand.

However the minute she opened her mouth it became clear she'd married a
englishman and learned her english from him.
