Hi there Jim....

Actually, this is Heather;  you sent this message to our consulting
services.  However, since you addressed it to Jim specifically, I'll take
a first shot on behalf of The Answer Guy, since he's been really busy
this week.

My name is Ian van Battum and I am a desperate man.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have recently wanted to further my computer studies and have found
Linux to be a great OS to learn and master. Being a complete newbie
to Linux, I am not a stranger to OS's and what have you.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have how ever a small problem. I have a laptop on which I would like
to load Linux. Unfortunately it only has a floppy drive. So I need to go
through the slog of installing off a 'million' and one floppies. This
is not a hassle though but I am stuck when it comes the old procedure
of doing this task.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
Actually, you don't need to go through as many floppies as all that.
TurboLinux (from Pacific HiTech), <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">S.u.S.E.</A> all offer single
floppy starter disk images that you can download from the internet, put
in your machine to boot it, and then they'll use FTP across the internet
to get the rest.  Of course this works best if you have a fairly solid
link to the net, and you have a buddy to help you cut the initial disks.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Somewhat more durable in their efforts are a 6-diskette <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> base
packages install (after which it will be able to use even a fairly
fragile connection, and retry as necessary).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course Linux hasn't got the only spot in this limelight.   
<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A>
will also install via FTP given its single boot floppy, but you do need a
solid enough link to get the 'bin' distribution...  although they do
have their 'distributions' (base file sets;  yeah, I know, it kind of
confused me the first time I saw it, too) split into parts so they can
be copied onto floppies and recombined, I've never actually done an
install that way.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If it weren't a laptop then it would be pretty easy to swap your hard
drive into another system, apply the new OS, and then return it to your
system.  Of course if it weren't a laptop, it would be worth buying a
super-cheap 2X CD-ROM... maybe even used, or as a giveaway from a friend
joining the multimedia age.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As for adding peripherals, you may not be as out of luck as you think.
Most laptops have a parallel port, and ZIP support across parallel ports
has been in Linux for a while now.  So, you could potentially get a lot
more files onto a ZIP.  There are a few parallel based CD-ROMs such as
the Backpack, but I'm not sure how well Linux supports them.  And, there's
usually your CardBus or PCMCIA slots... which I call "piecemeal"... as in
that's how they let you upgrade your laptop, by pieces.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
My own <a href="http://www.ricoh-usa.com/prodshw/minipc/">Ricoh Magio E
laptop</a> installed TurboLinux great from an Addonics PCMCIA based CD-ROM 
(ATAPI/IDE drivers were used) with only the help of also using its 
'additional hardware' disk, and making sure that the CD's
card/cord was plugged into the lower bay in the type III cardbus slot.
The only trick there is, the install floppy has to be able to spot your
CardBus or pc-card controller, and you have to use a device whose card
can be found in the card manager's database.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you have a 3'5" sized drive, you might actually be able to do this the
same way a non-laptop user would, anyway.  (I had an ordinary 3.5" drive
on my Sager-Midern Pentium-60 laptop, in a special removable slide.  It
was great.  It's a shame the video finally broke and now it won't start.
Eventually I'll make enough free time to take it by a repair shop and see
if they can do anything for it.)  If it has a PCMCIA sized drive, then
there are PCMCIA ports for desktop machines, as well.  However, many
laptops have proprietary internal setups, and some manufacturers have a
policy that says you void the hardware warranty if you take out anything.
So, be sure what you're getting into before you consider that route.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of much greater concern for an older model system, since Linux has pretty
darn good support for older hardware, is whether your hard disk has enough
space for what you want to do with it.  The Sager-Midern mentioned above
fit a <A HREF="http://www.caldera.com/">Caldera</A> Network Desktop on a 500 MB drive fairly easily, but newer
distributions have more stuff, and certain packages (like X networking,
emacs, and source trees) have grown quite large over time.

Do you have any suggestions to resolve my problem as I have gone through
all the web sites? I would be really greatfull if you could shead some
light on this for me.

Try the ftp sites instead of the websites.  I hope I'm correct in assuming
you have an x86 based laptop, not a PowerBook or Sparctop:

...though admittedly they don't make it clear <EM>which</EM> disk images are the
one you need to do an FTP-based install.  Their in-flight questions have
gotten pretty clear about telling you which disk to put in, and you
shouldn't need anything special from Red Hat unless you have an unusual
controller for your internal hard disk.

Well, I hope that helps out.  If you still have trouble, though, drop us

Pretty good, but you missed the possibility of establishing a 
network with PLIP, then using a network-based install.  All you'd need
is a parallel "laplink" style cable.  Unfortunately I don't think the 
distributions support this directly (though Debian might, I haven't checked).
So, you'll probably need to get the minimal installation onto your system
first, but this would probably make the rest a lot easier.
