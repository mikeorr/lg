Subject: $0.02 tip for removing Control M in emacs<br>
<P> 
After looking at issue 8 about how to remove the pesky Control-M
character in vi (vim or whatever) I had to also tell how it could be
done in emacs. Say you loaded up a file that has the ^M all over the
place. No problem, say M-x replace-string RET C-q C-M RET RET and you're
done. Emacs rulz!!

Subject: XTerm title tricks in Linux Gazette #6.<br>
<P> 
Just scanning through back issues and came across the tip to keep the hostname
of the machine your currently logged into in your xterm titlebar (and
wanted to add my 2 cents).
<P>
I work in a room of 30 linux boxes, so to keep track of which one I'm logged 
into despite logging in from one to another and logging out, I put 
<pre>
alias precmd 'echo -n "\033]2;"`hostname`"\007"' 
</pre>
(course anything could be put here)
<br> 
in my .cshrc. Keeps my titlebar updated at all times. As a precmd its run after
every command but its a tiny overhead and steps around the issue of trying to
detect log-outs.

<P>
This is how you comment in a block of code using vi:
<pre>
	:START,ENDs/^/# /
</PRE>
where START is the starting line number and END is the ending line number.
<PRE> 
	i.e. :10,30s/^/# /
</PRE> 
comments in line 10 through line 30 of the current buffer (file).
<P> 
same idea can be used for indentation and/or commenting out.

Newbie Tip on Find</a></H3>

Subject: Article submission: Newbie Tip on Finding<br>
<P> 
Hi,
<P> 
As a new linuxer, I had a hard time finding my way
around the filesystem, and discovered that I often had to find
a file for some reason or other.  I knew the find command was 
out there, but remembering all the options required to make it
search the right places, find the right files, and print the 
right answers was something I couldn't do, at first.  So I made
up my own command, using a shell script, and called it "fnd".
<P> 
"fnd" takes one argument, the name of the file you want
to locate, complete with any wildcards you may wish to include,
and pipes its output to "less", which then allows you to view a
large list of results.  What you get, on each line of output, is
the complete path to anything which you're looking for!  I
find it amazingly useful (as is a rough familiarity with the 
"less" command.)  Here's my script:
<PRE> 
#!/bin/bash
find / -iname $1 -mount -print |less
</PRE> 
<P> 
That's it!  The -iname option tells find to be case insensitive,
the $1 is a variable which subs in your commandline argument,
-mount tells find not to descend directories on other file systems
like your cd-ROM (because mine is wonky and locks up the machine if
it is accessed;).  The -print option is required or you don't get
any output! (Get used to it, it's *nix...)  The | symbol tells
find to direct its output to the "less" command so you can see
your results in style!  Don't forget the / right after the find
command, or it won't know where to look.  -  Enjoy!  You won't 
regret the time you spend keying in this little shortcut, and 
don't forget to put it in a "bin" or "sbin" directory after
chmod'ing it to be executable. 
<P>

Masquerading with SendMail</a></H3>

Subject: Masquerading with sendmail<br>
<P> 
Hi Marjorie,
<P> 
First of all, I think it is wonderful that John devoted that much of
his spare time to start and maintain the Linux Gazette. I am happy to
see that it is being continued. Keep up this beautiful project! 
<P> 
I was very pleased with Leifs Queue-R-Mail Howto, published in issue 6
of the Gazette, but I was still left with one drawback. I have a PPP
dialup account at a local provider, and when sending remote mail, the 
"From" address and "Return Path" should be masqueraded to match my address
at the provider. If I would fill the $M macro in my 'sendmail.cf' (as
installed by Slackware 3.0), it would only change my domain, so it needed
some adjustment. I made some direct changes to  'sendmail.cf', but I did
make a backup before trying anything! Here are the changes I made:
<PRE> 
> # Before the edits
< # After the edits
</PRE>
<P> 
First of all, I filled the $M macro for masquerading my domain and added
a $N macro for masquerading my username:
<PRE> 
> DM
< DMlelystad.flnet.nl
< DN0wolfram01
</PRE>
<P>  
Disable masquerading for the local mailer in ruleset 40:
<PRE> 
> R$*			$: $1 @ $M		add local qualification
< #R$*			$: $1 @ $M		add local qualification
</PRE> 
<P> 
Include username in remote mail masquerading (rulesets 31 and 61):
<PRE> 
> R$* < @ $+ @ $+ >	$@ $1 < @ $3 >			$M is defined -- use it
< R$* < @ $+ @ $+ >	$@ $N < @ $3 >			$M is defined -- use it
> R$+			$: $1 < @ $M >			user w/o host
< R$+			$: $N < @ $M >			user w/o host
</PRE>
<P> 
If you send your mail as root, you might want to remove its special
treatment:
<PRE> 
> #CLroot
> CEroot
< #CLroot
< #CEroot
</PRE> 
<P>
After sending 'sendmail' a HUP signal, my mail got masqueraded so that
the receiver could just reply to the correct mailbox.<br>
Two remarks:<br>
First, to find ruleset xx, just search for Sxx in the beginning of a line.
Secondly, tab characters between the fields in the rewriting rules
are REQUIRED!!! Make sure you do not change those into spaces!
<P> 
Well, those were my $0.02. I hope it was still readable.
<P> 
Cheers,<br>
Rob.

Subject: Linux upgrade<br>
<P> 
Hello,
<P> 
Since this FAQ is comes up a very often in comp.os.linux.*,
and since it's already mentioned in kernels 2.0.12+ in
/linux/Documentation/Changes and in some News papers
(still one contacting me today: The editor of the german magazine
UNIXopen.) without any request from us.
So I'm going to ask for you to put something in your interesting
magazine. It's is how to avoid a lot of problem when upgrading
a Linux box. There's a easy way, and some scripts to run.
All the stuff is free, and is available by ftp, located at:
ftp://ftp.wsc.com/pub/freeware/linux/update.linux/
<P> 
The upgrade is full, it means it will upgrade any system
from 1.2.x (sorry I didn't test any earlier setup).
It will be right for anyone from new Linux users to experts
(no knowledge is required, no questions are done: all
is detected and worked fine for all people who tested,
except non-Lilo users since I force Lilo v19 to install.
This will change next.)
<P> 
All the upgrade is always up to date, and only fully tested
packages are included (!). For example, I didn't install
kernel 2.0.5 when it comes out since I've found out a bug
in the code (reported to Linus who did 2.0.6 as a patch).
Current upgrade contains:
<ul>
<li> New kernel: 2.0.x
<li> New gcc: 2.7.2
<li> New libc: 5.4.2
<li> New libg: 2.7.1.4
<li> New ld.so: 1.8.1
<li> New bin utils 86: 0.3
<li> New modules: 2.0.0
<li> New make: 3.74

<li> New dip 3.3.7o
<li> New fdisk 3.04
<li> New fdutils 4.2

<li> New apache (HTML server) 1.1.1
