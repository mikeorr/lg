Hello,
</P>
<P>
I am using RH8 linux and successfully installed xine for video play.
Video cds(.dat format) are functioning well with xine.  But I cannot play the  video files (in
.dat format) copied to hard disk. The following errors shows on 'xine <TT>/home/temp/AVSEQ14.DAT</TT>'
</P>

<blockquote><pre>-xine engine error
There is no available demuxer plugin to handle /home/temp/AVSEQ14.DAT.
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
Kindly note that same file on VCD play well in my system in xine.
Please advise me.

<P>
Hi
</P>
<P>
I have tried several times to backup my new Linux server into an existing
Windows NT server but each time I tried the connection is often refused. I
install the webadmin which makes it much easier but the same problem happens
</P>
<P>
I tried with the command below from the option in webadmin:
</P>

<blockQuote><ol>
<LI>smbclient //zeus/home/remote/Abacus/Abac -A samba-domain-pw -D trans &gt;dump.tar

<LI>smbclient //terabyte_server/e

<LI>rdump -0u -f server: /dev/nst0 /dump
</ol></blockQuote>
<P>
*where server = name of NT server and <TT>/dump</TT> a directory in NT server
Etc, all same stories.
</P>
<P>
Could you please advice me what to do as the Linux and NT Server are of same
domain and with possible solution.
</P>
<P>
Thanks for your help.
<BR>Maxwell

Re: <A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/issue97/defectors2.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/issue97/defectors2.html</A> by Tom

</P>
<P><STRONG>
In Windows, each user has an entry in the Documents and Settings
directory on the "C" drive.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
In Windows XP, I know this is true; however, it is not true for
Win98 or previous versions.  Dunno about 2000 or ME, don't have
experience with those.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Never login as root (the Linux equivalent of the Administrator in
Windows)! Always login as yourself and use the "su" command to give
yourself root privileges for specific commands.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I login as root all the time, and have only once trashed a
filesystem (typed <TT>/dev/hda</TT> when I meant <TT>/dev/fd0.</TT>)  You shouldn't do
<EM>everything</EM> as root, but I do a lot of system maint every time I'm
using linux, and it's just easier than typing sudo all the time.  The
biggest concern seems to be file deletion, which is easily abrogated
by <EM>ONLY</EM> using 'mc' to delete files.
</P>
<P>
Better advice might be something like: "Do all your normal tasks -
web browsing, listening to music, playing movies, word processing,
etc - as a non-root user, and use root for system config and
maintenance.  DO NOT run a GUI for very long as root, it increases
the chance of destabilizing the system.  Wherever possible, use
command-line or ncurses-based tools (like mc) when running as root."
</P>
<P><STRONG>
<TT>/sbin:</TT> Programs and scripts used by system itself, and by users to
administer the system.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
You may want to add: "Statically compiled <TT>/</TT> Standalone binaries
that don't depend on external libraries to run.  In other words,
critical Programs that can be run even when certain filesystems (like
<TT>/usr</TT>, if it's mounted on a separate partition) are unavailable."
That may be a bit technical tho.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
<TT>/dev:</TT> Each "file" inside this directory represents a hardware
device on the computer.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
The <TT>/dev</TT> dir is full of stuff that doesn't necessarily exist on
your machine, however.  They put it all in there up front so the
device file doesn't have to be created later if you plug one in.
(New users might be confused if the do ' ls <TT>/dev</TT> -l ' and expect all
those devices to really exist.)
</P>
<P>
Side note: Did you ever fix the 1GB memory and Promise problems?
Recompiling the latest 2.4 kernel might give you some new options.
Aside from that, I have to pass ' mem=511M ' on my 512MB AMD Duron
box when booting Knoppix.  Hdinstalled systems are fine w/o it.  With
the Promise controller you might be able to pass an "ide=" parm, or
it may have a native Linux driver by now.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
At the risk of offending everybody, vi.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Personally, I use jstar. 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=";-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">  It's provided by the "joe" package.
All the common/major distros supply it (it's even in Mepis now, after
I tweaked Warren's arm.)

You can't just eject the CD-ROM as you do in Windows. You have to
unmount it first.
</STRONG></P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">That directly depends on whether you have a file open from the disc; the
hardware will be advised to resist the user pressing the button if
you're running a program or reading a file from it at the time.  The
noticeable difference is that looking at its directories in Explorer
isn't holding the filesystem locked open.
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
<P>
FYI, if you type 'eject <TT>/dev/blah</TT>' at a command prompt it will
umount it for you.  (Depending on fstab permissions, you might have
to root-run it tho.)  See 'man eject'.  One of the caveats for
unmounting is that no-one's current directory can be the intended
ejection point (if your $PWD is <TT>/mnt/cdrom</TT> and you try to eject it,
it'll probably fail.  CD to another directory 1st.  If eject still
fails, do 'lsof|grep $mountpoint' and see who's holding it up.)

Hello Heather,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I just wanted to send you a very sincere bit of thanks for your efforts
in resisting the "CMSment" of LG. While I know that there are obviously
many others who contributed to the cause, your name was mentioned to me
just the other night by a friend here in NYC and from that news, I got
the impression that you really drove the campaign. I am actually in the
middle of reading this month's issue and love your statement regarding
the CMS proposal:

Yeah, I figured <A HREF="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</A>'s a great thing, but somebody else already does
that...
</P>
<P>
I can't say I was the most annoyed about it, but I was probably one of
the clearest in saying what I didn't like.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I could not agree more! Thankyou once again and keep up the great work.
I hope you'll extend my gratitude to the other members of the team who
helped save this incredible resource

Hello Linux Gazette!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
From the Mailbag of issue 97:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000066"><EM><BLOCKQuote>
If you think LG is too strict -- or not strict enough -- in its
article selection, please let us know.
</BLOCKQuote></EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Please don't make it less strict! It is right at the moment, sometimes
even not strict enough. Perhaps you would like to read a few thoughts
about this.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
What I like very much about the Linux Gazette is that it is a "real
magazine" online, not like a news site that gathers seemingly random
bits of information. There is a given time each week when it will be
published, the structure is always the same etc. Another element of that
"magazine feel" is of course the quality of the articles. Please keep up
that up strictly, it is a crucial element of the success you have so
far. A new issue is something that people look forward to. They won't do
that if a new issue means they have to scan the articles first to find
the mediocre ones.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I don't think you have to worry about information kind of "getting lost"
when you reject articles. Linux has gone beyond the crititical mass
concerning representation and information availability on the net. In
fact, I believe it has gone so far beyond that critical mass that it is
an important function of an edited magazine to help its readers sort out
the good writings out of the vast amount there is available. This is
exactly what strict editing does.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Keep up the great work,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thomas Kappler
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Thanks for the support.
</P>
<P>
Of course, LG is a monthly publication, not weekly.  We've sometimes
done it twice a month, and in the mythical future we'd like to see it
published twice a month regularly, but that's not in the cards now.
</P>
<P>
-Mike Orr (aka. Sluggo)
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Yes, that was just a mistake.
Better monthly with high quality than twice a month, but not as good.
And of course we want you to stay motivated rather than tired

Seems to me this dispute over who should control the words:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
Linux Gazette
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
is a real muddle.  Each side's arguments seem pretty clear.  It has
been a monthly magazine for a long long time, and one side wants to
continue that.  The other side has supported it for a long long time,
and wants to move into the future.

A modest proposal, how about <EM>both</EM> zine change their name,
one to linux gazette monthly, one to linux gazette online.
If you really want to get anal, make (the original sites)
a CGI which chooses the order of the two links randomly, or a cron
program to switch it every minute, or hour, or day.
Then the contested shorter name can point to a simple page

Felix, Mr. Hughes has made clear that he regards Linux Gazette
magazine's use of any variation on "Linux Gazette" as a violation of his
(alleged, phony) trademark.  We've concluded that the proper way out of
this is to disregard (and disarm as required) the bogus trademark claim,
and just concentrate on publishing the magazine.

A lower-tech alternative would be each site staying at their current URL
(but modifying their popular name slightly) and linking to the other on

Changing the name (and the web address) twice in so short a time can't
be a good thing. Readers new and old need to find LG, not wander around
looking for it in all the wrong places. A significant PR campaign would
be needed to make it work.  That's what makes the original proposal in
this thread attractive: the original site gives people a choice. The
trouble with the proposal is that egos are going to get in the way, no
doubt about it. Get over that hurtle, and you have a reasonable
solution. Of course, any agreement needs to be in writing so nobody has
room to waffle in the future.

Right now I'm all for making it a public issue. That way the new site
and the issue gets some popularity. If LG.net is forced or at some point
thinks its simply wise to move away we've some audience aware of the
switch and it's not starting at a point zero  with no known name or
link. Right now the public opinion seems to be with us so we get the
sympathy. If this changes and we come over as the stubborn ones without
a case we should resolve the issue one sided by backing down -- again as
publicly as possible.

<BR>John M. Fisk, N.D. (<a href="mailto:gazette@lists.linuxgazette.net?subject=%20Re%3A%20%5BLG%2098%5D%20gazette%20matters%20%232">jf235 from email.med.yale.edu</a>)
<BR>Question by Rick Moen (rick from linuxmafia.com)

<P>
Hi Rick, thanks for writing.  I'll try to address your questions below.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Dear Dr. Fisk:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
You've probably been too busy with real life to notice, but we at
Linux Gazette magazine have been having some problems of late.   To
make a long story short, because SSC announced intentions in 3Q 2003
to effectively kill Linux Gazette by transforming it into a
<A HREF="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</A>-style Web discussion forum, and for several other reasons,
the couple of dozen editors and staff unanimously voted to move the
magazine away from SSC, to <A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net"
	>http://linuxgazette.net</A> .
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Phil Hughes at SSC, Inc. has unfortunately been extremely vindictive
about this, and is retroactively asserting commercial trademark over our
magazine's name, and based on that is attempting to seize our Internet
domain.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
It would help us a great deal if you could confirm our understanding
of your intentions in August 1996.  Based on your wording in issue #8,
we believe your understanding was that SSC would continue to operate
Linux Gazette as a free, entirely non-commercial magazine alongside
its commercial offering, Linux Journal.  Can you confirm this?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
This is correct.
</P>
<P>
Bear with me for a moment and I'll try to provide a bit of background.  I had
started the Linux Gazette in early 1995, essentially as a means of learning
HTML and to provide an educational/entertaining resource for other Linux
enthusiasts.  I had spent a bit of time lurking around various Linux related
USENET groups and found that although there was a good deal of useful
information there, the signal to noise ratio at times dipped pretty low.
</P>
<P>
I had no access to the internet, other than a 2400 baud dial up connection to
the Vanderbilt University VAX machine.  A physics grad student, Tim, offered
to host it on a site that he was running, and that's where the LG got its
start.  Throughout the early life the LG, I was always beholden to others to
the host the content.
</P>
<P>
My stated intention at that time was to start a monthly online magazine with a
variety of article formats: in-depth articles, short tips-and-tricks, email
correspondance, etc.  It was always intended to be open (in the sense of open
to all contributors), free (in the sense of beer AND speech), non-commercial,
and "moderated" only in the sense that no flames or derogatory material were
going to be allowed.  At the time, the Linux community was pretty small
(Patrick V. was just getting <A HREF="http://www.slackware.org/">Slackware</A> well established and Marc Ewing, Erik
Troan, and Donny Barnes were gearing up for RedHat!) and collegial.
</P>
<P>
It was an almost instant success in terms of community interest and took very
little time for several regular contributors to come forward and offer to
provide monthly articles of good quality.  Within a year, I was getting
overwhelmed trying to provide the time to get new editions of the Linux
Gazette ready and sent out to the various hosting sites.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, I received an unexpected call from Phil Hughes at SSC with an offer
to take over the management of the Linux Gazette.  He mentioned that he had
the personnel to handle the editing and distribution aspects and that he would
continue to make it available as it had been started - open, free, and
non-commercial.
</P>
<P>
Phil was very pleasant and we entered into a "gentleman's agreement" that he
would take over management of the Linux Gazette and I would be able to retire
gracefully and continue to contribute as time allowed (which clearly, it has
not...)  No money was exchanged during this transaction and no documentation
was created or signed -- we simply had an mutual verbal agreement.
</P>
<P>
They were good to their word and Marjorie Richardson did a wonderful job of
handling the early efforts of keeping the LG going.  On my part, I returned to
residency in Pathology at Yale and am currently completing a fellowship in
Transfusion Medicine.  I was delighted to have someone interested in the LG
and have greatly appreciated their years of dedication to it.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Can you also confirm that you made no agreement with SSC, Inc. to
assign them any trademark?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
That is correct: the verbal agreement that Phil Hughes and I entered into was
that the Linux Gazette would continue as it had been started, the only change
being that SSC would take over the day-to-day management of it.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I will stress that we bear absolutely no ill will towards SSC, Inc. or
towards Mr. Hughes.  We wish only to prevent his use of belated
trademark claims to harrass the Gazette, after its departure from his
site.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I'm deeply sorry to hear of this situation.  Phil was a godsend and I
appreciate his efforts in keeping the LG going.  I will demur on comment as to
whether moving to a "Slashdot Style" format is A Good Thing(tm) or not -- it
certainly was not my original intention.
</P>
<P>
It's unfortunate that a complementary solution could not be amiably arrived
at: a "two-site" Linux Gazette, as crazy as that sounds, wouldn't be entirely
a bad idea.  As long as the two sites linked to each other, I could envision
having a Slashdot style site with daily chatter and such, and an ongoing
monthly online magazine as a complementary site for more currated content.
Just a thought...
</P>
<P><STRONG>
(The situation is admittedly somewhat more confused than that, but I
was going to omit the gory details.)
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Again, sorry to hear about this mess.  I hope that it can be resolved in an
amiable fashion and that the community will support, rather than split from,
whatever is decided.
</P>
<P>
I wish you the best.  The grace and wisdom of God be with you.
</P>
<P>
cheers,
</P>
<P>
John

<P>
Rob Tougher's family lost a good friend and companion this week;  he would

helping us with stylesheet improvements.  Netscape and Phoenix users

<P>
Thomas Adam, our Weekend Mechanic, has also been helping me out with
preparing TAG;  I'm sorry we didn't have an Answer Gang or Tips last
month, for I was going to be out of town and could only prepare Mailbag.
Thomas cheerfully offered to fill in for me, but it turns out that he has
been ill for the last few months, and outstretched his poor health -- he
was too ill to complete them in time, though he had hoped better of himself.
He has pitched in such as he could across this month, but many of the Tips
are last month's material.  I am pleased to say that he is recovering now,
but it looks like it may take awhile for him to be at his best again;  the
staff is encouraging him to take it easy.
</P>
<P>
Please join us in offering kind thoughts for Rob and Thomas.
