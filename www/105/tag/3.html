Dear Answer Gang,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The problem is: "<TT>/etc/init.d/pcmcia</TT> start" reports 0 sockets being
watched when use any 2.6 kernel other Mandrake 10.0's 2.6.3-7.

My first suggestion at reading that is Mandrake, like RH (and <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> to an
extent) have patched that kernel to high heaven (read that as 'mangled')
such that it is no longer a kernel... grr, stock kernela <EM>are</EM> evil.

It's been a while since I last dug around for info on the pcmcia
subsystem, but last I looked at the pcmcia pkg docs from Hinds - it has
been a while, maybe 18 months or more, there were some things that the
stand-alone pcmcia pkg did better than the integrated kernel version.  His
recommendation was that in circumstances where there were problems, one
should try compiling the kernel without the pcmcia options, and compile
the pkg from source, and run it from a system init script.  It might be
worth taking a look to see if that situation still holds.

I've had this problem with Fedora 2, Suse 9.1, and Manrdake 10.  The
only kernel that get my PCMCIA right is 2.6.3-7 from the Mandrake 10
distro.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
This happens on two of my laptops, a fujitsu lifebook 765DX (Pentium
166MMX), and an NEC Versa LX (PII-233).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The other possibly related irritant is that "<TT>/etc/init.d/pcmcia</TT> stop"
is not working right; more precisely, when I get the PCMICA card
started, the card's lights go on and eth0 is brought up; when I stop
the card, eth0 is brought down, but the card remains ON.  So, if I
reboot, even with kernel 2.6.3-7 mdk 10.0, the next "pcmcia start"
fails to notice the two slots.  If I power down and then boot, all
works fine.
</STRONG></P>

If the pcmcia initscript is the same as it was in Mandrake 7.0 (which
was my only fleeting contact with it) then that should actually be
calling cardmgr . Cardmgr normally works just fine.

Yes, agreed.  Instead of stopping the pcmcia service, try the command
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
"cardctl eject"
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
as root.  Before I discovered the card mgrs eject command (back in the
days of the 2.2 kernels), I used to stop the pcmcia service, and it would
sometimes hang, and otherwise misbehave.  I found the eject command to be
a better option.

To summarize: "<TT>/etc/init.d/pcmcia</TT> start" find 2 sockets and works
with only one very specific kernel.  The "stop" doesn't stop all
the way.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I looked around the net for a while, but didn't find an answer.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I am guessing that this is one of those "older machine" things
that require a slightly exceptional configuration clause somewhere.

Actually, I would be more inclined to say that you should look at
compiling your own kernel. Since it works with a specific kernel you can
almost certainly rule out hardware issues. So the trick is to look at
the specific working kernel's config file for clues. The config files
for kernels should be in <TT>/boot</TT> as:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>/boot/config-$(uname -r)
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
The $(uname -r) interpolates to the current running kernel's version,
but the principle is the same -- the file name is <TT>/boot/config-&lt;version&gt;</TT>
. If you can do the following for that kernel version:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>grep -i pcmcia /boot/config-&lt;ver&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
And send it to us, that would help. Along with that, you should repeat
that same command on a file for a kernel that does <EM>not</EM> work, for
comparison.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If you think this is long winded, you'd be right. I would definitely
look at compiling your own kernel. It's not that hard, and there's
plenty of references to it, here's two:
