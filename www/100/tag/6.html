Hi TAG!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Hope you can help me, because I can't solve my problem using search-engines
man-pages, faq's (linuxgazette, tldp.org, <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> portal, ...):
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
Some programms send messages to any user logged in (i.e. shutdown, module
error messages, ...).
When using a terminal and my script is working cursor position dependent these
messages really disturb!
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
My questions:
Where do these messages come from, maybe printk (out of the kernel)?
How do I suppress them?
</STRONG></P>

They come from the script doing "echo foo". Now, if they are just from
scripts that you yourself invoke, you can do:

come from the kernel.

which means you won't see a thing. If, however, you are referring to
seeing messages to your console, you can do:

Generally you are right, Ben, but:
I am displaying server status and activity from my (python) script. The
unwanted messages are first of all from a scsi-modul. Thus: I am interested
in the message, but not in THIS terminal.

Do not take a discussion off-list without clearly stating that you're
doing that, please. If you want private advice, my rates are $125/hour;
I'd imagine Thomas would also charge you a consulting fee. I've added
TAG back to the CC list.

Assuming you're talking about non-critical messages, try turning off
SCSI debugging in the kernel config. In an extreme case, you can tweak
the module code itself (but this last one is something you'd have to do
every time you update your kernel.)

Not unless you send <em>  all  </em> output on that terminal to "<TT>/dev/null</TT>".

What you're proposing is <em>  still  </em> getting rid of all system messages, and
I keep telling you that it's a bad idea - and thus not likely to be
supported. Getting rid of the non-critical messages from one module, OK;
shutting down system messages in general, bad idea.

Absolutely a bad idea. And let's face it, having tweaked klogd(
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT="8)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">, one is
not going to be seeing those messages until one needs to, since shutting
the system down etc, is at a time when either the user is aware of what is
happening, or because it is there to alert you to save your work, etc.

'setterm -msglevel [n]' doesn't help:

I still belive I have to take a close look at klogd or syslog. But I doubt it

Or he could just see the messages and hit "Ctrl-L" to clear them after
reading them. The screen should redraw back to the way it was before the
message. I thought this would be too obvious to mention, but - maybe
not.

Christoph, it would help if you give us some examples of exactly what
messages you are seeing.  That would help us narrow down which modules
or kernel systems are producing them and why.  See the TAG Posting FAQ,
<A HREF="../../tag/ask-the-gang.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html</A>
especially section "Provide enough, but not too much information".

If you see something like "cannot load module char-major-10-175", it
means some program is trying to access a device that is not present in
the kernel.  E.g., when a time synchronization program wants to access
the real-time clock but you didn't compile the RTC module.  The proper
thing to do is to enable the module (if essential) or disable the
program (if non-essential).  The quick fix is to put "alias
char-major-10-175 off" in <TT>/etc/modules.conf.</TT>  That tells the module
loader (modprobe) not to look for that module if requested.  In
practice, most people just use the quick fix and forget about it.
After all, if the lack of that service was causing any practical
problems, you would have seen it by now.  See "man modules.conf" for
more info.

Ctrl-L works in many Curses-based programs to redraw the screen as it
should be, erasing any droppings left by other processes.  It works in
vim, mutt, newsreaders, etc.  Although it's a longstanding Unix convention,
it's not automatic, so some programs may not support it.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Going back in computer history, Ctrl-L means "form feed" (ASCII symbol
FF).  When a printer receives it, it ejects the page.  Video consoles
can't eject the page (or if they did there'd be broken glass
everywhere), so they clear the screen instead.  That's why shells and
other line-oriented programs clear the screen when you press Ctrl-L.
However, screen-oriented programs like vi decided on a different
convention more useful to them: Ctrl-L redraws the screen.  Line noise
was a significant problem in those days, and it would sometimes cause
random characters to appear on the screen.  (Nowadays modems have error
correction built in, so they can detect line noise.)  Control-L was a
convenient way to counteract that, and it's still useful when a
background program invades your screen with messages.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
"man ascii" shows the control codes, although it doesn't explain what
the symbols mean.  Most of the codes are no longer used for their
original purpose anyway.  Here's the original reasoning behind the
codes:

Not all terminals actually responded the way they were "supposed" to.
LF is supposed to go down one line but stay in the same horizontal
position.  That's why Windows uses CR+LF at the end of a line, because
that's what old-time printers did.  But VT terminals needed only LF, so
that's what Unix inherited.  Macintosh uses CR, perhaps attempting to
redefine the code according to modern understanding.  If you've ever
seen a printer do "stair stepping" (starting one line where the previous
one left off), that's what's happening.  The computer is sending only
LF, and the printer is interpreting it strictly.

One workaround would be to use a GUI window (wxPython, Tkinter, gtk, etc) for
your application output.  Kernel messages can't write there.

No, since you would have to have someway of knowing the tty that your

Stderr is a channel a process writes out on, not a channel it receives
things from.  So xterm cannot receive things on stderr.  It does receive
things from stdin, but that's connected to the tty xterm was started <EM>from</EM>,
not to the tty that xterm's display window is showing.  Stdin/stdout/stderr
are set by the kernel when xterm starts, and only later does xterm allocate
a tty for its display window.  If xterm receives something on stdin, it
probably ignores it.  But if it receives something on the tty connected to
its window, it displays it.  You can do this yourself.

(<TT>/dev/tty</TT> automatically directs to the current tty.  The 'tty' command
shows which tty is the current one.  I got a permission error because I
don't own <TT>/dev/pts/8.</TT>  The first 'w' entry is the console I ran "startx"
in.  Writing to it didn't show up here, but it did show up in my text
console.  <TT>/dev/tty7</TT> is the graphical display my X session is using, thus
the one konsole was launched from, thus konsole's stdin/stdout/stderr.
Writing to it didn't show up in the window, it just disappeared.  In all
cases, 'echo' is writing to its stdout, not to its stderr.  The tty it's
writing <EM>to</EM> may be somebody else's stdin or stderr, but that depends on
how that other somebody is configured.)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I use konsole, which is kind of a super xterm from <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A>.  Each konsole
has multiple views (like screen), but sometimes I launch a second
konsole from the first so I can keep two sets of views separate.  For
instance, one set of views for my personal stuff, and another set for
work stuff (which are all su'd to another user).  The second konsole
writes all sorts of undesired debugging information on stderr, which
stomps over the view I launched it from -- similar to the problem
you're having.  So I start it with "konsole 2&gt;/dev/null" to suppress
those messages.  But that only works if you do it to the process that's
writing the messages.  You can't do that to the kernel, to a driver or
a daemon, since you don't have control over their stdin/stdout/stderr.
