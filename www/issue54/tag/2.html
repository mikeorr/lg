Homework Answer: All about 'rm'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:: -->
<P><STRONG>
Hello,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I'm wondering if you can answer a few questions on the UNIX rm command.  I
need a response before May 3rd if possible.  Your assistance on this matter
is greatly appreciated.  Thank you for your time and service.  Here's the
questions
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
Hmm.  Wouldn't want this assignment to be late for the prof,
heh?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, at least you had the brights to use a hotmail account
rather than sending this from your 
	<em>flunkme</em>@<em>someuniv.edu</em> address.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"

The rm unix command lowers the link of an inode.  When the link count goes
to zero the inode is made available to the system and cleared of extraneous
information.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
The 'rm' command is basically a parser and wrapper around the
<TT>unlink()</TT> system call.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
BTW: This definition is an oversimplification.  When the link count
is less than 1 AND THERE ARE NO OPEN FILE DESCRIPTORS ON THAT FILE
then the system does some sort of maintenance on the inode and any
data blocks that were assigned to it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Exactly what the filesystem does depends on what type of fs it is,
and on how it was implemented for that version of that flavor of
UNIX.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Usually the inode is marked as "available" in some way <TT>---</TT> so that
it can be re-used for new files.  Usually the data blocks are added
to a free list, so that they can be allocated to other files.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(It is possible for some implementations to mark and reserve these
to allow for some sort of "undelete" process <TT>---</TT> and it would
certainly be possible to have "purge" and "salvage" features for
some versions of UNIX).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
1) Explain link count?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
The link count is one of the elements (fields) of the inode
structure.  An inode is a data structure that is used to
manage most of the metadata for a file on a UNIX like filesystem.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
On UNIX filesystems a directory entry is (usually) a link to an inode.
(On some forms of UNIX, on some types of filesystems there may be
exceptions to this.  Some filesystems can store symbolic link data
directly in their directory structures without dereferencing that
through an inode; some of them can even store the contents of small
files there.  However --- in most cases the directory entry is a
link to an inode.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This allows one to have multiple links to a file.  In other words
you can have many different names for a file --- and you can have
identical names in different directories.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It turns out that most filesystems use this feature extensively
to support the directory structure.  Directories are just inodes
that are mostly just like files.  Somewhere you have a parent
directory.  It contains a link to you.  Each of your subdirectories
contains a ".." link to its parent (you).  Thus each directory
must contain a link count that is equal to it's number of sudirectories
plus two (one for . and another for <TT>../somelink.to.me</TT>).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(Note: On most modern forms of UNIX there is a prohibition against
creating additional named hard links to directories <TT>--</TT>  this is
apparently enforced in order to make things easier for fsck).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
2) Explain why the name of the command is called remove (rm)?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
It seems pretty self explanatory to me.  You're removing a link.
If that link is the last one to that file, then you've remove the
file as well.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
3) What hapens to the blocks referenced by the inode when the
link count goes to zero?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
Normally the data block would be returned to the free list.
The free list is another data structure on UNIX filesystems.
I think it is usually implemented as a bitmap.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note: On some forms of UNIX the filesystem driver might
implement a secure deleted feature which might implement
arbitrarily complex sets of overwritting the data with
NULs, with random data, etc.  There is a special feature in
Linux which is reserved for this use <TT>--</TT> but which is not yet
implemented.  You might find similar features in your favorite
form of UNIX.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
4) What data is present in these blocks after the inode has been
cleared?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
That depends on the filesystem implementation.  It usually would
still contain whatever data was laying around in those blocks at
the time that they were freed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you're thinking:  "Ooooh!  That means I can peek at other
people's data after they remove it!"  Think again.  Any decent
UNIX implementation will ensure that those data blocks are
clear (zero'd out) as they are re-allocated.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
5) How does the removal of an inode which is a symbolic link
change the answer to 3) and 4)?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
Symbolic links may be implemented by storing the "data"
in the directory entry.  In which case the<TT> unlink()</TT> simply
zeros out that directory entry in whatever way is appropriate
to the filesystem on which it is found.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Symbolic links may also be implemented by reference to an
inode --- and by storing the target filename in the data
blocks that are assigned to that inode.  In which case they
are treated just like any other file.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note that removing a symbolic link with 'rm' should NEVER affect
the target file links or inodes.  The symbolic link is completely
independent of the hard links to which they point and the inodes
to which those refer.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
Thank you for your help.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

As I'm sure you noticed this sounds to me like a "do my homework"
message.  However, I've decided to answer it since it is likely
to be of interest to many of my readers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You may also have noticed that I was a bit vague on a number of
points.  Keep in mind that there is quite alot of this that depends
on which version of UNIX you're using, which filesystem your talking
about (Linux, for example supports over a dozen different types of
local filesystem), and how you've configured it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course you could learn quite a bit more about it by reading
the sources to a Linux or <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A> kernel
