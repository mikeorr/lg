<h1>Using Linux to Teach Kids How to Program, 10 Years Later (Part II)</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/silva.html">Anderson Silva</a></b></p>

<p>
In last month's article, I talked about the Logo programming
language as a tool to help you introduce mathematics and programming
concepts to kids. This month, I am going to take you one step further
into Logo programming and show you some more advanced concepts like
loops, conditional statements, procedure definition, and (do I dare?)
even the concept of recursion.
</p>

<p>
Before we begin, though, I would like to make a small disclaimer: I've
always thought of Logo as a programming language for kids only, and even
though I've been writing these articles about using Logo to teach kids how
to program, I know of quite a few universities that use Logo even in their
graduate courses, to teach complex techniques in recursion and other
programming topics. Therefore, don't think for a moment that Logo is just a
toy: it's definitely fun <em>and</em> educational.
</p>

<p>
With that said, let's go ahead and learn some more Logo.
</p>

<p>
In Logo, we have the ability to teach our "programmable" turtle new
words. To do that, we use the <em>to</em> keyword. It's with
<em>to</em> that we define our procedures in Logo, and also have the
ability to save our work to disk, which I will discuss later on.
</p>

<h3>Logo's Hello World</h3>

<p>
If you decide to do more research and learn more about Logo on your own,
you will probably see the following procedure as one of the very first
Logo examples:
</p>

<pre class="code">
to square
repeat 4 [fd 100 rt 90]
end
</pre>

<p>
That's how we teach Logo's turtle the word "square". To square means:
<em>Repeat the following 4 times: go forward 100 pixels and turn right 90
degrees</em>. Now, when you call <em>square</em> in the Logo interpreter,
the turtle will draw you the square you are asking for. The only problem
here is that, if you exit your interpreter with the command <em>bye</em>,
the turtle will forget that word, and eventually teaching the same word
over and over again will get pretty boring, even for a kid.
</p>

<p>
<img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_31tgtr85c8_b.png" alt="square">
</p>

<p>
The solution is to save your new procedure (a.k.a. word) into a file,
and load that when you start the interpreter. To save your work use:
</p>

<pre class="code">
? save "square.logo
</pre>

<p>
where, like the <em>help</em> command we talked about last month, the file
name must be preceded with a double quotation mark. Once you save your new
defined word, you will see a text file called square.logo in the same
directory where you started your interpreter.
</p>

<p>
As you start to familiarize yourself with Logo, you will always have the
choice to write your code directly to a text file, and then load it via
the interpreter. To do that:
</p>

<pre class="code">
? load "square.logo
</pre>

<p>
Let's say, once you teach the turtle the word <em>square</em>, you want to
change the definition of it a little. Maybe you want to add colors or
make the square bigger.  Well, Logo will not let you create a new
<em>square</em> word, and it will complain with the following message if
you try it:
</p>

<pre class="code">
? to square
square is already defined
</pre>

<p>
If you want to modify an existing word you taught the turtle, you need
to use the <em>ed</em> command.
</p>

<pre class="code">
? ed "square
</pre>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> For <em>ed</em> to work, you must have the shell
environment $EDITOR set to your favorite text editor. I usually run:
<em>export EDITOR="vi"</em> in my shell before starting my Logo
interpreter.
</p>

<p>
With all that said, I'd like to give you one final and more complex, yet
fun, Logo example. The example below is recorded as if we were typing it
directly into the Logo interpreter, and then saved to a file called
example.logo.
</p>

<pre class="code">
Welcome to Berkeley Logo version 5.6
? to pick_color
&gt; output pick [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15]
&gt; end
pick_color defined
? to colorful_circle :size
&gt; if :size = 1 [stop]
&gt; setpencolor pick_color
&gt; arc 360 :size
&gt; colorful_circle :size - 1
&gt; end
colorful_circle defined
? save "example.logo
</pre>

<p>
In the example above, I teach Logo's turtle two new words:
<em>pick_color</em> and <em>colorful_circle</em>.
</p>

<p>
The word <em>pick_color</em> is basically a function that uses the command
pick to randomly choose a number between 1 and 15. The command
<em>output</em> is used to return the value picked by pick.
</p>

<p>
The word <em>colorful_circle</em> is quite a bit more complex, and it
packs a lot of new Logo features. If you look at the very first line where
colorful_circle is defined with <em>to</em>, we have <em>:size</em> as a
parameter for it. In Logo, variables are identified with a colon (:) in
front of their labels.
</p>

<p>
Then, we have an <em>if</em> statement, checking if <em>:size</em> equals
1, and, if so, to leave the procedure. This <em>if</em> statement is known as a
base case, because colorful_circle is a recursive word, which means it
calls itself to execute a rule, and it will stop doing so only when the
base case is met.
</p>

<p>
With <em>setpencolor pick_color</em>, the turtle will be able to choose
whatever color it wants to draw the next circle it is going to draw.
(<strong>Note:</strong> setpencolor was discussed in last month's article).
</p>

<p>
After a color is picked, and set, it's time to draw a circle with the
<em>arc</em> command. To understand the <em>arc</em> command, let's use
Logo's help. In the interpreter, type:
</p>

<pre class="code">
? help "arc
ARC angle radius

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;draws an arc of a circle, with the turtle at the center, with the
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;specified radius, starting at the turtle's heading and extending
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;clockwise through the specified angle.&nbsp; The turtle does not move.
</pre>

<p>
So, the <em>arc</em> command takes two parameters: an angle and a radius.
Because we want to draw a circle, it makes sense that my arc angle be
360 degrees. The radius, it turns out, will be whatever the
variable <em>:size</em> is. If :size changes, we will have different sized
circles being drawn by the turtle.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we call <em>colorful_circle</em>. Yes, you are seeing it
right: it is the very same word we are teaching the turtle, but we are
subtracting 1 from the original <em>:size</em> for the word. This
completes our recursion. We use recursion in this example to decrease
the <em>:size</em> of the circle the turtle draws, and, when the
<em>:size</em> becomes 1, the turtle stops drawing.
</p>


<h3>Executing example.logo:</h3>

<pre class="code">
Welcome to Berkeley Logo version 5.6
? load "example.logo
? colorful_circle 200
</pre>

<p>
The above will give you the following output:
</p>

<p>
 <img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_33g8dhb9fw_b.png" alt="example.logo's output">

</p>


<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<p>
Are you confused yet? Probably not, but that doesn't mean the kids
will get it all at first, so don't get frustrated with them. They don't
need to be able to know recursion to discover Logo. I've said it before,
and I will say it again: enjoy your time with them, teach them the
basics, let them watch you code, let them pick colors, let them choose
shapes on their own, and hopefully someday they will realize that
programming and logical reasoning can be as much fun as things like
playing games or reading a book.
