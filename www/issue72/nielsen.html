<h3><a NAME="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
This article tries to accomplish the following:
<ol>
<li> Given a database design, create all the tables, sequences, stored
  procedures, views, backup tables, timestamps, and unique ids. 
</li>
<li> For the Perl language, create all the modules and sample perl scripts
   for a web server. 
</li>
<li>The database and webpages will assume there is user authentication. The
  users table, which will have a username and password for accounts, will be
  called "users". 
</li>
<li>Create all the "stuff" inbetween the database design and the sample 
 webpages. Thus, it relieves you of creating the database information, perl
  modules, and even provides sample web script code about how to access
  the database using the perl modules. All you need to do is manipulate 
  the perl scripts and customize them. 
</li>
<li>Remove the threat of the database administrators and non-programming
   web administrators strangling the life out of the programmers. Also,
   to make it possible for a novice programmer to setup the entire database, 
   perl modules, and sample perl scripts so that they can start
   to experiment and learn (this is going to be valuable at my advanced
   web/databases classes at eastmont.net).  
</li>
<li> To setup a Standard Database Setup, which I will use for all further
projects regardless of which database server and programming languages I use.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I have worked for many companies and many projects. Every one of them have
their own programming style and their own ways of doing things. Usually not
thought out very well because of pressure to get things out fast and
worry about the consequences later. Part 3 of Perl and PostgreSQL is dedicated
to me so that I will use a standard way of doing 
things with Perl and PostgreSQL
so that everything remains professional (a professional database structure, 
professional perl modules, and semi-professional sample perl scripts).
<p>
When everything is standardized with good code, everything becomes easy. 
Personally, I am not ever going to take on another project that doesn't use
a database system with standard stored procedures with 100% unique ids
in every table. I just won't take the job (I get enough job offers
as it is). I don't want to walk into an
unprofessional environment anymore (unless they agree to make it
professional). It wastes my time and their time. Bottom line. I am more
interested in business aspects of a company that requires programming
skills than to do the actual programming. 
I like to setup things up and do research
and development to improve things, but I want other people to do the dirty
work after I have done the R&amp;D. 
<p>
One large company that I worked for had great database design, but the perl
programmers were at the mercy of the database administrators. One unwieldy
popular database server is a nightmare to handle. Although I respected the
database administrators, I feel as though a true programmer should be in
charge of the database and the database administrator should be a guide rather
than a god. Programmers might not know how to handle the database properly,
but that is where the database admin comes in, to approve things, but not
to prevent things from getting done. I find it extremely frustrating to
fight with database administrators when they are suppose to serve the 
programmers. Network admins serve the database admins, database admins
serve the programmers, programmers serve their boss, their boss serves
the secretaries, accountants, customers, salespeople, 
and other people inside and outside
of the corporation. In other words, the only justification for the people
at the bottom is if they are serving the people at the top to help them
get their work done. Lord knows I have seen many computer geeks who just
didn't have a clue about how to run a business. Computer people are only
valuable if they accomplish goals that other people can use in the company. 
<p> 
Having said that rant about how I fight on a daily basis with database admins,
part 3 of Perl and PostgreSQL is also suppose to remove or severely
reduce the need of a database admin. My perl script deletes the tables, 
which if you have live data on a live server, can be a bad thing which you 
might need a database admin for. However, I backup all tables deleted
and I want to add the ability to repopulate data from one table to another
when columns get changed or added. With that, a database admin looses power to 
stranglehold a programmer from getting his work done, or more accurately,
if we can provide a professional system that a professional overpaid
database admin approves of, there will be less work for the overpaid
database admin and thus they become cheaper. With that said, overpaid
programmers can cause just as much problems as an overpaid database admin!
I just deal in a world where I install my operating system from scratch, 
I install Perl, Apache, Zope, Python, PostgreSQL, MySQL from scratch, 
and my end result is a pretty and/or functional webpage
that people can use. Anything below the webpage that causes me problems
to achieve my goal, whether it is the network admin, database admin, etc.
is an obstacle that needs to be removed. That is how I think. I have
great respect for all sorts of admins, but they serve the programmers, and
I can seen countless times how programmers get restricted and choked to know
when a company or department is in trouble. When network and database admins
make the programmers happy, everyone is happy (they also have to know how 
to prevent the programmers from running amok and put their foot down
when needed!). 
<p>
With standard exact stored procedures, views, sequences, unique ids, 
timestamps, active/inactive status for all tables, the database admin
should feel happy to let programmers design database tables as long as they
approve the final database result. Afterall, if my perl script sets up the
entire database, and the Perl modules to access the stored procedures
in the database, there is nothing for the database admin to do other than
approve database designs and make changes to the database design (because
the programmer probably 
doesn't know how to setup a good database). Also, the web
administrator can be a stranglehold if they are not a programmer. If the
web administrator limits the programmers to use the Perl modules
in accessing the database, then
a non-programming web administrator can feel comfortable to not strangle
the life out of a programmer. If everything is standardized, then the
immature novice programmer dot-com wannabe 
who doesn't know how to do good programming
and who knows nothing about installing operating systems or setting up
database and web servers, can at least have something to work with as
a standard so that they don't go off wild creating lots of interesting
uncommented archaic code just because there were "cool" ways of doing things. 
<p>
Bottom line, everybody involved can cause problems to get that Perl
script to work. This hopefully is a starting point to get things moving. 
There are a lot of things I want to add. I am happy with this being
called "Version 1". I am aiming for PHP, Python, and possibly JAVA
modules and webpages for Version 2, modifying tables (rather than deleting
them and recreating them) for lives systems for Version 3, 
and a GUI for Version 4 (though a GUI can be developed at the same time).   
<p>
Obviously, to get to get to version 4 is going to take a long time. 
It has taken me 4 months just to get this far. Most of my work is debating
with myself about what to do rather than actually doing work. In development,
you scrap lots of code because you figure out a better way of doing it, and
you also wish you can scrap more code. For now, I am consistently getting
rid of code I don't like and redoing it, which takes a little longer but yields
greater rewards, which is a completely different and refreshing mentality
compared to the dot-com boom where you had a non-programming manager over your
shoulder who just wanted to get things done no matter how horrible the code
and setup was. 

<h3><a NAME="SDS"></a>Standard Database Setup (SDS) </h3>
SDS is my creation about how to handle database systems. I already
know there are lots of things to add on and clarifications that I need
to do, but I will call this version one. At some point, I will have a link
to <a href="http://www.tcu-inc.com">www.tcu-inc.com</a> about further 
updates to my database system. In addition, I am going to call
my Perl Script and related material MAPPS, which will be located at
<a href="http://www.tcu-inc.com">www.tcu-inc.com</a> by October. I plan
on letting people execute MAPPS to create their web application online at
my website. Not that I want them to use the application on my website, just
to create it, test it, and then download it. 
If just one person wants to join with me at
creating a class act database system useable for all database needs, then
I will put it in sourceforge, or wherever, so that people can collaborate.
This system is really immature, and I haven't tried to 
read any documentation about
anything else that is similar. My SDS system is based on all the mistakes
and headaches I have witnessed over the years from myself and others. I am 
developing SDS to be used for any application and to create a consistent
interface so that no matter what the project, if you know SDS, you can easily
understand and add to the project. This greatly reduces the need for an 
overpaid programmer because you won't need to hire a programming god to
figure out lots of messy code (hopefully). 
<p>
The two options, using a table TABLENAME_diff and select stored procedures
are not done in my scripts. The reason, I just downloaded the beta version
of PostgreSQL 7.2, and I haven't messed around with stored procedures returning
multiple variables (or cursors). I am still using stored procedures that
can return only one variable. When PostgreSQL 7.2 is out, 
I will be able to make really
cool stored procedures that return lots of information. 
<p>
SDS version 1.0 is the following:
<pre>
Standard Database Setup (SDS) version 1.0. 
Copyright by Mark Nielsen, 9/2001. 

1. All tables must contain the following:
   a. A primary key equal to TABLENAME_id.
   b. Timestamps for the date of creation and modification, date_created
      and date_updated. 
   c. There will be a backup table named TABLENAME_backup. 
   d. All fields are lower case.
   e. An active field whose status of 0 is inactive and 1 is active. 
   f. All foreign keys must have the extension "_fk" except for fieldnames
      ending in "_id".
   g. All fieldnames with "_id" in the table definition will automatically
      get a foreign keys constraint. A fieldname of "TABLENAME_id" will
      have a foreign constraint to the table "TABLENAME" with its primary key
      "TABLENAME_id". 
   h. Views for active, inactive (deleted), and purged will be created. 
   i. Insert, Update, Delete, Copy, Change, Purge, Unpurge, PurgeOne, 
       and UnpurgeOne functions are too be used for all database 
       modifications where the functions will be 
       named "TABLENAME_FUNCTION_sql".     
   j. When stored procedures can return multiple variables, then all
      select statements will be executed through stored procedures as well. 
      All select stored procedures will end in "_select_sql".
      The two types of select stored procedures will be:
      1. Given a unique id number, the select statement will require
         all fields for that row. This stored procedures will be named
         "TABLENAME_select_sql". 
      2. All other select statements will be custom made. Select statements
         can get very complicated. It is mandatory that all custom select
         statements be created with custom stored procedures. 
   k. All modifications to any table will be recorded in "TABLENAME_backup".
      Modifications will occur through standard stored procedures and
      the stored procedures will handle recording of these modifications. 
      "backup_id" will the primary key of all backup tables.  
   l. All selects of tables will be recorded as an option using the table
      "TABLENAME_select" if it is desired when the table is created. 
      "TABLENAME_select" will have the fields select_id, date_created, 
      date_updated, TABLENAME_id, error_code, and misc.   
   m. An optional method for recording database inserts and changes
      with respect to differences may be used, but must follow the following
      standards. This will not be included by default in MAPPS. 
      1. The backup table must be named TABLENAME_diff.  
      2. "diff_id" will be the primary key for each table. 
      3. Each diff table will have exactly these fields.
         a. diff_id 
         b. date_updated : Timestamp the data was entered. 
         c. diff_data : This is the difference in data between this
            entry and the previous entry. 
         d. diff_method : This describes the difference method used.
             This is arbitrary and dependent upon the programmer. Here are
             a list of pre-defined methods:
            1. "diff" or "gnudiff" will correspond to GNU diff. The version
               must be supplied and recorded somewhere. 
            2. "subversion" in relation to subversion. 
            3. cvs will not be an option for a standard. "subversion" replaces
               cvs, and hence, by the time SDS is really solid, subversion
               from subversion.org will be ready. 
         e. diff_prev : This is the previous diff_id which the data is 
            being compared to. This is done so that if a diff_id gets
            deleted, you can state there is an error. 
         f. fieldname : This is the field of the row which the data
            belongs to.  
         g. primary : This is the primary key of the row we are looking at. 
         h. error_code : "start" means there is no diff_id previous
            to this one. "diff" means there is a previous entry to
            be compared to. "stop" means the primary key has been deleted. 
            Other error codes are possible. 
   n. An entry of 0 into a foreign key means null. All rows with a primary
      key of 0 should have empty space for text and 0 for numeric values
      or the default value (if supplied). 

2. The unique names which cannot be used are:
   a. "error_code", "backup_id", "date_created", "date_updated",
      , "diff_id" and "active" are reserved fields. 

3. Standard practices with Perl Modules and other programming languages. 
   a. All Perl Modules (or other programming languages) will create
      objects whose methods correspond to each stored procedure. The naming
      convention of each method shall be exactly the sql function name minus
      the tablename and "_sql". Thus, "TABLENAME_FUNCTION_sql" becomes
      "FUNCTION" in the Perl Module. There will be an exact one to one
      correspondence between all sql functions and perl methods, minus
      custom made sql functions or perl methods. 
    b. All custom made perl methods must use stored procedures for all
       changing of data, and selecting data (when stored procedures
       can return multiple variables). 
     
4. Standard practices of custom stored procedures.
   a. All custom stored procedures may only change data using one of the
      predefined stored procedures. Custom stored procedures may not
      use custom made stored procedures for changing/inserting data. 
   b. All select statements must use select stored procedures (when the
      stored procedures can return multiple values). 

5. Standard practices of webpages/perl scripts.
   a. All perl scripts or other programming languages will always
      use perl modules for all interactivity with database. All changing,
      inserting, or viewing data will occur through a module.

<h3><a NAME="perl"></a>
Perl script to setup my SDS environment with Perl and PostgreSQL</h3>
Here is a link to the perl script and generic files I use, 
<a href="misc/nielsen/Files.tgz">Files.tgz</a>. You may also access the uncompressed
files by going to my <a href="misc/nielsen/Test">Test</a> directory. 
Download this file into an empty directory on your Linux system. 
Please have a running PostgreSQL 7.1 database running on your computer
which you have access to. Then, follow the instructions below. 
<ol>
<li> Install PostgresSQL 7.1, the Apache webserver, setup the Apache
  webserver to use persistent databases connections, make the Apache
  webserver execute *.pl files as perl scripts,  
  install the Perl modules
  DBI, DBD::Pg, and BlowFish. If you have trouble with this, please look
  at the references section located in this article. </li>

<li> "cd" into the directory where you downloaded these two files
 and execute these commands. 
<pre>
tar -zxvf Files.tgz
mv misc/nielsen/Test /tmp/
cd /tmp/Test/
mv Create_Functions.pl.txt Create_Functions.pl
chmod 755 Create_Functions.pl
</pre>
</li>
<li> Now in theory, you are ready to go. I have provided a sample database
called "sample". You must change two Config.txt files. One located in 
the <a href="misc/nielsen/Test/Config.txt">main
directory</a>, and another located in the 
<a href="misc/nielsen/Test/sample/Config.txt">directory "sample"</a>. I have setup
certain web variables to point to /usr/local/apache which would be the 
standard installation of apache when you download and install it from 
scratch. If you are using apache that comes with your Linux distribution, 
please change the variables in those two files. 
In theory, all you have to do to get your database setup 
and use the webpages is to execute the one command 
<pre>
/tmp/Test/Create_Functions.pl sample
</pre>
and then go to the webpage
<a href="http://127.0.0.1/sample/sample/index.html">
http://127.0.0.1/sample/sample/index.html</a> on your computer.
</ol> 
<p>
Just in case you can't get the perl script to execute, here is the output
of the SQL commands, Perl modules, and web scripts. 
<ol>
<li><a href="misc/nielsen/sql">SQL commands</a>
<li><a href="misc/nielsen/modules">Perl Modules</a>

<h3><a NAME="conclusions"></a>Conclusions</h3>
At long last, I have finally achieved a system that uses all free software
and does 90% of the work for me when I give it a list of database tables. 
Also, my entire system is as systematic and tries to reuse code, thus it
is very easy for me to understand how to use the sql procedures, perl methods,
and perl scripts since they all use the same code and all are used the same
way. I find out that by taking a hard stance at making things systematic, 
things actually become very easy to do, easy to understand, easy to modify, 
and easy to add on to. The key is to find out what is being used more than 
once and then replicating that process. 
<p> 
I am very happy with my system. I can now pump out webpages like crazy.
I no longer have to worry about what goes on in the middle, since it is
all taken care of. I know of tons of things I would like to get done, change,
add on, but I try to do the most important things first. Plus, it takes a while
to think through problems because I often ask myself "do I really want to do 
that?" which takes up time. 
<p>
I hope this lets you create webpages fast and relieves a lot of stress at
developing your web/database system. My goals in the future are to have
this Perl script create Php and Python code as well and to create a nice GUI
interface (either web-based or Xwindows independent) to handle creating
your database, checking for errors, generating reports, creating graphs, 
alter the database, etc. I see lots of systems out there that can do this,
but I don't want a GNOME or KDE dependent interface. In my opinion, a nice
Python/TK solution would be cool since you can compile Python and it will run
under any XWindows environment. I want it to be useable by all, not just those
who run GNOME or KDE. Plus, Python can output JAVA code, which may be useful. 
Also, I don't see other systems that try to force an implementation of
standard ways of doing things. My (or our) gui interface will enforce
the use of SDS or some other standard way of doing things. One thing I want to
reiterate is: I want future versions to create PHP and Python modules and
scripts. Why is this so important? It lets you change programming languages
rapidly which can be really useful if you want to use one language for all
needs (trust me, it is a headache to support multiple languages). If your
programmer is an idiot, and the next guy who you want to hire uses a different
programming language, guess what! No Problem! Again, my goal is to reduce
the cost of having database administrators, network administrators, and
programmers. Anything that is a bottleneck must go. If you don't advance your
own skills to meet new challenges, you deserve to fall behind. I want my 
system to push the good guys forward and leave the bad guys in the dust.  
<p>
The stuff I do here should be really easy to use with Mason, ASP, or other
cool ways of making webpages. 
In ASP and Mason, you don't want to use the CGI module, so you can replace
it with their own query handling methods. One thing I stress again, is the
use of creating objects and concepts. Since I put all the good code into
perl modules, they become useable to Mason, ASP, or whatever method you use
to make webpages. By trying to create code that can be used under all
circumstances, I hope to be able to use this stuff no matter where I go. 
I am thinking about my career and trying to reduce obstacles. I hope this
makes sense! Enjoy! 
<p>
P.S. I got heat for claiming the database administrators serve the programmers.
I still claim it is true. The database administrator has no final product. 
The final product occurs with the programmer, who needs a web server (managed
by the web admin), a database (managed by the database admin), and
a network (managed by the network admin). In turn, that final product is given
to the programmers boss, which is given to the customers or employees. Bottom
line, there is a chain of support, and I view customers and employees at the
top, and the computer geeks at the bottom. Anybody that you need to get your
product done is a facilitator and is below you, even if they have more
authority and they get paid more than you. Granted though, they must set
reasonable guidelines and prevent the programmer from doing stupid things.
