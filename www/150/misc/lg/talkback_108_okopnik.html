   hello, this is directed towards Ben, i just read his review of how the
   5400 series worked with linux, honestly most of it was over my head, i
   didnt really know what he was talking about with all the technical stuff.
   having said that, i own an averatec 5400 series laptop, and have had it
   for 3.5 years and i love it. i am interested in starting to use linux and
   have tried several distros and cant get them to work. which one would he
   recommend to a non technophile like me who just hates windows and is
   willing to learn to program if i have to, but dont really have the time. i
   used to program in machine language, basic, and fortran77, but was a
   beginner. i have long since forgotten those things a lifetime ago.im
   looking for a distro i can install and be relatively easy to use and will
   function well on this machine. i want to set up a dual boot system with
   windows/linux. any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you.

Well, I'm not Ben, but I'll toss out a recommendation that you try
Ubuntu.  There are some some variations within that branch of a Linux
distro mainly to give a choice of the GUI that will install.  My
personal preference is KUbuntu, which will install the KDE desktop /
window manager.  Plain old Ubuntu will install the Gnome interface,
which is preferred by some people.
</p>

<p>
XUbuntu carries a lighter weight GUI than either KDE or Gnome, so will
run faster, and demand less memory resources from your machine.  The
nice thing about the install CD's for these flavors is that, AFAIK,
all have the ability to boot and run right from the CD without having
to install it.  That's mainly for purposes of suitability testing,
i.e. to give a glimpse at the UI and test for how well it will detect
the devices on your machine.
</p>

<p>
If you don't want to fuss around too much tweaking the system
configuration after installation, then Ubuntu can give you a system
that won't require that much invested time.  It usually does a pretty
good job of setting itself up to leverage the power management
features on laptops, which makes it a consideration Linux users of all
experience levels.  But of course, as with just about all Linux
distros, it is very customizable, and there is virtually no limits to
how you can tailor it to your personal tastes.

Hi, Edward -
</p>

<p>
That's to be expected, since this is a technical publication in a
technical field. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> I'm glad that you found it useful, in any case.
</p>

<p>
For a guy who claims to be all techno-non-savvy, you sure do sling
around terms like "dual boot" and "distro" like an old hand! <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> As
someone else here said earlier, Ubuntu is pretty good for beginners -
and works well for professionals also. There are many other distros,
including quite a few that you can run without installing (e.g.,
Knoppix, or Puppy Linux); I find that for many people starting with one
of those is less intimidating for just trying things out.
</p>

<p>
I'd like to correct one common misapprehension, though: you don't have
to learn to program in order to use Linux. in fact, the skills you need
to use it are the same ones that you need for using Windows. Not exactly
the same - for one thing, you don't have to learn how to remove viruses
and spyware, or to recover files destroyed by those - but using the GUI,
etc., is going to be a familiar experience.
</p>

<p>
The difference is, if you <em>want</em> to learn to program, or run your own
webserver, or get into any technical aspect of computing that you're
interested in, Linux also makes that available and easy. It doesn't cost
you a fortune, you don't have to agree to horrendous legal restrictions,
you <strong>do</strong> own the software that you produce - and you have access to a
community of people who have a tradition of sharing expertise and
information freely.
</p>

<p>
So, come on in. The water really is fine.

I don't know when they started including the feature, but the CD I
installed from (Ubuntu 7.04) was also a runtime OS. I.e., at some
point during initialization, the user is presented with a dialog box
to choose installation vs. just running it.  Presumably 7.10 functions
that way as well.
</p>

<p>
I will note that I've read comments which assert that 7.10 seems to
suffer some hardware compatibility issues not seen in the earlier
7.04.

Its a live CD - Ie you can run it by booting of the CD to test
hardware etc then run the installer off an icon on the desktop.

Never heard of it doing it the way you describe ;)

Actually, I think it's time we counter the hoary "you have to be a
programmer to use Linux" farrago with a far more credible counter-meme:
You really <em>must</em> be a programmer to stand a chance of not being
horribly frustrated by MS-Windows.
</p>

<p>
Consider how many times we've heard from MS-Windows users that the poor
security architecture, corruption-prone registry, spyware-infested
proprietary software marketplace, fragile and fragmentation-tending
filesystems, and so on have driven them to utter distraction.
Obviously, the only effective counter-move must be to be an expert
programmer within that environment, such that you have even a prayer of
being able to protect your own code and data in a stable environment.

Actually, even that won't help much: no matter how good of a builder you
are, your house will <strong>still</strong> sink if it's built on top of a swamp. But
you're right to this degree: in a losing scenario like that one, being a
programmer can lessen the pain even if it won't change the outcome.
</p>

<p>
The killer factor is that you can't get the source code - and even if
you could, you're legally prohibited from changing it. Game, set, and
match.
