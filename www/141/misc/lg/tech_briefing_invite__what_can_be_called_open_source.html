[Forwarding Ben's private mail, with commentary, at his invitation.]
</p>

<p>
As a reminder, Centric CRM, Inc. has recently been one of the most
problematic of the ASP/Web firms abusing the term "open source" for
their products, in part because their flagship product (Centric CRM)
has been notorious during most of this past year as the <em>most</em> clearly
and unambiguously proprietary software to be offered with the ongoing
public claim of being "open source".
</p>

<p>
I'd call this (below-cited) PR campaign blitz -- apparently, they're
intensively hitting reporters known to be following this matter --
really good news, though it has to be read attentively:
<pre class="code">
o  Former OSI General Counsel Larry Rosen's "OSL 3.0" licence is a
   really good, excellently designed, genuine copyleft licence that is
   especially well suited for ASP use, because it's one of the very 
   few that have a clause enforcing copyleft concepts within the 
   otherwise problematic ASP market.  (In ASP deployments, there is
   ordinarily no <em>distribution</em> of the code, so the copyleft provisions
   of most copyleft licences such as GPLv2 have no traction, and are
   toothless.)  Also, as Centric CRM, Inc. is keen to point out, OSL
   3.0 is an OSI-certified open source licence.
  
o  At the same time, the careful observer will note that this 
   announcement concerns the product "Centric Team Elements v. 0.9",
   which is <em>not</em> (yet?) the firm's flagship product.  That flagship
   product remains the entirely separate -- and very, very clearly
   proprietary, product "Centric CRM v. 4.1", which one wryly notices
   has been carefully omitted completely from this communique.
 
   Just in case there is any doubt about Centric CRM 4.1's proprietary
   status, here's one key quotation from the product brochure, about
   the applicable licence, "Centric Public Licence (CRM)":  "The major 
   restriction is that users may not redistribute the the Centric CRM 
   source code."
</pre>
Now, it may be that the Centric CRM product is on the way out, and that
Centric Team Elements (with genuine open source licence) will be taking
its place.  Or maybe not.  Either way:  
</p>

<p>
The bad news, but perhaps not too bad, is that Centric CRM, Inc. has
spent this past year to date falsely and misleadingly claiming that its
product line is open source -- and deflecting critics by claiming that
the term "open source" is (paraphrasing) subject to redefinition and
needn't be limited to what OSI (inventer of that term in the software
context, and standard body) defines it to be.  That misleading and
deceptive language is still very much a prominent part of the company's
pronouncements to this day, remains on the Web site, and doesn't seem to
be disappearing.
</p>

<p>
The good news is that the firm appears to be sensitive to the public
relations problem it created for itself, and <em>may</em> be taking steps to
fix it.
</p>

Hello Ben &amp; Kat
</p>

<p>
We'd like to invite you to a briefing with CentricCRM's EVP, Michael
Harvey to discuss a new product and the recent debate about what can be
called open source  - please see the two press releases below.
</p>

<pre>
  *  CentricCRM is a leading developer of open source Customer
    Relationship Management (CRM) technology. The new product, Centric
    Team Elements, will bring `Enterprise 2.0' capabilities to businesses
    of all sizes - giving them capabilities for project management, issue
    tracking, document repositories and discussion forums.
  * Also in light of the recent open source licensing debate, started last
    Thursday with a blog post from Dana Blankenhorn (and discussed by
    Michael Tiemann, president of OSI), Michael would also like to speak
    to you about their new, approved OSI license.
</pre>
Would you like to schedule a phone briefing with Michael?  Do let myself
or my colleagues Hazel or James (details below) know!
</p>

<p>
Kind regards
</p>

 Centric CRM makes its first release under an OSI-approved open source license
 
 - Centric Team Elements is available now for download under the Open Software
 License (OSL 3.0), one of the open source licenses approved by the Open Source
                               Initiative (OSI) -
 
   NORFOLK, VA - June 28, 2007 - Centric CRM, a leading developer of open
   source Customer Relationship Management (CRM) technology, has today
   released its new Centric Team Elements (see separate announcement)
   application under an open source license approved by the Open Source
   Initiative. This is the first time Centric CRM has used such a license,
   which grants customers and developers greater freedom over how they use
   and deploy their software, including giving them the right to reproduce
   it, modify it, redistribute modifications and bundle the software with
   other applications.
 
   Centric Team Elements is the first complete, open source, Java-based
   Enterprise 2.0 product. It ties together discussions, wikis, blogs, RSS
   feeds, issue tracking and trouble-ticketing, project management, document
   management, and federated search in a single, unified application running
   on a relational database. Centric Team Elements version 0.9 is immediately
   available as a preview release, and is already in use by commercial
   customers. A Community Edition of Centric Team Elements is available for
   download under the Open Software License (OSL 3.0), one of the open source
   licenses approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). There is also an
   Enterprise Edition that offers additional functionality, and comes with
   technical support and other benefits that are included as part of an
   annual subscription contract.
 
   "Companies such as Centric CRM are creating successful business models
   that allow them to deliver the benefits of open source to their business
   customers," said Lawrence Rosen, the attorney who created the OSL 3.0
   license, and author of the book `Open Source Licensing: Software Freedom
   and Intellectual Property Law.'
 
   He adds: "I created the OSL 3.0 license to be in full compliance with the
   OSI's Open Source Definition, and also to encourage innovative commercial
   vendors to succeed. The simple yet legally precise language in the
   OSI-approved OSL 3.0 license encouraged Centric to develop its own
   innovative business model for its applications, and it allows Centric to
   participate fully as a software vendor in the open source community. I am
   very pleased that Centric has chosen OSL 3.0 for its new product, Centric
   Team Elements."
 
   "We have selected the OSL 3.0 license for Centric Team Elements as it is
   the right decision for our community, our customers and our business, said
   David Richards, chief executive officer, Centric CRM.  "We will continue
   to choose the most appropriate licenses for our products and we are
   dedicated to the mission of delivering innovation and value to our
   customer base while ensuring they have control, protection and peace of
   mind."
 
   Richards continued, "Open source is about a range of business and
   operating practices. Our source code has always been available to anyone
   who wants to download and use it free of charge.  We grant customers and
   commercial partners unlimited rights to modify our products and we
   currently support a completely open community of more than 10,000
   registered users and developers.."

  Centric CRM redefines "Enterprise 2.0" with release of Centric Team Elements
 
Discussions, blogs, wikis, RSS and more seamlessly integrated with front office
                                   CRM system
 
 - Available for download under the Open Software License (OSL 3.0), one of the
      open source licenses approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) -
 
   NORFOLK, VA - June 28, 2007 -Centric CRM, a leading developer of open
   source Customer Relationship Management (CRM) technology, has released a
   preview version of its new Centric Team Elements suite, which will bring
   `Enterprise 2.0' capabilities to businesses of all sizes. The term
   `Enterprise 2.0' describes the business use of social networking and Web
   2.0 tools such as blogs, wikis and RSS feeds. Centric Team Elements goes
   well beyond the "standard" definition of Enterprise 2.0 to include project
   management, issue tracking, document repositories and discussion forums,
   in a way that could redefine a generation's way of working.
 
   Centric Team Elements is the first complete, open source, Java-based
   Enterprise 2.0 product. It ties together discussions, wikis, blogs, RSS
   feeds, issue tracking and trouble-ticketing, project management, document
   management, and federated search in a single, unified application running
   on a relational database. Centric Team Elements is the only team
   collaboration product to offer all of these capabilities within a single
   application.
 
   Like Centric CRM, the company's best-of-breed open source CRM program
   which is used by some of the world's largest companies, Team Elements is
   enterprise class and offers scalability, role-based permissions and secure
   access as well as all of the benefits of unstructured collaboration.
   Because Centric Team Elements shares the same architecture as Centric CRM,
   it can seamlessly integrate Enterprise 2.0 features with a company's front
   office operations.
 
   Centric Team Elements users can create departmental discussion forums,
   wikis and blogs; maintain document repositories with literature and
   presentations; set up and track detailed project plans; and establish RSS
   feeds with departmental news. Individual employees can then subscribe to
   those feeds, create their own blogs, submit complaints and issues, and
   provide ratings and reviews of the various services and components
   delivered by the system. Since all of this content is fully indexed,
   companies will be able to search for and find corporate information with
   the same ease and high rates of success that are now the norm on the Web.
   "Centric Team Elements has allowed us to implement a slew of best
   practices around how our management and employees collaborate on a daily
   basis," said William Yu, senior vice president, Information Systems, for
   the Panda Restaurant Group.
 
   Externally, Centric Team Elements can be deployed as a customer-facing,
   community-management system which can support a company's efforts to
   generate "viral marketing" within its community of stakeholders. Public
   users will be able to subscribe to company RSS feeds and blogs, browse and
   contribute to wikis, rate products and services, submit issues and
   complaints, and interact with other customers and stakeholders. Centric
   Team Elements scales to support tens of thousands of users and already
   powers the Centric CRM community of 10,000 registered users as well as the
   community site of the Open Solutions Alliance
   (www.opensolutionsalliance.org).
 
   By combining internal and external networking, Centric Team Elements makes
   seamless communication possible from consumer, through the business to the
   employee and back again. A customer, for example, might find a particular
   employee's blog worth subscribing to; and an employee might find a
   particular customer or customer segment's ratings useful.
 
   "Years ago, email introduced a drastic change to the way people conducted
   business and business relationships. The unified, comprehensive nature of
   our open source Centric Team Elements product will bring about a similar
   change, and make social networking and community management a key part of
   everyday business interaction," said David Richards, chief executive
   officer, Centric CRM. "Today's preview release clearly shows how we will
   integrate community tools like blogs and wikis with business processes
   like project management and issue tracking in a single application."
 
   Pricing, Licensing and Availability
 
   Centric Team Elements version 0.9 is immediately available and is already
   in use by commercial customers. The product is available as a hosted
   Software as a Service (SaaS) application with low monthly user-based
   pricing. A Community Edition of Centric Team Elements is available for
   download under the Open Software License (OSL 3.0), one of the open source
   licenses approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). The Enterprise
   Edition offers additional functionality and comes with technical support
   and other benefits that are included as part of an annual subscription
   contract. Subscriptions are priced in 10-user blocks for small and
   mid-sized companies, with an unlimited server edition available for larger
   enterprises or external community deployments. The 1.0 production release
   of the product will be available during the third quarter.
