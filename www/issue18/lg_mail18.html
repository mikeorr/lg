Subject: Help wanted: 2.1.40 will not boot<br>
From: Duncan Simpson, <a href="mailto:D.P.Simpson@ecs.soton.ac.uk">D.P.Simpson@ecs.soton.ac.uk</a><br>

<p>2.1.40 dies after displaying the message
Checking whether the WP bit is honored even in supervisor mode...

<p>A few prints hacked in later reveals that in enters the page
fault handler, detects the bootup test and gets to the end of the
C (do_fault in traps.c). However it never gets back to continue
booting---exactly where it gets lost is obscure.

<p>Anyone have any ideas/fixes?

Subject: CD-ROMs<br>
From: James S Humphrye, <a href="mailto:humpjs@aur.alcatel.com">humpjs@aur.alcatel.com</a>

<p>I just found the LG today, and I have read most of the back issues...
Great job so far! Lots of really useful info in here!

<p>Now to my "problem". I installed Slackware 3.0, which went just fine.
I had XFree86 and all the goodies working perfectly (no, really, it all
worked just great!) Then I upgraded my machine to a P150, and installed
a Trident 9660) PCI video card. Then the X server wasn't happy any more.
So...I upgraded the kernel sources to 2.0.29, got all the required
upgrades for GCC, etc. I built a new kernel, and it was up and
running...sort of.

<p>Despite having compiled in support for both IDE and SCSI CDROMs, I can
only get the IDE one to work. I have edited the rc.* scripts, launched
kerneld, run depmod -s, and all the other things the docs recommend.

<p>I have rebuilt the kernel to zdisk about 25 times, trying different
combinations of built-in and module support, all to no avail. When the 
system boots, the scsi host adapter is not detected (it is an AHA1521,
located on a SB16/SCSI-2 sound card, and it worked fine under 1.2.13 &
1.3.18 kernels)  When the aha152x module tries to load, it says it does
not recognize scd0 as a block device. If I try to mount the SCSI unit,
it says "init_module: device or resource busy". Any advice would be
welcome. What I want is to at least be able to use the SCSI CDROM under
Linux, or better yet, both it and the IDE CDROM...

<p>There are also a bunch of messages generated by depmod about unresolved
symbols that I don't understand, as well as a bunch of lines generated
by modprobe that say "cannot locate block-major-XX" (XX is a major
number, and the ones I see are for devices not installed or supported by
the kernel) The second group of messages may be unimportant, but I don't
know..

<p>Thanks in advance,
Steve

Subject: Need Help From Linux Gazette<br>
From: Scott L. Colantonio, <a href="mailto:scott@burbank.k12.ca.us">scott@burbank.k12.ca.us</a>

<p>Hi...

We have Linux boxes located at the remote schools and the district
office.  All remote school clients (Mac, WinNT, Linux) attempting to
access the district office Linux boxes experience a 75 second delay on
each transaction.  On the other hand, we do not experience any delay
when district office clients (Mac, WinNT, Linux) attempt to access the
remote school Linux boxes.  The delay began when we moved all the remote
school clients to a separate network (and different ISP) than the
district office servers.

<p>To provide a map, consider this:

<p>remote school &lt;-&gt; city hall
city hall &lt;-&gt; Internet
Internet &lt;-&gt; district office

<p>We experience a 75 second delay:  
remote school client -&gt; city hall -&gt; Internet -&gt; District office Linux
box

<p>We do not experience any delay:
remote school client -&gt; city hall -&gt; Internet

<p>We do not experience any delay:
city hall -&gt; Internet -&gt; District office Linux box

<p>We do not experience any delay:
District office client -&gt; Internet -&gt; city hall -&gt; remote school Linux
box

...

<p>The remote schools use a Linux box at City Hall for the DNS.

<p>In effect, the problem is isolated to the remote school clients
connecting to the district office Linux boxes, just one hop away from
city hall.

<p>As a result, the mail server is now a 75 second delay away from all
educators in our district.  Our Cisco reps do not think, after extensive
tests, that this is a router configuration problem.

<p>I setup a Microsoft Personal web server at the district office to test
if the delay was universal to our route.  Unfortunately, there was no
delay when remote school clients attempted to access the MS web server.

<p>Is this a known Linux network problem? Why is this a one-way problem?

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: inetd<br> 
From: Toby Reed, <a href="mailto:toby@eskimo.com">toby@eskimo.com</a> 

<p>I have a question for the inetd buffs out there...perhaps something like
xinetd or a newer version has the capability to do the job, but what I
want is this:

<pre>normal behavior:
connect to inetd
look in /etc/inetd.conf
run program

enhanced behavior:
connect to inetd
find out what hostname used to connect to inetd
look in /etc/inetd.conf.hostname if it exists, if not, use /etc/inetd.conf
run program listed in /etc/inetd.conf
</pre>
<p>So if dork1.bob.com has the same IP address as dork2.bob.com, inetd would
still be able to distinguish between them. In other words, similar to the
VirtualHost directive in Apache that allows you to make virtual hosts that
have the same IP address, except that with inetd.

<p>Or, depending on the hostname used to access inetd, inetd could forward
the request to another address.

<p>This would be extremely useful in many limited-budget cases where a
multitude of IPs are not available. For example, in combination with IP
masquerading, would allow a lan host to be accessed transparently both
ways on all ports, so long as it was accessed by a hostname, not an IP
address. No port masquerading or proxies would be required unless the
service needed was very very special. Even non-inetd httpd servers would
work with this kind of redirection because the forwarded connection would
still be handled by httpd on the machine with the masqueraded machine.

<p>Anyone know if this already exists or want to add to it so I can suggest
it to the inetd group?

<p>-Toby

Subject: S3 Virge Video Board<br>
From: Tim Gray & Family, <a href="mailto:timgray@lambdanet.com">timgray@lambdanet.com</a>

<p>I have a Linux box using a S3 Virge video board with 4 meg Ram.  The
problem is that X refuses to start with no other color depth than 8bpp.  As
X is annoying at 8bpp (Color flashing on every window and several programs
complain about no free colors) Is there a way to FORCE X to start in 16
bpp?   using the command ....   startx -bpp 16 does not work and erasing
the 8bpp entry in the XF86Config file causes X to self destruct. Even
changing the Depth from 8 to 16 causes errors..  Anyone have experience
with this X server?

about a year now and love the H*** out of it. About two weeks ago I was
testing some HD's I picked up used with this nifty plug and play bios I
got and when I went to restore the system back to normal and now my
CD-Rom does not work in Linux...I booted back into 95 and it still
worked so I tried forcing the darn thing nothing, nada , zero. I booted
with the install disks and still no CD-Rom...its on the 2nd eide set for
cable select I tried removing the 2nd hard drive and moving it there
still nothing....can anyone give me some more suggestions to try?

Subject: Programming in C++<br>
From: Chris Walker, <a href="mailto:crwalker@cc.weber.edu">crwalker@cc.weber.edu</a><br>

<p>Hi, I'm Chris Walker.  I'm an undergrad computer science major at Weber
State University. During my object oriented programming class Linux was
brought up. The question was asked "if c++ is so good for programs that
are spread over different files or machines, why are Linux and Unix
programmed in c not c++?"
I was hoping that you may have an answer.  Has anyone converted Linux
source to c++, would there be any advantages/disadvantages?

<p>Thanks,

Chris Walker

Subject: Programming Serial Ports<br>
From: Celestino Rey Lopez, <a href="mailto:claude@idecnet.com">claude@idecnet.com</a><br>

<p>First of all congratulations for your good job in the Linux Gazette.
I'm interested in programming the serial ports in order to get data from other computers or devices. In other
Unixes it is possible, via ioctl, to ask the driver to inform a process with a signal every time a character is
ready in the port. For example, in HP-UX, the process receive a SIGIO signal.
In Linux SIGIO means input/output error. Do you know where can I get information about this matter? Is there
any books talking about that?

<p>Thanks in advance and thanks for providing the Linux community with lot of tricks, ideas and information about
this amazing operating system.

<p>Yours,

Celestino Rey Lopez.

Subject: Response to VGA-16 Server in LG Issue 17<br>
From: Andrew Vanderstock, <a href="mailto:Andrew.van.der.Stock@member.sage-au.org.au">Andrew.van.der.Stock@member.sage-au.org.au</a><br>

<p>I'll look into it, even though VGA_16 has a very short life. Yes, he is
correct, there isn't much in the way of testing dual headedness with a herc
card and VGA16, as both are getting quite long in the tooth. VGA_16
disappears in a few months to reappear as the argument -bpp 4 on most
display adapters. One bug fixer managed to re-enable Herc support in the
new source tree a while back, so there may be life there yet. 

<p>Also, there was one 2c issue that was a little out of whack in regards to
linear addressing. The Cirrus chipsets are not fabulous, but many people
have them built into their computers (laptops, HP PC's etc). 

<p>All I can suggest is that he try startx -- -bpp 16 and see if that works.
If it doesn't have a look at the release notes for his chipset. If all else
fails, report any XFree bugs to the bug report cgi on www.xfree86.org

<p>I'll ask the powers that be if I can write an article for you on XFree86
3.3, the next version of the current source tree, as it is due soon. How
many words are your articles generally?

Subject: Secure Anonymous FTP setup mini-howto spotted, then lost<br>
From: Alan Bailward, <a href="mailto:ajb@direct.ca">ajb@direct.ca</a>

<p>I saw once on a friend of mines linux box, running Slackware 3.1, in
/usr/docs/faq/HOWTO/mini, a mini-howto on how to setup a secure anonymous
FTP server.  It detailed how to setup all the directories, permissions, and
so on, so you could upload, have permissions to write but not delete on
your /incoming, etc etc etc.  It looked like a great doc, but for the life
of me I can't find it!  I've looked on the slackware 3.2 cdrom, the 3.1
cdrom, searched all through the net, but to no avail.  As I am trying to
setup an anonymous ftp site now, this would be invaluable... I'd feel much
better reading it than 'chmod 777'ing all over the place :)

<p>If anyone has seen this document, or knows where it is, please let me know.
 Or even if there is another source of this type of information, I would
sure appreciate it sent to me at <a href="mailto:ajb@direct.ca">ajb@direct.ca</a>

<p>Thanks a lot, and keep on Linuxing!

Subject: Tuning XFree86<br>
From: Soh Kam Yung, <a href="mailto:kysoh@ctlsg.creaf.com">kysoh@ctlsg.creaf.com</a>

<p>I've been reading Linux Gazette since day one and it has been great.
Keep up the good work.

<p>I've been seeing comments and letters in the Gazette from people who are
having trouble with their XFree86.  Well, here's a tip for those not satisfied
with the way their screen looks (offset to one side, too high/wide, etc.).

<p>While looking through the XFree86 web site for tips on how to tweak my
XF86 configuration, I noticed a reference to a program called xvidtune.
Not many people may have heard about it, but it is a program used to
tune your video modes.  Among its features include:
<ol>
<li>the ability to modify your graphics screen 'on-the-fly'.  You can
move the screen, strech/compress it vertically or horizontally and see
the results.

<li>it can generate a modeline of the current screen setting.  Just copy
it into the correct area of your XF86Config file and the next time you
start up the XFree86 server, the screen will come up the way you like it.
</ol>
<p>Just run xvidtune and have fun with it!  But be careful: as with XFree86
in general, it does not guarantee that the program will not burn your
monitor by generating invalid settings.  Fortunately, it has a quick
escape (press 'r' to restore your previous screen settings).

Subject: Certification and training courses for Linux<br> 
From: Harry Silver, <a href="mailto:hsilver@pyx.net">hsilver@pyx.net</a>

<p>I am currently on a mailing list for consultants for
Red Hat Linux. One of my suggestions to that list is
contained below. I truly hope as part of a broader
international initiative, Linux International will
pick up the ball on this one so as to ensure that
Linux generically will survive. I truly hope that
someone from your organization will follow up both
with myself and with the Red Hat consulting mailing
list as to a more generic Linux support effort in this 
area. All that would be required is gathering up the 
manuals from the older Unixware CNE course and 'porting'
them to Linux and creating an HTMLized version. This 
along with online testing could easily generate a reasonable 
revenue stream for the generic Linux  group involved.

<p>Respectfully,

<p>MY SUGGESTION:
About two years ago, Novell still had Unixware before
sending it over to the care of SCO. At the time Unix 
was under the stewardship of Novell, a Unixware CNE course
was developed. Since, Ray Noorda of Caldera and former CEO 
of Novell is also an avid supporter of Linux as well as the 
good folks at Red Hat and other distributions, rather than 
RE-INVENT the wheel so to speak, wouldn't it make more sense 
to pattern certification AFTER the Unixware CNE courses by 
'porting' the course to Linux GENERICALLY ?

<p>Hello.

I did duplicate my Hard disk before you release this articles for it. A
friend of mine new to linux tried to do it, too using your instructions.
But we discovered, when he copied my root partition, that he couldn't
compile anything on his computer afterwards. A bug in libc.so.5.2.18
prevented his old 8 MB Machine from runnig make or gcc. it always
aborted with an error. After updating libc.so5.2.18 and running ldconfig
the problem was solved.

<p>We had a SuSe 4.0 installation.

Subject: Re: X Color Depth<br>
From: Roland Smith, <a href="mailto:rsmit06@ibm.net">rsmit06@ibm.net</a><br>

<p>In response to Michael J. Hammel's 2cent tip in issue #17: 
I disagree that a 16bit display displays less colors than a 8 bit display.
 
<p>Both kinds of displays use a colormap. A color value is nothing more than
an index into a color map, which is an array of red,green,blue triplets,
each 8 bits.
The amount of colors that can be shown simultaneously depends on the
graphics hardware.

<p>An 8bit display has an eight bit color value, so it can maximally have 256
different color values. The color map links these to 256 different
colors which can be displayed simultaneously. Each of these 256 colors can
be one of the 2^24 different colors possible with the 3*8 bits in each
colormap entry (or color cell, as it is called).

<p>A 16bit display has a sixteen bit color value, which can have 2^16=65536
different values. The colormap links these to 65535 different,
simultaneously visible, colors (out of 2^24 possible colors).
(actually it's a bit more difficult than this, but thats beyond the
 point).
 
<p>So both a 8 and 16 bit display can show 2^24=16.7*10^6 colors. The
difference lies in the number of colors they can show *at once*.

<p>Regards, Roland

From: Omegaman, <a href="mailto:omegam@COMMUNIQUE.NET">omegam@COMMUNIQUE.NET</a><br>

<p><I>I read your question in Linux Gazette regarding an X limitation to 8 bit 
color when the system has more that 14 megs of RAM. Where did you find that
information? I ask because my system has 24 megs of RAM, and I run 16 bit
color all the time. One difference between our 
systems is that I am using a Diamond Stealth 64 video card.</I>

<p>Gary,
<p>Just caught this letter in Linux Gazette.  This limitation is
specific to Cirrus Logic cards, particularly those on the ISA bus and
some on VLB (ie. old systems -- like mine. Since you're using a
Diamond Stealth 64, you don't have this limitation.

<p>Full details are in the readme.cirrus file contained in the XFree86
Documentation.  Some cirrus owners may be able to overcome this
limitation.  See <a href="http://www.xfree86.org">http://xfree86.org</a>

<p>XFree86 needs to be able to map video memory in at the end of physical
memory linearly. However, ISA machines cannot support greater than 16MB in
this fashion - so if you have 16 or greater MB or RAM, you cannot run
XFree86 in higher than 8 bit color.
