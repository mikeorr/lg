<p>
Hello, Peter!
</p>

<p>
Glad to be of help, but please keep in mind posting replies also to the
TAG list. Others might find helpful comments, which is never a bad
thing.
</p>

<p>
On Dec 10, 2007 at 1428 -0600, Peter Clark appeared and said:
</p>

<pre>
&gt; [...]
&gt; Some more questions for you, if you do not mind.
&gt;
&gt; # Indices to maintain
&gt;
&gt; You have mailLocalAddress, mailRoutingAddress and memberUid being
&gt; maintained (in your example slapd.conf). What is calling upon them in
&gt; your example?
</pre>

<p>
These attributes were supposed to be used in a future project, that's
the main reason. I took the slapd.conf from a live server and anonymised
the critical part of the configuration.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; You also have mail listed, isn't mail and mailLocalAddress
&gt; the same thing?
</pre>

<p>
No, we only used the mail attribute in our setup, we ignored
mailLocalAddress.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Also, mailQuotaSize, mailQuotaCount,mailSizeMax; I
&gt; understand mailQuotaSize but did you restrict a user by the # of
&gt; messages in their account (mailQuotaCount) and how did you use
&gt; mailSizeMax?
</pre>

<p>
These attributes are used by the quota management system, which I didn't
describe in the article. It is basically a web-based GUI where
administrators can change these values. Some scripts read the quota
values from the LDAP directory and write it to the Cyrus server by using
the Cyrus Perl API. mailSizeMax isn't used in the setup, but again it
was supposed to be.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Doesn't imap.conf and main.cf hold those values?
</pre>

<p>
AFAIK the imap.conf only holds IMAP-relevant things. Cyrus is only
interested in the authentication, and this is done by saslauthd.
main.cf only holds references to the configuration files that contain
the LDAP lookups.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Does the order in which the indices are listed matter?
&gt;
&gt; ie could:
&gt; index	accountStatus					eq
&gt; index	objectClass,uidNumber,gidNumber			eq
&gt; index	cn,sn,uid,displayName,mail			eq,pres,sub
&gt;
&gt; be written:
&gt; index	cn,sn,uid,displayName,mail			eq,pres,sub
&gt; index	accountStatus					eq
&gt; index	objectClass,uidNumber,gidNumber			eq
&gt;
&gt; also couldnt:
&gt; index	accountStatus					eq
&gt; index	objectClass,uidNumber,gidNumber			eq
&gt; be combined to:
&gt; index	accountStatus,objectClass,uidNumber,gidNumber	eq
&gt;
&gt; Is it separated due to visual aesthetics or does it make a difference to
&gt; the database somehow?
</pre>

<p>
Frankly I doubt that the order matters. The indices I used are an
educated guess. Having too much indices slows things down, having too
few leads also to low performance. Generally speaking all attributes
that are accessed often should have indices.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I am struggling with creating the ldif file. This directory structure
&gt; is so all encompassing I am getting buried by to many options. In
&gt; looking at the OpenLDAP Admin guide and various "How To" guides
&gt; everyone has so many different ways of achieving their goals and I am
&gt; really confused.
</pre>

<p>
Try to think of "your" tree as a collection of logical containers. Try
to imagine what data you wish to to have grouped in order to make access
and access rules easy later on.
</p>

<p>
LDAP trees need some design before they are put into the field (similar
to database structures). This is also the reason why everyone has a
different design.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I have an existing openldap-2.0.11 install. It was installed prior to
&gt; me and only functioned as a global address book for our mail system.
&gt; It does not serve as much of a template for data. I have only 2 types
&gt; of records in this data base.
&gt;
&gt; One entry of:
&gt; dn: dc=3Dexample, dc=3Dnet
&gt; dc: example
&gt; objectclass: domain
&gt;
&gt; and the rest are users:
&gt; dn: uid=3Dpeckt, dc=3Dexample, dc=3Dnet
&gt; cn: Templeton Peck
&gt; ou: student
&gt; o: Example College
&gt; objectclass: person
&gt; mail: peckt@example.net
&gt;
&gt; So building the directory structure is getting frustrating.
</pre>

<p>
Yes, I can imagine. This looks more like a simple tree with one branch
for the mail users. In this case you can extend the existing branch with
suitable object classes and use it for the mail subsystem. However if
not too many systems use the existing structure, then you have the
unique opportunity of improving the design. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>


<pre>
&gt; In order to use the structure you suggested (this is fresh install
&gt; with no existing structure or data):
&gt;
&gt; dn: dc=3Dexample,dc=3Dnet
&gt;    ou=3Daccounts,dc=3Dexample,dc=3Dnet
&gt;      ou=3Dsystem,ou=3Daccounts,dc=3Dexample,dc=3Dnet
&gt;        cn=3Dcyrus,ou=3Dsystem,ou=3Daccounts,dc=3Dexample,dc=3Dnet
&gt;        cn=3Dpostfix,ou=3Dsystem,ou=3Daccounts,dc=3Dexample,dc=3Dnet
&gt;        cn=3Dwebmail,ou=3Dsystem,ou=3Daccounts,dc=3Dexample,dc=3Dnet
&gt;      ou=3Dusers,ou=3Daccounts,dc=3Dexample,dc=3Dnet
&gt;    ou=3Dedv,dc=3Dexample,dc=3Dnet
&gt;      ou=3Dserver,ou=3Dedv,dc=3Dexample,dc=3Dnet
&gt;        cn=3Dmailstore,ou=3Dserver,ou=3Dedv,dc=3Dexample,dc=3Dnet
&gt;          cn=3Dpostfix,cn=3Dmailstore,ou=3Dserver,ou=3Dedv,dc=3Dexample,dc=3Dnet
&gt; (these under the last entry, gotta love wordwrap)
&gt; lookupName=3Daliases,cn=3Dpostfix,cn=3Dmailstore,ou=3Dserver,ou=3Dedv,dc=3Dexample,dc=3Dnet
&gt; lookupName=3Dmydestination,cn=3Dpostfix,cn=3Dmailstore,ou=3Dserver,ou=3Dedv,dc=3Dexample,dc=3Dnet
&gt; lookupName=3Dvirtualdomains,cn=3Dpostfix,cn=3Dmailstore,ou=3Dserver,ou=3Dedv,dc=3Dexample,dc=3Dnet
&gt; lookupName=3Dvirtualusers,cn=3Dpostfix,cn=3Dmailstore,ou=3Dserver,ou=3Dedv,dc=3Dexample,dc=3Dnet
&gt;
&gt; For curiosity's sake why did you name it "edv" (ou=3Dedv, dc=3Dexample, dc=3Dnet)?
</pre>

<p>
For language reasons, EDV means "Elektronische Datenverarbeitung" in
German. This is the equivalent of the acronym IT for most German
speaking people. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I guess the first question is the root level of the tree. Is "dn:
&gt; dc=3Dexample,dc=3Dnet" the correct way to write that?
</pre>

<p>
It is common. Most organisations using TCP/IP and DNS code their domain
and subdomains into the LDAP tree by using "dc=3Ddomain,dc=3Dtld".
</p>


<pre>
&gt; And then in building the DIT from scratch by creating a LDIF file to import
&gt; that lookis like this?:
&gt;
&gt; dn: dc=3Dexample, dc=3Dnet
&gt; o: Example College
&gt; description: Organization Root
&gt; objectClass: top
&gt; objectClass: organization

</pre>

<p>
Looks ok to me; it's just that I have no LDAP server ready to test an
import.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Do I actually need to make containers in this manner for this
&gt; implementation?
</pre>

<p>
Yes. When creating LDIFs make sure you create the roots of the branches
before the objects that have to be stored inside these branches.
"ou=3Dusers, ou=3Daccounts, dc=3Dexample dc=3Dnet" has to exist before
"uid=3Dpeckt, ou=3Dusers, ou=3Daccounts, dc=3Dexample dc=3Dnet" can be added. This
can be ensured by ordering the entries in the LDIF.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Do I need to specify objectClass:top in any (in just one and it is
&gt; inherited?) or all of them? I guess I am not sure how to apply objectClass
&gt; to postfix, cyrus, webmail either.
</pre>

<p>
The objectClass attribute defines an object class. You can list as many
as you wish (and as long as they are compatible). An object class in
LDAP is pretty similar to objects in Java or C++. Objects can have
relations such as inheritance. "objectClass: top" is an abstract class
to start somewhere.
</p>

</p>


<pre>
&gt; You also have entries for  lookupName. Do I have these entries even remotely
&gt; close (objectClass, cn and such)?
</pre>

<p>
The lookupName is the name and container of a simple lookup table (as
Postfix/Sendmail use for their aliases or other maps). This means that
</p>

<pre>
lookupName=3Daliases,cn=3Dpostfix,cn=3Dmailstore,ou=3Dserver,ou=3Dedv,dc=3Dexample,dc=3Dnet
</pre>
is just a fancy LDAP name for the alias table of the Postfix belonging
to the mailstore subsystem on server edv.example.net. It is one of the
many way to organise data inside a LDAP tree.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Do I actually need info under these or are they just like the cyrus
&gt; and postfix entries and are a way for postfix to search the DIT?
</pre>

<p>
The info below "lookupName=3Daliases,..." represents the data of the
lookup table. The whole DN "lookupName=3Daliases,..." serves as a
reference where to start looking. This is why DNs like these are used in
the Postfix and Cyrus configurations.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Do they even need a password?
</pre>

<p>
It is good practice to guard your lookup tables by using passwords. In
order to do this the individual DNs don't need password attributes. You
can use access lists and describe which branch is accessible by which
user.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Thank you for any time you are willing spend helping me.

<p>
You're welcome.

&gt;&gt; Also, mailQuotaSize, mailQuotaCount,mailSizeMax; I

&gt;&gt; mailSizeMax?

Is the management system based off your "cyrus_syncboxes.pl"? Could you

</pre>

<p>
Am I understanding correctly that because 'top' is an abstract it does 
not explicitly need to be added to every entry? The second link shows an 
  example that seems to conflict this.
</p>

<p>
"all objectClasses defined in the schema must directly or indirectly 
inherit from "top", so your entries will be fine as soon as you provide 
exactly one structural objectClass in all of them"
</p>

<p>
Because every objectClass in the SCHEMA inherits from 'top' I only need 
to provide to each LDIF entry for OpenLDAP?
<pre>
objectClass: blah
and NOT:
objectClass: top
objectClass: blah
</pre>

&gt; 
</pre>

<p>
Postfix and ldif configuring.
</p>

<p>
In your OpenLDAP structure section you refer to:
<pre>
lookupName=aliases
lookupName=mydestination
lookupName=virtualdomains
lookupName=virtualusers
</pre>
I only see that you 'search_base' on 3 of them (mydestination, 
virtualdomains and virtualusers). What happened to aliases? Is it not 
used in the example due to this:
''
alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases, hash:/etc/postfix/cgate_lists
''
in main.cf?
</p>

<p>
Could you give an example of an entry under any of the lookupName in the 
ldif file (is this actually called a table entry?)? Should I be using an 
objectClass of lookupTable or lookupTableEntry? I guess I am not sure 
what data would actually go into  the attributes either.
</p>

<p>
I have this currently but from what I am thinking now, this is not correct:
<pre>
dn: lookupName=aliases, cn=postfix, cn=mailstore, ou=server, ou=edv, 
dc=example, dc=net
cn: postfix
sn: postfix
userPassword: {SSHA}blah3
objectClass: Person
</pre>
OK I just re-read your last response to me and now I am  getting locked 
in a circle.
<pre>
"lookupName=aliases,cn=postfix,cn=mailstore,ou=server,ou=edv,dc=example,dc=net
is just a fancy LDAP name for the alias table of the Postfix belonging 
to the mailstore subsystem on server edv.example.net. It is one of the 
many way to organise data inside a LDAP tree."
</pre>
Are you saying that the main.cf calls:
<pre>
mydestination = localhost, ldap:/etc/postfix/mydestination.cf''
 and 
Postfix is told to do a ldap query (ldap<img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> based on a file 
(/etc/postfix/mydestination.cf) and this query binds as 
``
cn=postfix,ou=system,ou=accounts,dc=example,dc=net
</pre>
and returns an attribute of some type from the
''
lookupName=mydestination,cn=postfix,cn=mailstore,ou=server,ou=edv,dc=example,dc=net 
''
entry? Even though I do not know the contained data, is that the process?
</p>


<p>
And lastly can I have blank entries in my ldif file? ie:
<pre>
mailQuotaSize: 51200
mailForwardingAddress:
mailReplyText:
mailServer: mail1.example.net
</pre>
I would assume so as long as nothing is looking there and expecting to 
find something.
</p>


<p>
I am truly grateful for this.
</p>

<p>
Peter

<p>
The management system consists of a couple of Perl scripts.
cyrus_syncboxes.pl only synchronises the mail quota settings from the
LDAP tree with the settings on the Cyrus server. The other scripts are
CGIs and part of a web management UI. Admins can create, delete and
modify accounts. A rough overview over the functionality can be found
here:

I am trying to publish the scripts as soon as I got the time to review
the code and remove everything specific to the servers they manage.

&gt;&gt; The objectClass attribute defines an object class. You can list as many
&gt;&gt; as you wish (and as long as they are compatible). An object class in
&gt;&gt; LDAP is pretty similar to objects in Java or C++. Objects can have
&gt;&gt; relations such as inheritance. "objectClass: top" is an abstract class
&gt;&gt; to start somewhere.=20
&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.openldap.org/lists/openldap-software/200504/msg00226.html">http://www.openldap.org/lists/openldap-software/200504/msg00226.html</a>

&gt;
&gt; Am I understanding correctly that because 'top' is an abstract it does not
&gt; explicitly need to be added to every entry? The second link shows an
&gt; example that seems to conflict this.
</pre>

<p>
Usually you use the "top" object class when you create branches that
don't need any special attributes. Since LDIF exports often contain
"top" I also included it when writing LDIF files.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; [...]
&gt; Because every objectClass in the SCHEMA inherits from 'top' I only need to
&gt; provide to each LDIF entry for OpenLDAP?
&gt; objectClass: blah
&gt; and NOT:
&gt; objectClass: top
&gt; objectClass: blah
</pre>

<p>
Yes, although the latter should work fine, too.
</p>


<pre>
&gt;&gt; [...]
&gt;&gt; The info below "lookupName=3Daliases,..." represents the data of the
&gt;&gt; lookup table. The whole DN "lookupName=3Daliases,..." serves as a
&gt;&gt; reference where to start looking. This is why DNs like these are used in
&gt;&gt; the Postfix and Cyrus configurations.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Postfix and ldif configuring.
&gt; In your OpenLDAP structure section you refer to:
&gt; lookupName=3Daliases
&gt; lookupName=3Dmydestination
&gt; lookupName=3Dvirtualdomains
&gt; lookupName=3Dvirtualusers
&gt;
&gt; I only see that you 'search_base' on 3 of them (mydestination,=20
&gt; virtualdomains and virtualusers). What happened to aliases? Is it not used
&gt; in the example due to this:
&gt; alias_maps =3D hash:/etc/aliases, hash:/etc/postfix/cgate_lists
&gt; in main.cf?
</pre>

<p>
Yes, we chose to use files because we didn't configure the main domain
as virtual domain. Postfix allows you to mix this. You could use a line
like this:
</p>

<pre>
alias_maps =3D hash:/etc/aliases, ldap:/etc/postfix/aliases.cf
</pre>
Then Postfix would look first into the file database belonging to
/etc/aliases. If no match occurs it looks into the LDAP branch defined
by /etc/postfix/aliases.cf. This is very nice for chaining tables by
order of preference or adding legacy configurations (such as the list
aliases in our case).
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Could you give an example of an entry under any of the lookupName in the
&gt; ldif file (is this actually called a table entry?)? Should I be using an
&gt; objectClass of lookupTable or lookupTableEntry? I guess I am not sure what
&gt; data would actually go into  the attributes either.
</pre>

<p>
Ok, let's build a blacklist for users that don't receive any email.
First we create a lookupTable called blacklist.
</p>

<pre>
dn: lookupName=3Dblacklistrcpt,cn=3Dmta,dc=3Dexample,dc=3Dnet
objectclass: top
objectclass: lookupTable
lookupName: blacklistrcpt
description: Table for blacklisted recipients
</pre>
After that you can fill the table with accounts that receive no email:
</p>

<pre>
dn: lookupKey=3Dman,lookupName=3Dblacklistrcpt,cn=3Dmta,dc=3Dexample,dc=3Dnet
objectclass: top
objectclass: lookupTableEntry
lookupKey: man
lookupValue: REJECT
 
dn: lookupKey=3Dsys,lookupName=3Dblacklistrcpt,cn=3Dmta,dc=3Dexample,dc=3Dnet
objectclass: top
objectclass: lookupTableEntry
lookupKey: sys
lookupValue: REJECT
 
dn: lookupKey=3Duucp,lookupName=3Dblacklistrcpt,cn=3Dmta,dc=3Dexample,dc=3Dnet
objectclass: top
objectclass: lookupTableEntry
lookupKey: uucp
lookupValue: REJECT
</pre>

<pre>
&gt; I have this currently but from what I am thinking now, this is not correct:
&gt; dn: lookupName=3Daliases, cn=3Dpostfix, cn=3Dmailstore, ou=3Dserver, ou=3Dedv, dc=3Dexample, dc=3Dnet
&gt; cn: postfix
&gt; sn: postfix
&gt; userPassword: {SSHA}blah3
&gt; objectClass: Person
</pre>

<p>
You don't need the object class "person" for lookup tables. You only
need "lookupTable" for the table itself and "lookupTableEntry" for every
entry in the table.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; OK I just re-read your last response to me and now I am  getting locked in a
&gt; circle.
&gt; "lookupName=3Daliases,cn=3Dpostfix,cn=3Dmailstore,ou=3Dserver,ou=3Dedv,dc=3Dexample,dc=3Dnet
&gt; is just a fancy LDAP name for the alias table of the Postfix belonging to
&gt; the mailstore subsystem on server edv.example.net. It is one of the many ways
&gt; to organise data inside a LDAP tree."
&gt;
&gt; Are you saying that the main.cf calls:
&gt; mydestination =3D localhost, ldap:/etc/postfix/mydestination.cf and Postfix is
&gt; told to do a ldap query (ldap<img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> based on a file
&gt; (/etc/postfix/mydestination.cf) and this query binds as
&gt; cn=3Dpostfix,ou=3Dsystem,ou=3Daccounts,dc=3Dexample,dc=3Dnet and returns an attribute
&gt; of some type from the
&gt; lookupName=3Dmydestination,cn=3Dpostfix,cn=3Dmailstore,ou=3Dserver,ou=3De=dv,dc=3Dexample,dc=3Dnet
&gt; entry? Even though I do not know the contained data, is that the process?
</pre>

<p>
Yes, that's exactly what it does. Postfix sends lookup as LDAP query.
The query searches everything below
"lookupName=3Dmydestination,cn=3Dpostfix,cn=3Dmailstore,ou=3Dserver,ou=3Dedv,dc=3Dexample,dc=3Dnet".
If it returns a result, then Postfix knows that the item is contained in
the table and Postfix will assume that the domain it queried is part of
the mydestination domains. If the query returns no results, Postfix
knows that the domain belongs to somewhere else. In the case of
mydestination Postfix doesn't use the result. In the case of our
blacklist table, the result is used as an action code, just as in a
simple text-based table.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; And lastly can I have blank entries in my ldif file? ie:
&gt; mailQuotaSize: 51200
&gt; mailForwardingAddress:
&gt; mailReplyText:
&gt; mailServer: mail1.example.net
&gt; I would assume so as long as nothing is looking there and expecting to find
&gt; something.
</pre>

<p>
This depends on the definition of the object class in the schema file.
Some attributes may be empty, some need to have a value. I think in this
case the LDAP import will not create an entry with this attribute. When
building our LDAP tree we left many attributes out since we only needed
what Postfix should look up.
