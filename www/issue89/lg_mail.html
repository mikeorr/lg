<P>
Hi
</P>
<P>
I have tried lots and lots and lots of things to get DNS setup properly, but can only get
it to work intermitently. What I am try to achieve is a fairly small, fairly simple, multi
domain DNS host for a few domains that my company owns, and then a few that we
are/will be hosting in the near(ish) future.
I have some linux boxes RH62/RH7x configured for various tasks like email,
database servers, apache, samba etc.
Some of the DNS authorities are with register.com, some with various ISP's. I can
modify the register.com ones once I have the thing working, and will ask the ISP's to
"hand over" the SOA's as well, but first I have to get the confounded thing to work
properly.
</P>
<P>
I shall describe what I would like, using thumbsuck names and ip's, and would be
VERY happy and appreciative if you could tell me how the config files should look.
</P>
<P>
lets say I own/have howdoesdnswork.com as my main domain, and host some others
like:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>	whywontthiswork.net
	imconfused.co.za
	plshelp.org.za
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
I plan to run (i think i have it working, but can't test properly till DNS works) a virtual
domain mailhost (qmail based) system.
I have a fixed IP/permanent connection for my main(own) domain which is on ip
subnet 99.8.77.0
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>DNS server (primary) is/will_be  99.8.77.13 (using BIND8)
<br>DNS server (secondary) is/will_be 99.8.77.12 (also using BIND8)
<br>Mail server for howdoesdnswork.com (and in fact all above) is  99.8.77.2
<br>Web server (for all above using apache virtualhosting) is on 99.8.77.4
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
You're probably thinking "Why is someone so clueless even attempting something
like this", but I've gotta start somewhere if I'm ever gonna learn. Pls pardon
my ignorance (&amp; I'll pardon your sniggering 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=";-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> ).
</P>
<P>
By what I have read, and tried and struggled with, I need zone files for each
domain, each of which contains host info etc.
Here are my attempts, comments etc still included ..... followed by a desperate
request (on my knees, tears running down my face etc) for
assistance/guidance/criticism.
</P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/wanted/Murgatroyd.dns-configuration-files.txt">Murgatroyd.dns-configuration-files.txt</a></tt></p>
<P>
I would also like to get some info on "mail server splitting" - as in having a local mail
server (proxy) on a DSL connected LAN which forward internet emails to a main
server (mailhost) on a permanent connection, but transmits local mail as local mail,
and then which downloads mail from the "mailhost" to the local "mail proxy" on a
polled interval, but I'm probably pushing my luck here, so I'll post this one another
time..... unless of course...???
I have a working system using micro%$#* but would like to get rid of ALL M$
products as soon as humanly possible.
</P>

Thanx a stack

Hi

<P>
I hope this is a legitimate question:
At faked.org a person subscribes to <A HREF="mailto:Info@fake.nl"
	>Info@fake.nl</A>
with his e-mailadress <A HREF="mailto:special.person@faked.org"
	>special.person@faked.org</A>
Okay, fetchmail collects the e-mails and sendmail
distributes them on a linuxserver.
What is weird: the sender sends to himself . . .
in pine one sees:
From: <A HREF="mailto:Info@fake.nl"
	>Info@fake.nl</A>
To: <A HREF="mailto:Info@fake.nl"
	>Info@fake.nl</A>
</P>
<P>
Now I would not deliver such an e-mail . . . .
But linux is politer and sends it to the local person of last resort.
</P>
<P>
I cannot but forward the e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:special-person@faked.org"
	>special-person@faked.org</A>
I do not want to mess myself with the sendmail and fetchmail configurations
as they do perfectly what they should do with normal e-mails.
</P>
<P>
For your information I have put here-under what Outlook Express shows
One blames me for not delivering the e-mail in the normal way . . .

Hi,
</P>
<P>
Excellent material on this site !!!
</P>
<P>
I have a small problem. I have two subnets: 192.149.1.0/24 and
192.168.52.0/24. I want all the hosts on one to see the others on the
other subnet. In other words, I want to have <EM>NO BLOCKING</EM> of any
service from either side.
</P>
<P>
I have been able to make the 168 network hosts see and access the 149
hosts. From the 149 subnet I can ping a host on the other subnet, but I
can't, for example, see a PC's shared directories. Security is not an
issue as they are both internal networks.
</P>
<P>
I am running Coyote Linux on a floppy.

Any help will be greatly appreciated and thanks in advance.

Hi
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Hello,
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I got a lot of useful answers from this
group for my previous
question  [TAG] RPM -Installing Packages.Thanks a
lot to Thomas
,Ben,Breen,David and  Rick.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
&lt;blushing&gt;...you're welcome.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Actually i'm trying (to simulate the RPM
Tool
functionalities using C ) to  develop a Java
Packager Tool for handling
*. rpm files in a Solaris Box. It should support
packaging operations
like Install , Query, Verify,Erase etc.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Sounds good.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
As a first task , I'm tring to simulate the
RPM Query option ,
to query installed packages.If we query an
uninstalled package ,it
should say it's uninstalled.It should generate
package infos. as we get
in : rpm -qi &lt;file&gt;. Also to query the listof files
, pre &amp; post
installation scripts , list of dependencies, list of
dependencies
covered and not covered.I don't know how to use
&lt;rpmdb.h&gt; file for
generating these informations.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Hmmm, from my limited knowledge I think that you can
just query the RPM database directly without going via
&lt;rpmdb.h&gt;
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Can anybody (in this
group) help me in
this regard?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Which part are you implementing in Java (I got 93/100
for that last semester

Hi all,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I know that this list is called "linux-questions-only" and therefore I have
to prove that it is indeed a linux question! So: I want to travel to the USA
with my <EM>linux</EM> laptop and need some reliable internet access via modem or
ISDN (is ISDN available there and which standard is used then).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
In Germany we have something called "Internet by call" where you call a number
and pay via telephone bill, you don't have to register and don't have to pay
in advance.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
What are the options to get a linux laptop on the net in the USA? Since some
of you guys are living there, you may answer the question. A quick glance on
google results has only shown me some Calling Card providers where you buy
"points" and then use the web until they are empty. AOL (since it's not
linux-compatible) and T-Online global access (since I'm not a customer) are
no option.

You can do what I do, since I travel a lot: use AT&amp;T. It's $20/month,
and they have dial-up numbers pretty much everywhere; AFAIK, more so
than any other service. The only caveat is, no outgoing SMTP - you have
to use their mail servers to push your stuff out. For most people,
that's not a problem; I just find it to be an annoyance. Easy fix: set
up one conffile for a smarthost and one for a local MTA and swap them as
necessary. For extra ease of use, don't run in daemon mode - just invoke
the MTA per-message (and an occasional cron job in case anything gets
stuck in the pipe.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Swirl] 
You know, if I faced that situation, I'd rsync or scp my outgoing mail
over to my own MTA.  That's what Andrew Tridgell does.  (For that
matter, I usually just ssh over to my MTA box anyway, where I have mutt
perpetually running under GNU screen, interacting directly with the
local mail sppol.)  They don't block port 22 (ssh), do they?  That would
be a deal-breaker.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Tux] 
You know, I just got a shell account with &lt;freeshell.org&gt;; that is an
<EM>excellent</EM> idea. I'd really like the ability to keep 'Fcc's on my
laptop, but I can always pull down the files.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Swirl] 
Entrusting outbound mail to AT&amp;T's smarthost seems an unjustifiable
compromise, in any event.  Not acceptable.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Tux] 
Parallels my own attitude; however, I didn't have the means to
support it until now.

<blockquote><font color="#000066">These are interesting thoughts, but quite untrue to their nature, the

very closest I can think of is some internet coffee shops have taken to
selling daypasses into their wireless hookup, or sell hourly time while
you enjoy the coffee, and hotels in urban areas are starting to offer
high speed access, also paid by the day.  You'd need a wireless or

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000066"><EM>
I read your 'Greeting' in the latest LinuxGazette online and found it
interesting, and correct. The last company I worked for
actually switched from cvs, to BitKeeper, for all the cool features.
Very long story short, after one year of us debugging their
product, paying tens of thousands of $ for the privilege, and never
having Larry McVoy stop being a pain in the ass, we dumped
them and went back to cvs, and all was well (after they threatened to
sue us, etc... at the time we definitely had superior lawyers,
and they knew they had no case--but why even threaten? Leaves a bad
taste.) Afterward, we missed changesets a bit, but not as
much as you might think. And we got so much better performance for
"simple things", that it made up for it, in our minds.
Oh, and we could save the tens of 000s of $, which was in-line with our
whole philosophy, anyhow.

My. I've no idea why large enough corporations think being a poor
sport would keep them customers who are on the verge of flying the coop.
One would think the other way happens more often - attempts to lure one
back and all.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
"Large enough corporations" I suppose -- BitMover is/was only a handful
of folks.  I felt they were very deceptive about the quality of their
code (which did improve during the year we spent with it, but should have
been that way to start with), and were obviously trying to exploit Linux
(by convincing Linus to use BK), as a marketing tool. I don't believe LM
has ever contributed to an opensource project, if that tells you something.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
My own experiences of these systems have been with the bits only and not
so much which the personailities that drive them.  I'm all for people
having pride in their work... but a little respect around the naighborhood
here pays us all back best.

It's too bad BitMover (the company) isn't nearly as cool as well as
BitKeeper, the product, is. I told Linus in email (not sure if
he ever even read it) way back when that, be careful, Larry is not
really a "plays well with others" kind of guy. (This is probably
the understatement of the week, but I'm in a charitable mood.)

Heh.  Linus has been known to declare himself "not a nice guy" on

kernel function, either.

Your comments were right-on, and interesting to read. I don't usually
visit the site but maybe I'll try to do so more in the future.
(And if you're curious, my current shop is all-windows, that's what I
inherited... trying to slowly turn things towards opensource
solutions, but it's quite the effort. I thought switching from SourceSafe
would be hard, but it turns out they don't even use that!! Wow.

I'm glad you enjoyed my mangled thoughts on it all.  Your response goes

This is with reference to " Perl One-Liner of the Month: The Case of
the Evil Spambots" which was published in th LG#86. I especially
enjoyed you defination of Gibberish.

<P><STRONG>
Here is something I found in my fortune files. I am pretty sure
wordsmithing in the Marketroid language is done using this
procedure.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I wouldn't be surprised at all... Of course now I've just got to turn it
into a Perl script.

choice...

<blockquote><font color="#000066">This looked interesting enough to toss the clipping in.  Maybe we should
have stuffed it in News Bytes, but the air compressor wasn't in at
press time.  The "groups of linux users everywhere" is a list of LUGs
and service also hosted at SSC.

<P>
Some of you may have seen the recent story by ESR on NewsForge about SCO
suing IBM for billions over IBM's "disclosure" of SCO intellectual
property to the "free software" community.
</P>
<P>
In a nutshell, SCO bought the Unix source and related IP from Novell in
1995. <A HREF="http://www.caldera.com/">Caldera</A> (which was never much of an "open source" company)
recently became SCO, and since then, they have been looking high and low
for who they could sue over their IP. A rumour surfaced a while back
that they had retained David Bois to sue people, which they promptly
denied. Now, guess who's leading the charge against IBM? Yep. SCO has
become openly hostile to the Open Source community, and this looks like
the desperate effort of a dying company to grab money by suing people
rather than making a better product. IBM has the deepest pockets, so
they get sued first.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the whole point of this is that I recently received a package of
SCO Linux software for distribution to my LUG. You may have received
such a package as well. If so, I would encourage you to send it back to
SCO with a note explaining (lucidly) why. I don't know that it will
ultimately do any good, but maybe it will get their attention.

I am sorry if this message is in HTML format; Hotmail doesn't give a plain

I enjoyed reading the letters page. It reflected the range of responses I
received quite well. Just for your information, over 500 of your readers
downloaded my library during February.

On behalf of our missing Editor Gal, thanks, Stephen!  It's good to know
we snipped it just right.  Loyal readers, I've also snipped the ensuing
fragmented discussion about the nature of languages that sprung up among
TAG ... you'll probably see something of that in a later issue. -- The
