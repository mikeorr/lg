In an
<a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/09/22/gpl3.html">interview</a>
at OnLAMP.com, Richard M. Stallman discusses (among other things) version 3 of the GPL.
</P>
<P>
Though details of GPL 3 are sketchy, it has seemed certain that it will
contain a 'web service' clause: licences such as the Affero GPL and the
APSL have clauses that require the distribution of source code for
modified versions of software covered by those licences if the software
is used in public servers.
</P>
<P>
These clauses are considered non-free by <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>, because this affects
the use of the software. RMS's comments show that he has considered this.
</P>

<TABLE WIDTH="95%" BORDER="1" BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC"><TR><TD>
<p align="center">...............</p>
<P>
Running a program in a public server is not distribution; it is public
use. We're looking at an approach where programs used in this way will
have to include a command for the user to download the source for the
version that is running.
</P>
<P>
But this will not apply to all GPL-covered programs, only to programs
that already contain such a command. Thus, this change would have no
effect on existing software, but developers could activate it in the future.

by Jeremy Malcolm, a lawyer acting on behalf of Linux Australia Inc.,
demanding that these companies agree to a trademark licence and pay a
fee of between A$200 and 5000.
</P>

Although it was widely reported that this was somehow an attempt by
Linus Torvalds to cash in on the success of Linux, in

Finally, just to make it clear: not only do I not get a cent of the
trademark money, but even LMI (who actually administers the mark) has so
far historically always lost money on it. That's not a way to sustain a
trademark, so they're trying to at least become self-sufficient, but so
far I can tell that lawyers fees to <em>  give  </em> that protection that commercial
companies want have been higher than the license fees. Even pro bono
lawyers chanrge <em>(sic)</em> for the time of their costs and paralegals etc.

<P>
DRM-OPERA's roots lie in Project OPERA, which came out of the Eurescom

telecommunications industry.  Sun's R&amp;D lab contributed heavily to
Project OPERA, which produced an architecture for interoperable DRM in
2003.
</P>
<P>
OPERA achieves interoperability among DRM systems -- interoperability
between Microsoft and RealNetworks DRMs has already been demonstrated --
essentially by reducing DRM licenses down to a lowest common denominator
of authenticating users only (as described above) and providing "play
once" as an atomic licensing term that all DRM systems can understand
and support. Each of the DRM systems involved in a specific instance of
interoperability can manage more complex licensing terms internally and
communicate them through the OPERA architecture via "play once" licenses.
