<P>
To address the aforementioned requirements, we clearly had to use a client/server
database technology.  To defend against eavesdropping, we had to encrypt
all communications.
<P>
At the time, IPsec and virtual private networks were not available.
Even today, these are young technologies and VPNs are not yet suitable
for implementation on client workstations.  The solution had to be
encryption in the DBMS protocol.  To do this, we could either buy Secure
Oracle (which would put the project over budget), or roll our own
solution.
<P>
We had to write a DBMS engine which would encrypt all communication,
be responsive when the bandwidth was low and the latency high, support
strong authentication, access controls and auditing features.  On
the bright side, we really didn't need an SQL engine, or a generalized
query engine at all.  (More on queries and reports later, though!)
