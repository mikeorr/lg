Normally, I don't think much about spam.  It's easy to spot it in a mail
index.  Spam just doesn't have plausable Subject: lines.  Too many
capital letters, too many '$' and other symbols, and words that no 
person would put in a subject; e.g.,  "Here's the info you asked about."  

<P> Three weeks ago, I started receiving a lot of binary attachments.  After
two weeks of seeing the same subject lines over and over, I started keeping
count.  241 messages in 9 days, or 32 MB.  Ironically, the culprit itself
revealed its identity.  One of the subjects was "W32.Klez.E removal tools".  I
headed to 
<A HREF="http://www.datafellows.com/">www.datafellows.com</A>, searched for
"Klez.E", and sure enough, it's a worm.

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.europe.f-secure.com/v-descs/klez_e.shtml">http://www.europe.f-secure.com/v-descs/klez_e.shtml</A>

<P> It's quite a complicated little beastie.  It has a large pool of 
subjects to choose from and also incorporates phrases it finds in files.
It has a built-in SMTP client and sends itself to whoever it finds in your
Outlook address book, pretending to be From: somebody else in your address
book.  

<P> Linux users of course can't get infected, although it can leak onto Linux
mailing lists and pretend to be From: a Linux user.  But Windows users who
are unlucky enough to run the program or let IE or Outlook automatically
execute it will have their documents overwritten with random data, their
anti-virus programs disabled, and their address book harvested.  Often it
pretends to be an audio file, exploiting a bug in some Windows programs
that automatically executes audio attachments.  

<P> In the past week, the worm has forged the addresses of both Alex
(former Answer Gang member and column writer) and the Editor Gal (Heather),
and sent three messages to a linux-list recipient claiming to be From:
linux-list.  Interestingly, the addresses it chose for Heather and the
linux-list person were obsolete.  

<P> I have no idea why the Gazette address has the honor of receiving 99%
of these critters.

<P> What burns me up was not only the bandwidth but the sneaky way it tries
to trick you into running the attachments, claiming to be a Win XP patch
(that's what first got me suspicious) or an anti-virus tool against itself.
Some of its messages include the URLs of real anti-virus companies as a way
to sound legitimate.

Yeah, we're seeing it. This is one mean little sucker. It has the 
usual features of an Outlook-based worm, with the charming addition 
that it uses a random address from the victim's address book as the

One curious fact:

Curiously, "the virus doesn't work on any operating system except Windows 98
because of a serious bug in its code. Due to some blind luck the virus also
works on Windows 2000...  When the main code gets control, the first thing is
does is calls the IsDebuggerPresent API function. But the virus calls this
function using a fixed API address and this address is only valid for Windows
98. On all other systems the virus just crashes.  ...  [Stuff about registry
keys it sets] ... On Windows NT this doesn't happen because the virus crashes.
Due to a dumb luck the virus doesn't crash on Windows 2000 though it calls a
non-existing API address.  "

<P> Trendmicro/<A HREF="http://antivirus.com/">antivirus.com</A> 
describes the worm's attack scheme:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It does not require the email receiver to open the
attachment for it to execute. It uses a known
vulnerability in Internet Explorer-based email clients to
execute the file attachment automatically. This is also
known as Automatic Execution of Embedded MIME type.

<P>
The infected email contains the executable attachment
registered as content-type of audio/x-wav or
sometimes audio/x-midi so that when recipients view
the infected email, the default application associated
with audio files is opened. This is usually the Windows
Media Player. The embedded EXE file cannot be
viewed in Microsoft Outlook."

However Trendmicro also pretends that the thing (at least the `E'
and `H' variants) composes the message body "randomly"...
The `H' variant is supposed to contain the following strings:

<P>
I didn't know there was a minimum age to use Linux.  If you're old enough
to write an e-mail, you're old enough to write Linux.

<P>
Are you old enough to set your mailer so it sends us only text-format
messages, not HTML format?  Text messages are easier for us to read and
respond to, and are the standard for Internet e-mail.

<P>
You're not old enough to use Linux and you're trying to configure Sendmail???
Mamma mia!  Why?  Use a mail transfer agent like Postfix that's much easier
to configure than Sendmail.

<P>
What exactly do you want to do, what have you tried, and what are the 
problems?  

<P>
I assume by "mail relay" you just mean you want Sendmail to work, so you can
send mail from and to your computer.  That's not a mail relay.  A "mail relay"
means that your Sendmail program accepts mail *from non-local senders to
non-local recipients*.  Normally, Sendmail accepts mail only if it's *from a
local user* or *to a local user*.  Otherwise, you open up your mail server for
exploitation by spammers.  

<P>
If this is the central mail server for an organization, it probably accepts
mail from computers in the organization but not from other computers.
This is technically "relaying", but with most mail transfer agents you don't
configure it as a relay, instead you tell the program these are local addresses.

<P>
If you're trying to be a spammer yourself, see Linux Gazette's advice for
crackers:

	NEWS FLASH

	<P>
	Reports of a new strain of the "lack of clue" virus, in which people
	who lack a clue when dealing with email attachments are victimized
	easily, is going around.

	<P>
	This one affects all clueless Microsoft customers and is invoked when
	the hapless victim opens an attachment claiming to be "from Microsoft"
	(CLUE: Microsoft never sends attachments.  They have a website and a
	rather annoying auto-update system.  They don't need to waste their 
	own email bandwidth spamming customers with update .exe packets).

	<P>
	Linux users are largely immune, as are freeBSD users, but users of
	MSwin based mailers which "helpfully" open attachments for them are
	heavy sufferers in this ailment.  Linux and BSD folk who use WINE 
	or DOSEMU and have made any special effort to autolaunch those sort
	of binaries should beware though.  ("Too much clue" is also a problem
	at times...)

	<P>
	Sites using a central SMTP gateway can apply filters against undesired
	attachments.  If you don't have a clue what policy to apply, consider
	dumping all mail bearing attachments with the "Known Dangerous 
	Extensions" - a Microsoft Knowledge Base document available on their
	website - into some moderated account which is maintained by a user
	with no interesting privileges, or to pass it through some antivirus
	scanning.

for a proper firewall, we recommend you load the ip-cardboard module,

*There's* the problem, right there. You should be loading the "catp-*"

Hmm, purrr-haps.  I hear that the catp-plastic-liner module has to be

<P>
Every second billions of innocent assembler instructions are executed
all over the world. Inhumanly they are put on a pipeline and executed
with no regard to their feelings. The illegal instructions are spared,
although they should be executed instead of the legal ones.

<P>
Prior to the execution the instructions are transported to a cache
unit using a bus. There they spent their last moments waiting for the
execution. Just before the execution the instruction is separated into
several pieces. The execution isn't always fast and painless. On crude
hardware the execution of a complex instruction can take as long as
150 clock cycles. Scientists are working on shorter execution times.

<P>
Microsoft endorses the needless execution of instructions with their
products like DOS(TM), Windows(TM), Word(TM) and Excel(TM). It is more
humane to use software which minimises the executions.

<P>
Modern machines use several units to execute multiple instructions
simultaneously. This way it is possible to execute several hundred
million instructions per second. The time is near when there will be
no more instructions to execute.

I have been mandated by my colleagues on the Panel to seek your assistance in
the transfer of the sum of US$18.5 Million into your Bank account. As you may
have known, the late General Abacha and members of his government embezzled
billions of dollars through spurious contracts and payments to foreigners
between 1993 and 1998 and this is now the subject of the probe by my Panel. 

<P>
In the course of our review, we have discovered this sum of $18.5 Million,
which the former dictator could not transfer from the dedicated account of the
Central Bank of Nigeria before his sudden death in June 1998. It is this amount
that my Colleagues and I have decided to acquire for ourselves through your
assistance. This assistance becomes crucial because we cannot acquire the funds
in our names and as government officials we are not allowed to own or operate
foreign bank accounts.

	[Bah, they want to acquire knowingly-embezzled funds for themselves,
and need a partner because as government officials they can't open a government
bank acct?  -Iron.]
