This is, or closely related to, the thing that attracted me to Linux in
the first place. In the Windows world, you're either a user - which is
defined by a very narrow, small set of pointy-clicky skills and not much
if any understanding of the mechanisms you use - or you're some sort of
a "wizard", which gets defined in all sorts of arcane ways, mostly
meaning "knows some stuff beyond what users know." All that "stuff",
however, doesn't form any kind of a coherent whole: it was all chunks
and bits and pieces, no relation of anything to anything else. The only
choices, if you wanted more than the minimum, were 1) specialize -
meaning something like learning a certain language or a given
application, or 2) gather enough critical mass of random <strong>stuff</strong> until
you formed a gravity well of your own and could pull out some sort of a
related useful fact when a problem came along.  All very haphazard, and
somewhat akin to stumbling around in a dark dungeon until you found some
treasure or (far more likely) ran into some kind of a monster.
</p>

<p>
YOU'RE TRAPPED IN A MAZE OF TWISTY PASSAGES, ALL ALIKE, AND YOU'RE
LIKELY TO BE EATEN BY A GRUE.

(It is worth noting that I functioned in that world, professionally, for
a number of years, all the way from a wet-behind-the-ears teenage
computer repairman to working as CIO for an insurance company. This
perspective is not formed by my desire to promote Linux; quite the
opposite, if anything - I advocate Linux usage <em>because</em> I have this
perspective, which was formed by long experience.)
</p>

<p>
The Linux world also has a clearly-defined slot for users; you can fire
up your Firefox, OpenOffice, etc., and stay within that environment at
all times while using your computer - clickety-click, hurrah! However,
if you <em>do</em> want to learn just a little more, in whatever direction -
<strong>AHH</strong>, what a difference. Yes, it does require that fixed investment of
time and effort... but that's an excellent life strategy anyway: pay the
biggest costs up front and then enjoy the results (in a system that
actually works, the benefits at that point will generally continue to
grow proportionally with the effort that you put in, while the costs
continue to diminish until they reach some fixed low level.) Linux
follows that model - and it's no surprise that Professor Whatsisname
(I'm having trouble getting back to the page - Chrome claims "too many
redirects") found it to be effective. I mean, <strong>duh</strong>. What part of
"effective life strategy" did he miss? <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
My point is that once you've paid that "cost" (and it can't really even
be considered a pure cost, since you get paid back for having that
knowledge, again and again), you're in a situation where the tide is
lifting all the boats at the same time: everything you do will provide
feedback which results in more learning - *because there are no blind
alleys*. Nothing is hidden behind a wall marked "PROPRIETARY", which you
can only scale illegally or through crazy contortions that the average
human simple can't perform. The world really is wide-open in nearly
every direction.
</p>

<p>
A related aside: I was at a large office supply store today, and
happened to glance at the numerous aisles of software while passing
them. For just a moment, I would swear that I saw them behind dusty,
cobwebbed glass - like a museum full of ancient relics, the way our
ancestors used to do stuff in the distant past. Even after that
momentary flash, I looked at it for another moment and thought, with a
small shock "man, I'd forgotten that people still do this." Seriously,
it seemed odd.
</p>

<p>
And <strong>that</strong> is the kind of world I like living in.
