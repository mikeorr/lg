This is a small excerpt from the discussion thread at Linux Weekly New,
in response to LWN's news story about a "statement" posted at Microsoft
Corporation's Web site, claiming they are not, and never will be,
subject to the provisions of the GNU General Public License v. 3.
</p>

<p>
LWN is subscriber-supported, and well worth the minor expense.

Microsoft arranged for Novell to give GNU/Linux to anyone with an MS
voucher, and then proceeded to distribute those vouchers. Sounds like
distribution to me (with a middle man which isn't legally relevant).
</p>

<p>
According to the GPLv3 lawyers, they're "procuring the distribution of"
GPL'd software, and that requires permission from the copyright holder.
So Microsoft are either distributing under the permissions which the GPL
grants them, or they are violating copyright.
</p>

<p>
And, as I understand it, there's no time limit on those vouchers. Novell
might have to declare the deal non-applicable (and thus the "protection"
too) when they distribute GPLv3 software, or maybe Microsoft will have
to make that declaration.

In an eWeek article, they have a quote from "Bruce Lowry, a Novell
spokesperson" saying "Customers who have already received SUSE Linux
Enterprise certificates from Microsoft are not affected in any way by
this, since their certificates were fully delivered and redeemed prior
to the publication of the GPLv3".
</p>

<p>
So it sounds like Microsoft does not plan to be "distributing" GPL code
in this manner anymore, and that what has already been distributed is
protected the GPL's grandfather clause.
</p>

<p>
Well, that may not be a huge victory (Did anybody expect Microsoft to
suddenly give up on its patents or start GPL'ing its code because of
GPLv3 and the Novell deal ?), but it's something. It'll be interesting
to watch the GPLv3 / Novell deal interpretation match in the next few
weeks.

Quite. Moreover, this <em>does</em> affect preexisting software covered by the
Novell-Microsoft patent-shakedown agreement, too (not just future
releases under GPLv3), because a great deal of existing software in both
Novell SLES10/SLED10, per upstream licensors' terms, can be received by
users under GPLv2 or, at their option, _any later version_.
</p>

<p>
For that matter, Microsoft Services for Unix (nee Interix) is affected
in exactly the same fashion, because it, too, includes a great deal of
upstream, third-party code that users may accept under GPLv2 or any
later version.
</p>

<p>
So, this is not a consideration that could apply if Novell (and/or
Microsoft) distributes GPLv3 software in the future. They've both
already done it.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, Microsoft's uncredited "statement" is not for consumption by
judges, but rather by business partners, stock analysts, and the IT
press. You may recall this sort of fatuous and logically defective
tactic popping up frequently in Darl McBride's SCO Group playbook, too,
and the fact that it took a long time for the Laura DiDios of the world
to cease repeating it uncritically.
</p>

<p>
The correct response is to calmly point out that Microsoft Corporation
has, in fact, <em>already</em> distributed third-party GPLv3 code, irrespective
of the firm's dealings with Novell -- and ask whether Microsoft has
suddenly decided to rip off other people's copyright title, and ignore
their licensing terms, whenever it's convenient.
