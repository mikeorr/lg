<p>
please advice how much space needs to be allocated for each of the directory
of an opensuse 11.1 operating system if you intend to install it by manually
allocating space (i.e by not following the one proposed by yast2) .I'am
looking for a detailed explanation of the following directories and the
space needed (i have a 160 GB Hard Drive).also give me a general explanation
of each of the following directories (example what do they store and the
minimum space needed on a server class system)
</p>

<pre>
/
/bin
/boot
/home
/usr
/var
/tmp
/opt
/sbin
</pre>

<p>
An early reply will be greatly appriciated.
</p>

<p>
Thank you

That's not how partitioning generally works.  For what you've listed,
only /home, /usr and /var are typically mounted on to their own
partition.  /boot used to be for older reasons where the first sector
of the drive wasn't addressable, but that's rare -- so /boot just
becomes mounted under "/".

<p>
You typically want a small, "/" partition, a large "/usr" partition
and what's left for "/home" -- perhaps the following:
</p>

<pre>
5GB /
30 GB /usr
125 /home
</pre>

<p>
Oh, usual disclaimer:  should this not be what you want, don't hold me
responsible when you're then having to get gparted out to resize your
partitions.

That's not always the case.
</p>

<p>
For example, some systems default to partitioning the whole disk into
two partitions, /boot and LVM. All the other partitions are under LVM
and can be resized as and when required. The reason for /boot to be
separate is that grub (as opposed to lilo or grub2) cannot boot from
an LVM partition.
</p>

<p>
If one is not sure of how much space one wants in each partition, then
LVM is quite a useful solution --- just keep at least 100 MB for
/boot since linux is growing so fast! 
</p>

<p>
Actually, /boot was sometimes made a separate partition close to the
start of the drive because the BIOS in older machines couldn't
access the far end (past cyl 1024 or so) of large hard drives, and
the boot loader (typically LILO) used BIOS read routines to load
the kernel. Modern boot loaders on a modern BIOS don't have this
limitation.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; &gt; -- so /boot just=20
&gt; &gt; becomes mounted under "/".

<p>
Agreed.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; For example, some systems default to partitioning the whole disk into
&gt; two partitions, /boot and LVM.
</pre>

<p>
Another reason to have /boot as a separate partition would be to protect
the kernel from accidental damage. With /boot residing in the same
fs as /, the /boot directory (and it's contents) are writable,
protected only by Unix file mode bits and/or capabilities. With
/boot on a separate partition, the whole partition can be mounted
read-only, adding another layer of protection. Additionally, you
can have more than one /boot partition this way, permitting a
"recovery" boot if you feel it is necessary.

Size requirement is a particularly difficult question to answer, as it
depends on so many factors.  Primarily, the choice of file system and
it's parameters for example cluster size, determines the minimum storage
size per file.  The eventual size requirement will further depend on the
number and size of the files you decide to install.
</p>

<p>
I refer you to the LDP documentation on available file systems, to be
found at
<a href='http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Filesystems-HOWTO.html'>http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Filesystems-HOWTO.html</a>
...and further reading regarding directory structure at
<a href='http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/linuxdir.html'>http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/linuxdir.html</a>
</p>

<p>
Generally, your partitioning would include a swap partition (nominally
2x physical RAM size), a partition for your boot volume, and a partition
for the rest of the files.  So three partitions altogether.  There used
to be a constraint that your kernel must reside in BIOS addressable
space for the Lilo boot loader, but I am unsure whether this is still a
restriction for GRUB.  If this is no longer a constrant, I would simply
use two partitions- a swap and a root partition.  If the restriction
remains, your boot partition would be constrained to BIOS-addressable
partition size (varies).
</p>

<p>
Suggested configuration:  Assuming a boot partition constraint of 32GB,
a memory size of 2GB &amp; IDE drives,
<pre>
partition    size        mount
/dev/hda1    4GB         swap
/dev/hda2    4GB         /boot   (all your kernel images reside here)
/dev/hda3  152GB         /
</pre>

<p>
I have not personally tried the above, but see no reason why it should
not work.
</p>

<p>
Some people prefer mounting /usr and /home on their own partitions, but
my experience has been that there is little to gain.  Often /var and
even /tmp can be quite a space gobbler.  /var/mail in particular can be
a problem if someone is not reading their mail, or in a spam storm, or
when mail is misconfigured, and /var/log (or var/adm) stores system log
files which can grow quite quickly when there are problems.  I would
rather have the space available when it is needed than try to second
guess future needs.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, if you find the need to later add another drive, it is a
simple matter to mount it on /home, and restore your previous /home to
the new drive.
</p>

<p>
For reference, directories that change infrequently, and mostly at
installation time, and accessed mostly for read are:
<pre>
/usr, /opt, /boot, /bin, /lib, /sbin, /etc
</pre>
and directories which change often are
<pre>
/home, /var, /tmp
</pre>
... it would therefore make sense to have the last three directories
mounted on your fastest drive if you have more than one.  Symbolic links
are very useful to accomplish that.

I assume you mean "partition size being mounted on such directory e.g
/var and so on".
</p>

<p>
There's no such recommended rules of thumb. If you intend to install
many applications via RPM, IMO you need quite big /usr since the
binaries will be stored in that directory.
</p>

<p>
For typical database user e.g MySQL, /var needs to be big because it
will hold the database by default (most of my mysql package is
configured to store data in /var/mysql).
</p>

<p>
Definitely, you need adequate /home, let's say 20 GB or more. By
having separate /home, upgrading your linux system won't be too
difficult.
</p>

<p>
All in all, you need to consider using LVM these days, because it
allows you to do flexible partition management.
