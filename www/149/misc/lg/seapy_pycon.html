&gt; &gt;  From what I recalled, and as confirmed by Wikipedia, Esperanto is
&gt; &gt;  "...a language lexically predominantly Romanic... the vocabulary derives
&gt; &gt;  primarily from the Romance languages." Seems like the most probable
&gt; &gt;  projection of what you'd get when comparing the two languages is exactly
&gt; &gt;  what you got.
&gt; 
&gt; Most of the vocabulary comes from <strong>modern</strong> Romance languages.  Some
&gt; stuff does come directly from Latin ("post" being the most common),
&gt; but it's rare enough that it's an oddity.
&gt; 
&gt; Zamenhof was pretty random in sometimes choosing words in their
&gt; ancient form (post = after, patro = father), sometimes with French
&gt; idiosyncracies (preta = ready, instead of presta), and sometimes with
&gt; German idiosyncracies (lasi = to let, instead of lati), for no
&gt; apparent reason.

He knew that you'd try to speak it, and wanted to give you a few
sleepless nights.

<pre>
&gt; I'm sure there are Russian idiosyncracies too though
&gt; I can't think of any off the top of my head except:
&gt; 
&gt;     okopniki = to be a vicious pirate on the high seas
</pre>

<p>
"Okopniki" - is that plural, like it would be in Russian? I like the
idea, mind you - although I'd have to learn to wear those cheap pirate
earrings [1] and yell "Orr, matey!"
</p>


<pre>
&gt;     perle okopniki = to do the same while using Perl, or in a
&gt; Perl-like manner (e.g., shouting Haiku at your enemies)
</pre>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
"You bloody Orr-son!"
Sword-cleft head thumps deck
Wind sighs in taut silence.

<p>
[1] They cost a buck-an-ear, of course.

It's a verb.  Two Okopniks would be "du Okopnikoj".  So if there were
a story titled "How the Two Okopniks Quarreled", it would be "Kiel la
du Okopnikoj kverelis".
</p>

<p>
If one of them were a female named Kat, you could use the dual-gender
prefix "ge":
"Kiel la du Geokopnikoj kverelis".

All this Esperanto stuff is just a cover - you just wanted to say "Kill
the two Okopniks querulous" in your private language. See, I happen to
know that "Esperanto" is <em>almost</em> an anagram of "resonates" [1] - which
makes it obvious, yes, *obvious*! - that you want to take over the
world. You madman.

<p>
I hereby assure you that Kat is not dual-gender; I have proof. (He is
currently intently inspecting his bellybutton while contemplatively
chewing on a book.)

<p>
[1] _Of course_ I wrote a script. How the hell else would I know that?
