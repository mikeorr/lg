  <p> <strong>Hello, First of all, I like to thank you guys for this great &quot;Gazette&quot;. 
    I realy do enjoy it !!! </strong></p>
  <p><strong>I'm trying to build the stepper motor driver, that you published 
    in issue 122. While reading the code, I have a little remark. I'm not quite 
    sure that I'm right, but ... what do I have to loose :D </strong></p>
  <p><strong>On line 20 : &quot;static int pattern[2][8][8] = {&quot; </strong></p>
  <p><strong>Shouldn't that be pattern[2][2][8] ?</strong></p>
  <p><strong> Like I said before, I'm not sure of this ... just wondering ... 
    </strong></p>
  <p><strong>Thanks again for your nice work, all of you</strong></p>

<p>[Jason] - Thanks! It's great to hear from readers.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>I went and looked at that author's code, and it sure looks like you're right. 
    Note that it doesn't hurt anything to declare the array as larger than you 
    need it, but it's probably not the best style.</p>
  <p>There's a few other things in that code that I might have done differently. 
    For instance, his &quot;step&quot; function looks like this:</p>
  <pre class="code">int step()
{
        if(k<8) {
//              if(pattern[i][j][k]==0) {
//                      k=0; 
//                      printk("%d\n",pattern[i][j][k]);
//                      k++;
//              }
//              else {
                        printk("%d\n",pattern[i][j][k]);
                        k++;
//      }	
        }
        else  {
                k=0;
                printk("%d\n",pattern[i][j][k]); /*#####*/
                k++; /*#####*/
        }
        return 0;
}</pre>
  <p>Note that this does not have the exact same behavior as the original function. 
    In the original function, after step() returns, k is in range [1,8], inclusive. 
    In the version I give, k is kept in the range [0,7], inclusive, which is the 
    correct range if k is being used as the index of an array of length 8. </p>
  <p>Unless I'm really missing something, I don't think the actual code to write 
    the parallel port was included in that article.</p>
  <p>Thanks for taking the time to point this out.</p>

 <p><strong>Hi,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Could you please change address my website in the article <a href="../124/dutta.html">http://linuxgazette.net/124/dutta.html</a> 
  published in MArch,2006 issue of linuxgazette.net</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can get more details and photos related to this project at <a href="http://www.myjavaserver.com/~thelinuxmaniac/isa">http://www.myjavaserver.com/~thelinuxmaniac/isa</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>The website address has changed from mycgiserver.com to myjavaserver.com</strong></p>
<p><strong> --<br>
  Abhishek</strong></p>
<p>[Thomas] - I wouldn't have thought so. Most of the mirrors have probably synched 
  by now, not to mention copious other sources. By changing your article now, 
  that's be known as a <em>fork</em> -- something not desirable at all.</p>
<p>[[Ben]] - Even more importantly - since 'creating a fork' for already-published 
  content doesn't bother me much - it would be essentially pointless; we currently 
  have nearly 60 mirrors and several translation sites, and the only site that 
  we can change is ours (i.e., the root site.) In other words, even if we change 
  it - which I'll do, since it's trivial - anyone searching for your article will 
  still be about 70 times more likely to find the old address rather than the 
  new one.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>For anyone contemplating writing an article, this is why I encourage including 
    the pertinent images, sources, etc. as part of the submission: external links 
    die. The author's details - including the URL in their bio - are flexible, 
    since the bios are reloaded monthly by all the mirrors; the article content, 
    once published, is essentially frozen in time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Thomas] - The best you can hope for is that I/we/someone publishes this request 
  in the gazette for next month. ;) Of course, given that the talkback feature 
  points here, and not to your personal address, you can at least be assured that 
  any correspondence will reach us and not some void.</p>
<p>[[Ben]] - Excellent point, Thomas! I hadn't considered that particular benefit 
  of it.</p>

  <p> <strong>How would you configure this setup to use usb speakers for each 
    user. I think the ideal solution would be to have a usb keyboard with a built 
    in usb hub that has two usb slots, so you can plug in your mouse and usb speakers. 
    Any thoughts?</strong></p>
<p>[Jimmy] - That would solve the simpler problem: that of having the speakers 
  close  
  to the user; it wouldn't address the other difficulties of using  
  multiple sound cards: of ensuring that the intended sound is directed to  
  the correct sound card, in particular.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Ob. mailing list requests: please don't send HTML email (there's a not-so-tenuous 
    connection between postal workers and the frequenters of mailing lists: you 
    have been warned :), and should you reply, please don't top post: top posting 
    makes the Baby {Jesus, Buddha, Xenu, etc.} cry. :)</p>
  <p>If you understood my first paragraph, feel free to stop reading, as (bearing 
    in mind that e-mail to this list is intended for publication) there is a fairly 
    common misconception here; otherwise: USB is smart, but not <strong>that</strong> smart - 
    the fact that devices are located close to each other physically is not communicated 
    to the OS (that is, the system can't tell that soundcard A is connected to 
    keyboard A, soundcard B to keyboard B, etc.), which is therefore unable to 
    act accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[Karl-Heinz]] - If the keyboard is its own hub -- the usb tree hierarchy should 
  be quite able to mirror the physical proximity. I've not read the beginning 
  of this thread -- but I can imagine a setup with two heads and two keyboards 
  where &quot;usb speakers&quot; are dedicated to sound produced on one of the 
  heads. </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Just don't expect a standard distribution to do this for you -- this is manual 
    configuration and it can not be saved in the users settings (like kde) if 
    the users could be on either head.... pam extensions like group setting on 
    login for devices like audio might be able help with the setup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[Ben]]] - Interesting idea, that. I can imagine a system - something like LDAP 
  in general scope if not in implementation - that assigns configured user resources 
  from the available pool... hm, wish I knew a bit more about creating a project 
  like that. It wouldn't even have to involve kernel programming, since everything 
  could be done at the USB level.</p>

<p>[BobS] - Not really. There is a new nVidia driver which does not fix the problem. 
  Two members of the Xephyr project have written to say that the problem I'm seeing 
  is due to a reset problem in the nVidia driver. Their solution is to run several 
  X sessions inside one big X session. This way the boards only get reset once.

 <p> <strong>To whom it may concern,</strong></p>
<p><strong>This article by Mr. Smith is amazing. In my opinion, this is the solution 
  all 3rd world countries are looking for to keep hardware cost down. I know the 
  technology is not perfect yet, but it is a great start. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Anyway, does this setup allow each workstation to have their own audio? 
  How about network/LAN gaming? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time,</strong></p>
<p><strong>izzy</strong></p>
<p>[Ben] - Well, the former was noted as a problem in the article; there has also 
  been some discussion on the issue. What it looks like to me is that it would 
  be possible to make this available with a little work in the kernel - but it 
  would either take someone experienced in audio and kernel hacking, or convincing 
  the current maintainers that this is necessary. Conversely, individual external 
  (USB) sound devices might be a solution.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The latter does not seem like it would be a problem at all as long as the 
    CPU and the memory is up to it; most of the load in gaming, as I understand 
    it, is on the video card - and every user has one of their own in that configuration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[Izzy]] - Thanks for the reply, it was really helpful. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Last February Mr. Smith posted a message on <a href="http://blog.chris.tylers.info">http://blog.chris.tylers.info</a>

  <pre>  &quot;The system is VERY unstable. I get a kernel oops
  fairly often when a user logs out. Has anyone seen
  this problem before? Any ideas on how to fix it? Also,
  any suggestions to improve my article?
  thanks,
  Bob Smith&quot;</pre>
  <p>Also, there was a couple of replies after this message and showed how to 
    solve the problem by downgrading the nvidia drivers. Has Mr. Smith tried the

 <p><strong>I can see the comics. What's wrong with the old good image formats? 
  Why not PNG or JPG?</strong> </p>
<p>[Rick] - Guys, plainly we need to FAQ this.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Diego, this was discussed in the prior issue (#124). Please see: <a href="../124/misc/nottag/flash.html">http://linuxgazette.net/124/misc/nottag/flash.html</a></p>
  <p>Note open-source (reverse-engineered) Flash implementations in various degrees 
    of completion, detailed at <a href="http://osflash.org/">http://osflash.org/</a> . Note also excellent and 
    authoritative analysis by Kapil Hari Paranjape at the first URL cited. (Kapil 
    views HelpDex using the open-source swfplayer software, which he finds adequate 
    to the task. I recommend that plus the Flashblock browser extension, <a href="http://flashblock.mozdev.org/">http://flashblock.mozdev.org/</a>, 
    so that you retain the ability to view Flash only when <em>you</em> wish, not when 
    some advertiser so dictates.) </p>
  <p>Diego, you're welcome to work with us every month to convert the Ecol comic 
    strip to formats you prefer -- without the results sucking, please -- or become 
    a cartoonist and start sending us good cartoons in a graphics format you prefer. 
    Otherwise, your answer would seem to be as above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[Ben]] - I don't know that an FAQ entry would be of much use; in my estimate, 
  the percentage of our readers who have looked at our FAQ is very small.</p>
<p>[[[Rick]]] - Interestingly, one of the less-appreciated but substantial benefits 
  of a FAQ has nothing to do with whether people ever bother to read it before 
  asking its questions or re-raising its tired old subjects. That is: When somebody 
  <em>does</em> go there for the 1000th time, you can definitively answer, with near-zero 
  effort, with just a URL.</p>
<p>[[[[Ben]]]] - Which presumes remembering the URL in question... but I do see your 
  point. That &quot;secondary&quot; use of the FAQ has even more benefits than 
  I thought - all natural consequences, to be sure, but my mind wasn't quite twisty 
  enough to see all the rami. In short, kudos. </p>
<p>[[[[[Rick]]]]] - Why, thank you, sir. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You might enjoy the slightly cranky bit of documentation that I posted to 
    the prototype wiki replacement for Silicon Valley Linux User Group's Web site 
    (on one of Heather's machines), starting with header &quot;Standards, Nits, 
    Peeves&quot; on this page: </p>
  <p><a href="http://gemini.starshine.org/SVLUG/Teams/Web_Team">http://gemini.starshine.org/SVLUG/Teams/Web_Team</a></p>
  <p>I was definitely getting in touch with the curmudgeon within, when I wrote 
    this entry:</p>
<pre>
   website/Website: No such word. Correct to "Web site".

   No, there's nothing wrong with inventing new words, especially where
   they make our language more expressive and fill a need not met by
   existing words. This one doesn't qualify, and is really just the result
   of people being sloppy. Some would call our cleaning it and similar
   things off our pages "prescriptivism"; I prefer the term "leadership".
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[Rick]]] - Over the years, I've used this trick to dispose of innumerable topics 
  after getting tired of discussing them. My first-level expectation is that hardly 
  anyone will read my answers until I send their URLs. Note: I <em>do</em> take advantage 
  of that expectation to expose readers to adjoining text on related questions.</p>
<p>[[[[Ben]]]] - Sneaky. And useful.</p>
<p>[[Ben]] - However, it might make sense to add some sort of a note regarding 
  this issue to the top of the strip. I'll give the wording some thought and glue 
  it in. </p>
<p>[[[Rick]]] - My opinion, yours with a small fee and disclaimer of reverse-engineering 
  rights: Less is better. E.g.,</p>
<blockquote> '' Format: Flash '' 
  <p>...where &quot;Flash&quot; is anchor text hyperlinking to a FAQ, for which 
    <a href="../124/misc/nottag/flash.html">http://linuxgazette.net/124/misc/nottag/flash.html</a> might serve nicely.</p>
  <p>Metacomment: Computerists tend to overestimate public willingness to deal 
    with explanatory text. The public at large tends to react badly to verbosity, 
    assuming its contents to be</p>
  <ul>
    <li>unimportant, and/or</li>
    <li> open to debate</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is why we have &quot;STOP&quot; signs, rather than &quot;Stop, though 
    of course there are lots of exceptions including the need to do anything required 
    to avoid dangerous situations&quot; signs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[Ben]]]] - [laugh] Kat just finished her Power Squadron course (scored 100% on 
  her test, woo-hoo!); this is almost exactly the phrasing used for right-of- 
  way rules in navigation. Which is why, I suspect, so many people screw up in 
  that regard.</p>
<p>[[Suramya]] - Umm... I have a low tech approach to converting the Ecol comic 
  strips from flash:</p>
		
<blockquote> 
  <p>Click on the link to view the flash file, take a screen shot and save it 
    in the format you want. Sample output:</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.suramya.com/Temp/HelpDex.jpg">http://www.suramya.com/Temp/HelpDex.jpg</a></p>
  <p>:)</p>
  <p>If I get the files early enough I volunteer to do this. But let me know what 
    you think of this...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[Ben]]] - 1) At the moment, there's no way to do actual thumbnails linked to 
  full-size images in the cartoon section. Changing that would require twiddling 
  Mike's Python scripts - and I'd have no idea how to do that. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>2) JPG files are significantly larger than the equivalent SWFs - and go all 
    jaggy when viewed at anything but &quot;native&quot; size (unless, of course, 
    you go with an even larger file size.) E.g.:</p>
  <pre class="code">:-r!ls -l /tmp/Help*
-rw-r--r-- 1 ben root 80715 2006-04-06 12:50 /tmp/HelpDex.jpg
-rw-rw-rw- 1 ben root 18546 2005-12-06 21:21 /tmp/HelpDex.swf
</pre>
  <p>Add a thumbnail to that, and we've got a big chunk'o'download - for no gain 
    (and, in fact, image quality loss.)</p>
  <p>3) The issue is - except for the very rare complaint - settled. There's Open 
    Source viewing software available, which seems to work fine, and those who 
    complain will now be redirected (either from here or from the link on the 
    page itself) to the discussion covering it.</p>
  <p>So - thank you for the offer, Suramya, but there's no need. It's all good 
    to go.</p>

    than the other - just different. Implying otherwise, especially without supporting 
    data, is rather inconsiderate toward the person/people who took the time to 
    write the software that you don't like.</p>
  <p> [1] This is a (perhaps somewhat testy) way of pointing out that saying &quot;program 
    $X is good&quot; does NOT require adding &quot;because program $Y sucks&quot; 
    for the purpose of emphasizing the former; there's no subordinate clause implied. 
    Since this is not the world of proprietary software, in which vendors are 
    fighting tooth and nail to sell their latest crap-a-riffic bugware, *we do 
    not have to denigrate competing software* - it brings us, as a community, 
    no benefit, and may do damage to a fellow programmer's reputation. So, yeah, 
    this hits the rant button for me.</p>

<p>[[Andr&eacute;]] - My sincere excuses!!!</p>

  <p> I forgot to mention that my &quot;seems&quot; is not to consider!</p>

<p>[[[Ben]]] - Relax - my mini-rant was a generalized one. I replied to your statement, 
  but it's about more than that; it's about an important consideration for the 
  Linux community in general. We should always be striving to support each other, 
  not tear each other down.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Often, operating in the world of Open Source requires re-thinking the &quot;standard&quot; 
    ways of interacting with the other people involved. This differs from what 
    we're generally used to, but is usually easy to adapt to: substituting cooperation 
    for competition, especially when the benefits are obvious and immediate, presents 
    little difficulty for most people.</p>
  <p>It does, however, require thinking about it ahead of time - which is what 
    I'm trying to get people to do with my rant. Thanks for the opportunity. :)</p>

<p>[[Andr&eacute;]] - My intention was to tell you guys about the BrazilFW, the 
  Coyote sucessor. Like Coyote, BrazilFW have many addons to improve its funcionality. 
  The &quot;seems&quot; part was because I thinked you guys could make an article 
  comparing both and its funcionalities.</p>
<p>[[[Ben]]] - Well, we don't generally write articles - but we do accept well-written 
  ones on Linux-related topics. If you'd like to write one about BrazilFW, I'd 
  be happy to look at it.</p>
<p>[[Andr&eacute;]] - This is the point of the information. Really sorry if I wasn't

 <p><strong>Hello,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I was intrigued by this article about DDoS. It's something one hears 
  about more and more, and so I thought I'd give it a go, and play along at home. 
  Ben, I don't know just what percentage of the original article remains, having 
  done the rewrite on it (something that I agree with, especially in terms of 
  attribution), but I would have liked it if the original author could have expanded 
  on a few things...</strong></p>
<pre class="code">  *  Check if your CPU load is high and you a have large number of HTTP 
     process running</pre>
<p><strong>Heh. Yes, I quite agree. But so what? I mean, how are you supposed 
  to distinguish that from most other processing that goes on? A simple 'w' isn't 
  going to help you much there. It's pretty normal for most CPUs to peak. </strong></p>
<p><strong>As for the HTTP process, this is typically mitigated by setting the 
  following in /etc/apache/httpd.conf to a reasonable value:</strong></p>
<pre class="code">  MaxClients 30 </pre>
<p><strong>Now, the Apache folks make it quite clear that this should not be set 
  too low, blah, blah. But for a small-end server (perhaps even one running on 
  a home ADSL-connection) setting this to something perhaps lower than 30 in this 
  case would help in stopping Apache from consuming everything.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Then there's the following command:</strong></p>
<pre class="code">  ps -aux|grep -i HTTP|wc -l   </pre>
<p><strong>I know I can be pedantic at times, but on non-BSD systems the leading 
  '-' causes issues, not to mention the classic &quot;You'll return grep too&quot; 
  syndrome, as well as the useless use of 'wc' (this isn't for your benefit, Ben, 
  more the original author):</strong></p>
<pre class="code">  ps aux | grep -ic '[h]ttp'</pre>
<pre class="code">  *  Determine the attacking network </pre>
<p><strong>This section was quite good. Note that, as mentioned before, the number 
  of concurrent connections via Apache can be capped. Again, the command:</strong></p>
<pre class="code">  netstat -lpn|grep :80|awk '{print $5}'|sort </pre>
<p><strong>Can be reduced to:</strong></p>
<pre class="code">  netstat -lpn | awk '/:80/ {print $5}' | sort </pre>
<p><strong>(Too many people seem to think Awk only understands columns in terms 
  of quoting printed ouput. Such a shame.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>It's worth mentioning here the use of PAM and chroots. A slight side-note 
  is that in any DDoS attack, the targeted process or thread is generally going 
  to expand as the load increases on it. This is generally undesirable, and so 
  one can tell PAM to employ memory usage limits via /etc/security/limits.conf 
  (think ulimit for processes). As for the chroots, running various processes 
  inside those can encapsulate their environment away from everything else.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I also couldn't see what the following code was supposed to do:</strong></p>
<pre class="code">  for f in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*/rp_filter  
  do 
          echo 1 &gt; done  
          echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies  </pre>
<p><strong>I assume that's meant to read:</strong></p>
<pre class="code">  for f in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*/rp_filter  
  do 
          echo 1 &gt; &quot;$f&quot; 
  done

  echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies </pre>
<p><strong>Hmm. This reads as though I've picked the hell out of the article for 
  no apparent reason -- far from it. I hope these little tidbits of information 
  will prove useful. By all means feel free to forward these comments on to the

  <p>That's not much to do with peaks. (Just FYI, I avoided changing the actual

  <p>Right, but he's talking about a server in a data center - I believe that 
    was mentioned right at the beginning.</p>

  <p><strong>Hi,</strong></p>
  <p><strong>if I am the 10000th to mention, sorry for that ...</strong></p>
  <p><strong>The last script snippet looks a bit weird:</strong></p>
<pre class="code">   -----------------------------------------------------
   for f in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*/rp_filter 
   do
   	echo 1 &gt; done 
   	echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies 
   -----------------------------------------------------</pre>
  <p><strong>How about this:</strong></p>
<pre class="code">   -----------------------------------------------------
   for f in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*/rp_filter
   do
        echo 1 &gt; $f
   done
   echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies
   -----------------------------------------------------</pre>
  <p><strong>As to the syncookies thing: I am not quite sure, but if you have 
    already put the line</strong></p>
<pre class="code">   net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1</pre>
  <p><strong>into the sysctl.conf - what is the syncookies line in the rc.local 
    for?</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Regards,<br>
    Ulrich</strong></p>
<p>[Ben] - Come to think of it, it's only a couple of days after publication - 
  and the error is egregious enough that it shouldn't be propagated. [sounds of 
  axes, sawing, hammering, copying, and pasting [1] in the background] All fixed 
  now.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>How about this instead:</p>

<p>[[Thomas]] - Horses for courses -- both ways'll work.</p>
<p>[Ben] - </p>
<blockquote>

  <p>Right; that should have been (and now is) worded as</p>
  <pre>  Conversely, you could add this code to your '/etc/rc.local':  </pre>
</blockquote>
<p>[[Thomas]] - But this is still wrong. /etc/rc.local is not honoured across all 
  Linux distributions. SuSE and RH use it (although SuSE for a time used to only 
  honour /etc/local.rc). RH uses /etc/rc.boot. Debian, for instance, has /etc/bootmisc.sh, 
  but one shouldn't go changing that arbitrarily anyway (it'll get overwritten 
  when 'initscripts' is updated). For the Debian people, one can create the following 
  directory:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>   /etc/rc.boot</pre>
  <p>... and place any scripts in there, ensuring that the directory and<br>
    scripts themselves have octal permissions '755'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[Ben]]] - That would be the reason for the word &quot;conversely&quot;, so I 
  wouldn't call it &quot;wrong&quot; - just different. Is there a distro out there 
  that doesn't have an &quot;/etc/sysctl.conf&quot;? I thought that was pretty 
  much universal in Linux.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>On the gripping hand, there's also the fact that we don't purport to cover 
    all distros - although I like to encourage authors to broaden those &quot;$DISTRO_OF_CHOICE-only&quot; 
    articles into something a bit more useful. The way I figure it is, mentioning 
    a couple of different methods should suffice to clue people in about adapting 
    it to their specifics. If you have a better suggestion that will, without 
    fail, cover any and every distro (including the one that I'm creating right 
    now for the specific purpose of evading whatever solution you come up with 
    :), I'd like to hear it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Ulrich] - SuSE uses /etc/init.d/boot.local (among a lot of other boot.* files).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>BTW, as we are collecting the locations of the script to put the code into 
    - Gentoo uses /etc/conf.d/local.start</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Ben] - Between Thomas Adam (who first noted the problem) and yourself, you 
  two have managed to get me off my lazy butt and fix it. Consider yourselves 
  promoted, and entitled to wear The Grand and Sublime Order Of The Linux Gazette 
  [2]. Thank you, congratulations, and may you remain worthy of this high honor!

  and to encourage people to send half-written articles. Maybe postponing an article

<p><strong>Well, that's my brainstorming. English is not my native language, but

<blockquote>
  <pre>  &gt; Hello, Linuxgazette!</pre>
  <p>Hi, Ren&eacute;! Good to hear from you again.</p>
  <pre>    &gt; I read Ben's introduction to the &quot;Preventing DDoS attacks&quot; article. I
    &gt; can imagine that you get lots of submissions like this.</pre>
  <p>These days, it's averaging a bit more than one per month.</p>
  <pre>    &gt; I've given the
    &gt; idea of having stand-by co-authors some thought. I like the suggestion
    &gt; very much, especially if it helps to &quot;rescue&quot; content which could
    &gt; interest a wide audience.</pre>
  <p>The original suggestion came from my wife, Kat, some months ago. Ever 
    since then, I'd been planning to write a Back Page (i.e., get up on my 
    soapbox), propose the idea, and invite participation - but somehow never 
    got around to it. Except, of course, now - in a fit of desperation.</p>
  <pre>    &gt; However this is clearly much more than
    &gt; proofreading. It involves communication with the author, and it requires
    &gt; a change of style, obviously. I think it is a challenge to walk the fine
    &gt; line between helping someone and completely changing the original idea
    &gt; into something very different.</pre>
  <p>Indeed. Many of these articles express an important viewpoint that's 
    just poorly-enough stated, or address an interesting technical point but 
    fail technical review by an amount just beyond trivial. If it's a case 
    of pointing out the errors to the author and having them do a rewrite, 
    or perhaps directing them to try restating their point a bit better, 
    fine - as I keep telling people, &quot;there's always the next issue&quot;. 
    But 
    what if the problem is caused by the author lacking just that tiny bit 
    of knowledge, or that edge of ability to express themselves well in what 
    may be a foreign languge? I hate to turn those down because I can see 
    many of these authors trying their best, and missing by just -&gt;that&lt;- 
    much. If we can find some volunteers, this would be a great resource.</p>
  <pre>    &gt; I am teaching at a technical academy here in Vienna. I supervised and
    &gt; helped several students working on their graduation. Last year a student
    &gt; submitted a piece of work that we could not accept, even with all the
    &gt; best intentions. We gave the student a long list of improvements and had
    &gt; him rewrite the whole thing from scratch.</pre>
  <p>I almost never simply turn an article down; if I reject one, I'll have a 
    long list of suggestions and examples that an author could use to 
    improve their article <em>and</em> learn to write better articles overall. This 
    is, as I see it, one of the duties of an editor.</p>
  <pre>    &gt; Of course this is a different
    &gt; approach, because no one can assume co-authorship for a diploma our
    &gt; students are supposed to write alone.</pre>
  <p>What??? &quot;Alone&quot;, as in &quot;by themselves&quot;? Shocking. If 
    it wasn't for those 
    famous co-authors, Messieurs Ibid, Opcit, and Anon, I suspect that fully 
    90% of the modern &quot;original contributions&quot; would never have seen 
    the 
    light of day. :)</p>
  <pre>    &gt; Nevertheless it illustrates the
    &gt; point of enabling someone else to improve something.
    &gt; 
    &gt; Provided you have a pool of stand-by co-authors and co-authorship is

    &gt; in such a case. I don't think that it is a good idea to advertise this
    &gt; as a feature and to encourage people to send half-written articles.</pre>
  <p>[Nod] All joking aside, those are wise suggestions. I think that 
    half-baked articles have a substantially different quality from the ones 
    that I find to be this sort of a moral dillemma, and I have no problem 
    bouncing those back to the author - but, yes, co-authors would be a 
    resource to be assigned with care and forethought.</p>
  <pre>    &gt; Well, that's my brainstorming. English is not my native language, but in
    &gt; case you want to create a pool of helping hands that co-author and

  <p>Ren&eacute;, I'll take your diction and clarity of expression over many a
    native English speaker I've known - no joke. Your offer is gladly
    accepted. I don't know that I'll have anyone to send to you anytime soon
    (I'll be filtering submissions very carefully in this regard), but I'll
    definitely keep this possibility in mind. Thank you!</p>

    gather from his bio - I can see why he'd be constrained to COBOL and such.</p>
  <pre>&gt; It would have been nice if the original code/cobol code had been
&gt; linked to or a summary or explaination of the programs function was 
&gt; included.....</pre>
  <p>Well, I seriously doubt that Edgar's free to release his customer's code 
    for everybody's perusal. I agree, it would be nice if the world ran on Open 
    Source principles by default, and that it would indeed be interesting to see 
    what the original programming task was - just so people can snark at the complexity 
    and re-do it all in three lines of Perl or whatever - but that's not how things 
    are. Until we take over, at least. :)</p>

<p>[[Jimmy]] - Ah, Cobol. Not the reason I dropped out of college (that was RPG), 
  but a damn close second place.</p>
<p>[[Edgar]] - I won't try to one-up Ben's responses to the substantive issues. 
  We readers know why we keep him around...</p>
<p>[[[Ben]]] - Thanks, Edgar - I appreciate the implied compliment.</p>
<p>[[Edgar]] - But essentially you and I have no dispute. Your objections/questions are 
    all very reasonable. As I remarked to Ben, given a choice, I would prefer 
    C over any other programming language I have ever used. Regarding the article, 
    in retrospect it might have made sense to do things a bit differently. Some 
    background.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Although I have been using Linux since SuSE 5.0, I still consider myself 
    somewhat a newbie. Several decades of mainframe experience have inured me 
    against the daily slings and arrows. But even a casual reading of my articles 
    likely elicits no more than a polite &quot;ho, hum&quot; from the members 
    of TAG. A while back I discovered how easy it is for even a newbie to do things 
    that might sound intimidating, to a newbie. I'm addressing newbies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[Ben]]] - Just to expand on that point a bit - that's one of the types of articles 
  I'm always looking for. In fact, one of my larger challenges in vetting, editing, 
  and writing articles is to keep or access that &quot;beginner's mind&quot; - 
  and it's not an easy one. I'm always appreciative of new Linux users who can 
  write well about their experiences - this is one of the most important types 
  of articles in LG.</p>
<p>[[Edgar]] - As I was writing the article, I was concerned the problem itself 
  might be getting too much &quot;air time&quot; as it were. But I doubt most 
  newbies have done anything in Assembler. Any Assembler. And COBOL?</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>When I submitted the article, Ben properly chastised me for mentioning that 
    5-letter-word. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[Ben]]] - Ah-ah-ah! I did <em>not.</em> I did, however, poke some gentle fun at you 
  about it. :)</p>
<p>[[Edgar]] - But I felt it necessary to motivate what I went through and to explain 
  it in enough detail to make the problem understandable.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The point I really wanted to make -- and it may not have come across well 
    -- was that Open Source might be of help where one wouldn't necessarily expect 
    it and that it needn't be terribly difficult to install a package not part 
    of the distribution you are using.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[Ben]]] - This is, in fact, how I took it; that's been a wonderful part of my 
  Linux experience as well. The Open Source nature of it seems to spawn effort 
  and creativity in people who wouldn't normally give a rat's ass about writing 
  software, and motivates others who would otherwise let their ideas die without 
  expression. As an example, some years ago I ran across a Linux tool that translated 
  Norton Guide databases - something that made me very, very happy, since it allowed 
  me to convert some very useful data I'd thought of as lost. Another author had 
  rewritten the first IDE for C/C++ that I'd ever used under DOS (Borland's Turbo 
  C++) as a Linux prog (RHIDE), which was responsible for a wonderful bout with 
  nostalgia. :) There are <strong>lots</strong> of examples, many people doing wonderful things 
  simply because the environment is available, there's nearly infinite room to 
  play in, and you get full credit for your work.</p>
<p>[[Edgar]] - To that extent it might as well have been Pascal to C. Except that 
  that wouldn't even deserve &quot;ho, hum&quot;.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>For precisely the reasons mentioned by Ben the code in the article is not 
    even the code dealt with, although functionally equivalent. And long-term 
    it is not a question of one, single program. This is far more than merely 
    proof of concept. The people I am doing this with long ago left the starting 
    blocks. And there is reason to believe that many other companies need quickly 
    to get away from Assembler into something else main-stream. Anything! Before 
    their last remaining Assembler programmer retires.</p>
  <p>But, Trevor, you have given me a very interesting idea.</p>
  <p>I need to check this out, but I am fairly confident that C is an intermediary 
    step in the compilation process, under Linux. I'm the only one in this crowd 
    regularly using Linux, but not C. The code might be ugly. I need to look into 
    it. But down the road...?</p>
  <p>Thanks for your comments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[Ben]]] - I'll be looking forward to <em>that</em> article, too. :)</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>As to package installation - heck, most interesting things are already available 
    as packages, especially in distros that make a point of it. When I find something 
    on the Net that I'd like to install, I usually check for an existing Debian 
    package containing it - and find it in better than half the cases.</p>

Description: COBOL compiler
 OpenCOBOL implements substantial part of the COBOL 85 and COBOL 2002
 standards, as well as many extensions of the existent compilers.  OpenCOBOL
 translates COBOL into C and compiles the translated code using GCC.

<p>[[[[Trevor]]]] - Well guys I'd better explain what went through my mind when I read 
  the article, it went something like &quot;This guy's creating a problem' now 
  my experience and current nightmare is legacy code, where I'm at (I work for 
  IBM on uk government outsourcing projects) we have a number of older systems 
  that need modified, updated and in many cases replaced. The cost of hiring people 
  with 'legacy' skill sets which these days increasingly includes COBOL is high. 
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>One day that piece of COBOL will need either it's function modified or the 
    hardware will be replaced (nothing lasts for ever) with an off the shelf x86/opteron 
    commodity server (hopefully running Linux) and someone will have to re-do 
    the work and that might meaning having to hire an expensive contractor or 
    re-write the whole system in some other language and that is a cost that could, 
    at least in part, have been avoided.</p>
  <p>I have seen huge amounts of time and money spent dealing with this type of 
    'patching up' it's my pet hate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[[Ben]]]]] - Sure; anyone who's been a programming consultant for any length of 
  time has seen this, and it's always the same kind of double-bind. However, this 
  is also exactly the situation I had in mind when I quoted the Golden Rule - 
  what most of us neglect to consider, at least when we first run into the situatuon, 
  is the financial/operations end of the problem from the client's point of view. 
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>When a client (whose entire codebase consists of, say, COBOL) discovers that 
    he needs to patch/modify/fix/tweak/whatever that codebase, the first questions 
    that arise will inevitably be these:</p>
  <p>1) What will it cost?</p>
  <p> 2) How much of an interruption of business will it create?</p>
  <p>In the case of the first question, a patch - or even a large series of patches 
    or mods - is usually much cheaper than a complete rewrite, especially when 
    that codebase is large. So, the decision to patch, and keep patching some 
    obscure horror that can only be fixed by one doddering wizard (all others 
    having either croaked or switched to Java, which is essentially the same thing 
    :) is pretty much the default - absent some immediately-pending and obvious 
    (or already extant) catastrophe. Trying to convince clients that it's going 
    to happen before that point will mark you as a doom-sayer with a sly second 
    agenda, and will <em>not</em> result in happy relations with that client.</p>
  <p>In the case of the second question, the problem is even worse - far worse. 
    A patch - even if it's relatively major - can usually be rolled back fairly 
    easily in case of problems; a complete replacement - which usually involves 
    system changes (hardware, configuration, OS change) cannot. Certainly not 
    easily. Can you, or any programmer, guarantee that bugs - even major ones 
    - will not show up after the replacement, and take the business out of operation 
    for some length of time? The answer is, of course, no - and so, a complete 
    rewrite is very risky.</p>
  <p>In short, clients usually hate rewrites, and love patches - and if you keep 
    wishing that it wasn't otherwise, you'll only get frustrated. I learned, a 
    long time ago, to take my satisfaction in charging all the market will bear 
    for overtime, etc. when the crash <em>does</em> come; verbal &quot;I told you so&quot;s 
    bring no more than transient satisfaction, and put no money in your pocket. 
    :) By that time, I tend to be uniquely qualified as The Right Programmer to 
    do the job - since I've used the patching process to study the client's entire 
    business flow (as it relates to the software) and can not only write the new 
    code but know how and where the system can be improved.</p>
  <p>Looking at this kind of thing as an opportunity rather than a problem has, 
    over time, proven to be very rewarding. :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[[Edgar]]]]] - Hi Trevor, I hope you don't feel that &quot;we&quot; are picking 
  on you. This wasn't orchestrated. I still have essentially your attitude but 
  a few years ago resigned myself to the fact that the real world is as described 
  by Ben. About 5 years ago I quit telling everyone who might understand that 
  we need to get away from Assembler. As an outside consultant I don't have access 
  to the appropriate managers and they wouldn't understand the problem anyhow.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Basically I'm as frustrated as you are. But I have learned to live with it 
    and don't lose any sleep over the situation. That the managers are incompetent 
    is clear when you consider that I am now the only one left with Assembler 
    skills. An outsider! Unexpectedly, I spent a couple of weeks off work this 
    year due to skin cancer (taken care of) and during that time absolutely nothing 
    happened at work, in spite of the fact that we had a deadline of 31 March. 
    How can they sleep at night if they understand the situation?!</p>
  <p>That is my major customer at the moment, government service. I can't speak 
    about the UK but I am now convinced that the government service systems in 
    Germany and the USA cannot be reformed and need to be junked. I'm not going 
    to start a campaign and it of course won't happen. But if the tax-payers were 
    aware of the money wasted and the virtual sabotage on the part of too-highly-rated 
    civil servants...</p>
  <p>In the case of converson to COBOL, that is a project for someone I have twice 
    worked for and have known for well over 30 years. The customer, for whatever 
    reasons, wants to move from Assembler to COBOL. My guess is that the rest 
    of what they have is in COBOL and if that in fact is the case, the decision 
    is not completely wrong. At least it is a simplification of their computing 
    environment.</p>
  <p>By the way, in both cases I am dealing with financial computing, i.e. BIG 
    mainframes. Until discovering Open COBOL and GMP I wasn't aware that decimal 
    arithmetic was readily available outside the mainframe world. Well, back in 
    8080 and Z-80 days I used DAA, 'nuff said.</p>
  <p>I'm afraid, as much as I don't want to admit it, Ben once again is right. 
    The world just ain't the way we'd like it. When I did my military service 
    there was an expression: shit floats. Basically Peter was an optimist, if 
    only incompetence were readily recognizable at the level where it first floats! 
    But somehow, perhaps as it rots and begins to stink, it seems to take up more 
    space and float even higher.</p>
  <p>Sadly, too many people, like Billy, could sell SNOW to Eskimos.</p>
  <p>Don't give up trying to do things right. But don't let it get to you psychologically.</p>
