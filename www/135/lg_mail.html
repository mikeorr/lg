&gt; Hi all!

</pre>
Hi.
</p>

<pre>
&gt; I recently installed FC5 and FC6 on a newly acquired AMD 2800+ Sempron
&gt; processor(64-bit). There are a few things i would like to get cleared
&gt; 
&gt; 1. While the packages were being copied, I noticed the i386 extension
&gt; packages being copied. Isnt i386 supposed to mean intel 80386?
</pre>

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386</a>
</p>

<p>
"IA-32, sometimes generically called x86-32, is the instruction set architecture
of Intel's most successful microprocessors.
This is a 32-bit extension of the original Intel x86 processor architecture.
The term means Intel Architecture, 32-bit, distinguishing it from the preceding
16-bit x86 processors, and the later 64-bit architecture IA-64, also known as the Itanium architecture.
IA-32 has had such longevity partially because of full backwards compatibility.
The non-proprietary, generic name for this 32-bit architecture is x86-32."
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; 2. The FC5 and FC6 that i installed on my 64-bit AMD was also installed on
&gt; my 32-bit celeron. That means i am using 32bit OS on my 64-bit machine
&gt; right? Will i gain performance by using FC5 for 64-bit?
</pre>

<p>
Not FC5/FC6, but should give you some idea: 
"Ubuntu i386 &amp; x86_64 Compared"
</p>

<p>
Personally, I would take dual/quad core processor over 64-bit one any day <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

&gt; Which is the best distro to use on AMD sempron 2800+ ?

Define 'best'.

<h3>RealPlayer not playing well with others</h3>

<b>Mike Orr [sluggoster at gmail.com]</b><br />

</p>

<p>
I just set up a Kubuntu system with RealPlayer 10.0.8.805, and it
refuses to squack simultaneously with another noisemaker.  It sulks
silently if kaffeine/kscd/kmix is open, and silences them when it's
playing.  It's opening /dev/dsp directly rather than going through the
sound system.
</p>

<p>
The setup wizard says, "Alsa and esound drivers are not included in
this build.  The OSS device used for playback can be set using the
AUDIO environment variable. eg export AUDIO=/dev/dsp2."  But I've used
Real on Kububtu and Gentoo before without this problem.
</p>

<p>
I looked in the dialogs for an output device setting but didn't see
any.  KDE's sound system is usisng the "autodetect" audio device, and
KInfoCenter says, "Installed drivers: type 10 ALSA emulation.  Audio
devices: VIA 8237 (DUPLEX)".
</p>

<p>
gxine and kaffeine will play RealAudio files, but gxine distorts the
sound in an annoying way, and kaffeine crashes so frequently I forget
I'm not on Windows.  (It even hung the system once with gray vertical
bars on the screen.  I haven't seen that on Linux for years.)
</p>

<p>
Interestingly, when KMix is open Reaplayer is silent until I close
KMix and restart the audio clip a few times.  But if RealPlayer is
running and I open KMix from the volume control in the tray, I can
adjust the volume with KMIx's PCM slider.

<p>
I've been having problems with my SATA disk for some time and I've moved back 
to working off my old IDE disk, while I investigate the problem. I'm assuming 
the problem is hardware, but I don't have any suitable hardware to swap 
around to prove the point. I think my next step is to buy another SATA 
controller and swap that, but first I thought I'd see if the gang's 
collective wisdom had any pointers to offer.

Here's another error I've been getting on all my Kubuntu installs:

</pre>
This happens whenever an X application starts, and sometimes when it
opens a new window.  Apparently it retries a couple times and
succeeds, because I found one application that just gave up and
wouldn't start at all.  I don't remember which one now, not one of the
X apps I'm currently using

Dear list,

<p>
here is the actual situation which I like to share with you.
I have a Suse10 box with 2 lan card.  I also have a 10 port
HUB.
Now I like to dial my ISP with one lan card and another lan
will be connected with the HUB. hence the other PCs can
share the net connection from the HUB.  I like to implement
this. Could any one suggest any tutorial or suggest me to do
this ??

Dear list,
</p>

<p>
I am facing a really critical problem since last one weak. 
My server is running XAMPP for linux. 
Now the users are accessing the server and doing their
project work using dreamweaver from win PC.
</p>

<p>
but frequently they see the message "This file has been
modified outside of Dreamweaver. Do you want to reload it"
</p>

<p>
I am 100% confirm that there is no one elese who is working
on a particular file. if they accept yes all their
modification has been lost.
Is there any problem in the Linux server or Xampp ?
</p>

<p>
has any one experienced such a problem ? please suggest.
thanks.

<pre>
&gt;From a recent Risks-Forum Digest (Monty Solomon, "Cybercrooks Deliver Trouble"):
</pre>

<pre>
One of the best measures of the rise in cybercrime is junk e-mail, or spam,
because much of it is relayed by computers controlled by Internet criminals,
experts said. More than 90 percent of all e-mail sent online in October was
unsolicited junk mail, according to Postini, an e-mail security firm in San
Carlos, Calif. Spam volumes monitored by Postini rose 73 percent in the past
two months as spammers began embedding their messages in images to evade
junk e-mail filters that search for particular words and phrases. In
November, Postini's spam filters, used by many large companies, blocked 22
billion junk-mail messages, up from about 12 billion in September.
</pre>
Gosh, who could possibly have predicted that content-based filtering
wouldn't work?

about SPF here, and I strongly suspect elsewhere as well. So have many
other people. It's just that now, the problem is coming to roost in a
big way, and all these people are now scrambling in panic.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps - one day, after the human race grows up - we'll all have a
reflex that causes us to do the obvious things that prevent problems
instead of focusing all our energies on emergency management. The latter
makes you look like a hero if you pull it off... but the chances of
failure, with attendant chances of damage or death, are high and not
very controllable. For now, we just get to watch the frenzied scrabbling
for a way out, with its usual outcome of mostly-wrong answers.

I have a critical problem with my net setting and searching
for some kind guidance.
</p>

<p>
well, I have 2 ISP and a load balancing router ( Linksys
RV042).
My one ISP, say ISP1 is based on ADSL technology. The modem
to dialup ISP1 is
smartATX MT841 and it has inbuilt dialing feature. so a
connection from this 
smartATX MT841 direcly comes to WAN1 port the of the load
balancing router.
</p>

<p>
another ISP, say ISP2. now there is a PC with 2 lan card for
this isp2. one lan dialups
ISP2 and another lan card from this same machine fed this
connection to the WAN2 port
of the load balancing router.
</p>

<p>
till now there is no problem at all and the load balancing
feature is running great.
</p>

<p>
BUT the problem is with the PC which dialups the ISP2 and
fed the connection to 
the load balancing router. it actually behaves like a modem.
so the user in that machine
can't share the local lan resources and we can't share the
resources of that PC.
</p>

<p>
could any one kindly suggest any solution please ?
thanks for the support.

Trying to mount my camera, which works fine on Gentoo and I think on

But when I mount it the permissions are:

It's recognizing the user option but ignoring the uid,gid,fmask, and
dmask options.
</p>

<p>
I set the unmounted directory to mode 777 owned by myself because I
remembered hearing that has some effect on the mount's permissions,
but it didn't make a difference.
</p>

<p>
I tried mounting it with sudo and without, and removing the uid/gid or

<p>
Dear list,
</p>

<p>
I am running a PC having suse 10.  I have 2 lan card here
and like to configure 2 cards with different setting.
I have tried to configure the cards using Yast, but the
problem is ; 2 cards taking the same DNS, gateway etc from
the configuration which 
I make latter.  I think there may be some problem in yast,
so I like to do it manually. could any one suggest me the
file in suse 10 where I can 
write configuration for eth0 and eth1 and could any one
kindly provide an example configuration <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
</p>

<p>
thanks in advanced.
</p>

I was going back over the past few days of Slashdot, and found this:
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/01/19/216208">http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/01/19/216208</a> , a link to a
review (<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9007884">http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9007884</a>)
of online office suites.
</p>

<p>
The interesting part is that Slashdot also mention Docvert[1]
(<a href="http://holloway.co.nz/docvert/index.html">http://holloway.co.nz/docvert/index.html</a>), an open source, web based
document converter - not an office suite, but at least the "host my
own" crowd have an option to view word processor documents (if they're
willing to run public-facing software that's based on OpenOffice or
Abiword...)
</p>

<p>
It's interesting that 3 of the 4 support importing and exporting
OpenOffice files (although ajaxPresents from Ajax13 gives nothing but
errors when you try to export openoffice, though their "own" .appt
format <strong>is</strong> openoffice!).

<h3>Followup: opening VA FullON 2230 (LG134)</h3>
<p>
<b>Rick Moen [rick at linuxmafia.com]</b><br />

</p>

<p>
(This is a response to your request for help, opening VA FullON 2230
just printed in Linux Gazette's issue #134.)
</p>

<p>
The article you read is correct, that it's necessary to remove the
CD-ROM / floppy assembly before getting to the HDs.  Here's how:
</p>

<p>
Unscrew the two Philips screws on either side of the floppy drive.  
Now, remove the top cover that is atop the rear 3/4 of the chassis's
top surface, so that you can reach the back of the CD drive.  Reaching
inside the chassis, push the CD drive towards the front.  This will
dislodge the six-inch-wide faceplate that houses the CD and floppy
drives, allowing it to slide forward.
</p>

<p>
A flange on that faceplate projecting sideways towards the hard drives 
is the main obstacle to removing the twelve-inch faceplate in front of
the hard drives, which you now should be able to likewise dislodge
forwards.  That faceplate contains two very noisy, small fans:  FYI,
I've replaced those fans on my unit with quiet aftermarket fans, each
with a slide switch letting you select one of three speeds, making my
house a great deal quieter.
</p>

<p>
Once you have the twelve-inch faceplate removed, you can reach in from
the front to the four drive bays, a vertical pair on the left and a
similar vertical pair next to that.  Each bay can accomodate a drive
sled that is fastened from the front with a Philips screw in the upper
left.  Once you've removed the screw, the sled and attached drive should
slide forwards.  (You'll want to detach any cables from the drive,
first.)
</p>

<p>
Speaking for the former staff of VA Linux Systems, I hope you get many
long years of enjoyment from your model 2230.
</p>

<p>
Best Regards,
Rick Moen

Hi list,
</p>

<p>
Hope everyone is well here <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
I am little bit confused and seeking your guidance. I like to run a virtual 
machine for experiment with different S/W. Both UML and vmware are there. I 
like the S/W which gives less overhead to the CPU. occupies less Ram. 
Provides faster speed and performance. In this scenario which will be 
better ? could any one suggest ?
</p>

<p>
PS: Assume that both the virtual machines running with exactly same number of 
applications.

<h3>Problem in Client when spawning multiple connections on socket</h3>

<p>
Hi list!
i need your advice. The situation is like this
</p>

<p>
We have a situation where we have a DEC Alpha Server with a Concurrent
Server which spawns a child to every process that we connect to. On a
Linux box on the same network, we have built a client which connects
to the server ,we see the connection and every things is good. At this
time we try to invoke another instance of the this client, at this
point it kills the first connection and the second one connects. We
are passing the Internet address of the server to connect.
</p>

<p>
If we have the client on the same server we can spawn multiple
instances and every instance connects, in this case though the address
127.0.0.1 or the local host.
</p>

<p>
Any pointers as to how we can have multiple client using the same socket.
</p>
