<h1>OPS Camp and DevOps Days - coming in June</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>

<p>
Imagine that all the sysadmin and operations scripts and configuration
files at your data center were organized, rationalized, and set up in
a separate test environment. Imagine you could test changes in an automated
build process. If you can do this, you are a long way toward the goals of
the new Dev Ops or Ops Code movement which wants to abstract infrastructure
and treat it as code.
</p>

<p>
I attended OPS Camp San Francisco on May 15, 2010, the 3rd OPS Camp event
out of the 5 currently planned for this year. There were about 100 people
there and they were focused on making Operations more like software
engineering.
</p> 

<p>
The first OPS Camp was held in Austin in January and a follow-up OPS Camp
was held in Boston in April. Two more are planned for June and more are
likely in the Fall.  There is also a separate DevOps Day in Mountain View,
making for 3 separate events this month. (see below)
</p>

<p>
Part of the impetus behind OPS Camp is to hold discussions on OPS end of
Cloud Computing without the snake oil and hype or the 50,000-foot overview
slides. Private clouds require the rapid deployment and management of many
standardized components. The Dev part of this means employing the tools
and techniques of software developers: continuous builds, test automation,
version control, Agile techniques.
</p> 

<p>
Another way to think about this is to bridge the differences between new
Development and the stability (and reproducibility) of Operations, a
classic dichotomy.
</p>

<p>
The point is perhaps best summarized by Ernest Mueller, who blogs on Dev
OPS ideas: "... system administration and system administrators have
allowed themselves to lag in maturity behind what the state of the art is."
DevOps is about bringing operations into the 21st Century.
</p>

<p>
Attending the San Francisco event were some of the people behind Puppet and
Chef and also several local startups in the Operations sphere. Luke
Kanies, the creator of Puppet, for example, seems to be attending all of
the OPS Camp events.  I had a great conversation with Lee Thompson, who
co-leads the on-going DevOps Tool Chain Project that was described at an
afternoon session, and also seems to be attending most of the DevOps
events. And here is information about the project:
<a href="http://dev2ops.org/toolchain/">http://dev2ops.org/toolchain/</a>
</p>


<p>
Another key DevOps person and an organizer of the camps is Damon Edwards
who blogs at dev2ops.  Here is an excerpt from his blog on the DevOps
handle: (<a href="http://dev2ops.org/blog/2010/2/22/what-is-devops.html">http://dev2ops.org/blog/2010/2/22/what-is-devops.html</a>)
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Why the name "DevOps"?
</p>

<p>
Probably because it's catchy. It's also a good mental image of the concept
at the widest scale -- when you bring Dev and Ops together you get DevOps.
There has been other terms for this idea, such as Agile Operations, Agile
Infrastructure, and Dev2Ops (a term we've been using on this blog since
2007). There is also plenty of examples of people arriving at the idea of
DevOps on their own, without calling it "DevOps". For an excellent example
of this, read this recent post by Ernest Mueller
(<a href="http://www.webadminblog.com/index.php/2010/02/17/agile-operations/">http://www.webadminblog.com/index.php/2010/02/17/agile-operations/</a>) or
watch John Allspaw and John Hammond's seminal presentation "10+ Deploys Per
Day: Dev and Ops Cooperation at Flickr" from Velocity 2009
(<a href="http://velocityconference.blip.tv/file/2284377/">http://velocityconference.blip.tv/file/2284377/</a>).
</p>

<p>
For better or for worse, DevOps seems to be the name that is catching
people's imaginations.
</p>

<p>
The SF event took place in an open loft space with bare beam ceilings in
the same building that housed Bitnami. This was in the shadow of San
Francisco's Giants Stadium on a game day, so parking was an effort. I had
to park 7 blocks away and that was before the 9am start time.  On the
other hand, I could have bought a scalped ticket and gone to the game
instead of the afternoon sessions.
</p>

<p>
There was good WiFi and lots of daisy-chained power cords. We sat on
folding chairs, but in other respects this was a good space with the right
amenities.
</p>

<p>
The sponsors provided cinnamon rolls and empanadas as registration period
snacks, and provided sandwiches and pizza for lunch, and there was plenty
of coffee.
</p> 

<p>
The format mixed things up a bit. There was an intro to the OPS Camp
format, then a round of 5 minute lightning talks (some of which I wish
were 7 minutes). These included presenters from VMware, rPath, OpsCode, and
other companies in the operations space.  As an example, James  Watters,
Senior Manager of Cloud Solutions at VMware,  doesn't like the "per VM"
scaling model now in use and also spoke about bypassing the 80 Mb/sec data
transfer limit on EC2 at Amazon.  That got the audience's interest, but
discussions are only allowed in the main sessions which were later.
</p>

<p>
So far, the slide decks haven't surfaced at the OPS Camp web site.
</p>

<p>
Then there was an informal UnPanel with some participants being drafted by
the organizers.  These were people with skin in the Operations game who
spoke about their take on the DevOps concept and leading issues. One of the
organizers mentioned going to Cloud Camp and hearing from business types
that Cloud Computing could do away with system administration and local IT
departments.  "Not so", he said, the sysadmin function was changing and IT
departments had to adapt to a wild new world.
</p>

<p>
Then, volunteer presenters listed their topics and explained what the
sessions would be about.  After that, all attendees voted on the list and
the rooms and times were allocated.
</p> 

<p>
There were good discussions all around and I gleaned that several people
were combining cfEngine with Subversion for a partial DevOps solution.  For
large or complex environments, though, there was a need to choreograph or
sequence the infrastructure build process - and this is an area where the
DevOps Tool Chain may shine.
</p>

<p>
Be sure to join in the DevOps conversation at the upcoming OPS Camp or the
DevOps Day USA conference on June 25, 2010 in Mountain View, CA. It's the
day after O'Reilly's Velocity 2010 conference. Here's the info link for DevOps Day:<br>
