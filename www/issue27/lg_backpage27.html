Murray is an academic mathematician; trained at the University of
Pennsylvania and teaching at Macquarie University in Sydney Australia
for the last twenty odd years. At a time when UNIX was new to our
department he stumbled across the Berkely User Supplementary Documents
and got interested in troff. He also vowed to save up and get a UNIX
system of his own.  Linux saved him from the saving up part.
In his professional
work he has used mostly TeX, but maintains an interest in markup
languages in general, including SGML.

does general woodworking, plays the fiddle and searches for rare

struggling with configuring a Usenet news server for his local ISP.

<P>
Thanks to all our authors, not just the ones above, but also those who wrote
giving us their tips and tricks and making suggestions. Thanks also to our
new mirror sites.
<P> 
This month we say good-bye to our "Weekend Mechanic", John Fisk. John began
<I>Linux Gazette</I> as a learning project for himself, never dreaming how
popular it would become with the Linux community. When he turned <I>LG</I>
over to SSC, I was very pleased he planned to continue writing for
<I>LG</I>. I appreciate all of
John's contributions and will miss having his column in our pages. I
know you will too.
<P> 
Bye, John, keep having fun!
