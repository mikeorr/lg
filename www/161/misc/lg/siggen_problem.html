Well done, Arild! Yep, exactly what I mean.
</p>

<p>
What this implies to me is that 1) you have "tripwire" installed (which
you don't need), and 2) that you <em>don't</em> have the "siggen" package (as
contrasted against the "siggen" program) installed. If you had both, the
latter would normally get executed first - because it gets installed in
a "higher priority" directory.
</p>

<pre>
ben@Tyr:~$ apt-file search bin/siggen
siggen: /usr/bin/siggen
tripwire: /usr/sbin/siggen
</pre>

<p>
In the default execution path, "/usr/bin" comes before "/usr/sbin" - so
"/usr/bin/siggen" would get executed first. Here's what you need to do
to fix it:
</p>

<pre>
sudo dpkg -P tripwire
sudo apt-get install siggen
</pre>

<p>
That should take care of it. After you've run the above two commands,
you should be able to type "siggen" at the command line and see the
sound generator application.

Please read Ben's original response carefully.

Big hint: Spaces are important as are distinctions between uppper and
lower case.

The problem here is that you've used the wrong case for the option (it's
supposed to be '-P', not '-p'); you've also missed a space (it's
supposed to be 'dpkg -P', not 'dpkg-p'.) Note: it's <strong>VERY</strong> important to
type things <em>exactly</em> as you're told to type them. This literally is as
critical as correct diode polarity or the exact IC spec: if you get it
wrong in any way, the circuit (or the command) is not going to work,
period.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; arild@Arildlinux:~$ sudo dpkg-p tripwire sudo apt-get install siggen
&gt; sudo: dpkg-p: command not found
</pre>

<p>
Wrong case, missing space.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; arild@Arildlinux:~$ "sudo dpkg-P tripwire
</pre>

<p>
Missing space.
</p>


<pre>
&gt;&gt; sudo apt-get install siggen
</pre>

<p>
You're no longer typing on the command line. If the line does not begin
with 'arild@Arildlinux:~$ ', it's not a command line; in fact, if it
begins with '&gt;', it's a "continuation prompt", meaning that the system
considers the last command to be unfinished. The reason for that, in
this case, is that you started the command line with a double-quote
(right in front of the 'sudo' command) - and the shell is waiting for
you to "close" that quote. Even then, that wouldn't help you - command
names aren't supposed to have quotes in them - but at least you'd have
received an error and been returned to the command prompt.
</p>


<pre>
&gt;&gt; sudo dpkg -P tripwire
</pre>

<p>
You're not typing on the command line.
</p>


<pre>
&gt;&gt; sudo apt-get install siggen

<p>
You're not typing on the command line.
</p>


<pre>
&gt;&gt; sudo dpkg-P tripwire

<p>
You're not typing on the command line.

<p>
Not surprising; you're stuck in the middle of an uncompleted command.
</p>

<p>
Here's how that's interaction is supposed to go:
</p>

<p>
1) You type "sudo dpkg &lt;options, etc.&gt;".
</p>

<p>
2) Depending on how recently you've type "sudo", you may be asked for a
password. If you are, then you need to type one in (note that what you
type will not appear on the screen; it's a security measure that
prevents "shoulder-surfing" - people stealing your password by looking
at what you type.)
</p>

<p>
3) At that point, the "dpkg" command will execute, which will take a
while (anywhere from about 15 seconds to a couple of minutes.) You
should see informational messages on the screen within a couple of
seconds of its execution.
</p>

<p>
4) Once it's finished, you'll be returned to the standard prompt
(e.g, 'arild@Arildlinux:'.)
</p>

<p>
If you get stuck somewhere in the middle of that - whether via some
mistype or whatever the reason - and you see that things aren't moving
along the way they should, hit 'Ctrl-C' to break out.
