<P>
Hi
</P>
<P>
I've been trying in vain to do something very simple, but have been unable
to find the answer via excessive googling, so I'm hoping someone here can
point me in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
I am trying to configure my system so that I can utilise the TVout on my
graphics card.  I want to be able to display to the TV while still
retaining use of the desktop via a CRT.  Eventually I intend to run
MythTV on the TV screen (mainly for the movie and ogg playing
capabilities).
</P>
<P>
To this end I don't want <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> to bother running a window manager &amp; desktop
on the TV screen.  I have setup X such that I have :0.0 and :0.1 display
devices, with :0.1 being the TVout screen.  Unfortunately I end up with a
KDE desktop on the TVout, along with my usual KDE desktop on the CRT.
</P>
<P>
I can successfully run a movie on the TV screen using -
</P>

<blockquote><pre>$ DISPLAY=:0.1 vlc -f --video-on-top ./movie.avi
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
However, if I then try and run something on the CRT it steals the focus
from the vlc display on the TV (which in itself wouldn't be a huge
problem if the KDE panel didn't then put itself to the front on the TV
screen).
</P>
<P>
The only hint at a solution I've managed to find indicates that I <TT>/must/</TT>
run two instances of X, one for each screen, if I want to solve the
problem.  However, another person has managed to do this with one
instance of X (with MythTV on the TV) but runs WindowMaker as their WM,
which accepts a -display parameter when run so it limits itself to :0.0
</P>
<P>
First things first, my configuration:

<P>
I've managed to muddle through getting all the really nasty stuff
working...
</P>
<P>
OpenLDAP works
</P>
<P>
OpenLDAP directory contains appropriate user entries
</P>
<P>
Users can authenticate through PAM against their OpenLDAP records (and I can even control what they can log into using the authorizedService attribute, so, some users get FTP, some get SSH, some get SMTP, some IMAP, etc.)
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, I'm down to one thing I need to make work that isn't.
I need to get <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A> (2.0.53, Fedora Core 3) to authenticate
users against LDAP.  I think I know how to make the Apache
queries work and query the right things from the LDAP server
and such, but, here's the rub:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
Apache LDAP support is divided into two parts.  mod_auth_ldap which
seems pretty straightforward (at least after dealing with everything
else), and, mod_ldap (which unlike the rest of apache modules is
util_ldap.c instead of mod_ldap.c WHEE!!).
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
My problem is that mod_ldap is refusing to make SSL connections to the
LDAP server, and, my LDAP server (deliberately) won't allow
authenticated binds using cleartext passwords without SSL.
</P>
<P>
Any ideas how to make this all work together or know anyone who knows
this stuff cold and could help me?
</P>
<P>
Thanks,
</P>

I wasn't able to get sets working (if anyone knows appropriate set

I think that the missing step is that you are not repeating the "dd"
and "cp" operations every time you run lilo. After running lilo, you
have to transfer again the first 512 bytes of <TT>/dev/hda8</TT> to the file
bootsec.lin in <TT>/dev/hda.</TT>
</P>
<P>
If I may digress a little bit, I have to say that it is here where I
have found the greatest advantage between lilo and grub: this step is
not needed with grub.
</P>
<P>
I hope this helps. Best regards,

I am MOST distressed to hear you are trying to close down
linuxgazette.net by appropriating their name.  The fact that you HOSTED
them awhile back gives you NO RIGHT to the name.  And in fact you have
linuxgazette.com already.

I ENJOY reading BOTH linuxgazette.net, and my subscription to

Jim -

<P>
Thank you very much for your support, and for restating our position
with regard to SSC's unwarranted attacks. Here at the Linux Gazette, we
believe that there is indeed room for both - and our actions have
consistently reflected that belief. SSC, via their hired guns, have
closed off all avenues for peaceful coexistence by their threats; we
shall simply continue to stand firm against their baseless accusations -
the law and the public sentiment happen to coincide in support of us.
</P>
<P>
Your support, and the support of all our readers who have written to us
in regard to the present situation, serves to underscore and reinforce
our determination to see this through. Thank you, Jim... thank you,
everyone.

<FONT COLOR="navy">alien killer cheesecake eludes search, apropos apprehended</FONT></H3>
Ben Okopnik (<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net?cc=&cc=ben@lists.linuxgazette.net&subject=%20Re%3A%20%5BLG%20112%5D%202c%20Tips%20%233">ben from linuxgazette.net</a>)
<BR>Question by #tag-chat ()

<P>
Anyway - got a 2-cent tip for you. I sent this one in to Mike ages ago, but searching for it in LG doesn't show anything.
</P>
<P>
One of the things I'd found when experimenting with RedHat is that their "apropos" utility seems to be just an
alias for "man -k", i.e., does not allow wildcard searches via "apropos -w". Since "apropos -w" was something I
found very useful in my early days of learning Linux, I decided to write a script that would be an even
friendler, more helpful version of "whatis" and "apropos -w" combined. I called it "howto"- and I still use it
on occasion, simply because it's a fun way to find info (and get hooked into checking out other interesting
things!). The syntax for it is very simple - just type
<p>
<code>howto wipe out alien civilizations and make killer cheesecake</code>

<P>
If there's anything that's available on the topic, or any of the keywords, you'll find it...
</P>
<P>
RedHat users note: your installation procedure does not automatically create the "whatis" database (or for that
matter, even the "mandb" database) which is required by this script - and by "whatis". See the manpage for
"man" and "whatis" for further info.
</P>
<P>
And here's the script:
</P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/tips/howto.sh.txt">howto.sh.txt</a></tt></p>
<P>
Wiping out alien civilizations and making killer cheesecake are definitely knowledge that should be propagated.
(are things? is knowledge? Damn this slippery language and its referents!)
</P>

<P>
Hi there,
</P>
<P>
When you have problems booting Linux from DOS, you also have to look
in which mode you are using DOS: with or without HIMEM.SYS loaded,
with or without EMM/QEMM/EMM386 loaded, with or without a swap file,
with or without a disk cache or a memory disk (VDISK) loaded.
</P>
<P><DL><DT>
Have a look at:
<DD><A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gujin"
	>http://sourceforge.net/projects/gujin</A>
</DL></P>
<P>
you have there a GPL bootloader which works from a lot of DOS
configurations (probably all of them) - and if you have problems,
its debug executable (dbgload.exe, dbgdisk.exe, dbgfs.exe...) create
a file named DBG which explains what did wrong.
</P>
<P><DL><DT>
You have precompiled loader (interactive and command line version) at:
<DD><A HREF="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gujin/install-0.9.tgz?download"
	>http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gujin/install-0.9.tgz?download</A>
</DL></P>
<P><DL><DT>
and precompiled debug at:
<DD><A HREF="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gujin/standard-0.9.tgz?download"
	>http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gujin/standard-0.9.tgz?download</A>
</DL></P>
<P><DL><DT>
Please read the doc at:
<DD><A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/docman/?group_id=3D15465"
	>http://sourceforge.net/docman/?group_id=3D15465</A>
</DL></P>
<P>
it answers most usual questions.
</P>
<P>
You may not want to install it as the master boot record (MBR) of your
hard disk in its own managed partition (partition protected by setting
the IDE max address of the hard disk) if you are using an older 2.4
Linux kernel because those kernel had a bug where, when the IDE max
address is set, the Linux IDE system thinks the disk has 1 (i.e. one)
sector (i.e. the total size of the hard disk is then believed to be
512 bytes - that is a bug).
</P>
<P>
Note that I have never seen a case where - if a problem appear
following a hard disk install - the uninstall checkbox on the menu
did not perfectly work and restore a perfect system, at least since v0.8.
Version 0.9 is needed for newer 2.6 Linux kernels.
</P>
<P>
Etienne.

<P><STRONG>
Hello Ben,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I read your article at <A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/issue92/okopnik.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/issue92/okopnik.html</A>,
and was wandering if you can review the following:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
I'm now moving major application from Windows to Linux server.
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The application used blat mailing software.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Until here no problem, because I can work with Linux mail instead.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
But the Windows blat had a flag to send mail in html format... maybe you
know of an equivalent to send mails from Linux using the mail command?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Appreciate your help,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Haim
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Brian] 
Hello Haim,
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Create a text file that contains your email. It should look like an
email message, with headers on individual lines, etc:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>    To: you@example.com
    From: me@example.com
    Reply-To: me-too@example.com
    Subject: Test HTML message
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Make sure that one of headers is Content-Type, like this:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
Content-Type: text/html; charset="us-ascii"
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
That tells the email client to render the text stream that it receives
as HTML. Note that there are <EM>many</EM> options for charset - use the one
that's appropriate for your target audience (common alternatives are the
ISO-8859-n charsets). Also note that it doesn't help you when receivers
of the email explicitly don't parse HTML mail, or have filters that
preferentially mark HTML email as likely spam. But, ranting aside, we
continue...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Then in the body of your email,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>    &lt;html&gt;
         [your content]
    &lt;/html&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
All of that is in a text file (or composed on the fly by your
application), either way, redirected into the sendmail binary for mailing:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
sendmail you@example.com &lt; sample_message.htm
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Brian]
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>&gt; To:
&gt; &lt;ben-fuzzybear@yahoo.com&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Ben FuzzyBear, eh? Is that your Animist Native American <TT>/</TT> Aleut moniker?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
Old nickname coined by an x-gf due to a number of my bear-like
characteristics - mostly my hairy chest and my ability to substitute for
a room heater or an electric blanket... but 'twas long ago, far away,
and the account is essentially dead.

<BR>Question by The Linux Gang , Heather , (star from starshine.org)


<blockquote><em><font color="#000066">This was true of our mailman, which is a rather basic configuration at

<P><STRONG>
Is the archive tarball <EM>not</EM> in mbox format? I'm writing this off-line
so I can't check, but let me know if it's not - I've done header
mangling before, specifically converting some weird format into mbox, so
I'll happily fold, spindle, and mutilate those poor emails as necessary.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Jimmy] 
The list archives are available as text (so close to mbox format that
you really have to wonder why they bothered using anything else), or as
HTML. Mailman does keep mboxes of its archives, but those are private -
you should have no problem grabbing it though.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Got'em. Seems that the mods are pretty basic; passing it through a
couple of simple regexes -

<P>
hello, and greetings once again to the world of The Answer Gang.  I'm sure
some of you are wondering why we're so late - fact is, we actually managed
to get some of us together for lunch, having had the odd chance of being
close enough in the same state to drive the rest of the intervening
distance.
</P>
<P>
Real Life also has its interventions.  Not all bad - but the timing, well,
that can be.
</P>
<P>
I'm pleased to say one of my own interruptions of the outer world here
probably <em>won't</em> bore you to death -- and now it's revealed...
</P>

<h4 align="center"><br>Running an internet lounge
</h4>
<P>
For fun and profit?  Fun, absolutely!   Profit, um, no.  My Star Trek
Crew (<A HREF="http://trek.starshine.org"
	>http://trek.starshine.org</A>) runs an internet lounge at a handful
of science fiction conventions around here, and we either bring our own
older and not-so-valued equipment, or we use whatever is donated.  These
being the old grey mares of the computing world, it's inevitable - so
far at least one monitor or computer has gone on the fritz each time.
The one time we thought we were unscathed, a monitor died near the end,
it was wellll.... <EM>sort of</EM> usable... we shut it off.  Within the span of an
hour it got so bad the working blind really was better, or you be a
candidate for blinux afterwards.
</P>
<P>
The most spectacular failure was a power supply glitch, all the magic smoke
leaked out, luckily it didn't incite anything else.  California has this
no-smoking indoors policy you see...
</P>
<P>
The first of these lounges fit Battlestar Galactica more than Star Trek - a
rag tag fugitive fleet, some can jump to light speed, and some, well, they
can't.   What distro, I hear you ask!   Well, since different members of my
crew - and a neighboring LUG - provided setups, we had:
</P>

<p><Strong><ul>
<LI>some Sparcs running debian

<LI>about 6 PCs running Mandrake

<LI>10 PCs running some form of Red Hat, kickstarted

<LI>maybe 4 more PCs running some debian or other

<LI>the token, err, talking BORG - as recommended by a blind friend of mine.

<LI>people brought their laptops of course.
</ul></Strong></p>
<P>
We've not run nearly so large a lounge since. 6 or 10 machines <EM>total</EM> is
more like it.
</P>
<P>
That was a pretty big conference, and people enjoyed the variety.  I was
surprised at why a particularly slow Sparc was enjoying such popularity, but
apparently it had the best selection of chat clients...
</P>
<P>
There's the key.  If you want to run a netlounge, know your audience, and
give them what they want.  In my experience, they <EM>mostly</EM> care very little
about the OS.  What they want are features:
</P>

<p><Strong><ul>

They want to get at things too.  Handicapped access, icons NON geeks can
figure out (or else a big ol' icon map on the wall for this number one FAQ,
where's the $whatsit ) and room to scootch the chairs around (yeah, a
technical term).   In other words, make sure there's some <EM>lounge</EM> in your
net lounge.
</P>
<P>
In earlier lounges the word processor was not really a big hit. The glitz
was too good too early, abiword <EM>felt</EM> right, then crashed at the worst
moments.  It's better now - but some people have a rotten opinion of it :(
StarOffice did better - but needs a machine with some oooooooooomph. Java...
</P>
<P>
Live CDs really made the thing take off nicely.  Now if the cords would
learn to telekinese themselves.... or the computers all came with wheels
like luggage...  mmmmmm case mods.  Yummmmm.  (No I haven't done it.  But
it's a thought.)   We've been using Knoppix in the last few lounges,
customizing it with our own art.  We might try ubuntu, too.
</P>
<P>
Make sure you've enough people, that they stay fed so they aren't cranky,
that they occasionally get to run off and do other things (eyestrain makes
people cranky too).   Your silicate lifeforms will be easier to keep happy
when Murphy's Law isn't able to get your goat when it strikes.... because
troubleshooting that fist through the case would be much easier, but,
umm, that's not the kind of disk first aid I had in mind!
</P>
<P>
Plan that setup and teardown will take double the time it takes to setup and
teardown in the otherwise perfect conditions of your geeky home.  Those
cords get tangled, the upstream DHCP looks askance at you, whatever.  Expect
delays - just get the Express Lane up and have a wild guess at your
estimated full-service time.  That solves desperation and hovering.
</P>
<P>
If the event is of any decent size, have an Extra Special Express Lane for
the people who make things happen.  It'll make them feel like it's a special
benefit - and those moments when a piece of the event is about to suffer if
they can't find some important reading that happens to be online, will not
involve kicking someone off a machine who doesn't already kinda behind the
scenes already.
</P>
<P>
This weekend's convention will be a fun filled time of music and getting
together with good friends.  Maybe a few will wish me a happy pre-dated
birthday.   That's the scoop this month folks - above all else, have fun!

<p><strong>From Chris Gianakopoulos

<p></strong></p>

Hi Gang,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I'm just sharing an experience with you.  I've got Pentium 2 computers
with onboard audio these days.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I installed Linux using <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> 8.2, and the ethernet would work sometimes
but mostly, the card did not get recognized.  The card is a 3C509B ISA
card.  At first, I thought that I zapped the ISA slot in my motherboards
(yea -- two of them) because the card would work on my trusty Pentium
Pro computer.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
What was interesting was that if I installed Windows 2000 in the Pentium
2 system, the NIC worked flawlessly!  Okay, now I knew that it was not
hardware.  I just gave up for a while.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
During the holidays (December), I reinstalled Linux on the Pentium 2
system.  This time, I decided to get the thing to work.  Playing around
with the PNP tools, I saw that candidate resources for my onboard audio
(MPU-401 to be specific) was either 0x300 or 0x330.  Looking at
<TT>/proc/ioports</TT>, I saw that 0x300 was chosen for the I/O port.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I rebooted the system and disabled the onboard audio via the BIOS setup.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Of course, my Ethernet then worked.  Looking at <TT>/proc/ioports</TT>, I asw
that 0x300 (my favorite addresses of course) was allocated to the NIC.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I went ahead and reenabled the onboard audio, thus causing failure of
the Ethernet again.  I used YaST (SuSE's setup tool), and manually
allocated 0x330 to the MPU-401 port, and the Ethernet worked flawlessly.
Problem solved!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
This was my first exposure to plug and play hardware when using Linux.
Plug and play was disabled on the 3C509 as recomended in the older days,
and the audio hardware was allocated my sacred I/O address.  As I can
see <TT>/proc</TT> has lots of useful stuff, but, this is the first time that I
had to use it to troubleshoot a problem.  Cool and fun.
</STRONG></P>

I used to install 3C509B cards at a hospital.  We always disabled plug &amp;
play and set the base address using the DOS utility on the floppy.  We
used 0x300 by default, or 0x220 if there was a conflict.

Yea, Ben O. mentioned the lower numbered addresses too (e.g. 0x220).  I
use those for NE2000 type of cards -- for some reason, I got attached to
0x300 from my 3C503 days.  (I still use coax these days -- no hubs....).

I am running <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> Sarge and previously migrated my root drive from a

I never had any issue.

However, with the 60GB -&gt; 250GB drive, I did everything the same and at
the LILO prompt or "LIL" I should say, it sits there for about 1-5 minutes
and then says Loading Linux... BIOS something for about another 60 seconds
and THEN finally loads.  Does anyone know what is up with this 5-6 minute

You don't specify the model of the controller, nor anything about the
kernel you're using: stock kernel?  Custom compiled?  If custom, is the
ide controller driver statically linked, or being loaded as an (initrd)

The controller is a Promise 20269 ATA/133 controller, it is
custom-compilied; statically linked into the kernel.

I believe it is a LILO problem as the LILO menu/etc has problems loading

I'm not sure about the present state of ide booting requirements, but it
used to be that the important factor was the cylinder number, which is
related to, but not the same as, the size (in MB) of the boot partition,
depending on the data densityof the drive.  With the older drives, the
relation ship was linear, as in N sectors per cylinder.  That is no longer
the case however, with many <TT>/</TT> most <TT>/</TT> all of the more current generations
of hdd's.

made no difference.

The weird part is it boots (after a 4-6min delay).. but it does boot.  If
there were a serious geometry/disk/issue one would think it would boot or
fail, not have a delay and then work.

Given the sizes in question I'll place my bets on 48-bit IDE support being
the culprit, though not on the exact mechanism of the misbehavior.

hello, perhaps you could answer a simple question for me. i have a home
network with 2 linux boxes and 2 WinXP boxes. all 4 computers are set
with the same workgroup - the linux boxes use samba. i can access the
windows boxes from the linux boxes no problem. when I try to access the
linux boxes from the windows boxes, i get prompted for a user name and
password.

You need to setup users and passwords explicitly for Samba, these are
stored and sometimes administered separately from the Unix accounts.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
$ man smbpasswd
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
for more details.

if i try the normal user name and passwords, windows resets
the dialog box and prefixes the user name with the name of the computer.
of course, this does not work. how do i access a linux box running samba
from a windows box running XP? also, i haven't figured out how to mark a
folder as "shared" in linux. thanks for any help.

You need to configure directories that are shared in your systems
smb.conf. You will want to read the smb.conf files on your system, both
the running one (often found in <TT>/etc/samba/smb.conf</TT>) as well as any
example smb.conf files that are found with the Samba documentation. And
of course,
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
$ man smb.conf
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>

	> [John] 
As with most aspects of unix-like OS's, there is more than one way to
configure samba.  In fact samba comes with a utility called 'swat', but
I've never used it, so I can't really say much about it.  However, most
Linux distros these days do a pretty decent job of providing a template
configuration file that you can edit to add <TT>/</TT> change what you need without
too much work.  You will need to have a text editor installed, and know
how to use it.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Depending on the distro that you have, the samba configuration file will
likely be found as either <TT>/etc/smb.conf</TT> or <TT>/etc/samba/smb.conf.</TT>  "locate
smb.conf" might be of use to you, assuming that the "updatedb" utility has
been run on your system.  To run the following command(s) and edit the
samba configuration, will need to login as root.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Usually, to get samba to allow connections from the outside world, you
need to add the user and password manually, using the utility samba
provides.  To add a new user account, e.g., "john", type "smbpasswd -a
john".  The "-a" is for "add".  "man smbpasswd" for details.  You will be
prompted for the password.  If you duplicate the same username and
password as you use on the windoze side, then you won't be prompted for
a username and password when you want to access a samba share.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
You designate a folder share by entering some parameters into the
smb.conf.  For example. lets say that I have a dual-boot machine, and I
mount the 'blows partition under <TT>/dosC.</TT>  I could add a stanza to smb.conf
such as the following:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>[dosc]
    comment = W2k - vfat
    browseable = yes
    read only = Yes
    path = /dosC
    valid users = john
    guest ok = no
    printable = no
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Samba gives a fine degree of control by providing lots of parameters.  Any
parameters not specified for a share assume defaults which samba will
provide.  Usually the defaults for a share are such that you won't need to
provide more than a handful of parameters.  "man smb.conf" will give you
lots of info about them.  One thing perhaps worth noting is that many of
the parameters have one or more synonomous "twin" parameters, so there
aren't quite as many as there may seem at first, as there are "duplicates"
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
After making changes to smb.conf, it may be expedient to restart the smb
daemon.  There are actually two daemons, but they might both be handled in
just one init script.
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>/etc/init.d/smb restart
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
and
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>/etc/init.d/nmb restart
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
should suffice in any case.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
That will hopefully be enough to get you started.  There's lots of info
out there on the 'net about samba too.  Google is your friend.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
To share a folder using Samba in Linux you need to edit the smb.conf
file. On my computer it is located in the <TT>/etc/samba</TT> folder.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
You need to add the following lines to the file for each of the
directories you want to share:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>[ShareName]
         writeable = yes
         valid users = suramya
         user = suramya
         path = /home/suramya
         write list = suramya
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
The path is the directory you want to share. ShareName is the name you
want to call it. Valid users tells the system which users are allowed to
access this share. To create a readonly share remove the writable=yes tag.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Use the smbpasswd command to set the user password for samba share.
There is a way to have it sync the password with the linux password file
but I could never get that to work

<font color="green"> European Software Patents </font></h3>
<p>
The proposed European Union directive on the patentability
of computer-implemented inventions (software patents
directive) has moved a step closer to adoption.
<P>
As reported last month, there was a strong push from the European Parliament,
and from some national governments (notably Poland) to restart the legislative
process that is targeted at regularising the basis for software patents in
Europe.  Currently the European Patent Office is demonstrating a tacit
acceptance of software patents. This is in spite of an official framework that
has traditionally been interpreted as prohibiting the granting of patents for
software implemented inventions.  Many leading individuals and organisations 
<a href="http://news.com.com/Open-source+honchos+trash+software+patents/2100-7344_3-5559647.html">
involved in Free and Open Source Software</a>
believe that software patents are 
<a href="http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/40805.html">
not a good way to drive innovation</a>.  Meanwhile, other vested interests see
their future in the creation of large stockpiles of patents that threaten to
bog down the software industry in a defensive/offensive patents stand-off.  The
formula that will finally be adopted by the EU with regard to this issue will
have profound implications for innovation and economic flexibility throughout
Europe.
<P>
As matters stood last month, those opposed to the pro-software-patent directive
proposed by the European Commission were hoping that the Parliament 
<a href="http://www.europarl.eu.int/committees/juri_home.htm">
JURI committee</a>
would recommend a restart of this legislative process.  Such a restart
would provide an opportunity to re-examine the whole concept of software
patenting, and strengthen the European Parliament's hand with regard to applying
the restrictions on software patents it proposed earlier in this process.
<P>
In a continuation of the support the anti-patent lobby has received in
Parliament, the 
<a href="http://www2.europarl.eu.int/omk/sipade2?PUBREF=-//EP//TEXT+PRESS+NR-20050203-1+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&L=EN&LEVEL=2&NAV=X&LSTDOC=N#SECTION3">
JURI committee did indeed recommend such a restart</a>, much to the 
<a href="http://kwiki.ffii.org/Restart050202En">
appreciation of groups such as the FFII</a>.
Unfortunately, as welcome as this move is, the JURI committee, and Parliament,
cannot enforce such decisions.  Against this background, the Commission has
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/03/01/ec_rebuffs_parliament/">
decided to push ahead regardless</a>, and move the hotly contested directive
closer to final adoption.  FFII has 
<a href="http://wiki.ffii.org/Com050228En">
reported that this reluctance to restart</a> stems from an awareness in the
Directorate General for the Internal Market, currently headed by Irishman
Charlie McCreevy, (a refugee from a particularly ruthless backstabbing in Irish
domestic politics) that any revised directive would
likely take a very different shape to that currently on the table.
Though some legitimate questions may be asked about McCreevy's politics and
closeness to vested interests, such enquiries have been tainted by 
<a href="http://www.nosoftwarepatents.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=397">
rather intemperate, prejudiced, and simple minded outbursts</a>
by at least one prominent anti-patent campaigner who is apparently ignorant of
the dangers of scapegoating minority ethnic or national groups for the ills of
society.
<P>
The next outing for this directive will be on the 7th of March when there is a
meeting of the Competition Council.  For EU citizens, lobbying of your national
representative on this panel may still be a worthwhile endeavour.

<h1>Running XBoard in Irssi</h1>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>Recently, I have been playing chess on <a href=
"http://freechess.org">FICS</a>, a free service that uses the ICS
(Internet Chess Server) protocol. ICS is a telnet protocol, so you
can "telnet freechess.org 5000", login, and play with an ASCII
chess board if you want Here is what FICS output looks like: (I
made up most of this output as an example, but the actual output is
in the same format.)</p>

<p>Now, you could play chess this way, if you don't mind using an
ASCII chess board and entering all your moves manually, but most
people use an interface program to provide them with a graphical
chess board. I use <a href=
"http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/xboard/">XBoard</a> for my
graphical interface, which 
<!-- 20050227 dsrich I think that Mr. Creighton had stdin and stdout reversed in the next two lines, so I swapped them -->
 provides a nice board, but it directly passes the ICS output to
stdin, and sends its stdout to the ICS. That is to say, you start
xboard in an xterm, and it's almost as if you'd used telnet to
connect except you have a graphical chess board. This isn't so bad,
except:</p>

<ul>
<li>The server will output a line while you are in the middle of
typing something, so that half of your message ends up on one line
and half on another This can be confusing and difficult to
use.</li>

<li>Those <tt>fics%</tt> prompts waste a lot of space. (Up to half
of the lines on the terminal.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>The solution</h2>

<p>Enter <a href="http://www.irssi.org/">Irssi</a>.</p>

<p>Irssi is the IRC client I use. Well, it's mostly an IRC client.
There are modules for other protocols, such as ICQ.</p>

<p>I thought I could run XBoard in an Irssi window, filter out the
prompts, and have more fun. It's possible, you just have to tweak
things a little.</p>

<h3>Configuring FICS</h3>

<p>One problem with playing on FICS this way is that FICS will send a bell
(i. e., the ASCII BEL character) when the board is updated, letting you
know it's your move. However, they are sent without a newline, and since
Irssi's exec module will only print complete lines, you don't hear the bell
until the next newline, which could be with, for example, a chat message,
which will come an indeterminate amount of time after the BEL is sent. So
it's best to turn off bells on the FICS side with this command:</p>

<pre>
set bell off
</pre>

<p>This tells FICS not to send BEL characters on every board
update.</p>

<h3>Configuring XBoard</h3>

<p>Having turned off server-side alerts, you probably want to hear
some sort of sound when the opponent moves, but since just ringing
the terminal bell won't work, you'll have to use a sound file. Here
are my settings for XBoard in my .Xresources file:</p>

<pre class="code">
# xboard options
XBoard*showCoords: True
XBoard*highlightLastMove: True
XBoard*colorizeMessages: True

# Sounds
XBoard*ringBellAfterMoves: True
XBoard*soundMove:       /home/jason/sounds/fanfare.wav
XBoard*soundChallenge:  /home/jason/sounds/bridge2.wav
XBoard*soundRequest:    /home/jason/sounds/bridge2.wav

# ICS-related
XBoard*internetChessServerHost: freechess.org
XBoard*internetChessServerHelper: timeseal
XBoard*internetChessServerLogonScript: /home/jason/chess/.logon-script-freechess.org
</pre>

<p>The above configuration (among other things) sets "fanfare.wav"
to be played when the opponent moves and "bridge2.wav" to be played
on either a "Challenge" (When you're challenged on ICS) or a
"Request" (A request for something: draw, abort, adjourn, takeback,
etc.) Note that, in order for XBoard to heed "soundMove",
"ringBellAfterMoves" must be on.</p>

<p>Your configuration will differ, of course, and XBoard has scads
of options, so please refer to the 'xboard' man page for a full list
of supported sound events. (Among other things.)</p>

<p>When giving the names of sound files, you can also specify "$"
as a filename to have XBoard emit a BEL character for that event.
This is, of course, totally useless for the "soundMove" event for
reasons discussed earlier, but every other event that XBoard sees
involves something being printed, and thus Irssi will see the BEL
in a timely manner.</p>

<p>Note that, in order for the ICS-related sound events to work,
you must have 'colorizeMessages' enabled.</p>

<p>If you don't have some handy sound bites laying around, google
for "free sound files". Just be careful not to spend too much time
searching for suitable sounds, browsing site after site, staying up
all night, with your skeletal frame leaning limply against your
chair, the flickering light of your monitor casting a pale glow on
your bloodshot eyes, your mailbox overflowing as your quest causes
you to totally withdraw from society, becoming a sad, pathetic
little vegetable whose only joy in life is finding those perfect
sounds for every possible event.</p>

<p>Well, probably not, but you can spend a lot of time on it.
:-)</p>

<h3>Configuring Irssi</h3>

<p>Irssi doesn't really require much tweaking. If you have XBoard
beeping (i. e., you've specified "$" for one or more of XBoard's
sounds), you'll want to "/set bell_beeps on" in order to have Irssi
not ignore any BEL characters it sees. This is the alias I use:</p>

<!-- 20050227 dsrich Broke this single-line PRE block into multiple lines to fit my screen. -->
<pre>
/alias xboard window new hide; window name xboard; exec -name xboard -window -interactive \
xboard -ics -sgf ~/chess/fics.pgn | sed --unbuffered 's/^fics% //\;T\;/^\$/d'
</pre>

<p>Note that, in the alias, we have to quote ";" and "$", because those
characters have special importance to Irssi. XBoard is started in ICS mode,
appending any games played to <code>~/chess/fics.pgn</code>. The 'sed'
command (which filters out the FICS prompt) is a little more complex, so
I'll take the easy way out and not attempt to explain it in detail. The
irrepressibly curious can refer to the 'sed' man page.</p>

<p>And that's all there is to it. You could, of course, use a
different ICS interface such as <a href=
"http://eboard.sourceforge.net/">eboard</a>, but I prefer XBoard,
and this configuration works for me.</p>

<p>I have used "FICS" to refer to the chess server throughout this
article because that's what I use, but this should work with most
any ICS, provided you modify the 'sed' incantation appropriately.</p>

<h1>RSA 2005 Conference and Expo, San Francisco - Special Report</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<p> More than crypto systems and algorithms, the RSA conference and expo
has become a premier showcase of the full spectrum of security products and
concerns in this era of every more insecure computing.

<p> This reflects growing in interest for security products at government
and businesses everywhere.   More attendees [about 13000] and more
exhibitors were on-hand than ever before [over 275 companies and
organizations before the conference started] for this 14<sup>th</sup>
annual RSA conference.


<p> And one trend more than any other may offer some respite from the
growing tsunami of malware and identity theft: Trusted Computing.


<p> The specifications developed over the last few years by the Trusted
Computing Group [TCG] are now starting to implemented by major PC and
software firms, most significantly motherboard crypto for PCs and notebooks
from HP and IBM that identify users prior to bootup. Follow this link for
the TGC presentations at RSA2005 [first 3 items]:

<p> <a href="https://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/downloads/tcg_presentations/" target="_blank">https://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/downloads/tcg_presentations/</a>

<p> An emerging standard for Trusted Computing is a 'Trusted Platform',
which will relay on a cryptographically secured module to hold identity
information, certificates and secret keys that can be verified and
exchanged in a trusted computing environment.  These modules, or TPMs, are
now available as is new software for identity management and attesting to
the integrity of the underlying computing platform.  There are also
software versions of TPMs, some open source, that are able to play in a
trusted environment, although they are   less secure than hardware TP
modules.   See <a
href="http://www.infsec.ethz.ch/people/psevinc/">http://www.infsec.ethz.ch/people/psevinc/</a>.

<p> Here is a trusted computing network verification diagram:

<p> <img src="misc/dyckoff/RSA2005-1.jpg" name="Graphic1" align='left'

<p> and, at a network level,Trusted Network Connection [TNC]: <p> <img
src="misc/dyckoff/RSA2005-2.jpg" name="Graphic2"
align='left' border=1 vspace=20><br clear='left'>

<p> Anti-spyware products are becoming almost as ubiquitous as anti-virus
software. Almost all anti-virus, anti-worm vendors were adding or
incorporating anti-spyware modules in their product lines.  Symantec will
be adding this as a feature to existing products while McAfee will be
offering an anti-spyware additional module to its enterprise offerings.

<p> Phishing was also a topic at many vendor presentations, even though
this was largely referred as a social engineering attack.   The Identity
Management companies tried to link phishing with ID mgt, but generally
required end-to-end use of their products. That long view of security gives
birth to another TLA -  UTM or "unified threat management" as Symantec CEO
John Thomson called in his keynote.

<p> Also there were renewed efforts to work together on an industry level.

<p> A rare partnership between government and industry resulted in the
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS),  unveiled at the RSA Conference
by the <strong>National Infrastructure Advisory Council</strong>
[<strong>NIAC</strong>, a  part of the U.S.  Department of Homeland
Security] and leading vendors like Cisco, Ebay, Microsoft, and Symantec.
This  new and ambitious system aims to provide a common descriptive
language and standardized formula for reporting and assessing computer
security vulnerabilities and issues, instead of varying and confusing
vendor-specific ratings.

<p> CVSS, which is partly related to Mitre Corp.'s CVE rating system, helps
prioritize software vulnerabilities both for ISVs and for enterprise users,
calculating the risk by considering  the number of systems involved, the
type of exploit required, and if a software patch is available.

<p> Three major security and auditing groups announced the formation of a
cooperative alliance to create better security policies and legislation and
to better work with security professionals throughout the industry.   These
were the ASIS International, the ISACA (Information Systems Audit and
Control Association) and ISSA (Information Systems Security Association).
The groups will also work together to define certification and training
requirements for the Chief Security Officer (CSO) role and other
security-related positions in industry.


<p> And Microsoft introduced its Microsoft Security Resource Center team at
its booth where security issues could be addressed.  This was mostly a
customer feedback exercise and an attempt to raise the profile of the MSRC,
which also ran a blog for the length of the conference.  It  ties into the
TechNet security pages, [Finally, links for tools and patches.]

<p> Underscoring the new Microsoft security initiatives, Bill Gates
delivered the show's opening keynote address on Monday.  It highlighted new
Microsoft security products, including their enhanced 'Internet security
and acceleration' [ISA] server and future identity management products, and
touted a new version of Internet Explorer by this summer - but only
for Win XP users.

<p> Microsoft was a platinum sponsor and had about 100 employees at the
show. Besides a large booth with a presentation area, there was a separate
expo area where attendees could get 'hands-on' test experience with
Microsoft security products and tools.

<p> [After the RSA Conference, Gartner Corp analyst Neil MacDonald posted
a critique of the latest MS security offerings, rejecting the incremental
approach they are taking rather than a fundamental architectural change,
particularly with its IE web browser. See:

<p> Also in the critique: "The decision to restrict IE 7.0 to the XP
platform also suggests that Microsoft wants to force users of older
platforms to upgrade if they want improved security." ]

<h3>Conference Tracks and Technical Sessions</h3>

<p> Conference sessions were held in the afternoons in 16 simultaneous
tracks, including two separate Hackers &amp; Threats tracks, tracks for
developers and cryptographers, business tracks, and  tracks for privacy,
web security, wireless and Identity &amp; Access Management.

<p> The Hacker Tracks definitely covered a lot of important ground and gave
pause to developers and security officers alike. One paper focused on that
old nemesis, SQL Injection, showing that it was still a major concern since
the old standard approach of hiding error messages or using generic problem
messages does not actually stop the hack.

<p> The presentation, by Imperva's <strong>Ofer Maor</strong>, shows the
result of security testing on MySQL and all leading DBs using indirect
query tests to discover the number and type of data fields available to an
SQL injection attack.  These so-called 'blind' injection techniques only
take a little more effort but still yield confidential data.

<p> For instance, even with hidden or generic error messages an attacker
could request additional fields above and below the actual number  until
the correct number was determined and also check the data type one field at
a time until there was no error message or the target data emerged:

<p> inject :  <code>ORDER BY 1 --</code>
[and other numbers to get the right number of columns]

<p> Assuming we get the number of columns, '4' here, and that we know a
valid acctnum, (<em>AccNum=11223344</em>), we can use the following
sequence with the the UNION SELECT clause to get the data types for the
columns:

<ul type='none'>
<li><code>11223344) UNION SELECT
NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL WHERE 1=2 --</code> No Error - Syntax is
right. MS SQL Server Used. Proceeding.

<li><code>11223344) UNION SELECT
1,NULL,NULL,NULL WHERE 1=2 --</code> No Error - First column is
an integer.

<li><code>11223344) UNION SELECT
1,2,NULL,NULL WHERE 1=2 --</code> Error! - Second column is not
an integer.

<li><code>11223344) UNION SELECT
1,'2',NULL,NULL WHERE 1=2 --</code> No Error - Second column is a
string.

<li><code>11223344) UNION SELECT
1,'2',3,NULL WHERE 1=2 --</code> Error! - Third column is not an
integer.

<li><code>11223344) UNION SELECT
1,'2','3',NULL WHERE 1=2 --</code> No Error - Third column is a
string.

<li><code>11223344) UNION SELECT
1,'2','3',4 WHERE 1=2 --</code> Error! - Fourth column is not an
integer.

<li><code>11223344) UNION SELECT 1,'2','3','4' WHERE 1=2 --</code> No
Error - Fourth column is a string.
</ul>

<p><code> From this point an attacker can craft more specific queries to
get system tables and eventually get, for example, CCnum, SSnum and other
sensitive variables.</code>

<p> This and other presentations are available only to full conference
attendees but Imperva has several white papers on their website which were
the basis for RSA presentation:

<p> <a href="http://www.imperva.com/application_defense_center/glossary/sql_injection.html">http://www.imperva.com/application_defense_center/glossary/sql_injection.html</a>
<br> 
<a href="http://www.imperva.com/application_defense_center/white_papers/blind_sql_server_injection.html">http://www.imperva.com/application_defense_center/white_papers/blind_sql_server_injection.html</a>

<p><strong>Maor</strong> also discussed how signature-based security tools
could be thwarted by using other SQL tricks - concatenation, buried
comments and use of character values for instance - to camouflage the
injected SQL.  Real security must be implemented at the application level
and web masters and developers must be careful in their designs and coding
and also very comprehensive in testing.

<p> At the conclusion of the session, Maor suggested using different admin
accounts and passwords for different tables and application functions as a
deterrent.  Also, while the occurrence of a certain SQL signature in a
parameter value might not be enough to alert for SQL injection attack, the
same signature in correlation with error responses or abnormal parameter
size of  other signatures may indicate an SQL injection attack.

<p> Microsoft researchers Kurt Dillard and Mike Danseglio gave a Hacker
track technical presentation on a new generation of stealthy rootkits for
Windows kernels. These smarter root kits intercept system calls and
actively filter out signs of their presence to avoid detection by software
and security staff.  Microsoft has posted a short white paper on file
hiding and a 'cross-view diff' tool they are developing to detect this
behavior:

<p> <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/rootkit">http://research.microsoft.com/rootkit</a>

<p> Another presentation by Dan Houser on stopping script kiddies and
automated attacks [for a mere $30K effort] suggested hiding critical
servers in the open by using available IP addresses for virtual servers on
an Internet-wide honey-pot. From the slides:

<p>
<ul type='square'>
<li> Convert unused Class B and C IP address space into decoy tripwire nets
<li> example: 16,320,000 decoys, 200 "real" servers
<li> Stop swallowing packets: route unreachable hosts to the virtual honeynet
<li> 190,000 decoys per "real" server = 99.9995% detection
<li> Any hits are malicious - route to IDS / IPS
</ul>

<p> The result is that port scans would take weeks and even years to
complete while source addresses for the attackers can be identified and
blocked before real systems are compromised. This is approach also known as
the Big Freakin' Haystack Initiative; see more at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bfhi">http://sourceforge.net/projects/bfhi</a>.


<h3>Vendor News</h3>

<p> Sun announced security enhancements to be added to its new Solaris10
OS, including an integrity checking process that provides assurance against
accidental or malicious tampering. A future update to Solaris 10 will
feature automatic run-time verification. This feature is designed to check
the system's code at the exact moment of execution, protecting against the
possibility of unauthorized modification between periodic auditing checks
and actual use. Administrators will be able to customize which signatures
will be checked, and use provided tools to digitally-sign code from other
sources.

<p>After 15 months of certification testing by an independent organization,
Sun announced that its Solaris 9 Operating System has received 'Common
Criteria Certification'. Common Criteria is a  critical requirement to many
governments, military and financial institutions. [Except for Sun's
military-grade Trusted Solaris operating system, Solaris becomes the only
general purpose operating system with protection profiles of both
Controlled Access Protection Profile and Role Based Access Control at
Evaluation Assurance Level 4+ (EAL4+). ]

<p> Also, among Sun speakers at RSA conference this week was their Chief
Security Officer, Whitfield Diffie, who headlined a cryptographers panel.
Diffie is co-author of the <em>Diffie-Hellman</em> standard for Public Key
exchange [PKI].

<p> Hewlett-Packard's booth demonstrated an HP technology to limit the
spread of viruses and worms throughout an enterprise by isolating problem
PCs and workstations and limiting outbound bandwidth. Its new
virus-throttling software will be available for ProLiant Servers and
ProCurve Networking by HP 5300 series switches.

<p> HP also announced its Security Containment suite for its HP-UX 11iv2
OS. This virtualizes application into domains and limits memory and file
access by domains.  

<p> Other new products at RSA2005 used Linux, but it was often implicit
rather than obvious: 

<p> Linux was 'inside' for many security appliances: many security
appliances for email, VPNs, firewalls, etc., use embedded Linux at least as
a guest OS for serial port terminal sessions. Some run their IDS on Linux.
Some of the longer term appliance vendors use hardened freeBSD [Borderware,
for example]. Sun uses ENEA's OSE [not Linux or secure Solaris],  and a
few use WindRiver's realtime OS, Vx Works. A few embedded Linux examples,
most using a 2.6 kernel:

<ul type='square'>
<li> Symantec appliances for firewalls, email, and network intrusion
<li> Foundry's web acceleration appliance
<li> ServGates EdgeForce line of all-in-one security appliances
<li> TippingPoint's UnityOne IPS and integrated security appliance,
winner of SC Magazine's 2005 award for 'best security solution' and
a true 1 Gps device, uses WindRiver Vx, but the companion SMS
manager device uses Linux.
</ul>

<p> Novell introduced its Security Manager product, which is based on its
SuSE Linux and runs on any standard PC server. The product includes
firewall and VPN gateway, intrusion protection, virus protection, spam
blocks and configurable content filtering. In this case, the underlying
software comes from Astaro Networks which also sells it directly [about
$300 for a server and a 10 device monitoring license].


<h3>Separation Anxiety</h3>

<p> Conference security separated the different classes of attendees so
successfully that it may become model of what other conferences will do.
Not only were the badges and holders different for full-conference
attendees, exhibitors, and expo attendees, the full-conference attendees
had their photos on the badges.

<p> Professional security company personnel were used instead of convention
center part timers, so expo attendees were cleared out of the exhibition
hall at certain times and  only full conference attendees got to see Bill
Gates keynote. Some vendors also provided expo perks to those with
full-conference badges.

<p> A theatrical presentation preceding the show's opening highlighted the
prohibition and codebreaker theme. It told the story of honored
codebreakers and security pioneers Elizabeth and William Friedman and how
they helped start US government codebreaking hegemony in World War I and
into the 1920s and 30s.

<p> Opening ceremony awards were aimed at recognizing ongoing contributions
to the advancement of information security. RSA 2005 recipients honored for
these annual awards include: for public policy, Orson Swindle, Federal
Trade Commission; for mathematics, Dan Boneh, associate professor, Stanford
University; and for best security practices, Michael Assante, CIO at
American Electric Power.  


<h3>Collateral and Contests</h3>

<p> There were more t-shirts, pens and other collateral offerings,
indicating a healthier industry. Borderware, a provider of anti-spam and
anti-virus software, offered a daily drawing for a 50-inch TV. There were
also uncountable drawings for iPods and X-Boxes.  Some vendors offered
wheel-spins for PC and X-Box games [and mousepads for the not-so-lucky].

<p> Three of the more useful collaterals were the CISSP [computer security
professional certification] assessment CD from CA, the box set of Solaris10
DVDs from Sun [saves a really, really long series of downloads and at least
4 CD-Rs], and the numerous retractable Ethernet cables [like the older
phone port connectors, only more useful.]

<p> Special commendation in this department goes to McAfee who offered the
current edition of "Hacking Exposed" - 737 pages - for only sitting through
a short presentation and a short demo. Although they did finally run out of
books, this was a great service toward promoting secure computing
everywhere. I was very happy to get an updated copy!

<p> And I was very happy to attend the 2005 RSA Conference and Expo.

<p> If you are are interested and live nearby, RSA Conference will also be
holding one-day regional events throughout the year including: September
13, 2005 in Chicago and September 15, 2005 in New York. For more

<h1>Free as in Freedom: Part Three: Open Source to the Corporate Bazaar</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/engel.html">Adam Engel</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<p> Perhaps I was over-zealous in my praise of Richard Stallman and the
Free Software Foundation (FSF) in Part One of this article, "<a
href="../111/engel.html">Free as in Freedom: GNU/Linux</a>." That would be
<em>unfair</em> to many major corporations and the state of the world
they've created. Lots of people, especially "successful" Americans, like
the world just the way it is. 

<p> Oh well. It was a history of "GNU beginnings," the start of a
movement that, unlike anything we've thus far seen, said "No!" to the
corporate-defined order and created an alternative to corporate rule by
copyright, and an operating system that challenged the way certain
corporate monopolies have defined our desktops and how we use them (or go
directly to jail).

<p> Well, that was the product of another era, which focused on GNU/Linux. 
Old. Old. All that progressive, anti-corporate stuff is ridiculous, 
romantic nonsense anyway - at least according to Eric Raymond, author of 
"The Cathedral and the Bazaar" and co-creator (along with various 
user/collaborators) of the immortal "fetchmail" program. This 
section is going to focus not on GNU/Linux, but "New Linux," the 
operating system as it exists today, with GUI desktop environments and 
all the features of your favorite monopoly software (plus thousands of 
Unix-like programs, tools, utilities etc.). So, time to wrest that 
sword-helmet-cuirass combo from Richard Stallman - though he did look 
awful good in that garb - and place them on the person of Raymond's 
visionary of the now-and-next-week, the one and only Linus Torvalds.

<p> Also, despite the legitimate concerns of the Free Software Foundation, 
the operating system will never be called GNU/Linux, just "Linux." 
This could be for brevity's sake, or because the idea of GNU/Linux was 
promoted too late, or other reasons only we paranoid progressives - 
actually, I'm not a progressive; I'm an anarchist, but it's all the 
same "lefty crowd" (except for Libertarians who manage to 'pass' for 
conservatives or plain old folks) of whiners and discontents, the kind 
of folks who fail to appreciate all the great stuff corporate 
monopolies bring to what's left of life on earth before they finally 
kill it outright.

<p> I began this article or series of articles because I saw in GNU/Linux 
an example of a successful rebellion for "the left" to examine as a 
model. I don't think I was mistaken, though, as with all movements, 
once the "revolutionaries" have set the ground, the "liberals" take 
over and try not only to remake the present, but rewrite the past. If 
I "lionized" Stallman and "romanticized" GNU and the free software 
movement to create a "founding" myth - oops. Better the real 
revolutionary Jefferson than the paper and wax model we have today 
thanks to generations of post-revolutionary revisionists. Stallman and 
the FSF did what they did, long before my zealous praise, which is why 
GNU/Linux exists today.

<p> According to Okopnik, the allure of GNU/Linux is rooted in the moral
imperative created by the FSF and Stallman, "but is not strictly about it.
That's the flexible, fun approach that gets people involved, people who
would run away from a purely political approach. Most people would have a
great time living in a true democracy - but that does not mean that they
all want to become politicians, or involve a significant chunk of their
time in running the whole shindig," wrote Okopnik.

<p> Okopnik pointed me to Eric S. Raymond's "<a
href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">The
Cathedral and the Bazaar</a>" for a different take on the politics of
GNU/Linux, or in this case, "New Linux."

<h3>New Myths for New Linux: Linus's Law and the Bazaar</h3>

"Linux is subversive. Who would have thought even five years ago (1991)
that a world-class operating system could coalesce as if by magic out of
part-time hacking by several thousand developers scattered all over the
planet, connected only by the tenuous strands of the Internet?" wrote Eric
S. Raymond in "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" which chronicles the creation
of his popular fetchmail program.

<p> Raymond extols the development techniques of Linus Torvalds, main 
developer of the Linux kernel, as the new paradigm for software 
development:

<p> "Linus Torvalds's style of development - release early and often,
delegate everything you can, be open to the point of promiscuity - came as
a surprise. No quiet, reverent cathedral-building here rather, the Linux
community seemed to resemble a great babbling bazaar of differing agendas
and approaches (aptly symbolized by the Linux archive sites, who'd take
submissions from anyone) out of which a coherent and stable system could
seemingly emerge only by a succession of miracles."

<p> Like Okopnik, he sees Linux users as a particularly self-reliant bunch; 
many Linux users, he concedes, are also Linux developers. Raymond's 
essay was written in the late 1990s, before the GNOME and KDE desktop 
environments increased GNU/Linux's appeal among the general public.

<p> Raymond wrote, "Another strength of the Unix tradition, one that Linux
pushes to a happy extreme, is that a lot of users are hackers too.  Because
source code is available, they can be effective hackers. This can be
tremendously useful for shortening debugging time. Given a bit of
encouragement, your users will diagnose problems, suggest fixes, and help
improve the code far more quickly than you could unaided.  Treating your
users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement
and effective debugging.

<p> "The power of this effect is easy to underestimate. In fact, pretty 
well all of us in the open-source world drastically underestimated how 
well it would scale up with number of users and against system 
complexity, until Linus Torvalds showed us differently.

<p> "In fact, I think Linus's cleverest and most consequential hack was not 
the construction of the Linux kernel itself, but rather his invention 
of the Linux development model. Linus's open development policy was 
the very opposite of cathedral-building. Linux's Internet archives were 
burgeoning, multiple distributions were being floated. And all of this 
was driven by an unheard-of frequency of core system releases.

<p> "Linus was treating his users as co-developers in the most effective 
possible way:

<p> "Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers.

<p> "Linus's innovation wasn't so much in doing quick-turnaround releases 
incorporating lots of user feedback (something like this had been 
Unix-world tradition for a long time), but in scaling it up to a level 
of intensity that matched the complexity of what he was developing. In 
those early times (around 1991) it wasn't unknown for him to release a 
new kernel more than once a day! Because he cultivated his base of 
co-developers and leveraged the Internet for collaboration harder than 
anyone else, this worked.

<p> "Granted, Linus is a damn fine hacker. How many of us could engineer an 
entire production-quality operating system kernel from scratch? But 
Linux didn't represent any awesome conceptual leap forward. Linus is 
not (or at least, not yet) an innovative genius of design in the way 
that, say, Richard Stallman or James Gosling (of NeWS and Java) are. 
Rather, Linus seems to me to be a genius of engineering and 
implementation, with a sixth sense for avoiding bugs and development 
dead-ends and a true knack for finding the minimum-effort path from 
point A to point B. Indeed, the whole design of Linux breathes this 
quality and mirrors Linus's essentially conservative and simplifying 
design approach.

<p> "So, if rapid releases and leveraging the Internet medium to the hilt 
were not accidents but integral parts of Linus's engineering-genius 
insight into the minimum-effort path, what was he maximizing? What was 
he cranking out of the machinery?

<p> "Put that way, the question answers itself. Linus was keeping his 
hacker/users constantly stimulated and rewarded - stimulated by the 
prospect of having an ego-satisfying piece of the action, rewarded by 
the sight of constant (even daily) improvement in their work.

<p> "Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every 
problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.

<p> "Or, less formally, 'Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.' I 
dub this: 'Linus's Law'." 

<p> So, Raymond is replacing the "old heroes" with a new one, Linus. 
Simple and "essentially conservative" in approach. The very words, 
"Cathedral" and "Bazaar" were already in use to describe two 
different development styles; nevertheless, they are loaded like 
cluster bombs, and Raymond takes advantage of this, implying that the 
"New Linux" style is the wave of "the now" and the future, while the 
"old way" of the FSF - he even mentions Stallman and GNU Emacs as 
relics of the Cathedral - is as obsolete as any old Church.

<h3>"Cathedral versus Bazaar"</h3>

Raymond wrote, "In Linus's Law, I think, lies the core difference 
underlying the cathedral-builder and bazaar styles. In the 
cathedral-builder view of programming, bugs and development problems 
are tricky, insidious, deep phenomena. It takes months of scrutiny by a 
dedicated few to develop confidence that you've winkled them all out. 
Thus the long release intervals, and the inevitable disappointment when 
long-awaited releases are not perfect... In the bazaar view, on the 
other hand, you assume that bugs are generally shallow phenomena - or, 
at least, that they turn shallow pretty quickly when exposed to a 
thousand eager co-developers pounding on every single new release. 
Accordingly you release often in order to get more corrections, and as 
a beneficial side effect you have less to lose if an occasional botch 
gets out the door... And that's it. That's enough. If 'Linus's Law' is 
false, then any system as complex as the Linux kernel, being hacked 
over by as many hands as the that kernel was, should at some point have 
collapsed under the weight of unforeseen bad interactions and 
undiscovered 'deep' bugs. If it's true, on the other hand, it is 
sufficient to explain Linux's relative lack of bugginess and its 
continuous uptimes spanning months or even years." 

<p> I wrote to Stallman that, according to my reading of "The Cathedral 
and the Bazaar" Raymond, who used to develop GNU software, seemed to 
classify the GNU/FSF method of development as "Cathedral" style as 
opposed to the "Bazaar" style used by himself and Linus Torvalds.

<p> Stallman responded:

<p> "Is he still saying this? I thought he had stopped... It is not true. 
There is no single GNU/FSF development method, since each package 
maintainer can handle this as he likes. In fact, some GNU packages 
tried the Bazaar model before ESR did. ... The fact is that before the 
Bazaar model, the Cathedral model was the only one. We used it, ESR 
used it, and everyone used it...  I think ESR tried to associate that 
model with GNU so as to make us look bad. He does not like our 
philosophy, so he hoped that by making us look bad, he can reduce our 
influence. However, I told him this was not true, and I thought he had 
taken it out. Hence my question about whether he is still saying this."

<p> Raymond went on to point out that the old corporate model of top-down 
design no longer applied, that developers were more apt to create great 
software if they were allowed to have fun while doing so, enjoy their 
work as opposed to living a "Dilbert" nightmare in a cubicle; 
nonetheless, this applies to the corporation. Raymond's vision of the 
future is one of the successful corporate software product.

<p> When the first version of "The Cathedral and The Bazaar" was 
published in 1997, Netscape released its code as "open-source." 
Exactly as Stallman had warned, "open source" was a corporate 
methodology of co-opting the free software movement and sucking free 
software into its own code. Raymond's unctuous epilog to "The 
Cathedral and the Bazaar:"

<pre style="background-color:#f4f1bf; border:black solid 1px; padding:10px; font-size: 110%;">
<big><strong>Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar</strong></big>
It's a strange feeling to realize you're helping make history...  On
January 22 1998, approximately seven months after I first published The
Cathedral and the Bazaar, Netscape Communications, Inc. announced it would
give away the source for Netscape Communicator. I had had no clue this was
going to happen before the day of the announcement.

"Eric Hahn, executive vice president and chief technology officer at
Netscape, emailed me shortly afterwards as follows: ``On behalf of everyone
at Netscape, I want to thank you for helping us get to this point in the
first place. Your thinking and writings were fundamental inspirations to
our decision.''

"The following week I flew out to Silicon Valley at Netscape's invitation
for a day-long strategy conference (on 4 Feb 1998) with some of their top
executives and technical people. We designed Netscape's source-release
strategy and license together.

"A few days later I wrote the following:

"Netscape is about to provide us with a large-scale, real-world test of the
bazaar model in the commercial world. The open-source culture now faces a
danger; if Netscape's execution doesn't work, the open-source concept may
be so discredited that the commercial world won't touch it again for
another decade.

"On the other hand, this is also a spectacular opportunity. Initial
reaction to the move on Wall Street and elsewhere has been cautiously
positive. We're being given a chance to prove ourselves, too. If Netscape
regains substantial market share through this move, it just may set off a
long-overdue revolution in the software industry. 
</pre>

<p> So, unlike GNU and the FSF "making history" by turning the corporate
model on its head and inventing a successful alternative, Raymond "made
history" by eliciting positive reactions on Wall Street.  Raymond had done
well. His work received an A+ from his market masters.

<p> Stallman was absolutely right when he warned that the greatest threat 
to the movement he and others created would come from within, under the 
guise of "Open Source":

<pre style="background-color:#f4f1bf; border:black solid 1px; padding:10px; font-size: 110%;">
The largest division in the community is between people who appreciate free
software as a social and ethical issue and consider proprietary software a
social problem (supporters of the free software movement), and those who
cite only practical benefits and present free software only as an efficient
development model (the open source movement). This disagreement is not just
a matter of names - it is a matter of differing basic values.  It is
essential for the community to see and think about this disagreement.  The
names 'free software' and 'open source' are the banners of the two
positions. See '<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html">Why Free Software Is Better Than Open Source</a>'. The 
disagreement over values partially aligns with the amount of attention
people pay to the GNU Project's role in our community. People who value
freedom are more likely to call the system "GNU/Linux", and people who
learn that the system is "GNU/Linux" are more likely to pay attention to
our philosophical arguments for freedom and community (which is why the
choice of name for the system makes a real difference for society).
However, the disagreement would probably exist even if everyone knew the
system's real origin and its proper name, because the issue is a real one.
It can only go away if we who value freedom either persuade everyone (which
won't be easy) or are defeated entirely (let's hope not).
</pre>

<p> A subsequent email interview indicates that Raymond would most 
certainly not be upset if the free software movement and the FSF were 
"defeated entirely."

<p> According to Okopnik, "the NSA, the DOD, NASA, NWS, and many other 
government agencies are committed to Linux (the DOD, in particular, had 
actually made and then cancelled a multimillion dollar contract with 
Microsoft, based on the latter being unable to meet their performance 
promises.) Sun, IBM, Oracle, Novell, and many other companies are 
aligning behind it; hardware manufacturers are now either including 
Linux drivers or are making them available on their sites."

<p> So it is not taking a great leap to presume that GNU/Linux, 
specifically, the "New Linux," may be on its way to becoming a 
"proprietary open source" system. That is, the code will be open, but 
someone will own it. The software giant, Novell, bought the GNU/Linux 
distributor, SuSE, in December of 2004. We will see how this "open 
source" buyout effects the freedom of users of SuSE's distribution of 
GNU/Linux.

<p> Seen in this light, the "bazaar" model is not so beneficial to its 
users, merely a smart business move. Any corporation that does not go 
open source will lose, for they'd be missing out on a huge free 
development pool. Then again, how long would that last? Would 
user/developers submit bug reports and fixes and improvement hacks to a 
company that will incorporate the fixes into their proprietary 
software, then charge licensing fees (one to a customer, like the $129 
Macintosh Panther "upgrade") to those same user/developers despite 
providing this invaluable service? Why bother hiring professional 
programmers at all? Perhaps they'd pay small rewards for individual 
fixes and hacks sent in by user/developers.

<p> But according to Raymond, such questions are not worth asking, much 
less answering, and merely show how little "progressives" understand 
the open source movement (I never should have identified myself as a 
"progressive"; sounds too namby-pamby, like "liberal"; I should have 
described the magazines I read and write for as 
anarcho-libertarian-market-conservative. Then again, are readers of 
such magazines and web sites as "The Progressive" and "The Progressive 
Review" non-persons? Is it somehow more legitimate to identify oneself 
as a "conservative"? Conserve what? Body bags in Iraq? Anyway, if 
"Progressive" is such a powerful word, imagine what dark emotions are 
stirred by the GNU/ prefix to GNU/Linux...)

<p> I wrote to Raymond, "The main point of this two part article is to call 
attention to the fact that while "progressives" have been in-fighting 
and 'lesser-eviling,' an entire movement has evolved to challenge 
corporate control of the desk top - and it's 'winning.' Why do you 
think this has gone "unrecognized" by "progressives" in the U.S.? 
This is a major demonstration of the power of community over the 
corporation."

<p> He replied, "Your question answers itself. Adopting the 
self-description "progressive" is, among other things, a way of 
announcing 'I am so blinded by a Marxist-derived fear and hatred of 
markets that I cannot reason about anything related to economics 
without making ludicrous errors!' ... The open-source movement and 
corporations get along well because both are fundamentally about the 
same thing - voluntary cooperation in markets. The corporate market is 
primarily monetized and the open-source one primarily non-monetized, 
but that is an unimportant detail... But for 'progressives' to really 
understand why it is an unimportant detail they would have to abandon 
their most cherished myth, of the market as an exploitation machine run 
by malevolent plutocrats. I expect them to get clear about this about 
the same time that we start seeing competent biology from Creationists 
or competent geography from Flat-Earthers. "

<p> So, corporations are about "voluntary cooperation in markets", and the
monetization of corporations is a "minor detail". I didn't know rampant
corporatization of all business, the destruction of real competitive arenas
and individually-owned shops by monopolies, and all the rest of that
government subsidized corporate socialism had anything to do with markets
in which people actually exchange goods and services, as opposed to selling
their lifetimes to transnational behemoths. I suppose we "progressives" -
something I never identified myself as, actually - have so much to learn,
but since we obviously all think alike, the knowledge such people as
Raymond could impart will spread among us like a virus. And who said
anything about Marxism? Is one always either a "conservative" or a
"Marxist?"

<p> I wrote, "The first part of this article is about the history of 
GNU/Linux, Stallman and the GNU programmers (including yourself), the 
FSF, "copyleft", the how and the why of the free software movement. 
Part Two is about "New Linux" - the immense growth in distribution, 
diversity and user-friendly interfaces - supported hardware drivers, 
HOWTOs and other documentation, distribution-specific easy-install 
GUI's for beginners. First of all, what is your opinion on the 
insistence of certain members of the free software community to use the 
term GNU/Linux at all times, correcting the majority who refers to the 
OS, probably because it's just easier, as "Linux?"

<p> Raymond replied, "Insistence on the "GNU/Linux" label is political 
move by people who want to preserve and extend the reputation of the 
FSF. Myself, I agree with Linus Torvalds that this is a ridiculous 
form of special pleading - anybody who takes their argument seriously 
should really honor *all* the historical contributors and call it 
"GNU/X/Unix/Linux", or "GNU/X/BSD/Unix/Linux", or even 
"GNU/X/BSD/Unix/Multics/Linux'."

<p> Why not Linucks? Or Lynn Ucks? What's in a name? Look at all us 
flat-earth "progressives" lumped together like the coal Santa reserves 
for the unwashed stockings of incorrigible brats.

<p> I wrote, "Do you think that by becoming more user-friendly, embracing
a larger user base in an attempt appeal to "average users" who just want
word-processor, email and a browser (which Linux offers via KDE and GNOME,
as well as Mozilla and others), Linux is "compromising" its position as a
free operating system - free as in speech, not beer etc., losing it's
'edge?'

<p> Raymond responded, "This question only makes sense within a world-view 
that equates being 'edgy' or 'cool' with a sort of surly oppositionism. 
Thank you, I would much rather co-opt the bourgeoisie and succeed in 
my revolution than sneer at them and fail."

<p> Another "misunderstanding." I meant creative edge. I've never been 
into "cool" - or the bourgeoisie, much less the possibility of goading 
them into "revolution." But of course, since his entire world view 
shifted into package mode and tarred and gzipped me upon mention of 
the word "progressive" (I knew I should have just admitted I'm a 
burn-down-the-house anarchist; I would have used the word "leftist" 
but that particular term scares such people, who fear of failing the 
bourgeoisie even as they dream of leading bourgeois revolutions (when 
was the last time anyone used that old word, " bourgeoisie," anyway? 
Freshman Sociology?), to death.

<p> I wrote, "GNU and the FSF are all about free software. No compromise.
While this served to create a 'revolution,' Linux is now past the
revolutionary stage. In "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" you speak only about
"open source," not "free software." What's the difference, according to
you? "

<p> Raymond replied, "The software, the technology, the developers, and 
even the licenses are essentially the same. The only thing that 
differs is the attitude and the propaganda - how the results are 
marketed to the rest of the world... Early versions of CatB did in fact 
refer to 'free software'. That was before a bunch of us got together 
in early 1998 to invent a label that would be less likely to make 
businessmen and journalists write us off as Communistic flake 
cases... We promulgated the label 'open source' as a banner for a new 
style of argument - one which co-opts people with real-world results 
rather than cramming an ideology down their throats. Six years later, 
I think we can say this move was pretty successful."

<p> So. "A bunch of us" got together and decided to create a terminology
that would be used by the rest of the world, something that wouldn't offend
the businessmen and mainstream journalists who serve "the rest of us" so
well. Supported by corporate sponsors and the media they control, it "was
pretty successful." This would be funny, almost corny, if the events of the
past four years hadn't put the corporatization of humanity under the New
World Order in stark, murderous perspective. So those who disagree with the
corporate order are "communist flake cases." Well, at least we're not
terrorists.

<p> I wrote, "Can Linux maintain the freedom and community/volunteer
attitude that inspired so many user/programmers to spend many unpaid hours
developing and perfecting the system and its applications? Fetchmail is a
perfect example of a user/programmer devoting enormous amounts of time to a
project simply because it was a "good idea," and like most good ideas,
worth creating. It belonged in the world, but it wasn't, I assume,
requested by the Division Manager of Linux Central..."

<p> Raymond wrote, "No, it wasn't. As you say, fetchmail was a triumph of 
people volunteering on a good idea - there is no Division Manager, 
anywhere... 

<br>

I'm always puzzled by questions of the form 'Can Linux keep this up?'
They seem to proceed from an assumption that large-scale voluntary
cooperation is somehow fragile and exceptional, in danger of being
overwhelmed at any second by malevolent forces that are far more
powerful... This assumption is deeply wrong - voluntary cooperation in 
a win-win mode is the rule in 99.95% of human interactions, otherwise 
the streets would run with blood. Trade in the market, ordinary social 
communication, and even our use of language with each other are all 
systems of voluntary cooperation far more elaborate than the 
open-source movement. Yet *those* we take for granted and do not even 
register as cooperation, persisting despite the evidence of our own 
daily experience in the belief the "natural" behavior of human beings 
is a sort of dog-eat-dog Hobbesian strife within which open source is 
inevitably doomed. It's absurd when you think about it."

<p> In case Raymond hadn't noticed, many, many streets of the world, 
including Wall Street if one includes 9/11, are running with blood. 
But I agree with the sentence, "It is absurd". First of all, the 
Hobbesian definition of humanity came out of nowhere. I didn't mention 
it. Surely it was on this man's mind. Secondly, the excitement, the 
"edge" I was referring to came out of a community-based free 
operating system that programmer/users can participate in creating. A 
sense of participation and power over one's own destiny. An alternative 
to Microsoft not merely because "it's there" but because of the 
philosophy behind it. I wonder how many programmers volunteer to spend 
hours fixing bugs in Microsoft's code. Or if the "bazaar" mentality 
will be able to sustain itself under a "proprietary Linux."

<p> I wrote, "The FSF, and others in the free software movement, are 
adamant about keeping free software free to the extent that they 
would have boycotted KDE if the Qt development tools hadn't been 
released as free software. If a proprietary application was 
developed that would accelerate the growth and development of 
Linux to the point where Windows users would jump ship and flock to 
Linux in droves, but the owner of the proprietary app would have a 
degree of control (more than most at any rate) over Linux, would you 
support this?"

<p> Raymond replied, "No, I wouldn't. But my reasons for rejecting it would
be different in flavor than the FSF's. They would utter moralistic
arguments about the goodness of sharing and the evil of secrecy. I would
point out that proprietary control leads to bad engineering and bad
outcomes, appealing to the self-interest of users rather than moral
principle."

<p> Again, it's good to see strong, pragmatic minds fighting the urge 
toward sharing and transparency. Such pragmatic minds would surely 
have pointed out the Bush Administration's lying its way to the 
destruction of 100,000 Iraqis not because it was "wrong," just not 
cost effective.

<p> I wrote, "The development of KDE and GNOME, has resulted in a "New
Linux." It's not just for "hackers" anymore. The "average user" can now use
a word processor/email/browser combo and leave the PC without having to
deal with the command-line or the "iceberg" beneath the GUI tip he/she is
exposed to. If the purpose of Linux (is there a "purpose"?) is to provide
an alternative to Windows/Apple etc., then that purpose is served: users
have a choice; they don't have to accept Windows XP pre-loaded on their new
desktop. Beyond that, how would you define "progress" or "success" as far
as Linux is concerned. There are people who get caught up in the latest
benchmark tests pitting Linux against Windows or Solaris, as if it were a
sporting event. Once you get into that, Linux becomes just another
corporate-sponsored OS. Do you think it will grow along its own path to
provide a genuine change in "paradigms," in the way people relate to the
software that powers their machines, or do you see it becoming merely
another commercial alternative to what's out there? (This gets back to the
'open source' question: is 'open source,' as opposed to 'free' a way of
integrating Linux into the corporate software business?).

<p> Raymond responded, "Whenever I see questions like this, I am reminded
of an anecdote about Charles Babbage, the Victorian pioneer of computing.
He was once asked "Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong
figures, will the right answers come out?" Like Mr.  Babbage, I find myself
'not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could
provoke such a question.'

<p> Raymond wrote, "The confusion gets really thick in the third paragraph.
Among its implicit assumptions appear to be the following:

<p> "(1) Benchmark-comparing a piece of software X with commercial software 
products Y and Z implies that X is 'corporate-sponsored'.

<p> "(2) Corporate sponsorship is like having some sort of case of 
metaphysical cooties that negates the real value of what Linux 
programmers have done.

<p> Raymond wrote, "These are nonsense individually, and add up to nonsense 
on stilts. You then go on in the fourth paragraph with an assumption 
that:

<p> "(3) The descriptions 'changes the way people relate to their machines'
and 'just another commercial alternative' are mutually exclusive.

<p> "This is also nonsense. Consider as a very obvious example the way
that the cell-phone, which is 'just another commercial alternative' to
land-lines, has radically changed the way people relate to handsets -
to the extent that they're now treated as fashion accessories," wrote 
Raymond.

<p> Well, first of all, I hate cell phones. They're noisy, ubiquitous, and
fry your brain. Fashion accessories are most certainly "bourgeois". Still,
I don't understand the "confusion" my questions provoked. The original
rebellious spirit of GNU/Linux that set the process of creating a free
alternative to Mac and Windows is, as Raymond demonstrates, being set aside
for fidelity to "Linux" for its own sake. Like America's still supposed to
be the "republic" it was, or was supposed to be, cause we have a theme
song, elections and a flag. Thus, when "Linux" advocates "root" for Linux
to "beat" Microsoft in a test meant to determine the winner of a government
defense contract, support of Linux as anything but "just another OS" is
meaningless. In such a scenario, why not Microsoft? Or Sun? Or Univax? If
"success" means Linux has reached the point at which the DOD wants it to
create weapons of destruction, it's no better or worse than Microsoft. Just
another corporation competing for military (tax-payer) dollars. That's not
a valid question?

<p> Raymond wrote, "Your confusion appears to be a manifestation of
progressives' general inability to understand open-source software except
through a haze of romantic idealism that distorts it out of all
recognition."

<p> Again, I don't see where this haze of romantic idealism exhibits itself
anywhere but in Raymond's tepid imagination - no idealistic revolutions for
that staid worker-bee. Nevertheless, in the time spent trying to be clever
and wry, he could have just answered my question, which he did at last do
in a sentence, contradicting himself, for if my question was so
over-the-top confusing, how was he able to answer it at all?

<p> Raymond wrote, "Having said that, I will now answer your question: the 
'success' of open source is defined by the extent to which it gives 
software users and software developers more choices. "

<p> What? Isn't that - ? Oh, well. Never mind. I thought GNU/Linux was 
supposed to be anarchic, rebellious and fun, not... creepy.

<p> I'm glad Raymond was able to diffuse his pent-up frustrations at being
on the supply-side of a life-destroying world-order before "answering" my
question. It probably made him feel even better than a good half-hour on
the Stair-Master. I have a feeling that Raymond was just messing around,
anyway. I quoted this interchange verbatim because, in 18 years of
journalism, this was the nastiest, most mean-spirited, arrogant, and
ultimately goofy one I've seen ("communist flake cases?" What 1950s-era FBI
comic book did he get that one from? Communist? Because I said I write for
progressive 'zines? Or maybe because I mentioned the FSF? Are they
considered "communists" now, fifteen years after the Cold War?). Perhaps he
figured that just in case this article is picked up by an "important"
mainstream publication, it was a chance to score points with his
corporate/bourgeois masters. Does Netscape still exist? Maybe there's
someone there he wants to impress.

<p> Regardless, his contempt for any questioning of his corporate agenda 
for GNU/Linux (he is, after all, on the "winning" side), his dismissal 
of all that came before him, as if GNU and the hundreds (thousands?) 
who worked on it were just "flaking around" until Linus Torvalds came 
out with his kernel in 1991, and his crude, bullying remarks to a 
stranger asking valid questions, whether meant as a spoof or not, 
demand attention. It demands a re-reading of the documentation on 
gnu.org and fsf.org to remind us exactly how the operating system 
Raymond works with - I wonder how successful fetchmail would have been 
had Raymond broached the idea of a new free consumer good during a 
board meeting of SUN or HP? - began, and why.

<p> Especially now. Especially with most of humanity fighting for existence
against a New World Order (not unlike a 'New Linux," if such developers as
Raymond have their way) that literally puts the profit of a minority
against the well-being, perhaps even survival of its own species. And let's
not forget about Iraq and the corporations who are benefitting from what
we've done there. Perhaps it's the naive "progressive" in me, but somehow I
associate the high-tech wasting of 100,000 lives, another fixed election
based in part on proprietary software, and all sorts of proprietary
nastiness - for what is the U.S. government, now, but a proprietary system?
- with "a bunch of us" creating a name for corporate-friendly, "open
source" software that won't - heaven forbid - offend CNN or Time
Magazine.

<p> Stallman was right. It isn't a question of this or that operating 
system succeeding in the marketplace - not even a marketplace, a 
Windows dominion, though if Okopnik's facts on other countries 
developing Linux are correct, this may change. But again, if the power 
of GNU/Linux is harnessed by the DOD to create yet smarter weapons of 
mass destruction, who needs it?

<p> As Stallman wrote (<a
href="http://www.gnu.org">http://www.gnu.org</a>): "How will we respond to
the next tempting non-free library? Will the whole community understand the
need to stay out of the trap? Or will many of us give up freedom for
convenience, and produce a major problem? Our future depends on our
philosophy."

<p> Or, as Ben Okopnik wrote, "We need our radicals. They're ugly, scruffy,
pushy, aggressive, loud, and unfit for normal humans to associate with -
but, O Ghod do we need them! They sacrifice themselves on the altar of
whatever the hell their passion may be; they give up their right to be seen
as "normal", and make of themselves targets at which the majority of
society will fling rocks and garbage - and we, the human race, get to move
ahead just another tiny notch for each one of them. Granted, there are
radicals on either side of the fence, and lots of different fences, but the
total vector of these little steps *is* in the direction of progress;
another pragmatic belief of mine, and although I won't go into the
philosophical ramifications of it, it can be summed up as "'good' is just
another way of saying 'pro-survival'."

<h1>Experiments with the Linux Kernel: Process Segments</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/krishnakumar.html">R. Krishnakumar</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<h3><a name="s1" id="s1">1. Introduction</a>
</h3>

<p>Traditionally, a Unix process is divided into segments. The
standard segments are code segment, data segment, BSS (block
started by symbol), and stack segment.</p>

<p>The code segment contains the binary code of the program which
is running as the process (a "process" is a program in execution).
The data segment contains the initialized global variables and data
structures. The BSS segment contains the uninitialized global data
structures and finally, the stack segment contains the local
variables, return addresses, etc. for the particular process.</p>

<p>Under Linux, a process can execute in two modes - <em>user
mode</em> and <em>kernel mode</em>. A process usually executes in
user mode, but can switch to kernel mode by making system calls.
When a process makes a system call, the kernel takes control and
does the requested service on behalf of the process. The process is
said to be running in kernel mode during this time. When a process
is running in user mode, it is said to be "in userland" and when it
is running in kernel mode it is said to be "in kernel space". We
will first have a look at how the process segments are dealt with
in userland and then take a look at the bookkeeping on process
segments done in kernel space.</p>

<h3><a name="s2" id="s2">2. Userland's view of the segments</a>
</h3>

<p>The code segment consists of the code - the actual executable
program. The code of all the functions we write in the program
resides in this segment. The addresses of the functions will give
us an idea where the code segment is. If we have a function
<code>foo()</code> and let <code>x</code> be the address of
<code>foo</code> (<code>x = &amp;foo;</code>). we know that
<code>x</code> will point within the code segment.</p>

<p>The Data segment consists of the initialized global variables of
a program. The Operating system needs to know what values are used
to initialize the global variables. The initialized variables are
kept in the data segment. To get the address of the data segment we
declare a global variable and then print out its address. This
address must be inside the data segment.</p>

<p>The BSS consists of the uninitialized global variables of a
process. To get an address which occurs inside the BSS, we declare
an uninitialized global variable, then print its address.</p>

<p>The automatic variables (or local variables) will be allocated
on the stack, so printing out the addresses of local variables will
provide us with the addresses within the stack segment.</p>

<h3><a name="s3" id="s3">3. A C program</a>
</h3>
<!-- 20050220 dsrich - Copied program out, compiled and ran, made compilable print_segments.c.txt file and linked -->

<p>Let's have a look at the following <a href=
"misc/krishnakumar/print_segments.c.txt">C program</a>:</p>

<pre class="code">
 1 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 2 #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
 3 #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
 4 #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
 5
 6 int our_init_data = 30;
 7 int our_noinit_data;
 8
 9 void our_prints(void)
10 {
11         int our_local_data = 1;
12         printf("\nPid of the process is = %d", getpid());
13         printf("\nAddresses which fall into:");
14         printf("\n 1) Data  segment = %p",
15                 &amp;our_init_data);
16         printf("\n 2) BSS   segment = %p",
17                 &amp;our_noinit_data);
18         printf("\n 3) Code  segment = %p",
19                 &amp;our_prints);
20         printf("\n 4) Stack segment = %p\n",
21                 &amp;our_local_data);
22
23         while(1);
24 }
25
26 int main()
27 {
28         our_prints();
29         return 0;
30 }
</pre>
We can see that lines 6 and 7 declare two global variables. One is
initialized and one is uninitialized. Per the previous discussion,
the initialized variable will fall into the data segment and the
uninitialized variable will fall into the BSS segment. Lines 14-17
print the addresses of the variables.

<p>We also know that the address of the function
<code>our_prints</code> will fall into the code segment, so that if
we print the address of this function, we will get a value which
falls into the code segment. This is done in lines 18-19.</p>

<p>Finally we print the address of a local variable. This automatic
variable's address will be within the stack segment.</p>

<h3><a name="s4" id="s4">4. Execution of a userland program</a>
</h3>

<p>When we execute a userland program, similar to the one given
above, what happens is that the shell will <code>fork()</code> and
<code>exec()</code> the new program. The <code>exec()</code> code
inside the kernel will figure out what format the binary is in
(<em>ELF</em>, <em>a.out</em>, etc.) and will call the
corresponding handler for that format. For example when an ELF
format file is loaded, the function <code>load_elf_binary()</code>
from <code>fs/binfmt_elf.c</code> takes care of initializing the
kernel data structures for the particular process. Details of this
portion of loading will not be dealt with here, as that in itself
is a topic for another article :-) The point here is that the code
which loads the executable into the kernel fills in the kernel
data structures.</p>

<h3><a name="s5" id="s5">5. Memory-related data structures in the
kernel</a>
</h3>

<p>In the Linux kernel, every process has an associated
<code>struct task_struct</code>. The definition of this struct is
in the header file <code>include/linux/sched.h</code>. The
following snippet is from the 2.6.10 Linux kernel source code (only
the needed fields and a few nearby fields are shown):</p>

<pre class="code">
struct task_struct {
        volatile long state;    /* -1 unrunnable, 0 runnable, &gt;0 stopped */
        struct thread_info *thread_info;
        atomic_t usage;
        ...
        ...
        ...
        struct mm_struct *mm, *active_mm;
        ...
        ...
        ...
        pid_t pid;
        ...
        ...
        ...
        char comm[16];
        ...
        ...
};
</pre>
Three members of the data structure are relevant to us:

<ol>
<li><code>pid</code> contains the Process ID of the process.</li>

<li><code>comm</code> holds the name of the process.</li>

<li>The <code>mm_struct</code> within the <code>task_struct</code>
is the key to all memory management activities related to the
process.</li>
</ol>
The <code>mm_struct</code> is defined in
<code>include/linux/sched.h</code> as:

<pre class="code">
struct mm_struct {
        struct vm_area_struct * mmap;           /* list of VMAs */
        struct rb_root mm_rb;
        struct vm_area_struct * mmap_cache;     /* last find_vma result */
        ...
        ...
        ...
        unsigned long start_code, end_code, start_data, end_data;
        unsigned long start_brk, brk, start_stack;
        ...
        ...
        ...
};
</pre>
Here the first member of importance is the <code>mmap</code>. The
<code>mmap</code> contains the pointer to the list of VMAs (Virtual
Memory Areas) related to this process. Full usage of the process
address space occurs very rarely. The sparse regions used are
denoted by VMAs. So each VMA will contain information about a
single region. The VMAs are stored in <code>struct
vm_area_struct</code> defined in <code>linux/mm.h</code>:

<pre class="code">
struct vm_area_struct {
        struct mm_struct * vm_mm;       /* The address space we belong to. */
        unsigned long vm_start;         /* Our start address within vm_mm. */
        unsigned long vm_end;           /* The first byte after our end address
                                           within vm_mm. */
        ....
        ....
        ....
        /* linked list of VM areas per task, sorted by address */
        struct vm_area_struct *vm_next;
        ....
        ....
}
</pre>

<!-- Those were the basics of the memory data structures we needed to 
get hold of, to progress further into the article. -->

<h3><a name="s6" id="s6">6. Kernel's view of the segments</a>
</h3>

<p>The kernel keeps track of the segments which have been allocated
to a particular process using the above structures. For each
segment, the kernel allocates a VMA. It keeps track of these
segments in the <code>mm_struct</code> structures.</p>

<p>The kernel tracks the data segment using two variables:
<code>start_data</code> and <code>end_data</code>. The code segment
boundaries are in the <code>start_code</code> and
<code>end_code</code> variables. The stack segment is covered by
the single variable <code>start_stack</code>. There is no special
variable to keep track of the BSS segment &mdash; the VMA
corresponding to the BSS accounts for it.</p>

<p>The module accepts the pid of the process, which it should
dissect, as its parameter (line 48). The module will go through the
list of processes in the kernel (32-37), and when it finds the
required pid, it will call the function '<code>print_mem</code>'
function which will print the details from the memory management
related data structures of the kernel.</p>

<h3><a name="s8" id="s8">8. Let us get into execution mode</a>
</h3>

<p>I ran the C program given in the earlier section and, while it was still
running, loaded the kernel module with the pid of the process. Please note
that the program was compiled<em>statically</em> (-static) rather than
<em>dynamically</em>, to avoid the unnecessary complication of shared
libraries. Here is what I got:</p>

<pre class="code">
# ./print_segments &amp;
Pid of the process is = 3283
Addresses which fall into:
 1) Data  segment = 0x80a000c
 2) BSS   segment = 0x80a1a10
 3) Code  segment = 0x80481f4
 4) Stack segment = 0xbffff8e4

# /sbin/insmod print_kern_ds.ko pid_mem=3283

Got the process id to look up as 3283.
print_segments[3283]

This mm_struct has 5 vmas.

Vma number 1:
  Starts at 0x8048000, Ends at 0x80a0000

Vma number 2:
  Starts at 0x80a0000, Ends at 0x80a1000

Vma number 3:
  Starts at 0x80a1000, Ends at 0x80c3000

Vma number 4:
  Starts at 0xb7fff000, Ends at 0xb8000000

Vma number 5:
  Starts at 0xbffff000, Ends at 0xc0000000

Code  Segment start = 0x8048000, end = 0x809fc38
Data  Segment start = 0x80a0000, end = 0x80a0ec4
Stack Segment start = 0xbffffb30
</pre>

Let's analyze the output. According to the userland program the
address 0x80a000c should fall into the data segment. This can be
verified by looking into the information we got from the kernel
module, on printing the Data segment starting address and VMA
number 2. For the code segment, it is starting at 0x8048000 as per
the kernel data structures. Also according to the userland program
the address 0x80481f4 should fall into the code segment. Hence
userland and kernel tallies.

<p>Now, lets look at the Stack segment: the userland program says that the
address 0xbffff8e4 should fall into it and kernel data structures states
that stack will start from 0xbffffb30. In a 386-based architecture the
stack grows downwards. The BSS is not stored in any particular variable of
the kernel, but there is a VMA allocated for the corresponding location
- from the userland program, the address 0x80a1a10 should come inside the
BSS, and a look at VMA 3 makes it clear that this is the corresponding
VMA for the BSS.</p>

<h3><a name="s9" id="s9">9. Gathering Information from /proc</a>
</h3>

<p>We have been using custom programs to explore the contents of the data
structures inside the kernel, but the kernel provides a standard interface
for us to access such information. The memory maps of a particular process
can be obtained by doing a '<code>cat
/proc/<em>&lt;pid&gt;</em>/maps</code>' where <em>&lt;pid&gt;</em> should
be the pid of the process of which we need to get the details about. When I
ran it, the program used pid 3283; here is the memory map, trimmed to
fit:</p>

<pre class="code">
# cat /proc/3283/maps | cut -f1 -d' '
08048000-080a0000
080a0000-080a1000
080a1000-080c3000
b7fff000-b8000000
bffff000-c0000000
ffffe000-fffff000
</pre>
A close look at the output shows that the first region corresponds
to the code segment, the second region matches the data segment,
the third is the BSS segment and the 5th region corresponds to the
stack segment.

<h3><a name="s10" id="s10">10. Conclusion</a>
</h3>

<p>We have looked at the userland perspective of how the segments
are treated for a program. Then we examined the data structures in
the kernel which keep track of the segments. We verified that our
assumptions are correct using userland and kernel programs. Finally
we used the standard kernel interface to obtain information
regarding the memory regions of a specific process.</p>

<h1>GNU Octave - Functions and Scripts</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/odonovan.html">Barry O'Donovan</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

In this, the second article on <a href="http://www.octave.org/">GNU
Octave</a>, I will build on the basics that were covered in
<a href="/109/odonovan.html">issue #109</a> by introducing
functions and scripts through a number of examples. Obtaining and
installing GNU Octave as well as sources for official documentation
is discussed in the first article and you should refer to it for
more information.

<h3>Functions in Octave</h3>

Just like any other programming language, Octave has full support
for creating functions. Functions are an essential tool that allow
large problems to be broken down into a number of smaller tasks. A
function should perform a <strong>specific task</strong> and it
should <strong>perform it well</strong>. These criteria are very
important. The more specific the task that a function performs the
more reusable it will be; although you may be writing it to help
solve your current problem, if it is well defined then it could
also be used in many future problems. By "perform it well", I mean
that the function should give the correct answer for valid input
while reporting an error for invalid input; it should be a
veritable "black-box" - once written and tested it should be of
sufficient quality that you can trust it without having to recheck
it in all future problems.

<p>One extremely simply mathematical function that Octave lacks and
which I required recently was the factorial function. This function
is defined as:</p>

<blockquote>
    <code>n! = n(n-1)...2&middot;1</code>
</blockquote>

So, for example, <code>5! = 5&middot;4&middot;3&middot;2&middot;1 =
120</code>. There are a number of algorithms for implementing this
function and I will cover some of them to give a good introduction
to functions in Octave. Let's begin with an iteration solution:

<pre class="code">
function answer = lg_factorial1( n )

    answer = 1;
    
    for i = 2:n
        answer = answer * i;
    endfor

endfunction
</pre>
Listing 1: <a href=
"misc/odonovan/lg_factorial1.m">lg_factorial1.m</a>

<p>So, a function definition in Octave is:</p>

<pre class="code">
function name
    body
endfunction
</pre>

Functions should be saved on their own in a text file named the
same as the function itself with the extension <code>.m</code>. So
the above file would be saved as <code>lg_factorial1.m</code>. When
you now try and call the function <code>lg_factorial1()</code>,
Octave will search the list of directories specified by the
built-in variable <code>LOADPATH</code> for files ending in &lsquo;.m&rsquo;
that have the same base name as the function name. If you want to
create a repository of functions on your computer and would like to
have <code>LOADPATH</code> include that directory automatically,
you can add the line:<br>
<code>LOADPATH = "/path/to/your/files/:"</code><br>
to the Octave configuration file <code>~/.octaverc</code>. Octave
also checks the path specified in the built-in variable
<code>DEFAULT_LOADPATH</code> which includes the current working
directory by default.

<p>A function can take any number of arguments as a comma separated
list in parentheses after the function name. Multiple return values
can also be defined:</p>

<pre class="code">
function [retval1, retval2, etc] = name( arg1, arg2, etc )
    body
endfunction
</pre>

<p>There are two additional rules in the mathematical definition of
the factorial function:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>0! = 1</code></li>
    <li><code>n &gt;= 0</code></li>
</ul>

Let's incorporate these rules into our function definition:

<pre class="code">
function answer = lg_factorial2( n )

    if( n &lt; 0 )
        error( "there is no definition for negative factorials" );
    endif
    
    answer = 1;
    
    if( n == 0 )
        return;
    else
        for i = 2:n
            answer = answer * i;
        endfor
    endif

endfunction
</pre>
Listing 2: <a href=
"misc/odonovan/lg_factorial2.m">lg_factorial2.m</a>

The function first tests to ensure that the input is valid
(non-negative). If it is not it throws an error using the
<code>error()</code> built-in function. As well as printing the
error message, it also prints a traceback of of all the functions
leading to the error. This is very useful for programmers who are
solving complex problems with many functions as they can narrow
done the offending problem very quickly.

<p>If the input is valid then we test for the zero case and we use
the <code>return</code> command to end the function if it is true.
Unlike many other programming languages, Octave's
<code>return</code> statement does not take any arguments, so it is
essential that the return value(s) are set before a
<code>return</code> call is encountered as I have done with
the <code>answer = 1</code> statementabove.</p>

<p>Now, what happens if <code>lg_factorial2()</code> is called
without any arguments?</p>

<pre class="code">
octave:1&gt; lg_factorial2()
error: `n' undefined near line 3 column 9
error: evaluating binary operator `&lt;' near line 3, column 11
error: if: error evaluating conditional expression
error: evaluating if command near line 3, column 5
error: called from `lg_factorial2' in file `/home/user/lg/lg_factorial2.m'
octave:1&gt;
</pre>

<p>We can also check to ensure that a valid number of arguments
have been passed to the function using the built-in variable
<code>nargin</code>. This variable is automatically initialised to
the number of arguments passed. While we're at it, we should also
try and ensure that a valid data type is passed. Unfortunately,
Octave has no <code>isinteger()</code> function but we can check
that it is a real number and not a vector. If a real non-integer is
passed it will be automatically rounded down by the range operator
(<code>2:n</code>).</p>

<pre class="code">
function answer = lg_factorial3( n )

    if( nargin != 1 )
        usage( "factorial( n )" );
    elseif( !isscalar( n ) ||  !isreal( n ) )
        error( "n must be a positive integer value" );
    elseif( n &lt; 0 )
        error( "there is no definition for negative factorials" );
    endif
    
    if( n == 0 )
        answer = 1;
        return;
    else
        answer = prod( 1:n );
    endif

endfunction
</pre>
Listing 3: <a href=
"misc/odonovan/lg_factorial3.m">lg_factorial3.m</a>
<p>This example introduces the <code>usage()</code> built-in
function. It is very similar to <code>error()</code> in that it
prints a traceback of the functions leading up to the call to help
debugging but instead of printing "error: ...", it prints "usage:
...". The <code>isscalar()</code> and <code>isreal()</code>
functions check that the given argument is a scalar value (as
opposed to a vector, a string, etc) and a real number (as opposed
to a complex number) respectively. The <code>!</code> before them
inverts the test so that it reads as <em>if n is not a scalar or if
n is not a real number then raise an error</em>.</p>

<p>You also have noticed that I have changed the code for
calculating the factorial. I now use the built-in function
<code>prod()</code> which calculates the product of the elements in
a given vector. In this case, the given vector is the range
<code>1:n</code>.</p>

<p>In the previous article, I mentioned that Octave comes with full
documentation which is accessible through the Linux command
<code>info</code>. There is also a built-in <code>help</code>
function for every command. For example:</p>

<pre class="code">
octave:2&gt; help prod
prod is a built-in function

 -- Built-in Function:  prod (X, DIM)
     Product of elements along dimension DIM.  If DIM is omitted, it
     defaults to 1 (column-wise products).
...
octave:3&gt;
</pre>

<p>A "well written" function should allow the use of the help
function in a similar manner. The help text is taken as the first
block of non-copyright (see <a href="#copyright">below</a>)
comments from a function file:</p>

<pre class="code">
## usage: answer = lg_factorial4( n )
##
## Returns the factorial of n (n!). n should be a positive
## integer or 0.

function answer = lg_factorial4( n )

    if( nargin != 1 )
        usage( "factorial( n )" );
    elseif( !isscalar( n ) ||  !isreal( n ) )
        error( "n must be a positive integer value" );
    elseif( n &lt; 0 )
        error( "there is no definition for negative factorials" );
    endif
    
    if( n == 0 )
        answer = 1;
        return;
    else
        answer = prod( 1:n );
    endif

endfunction
</pre>
Listing 4: <a href=
"misc/odonovan/lg_factorial4.m">lg_factorial4.m</a>
<p>And calling the <code>help</code> function will now yield:</p>

<pre class="code">
octave:3&gt; help lg_factorial4
lg_factorial4 is the user-defined function from the file
/home/user/lg/lg_factorial4.m

usage: answer = lg_factorial4( n )

Returns the factorial of n (n!). n should be a positive
integer or 0.

...
octave:4&gt;
</pre>

<p>Another common algorithm for calculating the factorial of a
number is to use a recursive function (a recursive function is one
that calls itself). This can be implemented in Octave (ignoring the
error checking for now) as:</p>

<pre class="code">
function answer = lg_factorial5( n )

    if( n == 0 )
        answer = 1;
        return;
    else
        answer = n * lg_factorial5( n -1 );
    endif

endfunction
</pre>
Listing 5: <a href=
"misc/odonovan/lg_factorial5.m">lg_factorial5.m</a>
<h3>Testing Function Efficiency</h3>

<p>Academic use of Octave often tends to be in the form of large
and time-consuming simulations. As such it is important to know how
to both write quick and efficient code as well as testing the
efficiency of code that you do write.</p>

<p>Let's begin by comparing the three algorithms above for
calculating the factorial of a number. Octave has two functions for
starting and stopping a "wall-clock timer":</p>

<pre class="code">
octave:4&gt; tic(); sleep( 10 ); toc()
ans = 10.0
octave:5&gt;
</pre>

<p>To make the comparison fair, the only checking we will perform
is if <code>n == 0</code>, otherwise we will assume it is a
positive integer. We will use the program in listing 5 above, the
iterative version shown in <a href=
"misc/odonovan/lg_factorial6.m">lg_factorial6.m</a> and the
<code>prod()</code> version shown in <a href=
"misc/odonovan/lg_factorial7.m">lg_factorial7.m</a>. The commands
executed for the comparison and the times found can be seen
here:</p>

<pre class="code">
octave:5&gt; tic(); for i=1:100 for n=1:100 lg_factorial5( n ); end; end; toc()
ans = 23.5154919996858
octave:6&gt; tic(); for i=1:100 for n=1:100 lg_factorial6( n ); end; end; toc()
ans = 3.06905199959874
octave:7&gt; tic(); for i=1:100 for n=1:100 lg_factorial7( n ); end; end; toc()
ans = 0.537685000337660
octave:8&gt;
</pre>

Firstly, the recursive function took the longest by far and this
was to be expected. Just like with most other programming
languages, calling functions (even recursively) requires a lot of
overhead. The result that may surprise you is that the use of the
<code>prod()</code> function is about six times faster than
iteration. This is because, just like Matlab, Octave is quite slow
at looping and it should be avoided wherever possible.

<p>As I have already stated, well written and documented functions
are important, especially if you wish to share your code. Some may
think that the effect of checking for valid input may significantly
slow a function's execution. Let's compare the iteration algorithm
in <a href="misc/odonovan/lg_factorial6.m">lg_factorial6.m</a>
against the same algorithm but with full error checking in <a href=
"misc/odonovan/lg_factorial8.m">lg_factorial8.m</a>:</p>

<pre class="code">
octave:8&gt; tic(); for i=1:100000 lg_factorial6( 10 ); end; toc()
ans = 9.44780500046909
octave:9&gt; tic(); for i=1:100000 lg_factorial8( 10 ); end; toc()
ans = 17.9307480007410
octave:10&gt; 
</pre>

<p>There is clearly a difference but when you consider that each
function is called 100,000 times, the added time for the error
checking is only 0.000085 seconds per function call.</p>

<p>Another important tip to remember when writing Octave functions
is to avoid resizing matrices unnecessarily. The manual itself
states that if you are &ldquo;<em>building a single result matrix
from a series of calculations, set the size of the result matrix
first, then insert values into it.</em>&rdquo; The following is a
graphic illustration at just how slow this can be:</p>

<pre class="code">
octave:10&gt; clear a; tic(); for i=1:100000 a(i) = i; end; toc()
ans = 52.4
octave:11&gt; a = [1]; tic(); for i=2:100000 a = [a i]; end; toc()
ans = 362.247
octave:12&gt; a=zeros(100000,1); tic(); for i=1:100000 a(i) = i; end; toc()
ans = 1.42
octave:13&gt; 
</pre>

<h3>Octave Scripts</h3>

<p>Octave script files are simply a sequence of Octave commands
which are evaluated as if you had typed them at the Octave prompt
yourself. They are useful for setting up simulations where you wish
to vary certain parameters for each run without having to re-type
the commands each time, for sequences of commands that do not
logically belong in a function and for automating certain
tasks.</p>

<p>Octave scripts are placed in a file with the <code>.m</code>
extension in the same way that functions are but a script file
<strong>must not</strong> begin with the <code>function</code>
keyword. Note that variables defined in a script share the same
namespace (or scope) as variables defined at the Octave prompt.</p>

<p>The following is a simple example of an Octave script which
calculates the time taken to create an array of integers of size
specified by the user:</p>

<pre class="code">
# An example Octave script 

len = input( "What size array do you wish to use for the evaluation: " );

clear a; 
tic(); 
for i=1:len
    a(i) = i; 
endfor 
time1 = toc();

a = [1]; 
tic(); 
for i=2:len 
    a = [a i]; 
endfor
time2 = toc();

a=zeros( len, 1 ); 
tic(); 
for i=1:len 
    a(i) = i; 
endfor
time3 = toc();

printf( "The time taken for method 1 was %.4f seconds\n", time1 );
printf( "The time taken for method 2 was %.4f seconds\n", time2 );
printf( "The time taken for method 3 was %.4f seconds\n", time3 );
</pre>
Listing 6: <a href=
"misc/odonovan/lg_calc_time.m">lg_calc_time.m</a>
<p>And once it is saved in an appropriately named file, it can be
executed as follows:</p>

<pre class="code">
octave:13&gt; lg_calc_time
What size array do you wish to use for the evaluation: 20000
The time taken for method 1 was 1.3509 seconds
The time taken for method 2 was 12.8984 seconds
The time taken for method 3 was 0.2850 seconds
octave:14&gt; 
</pre>

<h3>Executable Octave Scripts</h3>

<p>It is also possible to have executable Octave script files like
we have executable Bash scripts. This is an excellent feature of
Octave that can be very useful for large problems where a mixture
of programs, tools or applications may be needed to solve the
problem.</p>

<p>The example in listing 6 above can be easily converted to an
executable Octave program by adding a single line to the
beginning:</p>

<pre class="code">
#! /usr/bin/octave -qf

# An example executable Octave script 

len = input( "What size array do you wish to use for the evaluation: " );
... ... ...              ... ... ...              ... ... ...
printf( "The time taken for method 3 was %.4f seconds\n", time3 );
</pre>
Listing 7: <a href=
"misc/odonovan/lg_calc_time.sh">lg_calc_time.sh</a>
<p>Just make sure that the path to the Octave program is correct
for your system (<code>/usr/bin/octave</code>), make the script
executable and run it as follows:</p>

<pre class="code">
[barry@hiscomputer lg]$ chmod u+x lg_calc_time.sh
[barry@hiscomputer lg]$ ./lg_calc_time.sh
What size array do you wish to use for the evaluation: 20000
The time taken for method 1 was 1.3959 seconds
The time taken for method 2 was 13.0201 seconds
The time taken for method 3 was 0.2800 seconds
[barry@hiscomputer lg]$
</pre>
If you call the script with command line arguments, then they will
be available through the built-in variable <code>argv</code> and
the number of arguments will be contained in the variable
<code>nargin</code> which we have already seen. A simple example of
this can be seen in <a href=
"misc/odonovan/lg_calc_time2.sh">lg_calc_time2.sh</a> which is the
same as the last example except it reads the size of the array from
the command line.

<h3>Final Words</h3>

<p>There are many tricks and techniques for writing efficient
Octave code. Examples include imaginative uses of the
<code>reshape()</code> function for operations between elements of
the same matrix so as to avoid iteration. I would welcome all such
tips to <img src="../gx/authors/email/odonovan.png"> and if I get
enough I will write them up in an article.</p>

<h1>Introduction to Shell Scripting - Part 2</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/okopnik.html">Ben Okopnik</A></b></p>

</p>


<p>
<img src="../gx/reprint.png" alt="A Blast from the Past!"><br>
<strong><em>Originally published in Issue 54 of Linux Gazette, May
2000</em></strong>

<p> Last month, we took a look at some basics of creating a shell script,
as well as a few of the underlying mechanisms that make it all work. This
time around, we'll see how loops and conditional execution let us direct
program flow in scripts, as well as looking at a few good shell-writing
practices.

<h3>Conventions</h3>
The only thing to note in this article are ellipses (...) - I use them
to indicate that the code shown is only a fragment, and not an entire script
all by itself. If it helps, think of each ellipse as one or more lines
of code that is not actually written out.

<h3>Loops and Conditional Execution</h3>
<strong>for; do; done</strong>

<p> Often, scripts are written to automate some repetitive task; as a random
example, if you have to repeatedly edit a series of files in a specific
directory, you might have a script that looks like this:

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash

for n in ~/weekly/*.txt
do
    ae $n
done
echo "Done."
</pre>

or like this:
<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash
for n in ~/weekly/*.txt; do ae $n; done; echo "Done."
</pre>

The code in both does exactly the same thing - but the first version is
much more readable, especially if you're building large scripts with
several levels. As good general practice in writing code, you should indent
each level (the commands inside the loops); it makes troubleshooting and
following your code much easier.

<p> The above control structure is called a 'for' loop - it looks for items
remaining in a list (e.g., 'are there any more files, beyond the ones we
have already read, that fit the "~/weekly/*.txt" template?'). If the test
returns true, it assigns the name of the current item in the list to the
loop variable ("n" in this case) and executes the loop body (the part
between "do" and "done"), then checks again. Whenever the list runs out,
'for' stops looping and passes control to the line following the 'done'
keyword - in our example, the "echo" statement.

<p>  A little trick I'd like to mention here. If you want to make the "for"
loop 'spin' a certain number of times, the shell syntax can be somewhat
tiresome:

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash

for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
do
    echo $i
done
</pre>

What a pain! If you wanted it to iterate, say, 250 times, you'd have to
type all of that out! Fortunately, there's a 'shortcut' - the
'<code>seq</code>' command, which prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to
the given maximum, e.g.,

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash

for i in $(seq 15)
do
    echo $i
done
</pre>

This is functionally the same as the previous script.  '<code>seq</code>'
is part of the GNU "shellutils" package and is probably already installed
on your system. There's also the option of doing this sort of iteration by
using a "while" loop, but it's a bit more tricky.


<p><strong>while; do; done</strong> 

<p>  Often, we need a control mechanism that acts based on a specified condition
rather than iterating through a list. The 'while' loop fills this requirement:

<pre class="code"> 
#!/bin/bash

pppd call provider &amp;

while [ -n "$(ping -c 1 192.168.0.1|grep 100%)" ]
do
    echo "Connecting..."
done

echo "Connection established."
</pre>

The general flow of this script is: we invoke '<code>pppd</code>', the PPP
paenguin... I mean, daemon :), then keep looping until an actual
connection is established (if you want to use this script, replace
192.168.0.1 with your ISPs IP address). Here are the details:

<p>  1) The "<code>ping -c 1 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</code>" command sends a single
ping to the supplied IP address; note that it has to be an IP address and
not a URL - "<code>ping</code>" will fail immediately due to lack of DNS
otherwise.  If there's no response within 10 seconds, it will print
something like


<pre class="code">
PING xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx):
56 data bytes
ping: sendto: Network is unreachable
ping: wrote xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 64 chars,
ret=-1

  --- xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx ping statistics
---
1 packets transmitted, 0 packets received,
100% packet loss
</pre>

<p> 2) The only line we're interested in is the one that gives us the packet
loss percentage; with a single  packet, it can only be 0% (i.e., a
successful ping) or 100%. By piping the output of "ping" through the "grep
100%" command, we narrow it down to that line, if the loss is indeed 100%;
a 0% loss will not produce any output. Note that the "100%" string isn't
anything special: we could have used "ret=-1", "unreachable", or anything
else that's unique to a failure response.

<p> 3) The square brackets that contain the statement are a synonym for the
'test' command, which returns '0' or '1' (true or false) based on the
evaluation of whatever's inside the brackets. The '-n' operator returns
'true' if the length of a given string is greater than 0. Since the string
is assumed to be contiguous (no spaces), and the line we're checking for is
not, we need to surround the output in double quotes - this is a technique
that you will use again and again in script writing. Do note that the
square brackets require spaces around them - i.e., <code>[-n $STRING]</code>
won't work; <code>[ -n $STRING ]</code> is correct. For more info  on the
operators used with 'test', type "help test"; a number of very useful ones
are available.

<p>  4) As long as the above test returns "true" (i.e., as long as the "ping"
fails), the 'while' loop will continue  to execute - by printing the
"Connecting..." string every ten seconds. As soon as a single ping is successful
(i.e., the test returns "false"), the 'while' loop will break and pass
control to the statement after "done".

<p>
<strong>"until; do; done"</strong>

<p>  The 'until' loop is the reverse of the 'while' - it continues to loop
as long as the test is false, and fails when it becomes true. I've rarely
had the occasion to use it; the 'while' loop and the flexibility of the
available tests usually suffice, and this construct is just "syntactic
sugar" for those who prefer to avoid logical inversions.


<p><strong>"if; then; [else]; fi"</strong> 

<p>  There are many times when we need to check for the existence of a
condition and branch the execution based on the result. For those times, we
have the 'if' statement:

<pre class="code"> 
...

if [ $BOSS="jerk" ]
then
    echo 'Take this job and shove it!'
else
    echo 'Stick around; the money is good.'
fi

 ...
</pre>

&lt;grin&gt; I guess it's not quite that easy... but the logic makes sense.
Anyway, if a variable called BOSS has been defined as "jerk" (C programmers
take note: '=' and '==' are equivalent in a test statement - no assignment
occurs), then the first 'echo' statement will be executed. In all other
cases, the second 'echo' statement will run (if $BOSS="idiot", you'll still
be working there. Sorry about that. :). Note that the 'else' statement is
optional, as in this script fragment:

<pre class="code">
...

if [ -n $ERROR ]
then
    echo 'Detected an error; exiting.'
    exit
fi

 ...
</pre>

<p>  This routine will obviously exit if the ERROR variable is anything other
than empty - but it will not affect the program flow otherwise.


<p> <strong>"case; in; esac"</strong> 

<p>  The remaining tool that we can use for conditional branching is basically
a multiple 'if' statement, based on the evaluation of a test. If, for example,
we know that the only possible outputs from an imaginary program called
'intel_cpu_test' are 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64, then we can write the following:

<pre class="code"> 
#!/bin/bash

case $(intel_cpu_test) in
    4) echo "You're running Linux on a calculator??";;
    8) echo "That 8088 is past retirement age...";;
    16) echo "A 286 kinda guy, are you?";;
    32) echo "One of them new-fangled gadgets!";;
    64) echo "Oooh... serious CPU envy!";;
     *) echo "What the heck are you running, anyway?";;
esac
</pre>

<p>  (Before all you folks flood me with mail about running Linux on an
8088... you can't run it on a calculator either. :)

<p>  Obviously, the "*" at the end is a catch-all: if someone at
the Intel Secret Lab runs this on their new CPU (code name "UltraSuperHyperWhizBang"),
we want the script to come back with a controlled response rather than
a failure. Note the double semicolons - they 'close' each of the "pattern/command"
sets and are (for some reason) a common error in "case/esac" constructs.
Pay extra attention to yours!


<p>  <strong>break</strong> and <strong>continue</strong> 

<p>  These statements interrupt the program flow in specific ways. The
"break", once executed, immediately exits the enclosing loop; the
"continue" statement skips the current loop iteration. This is useful in a
number of situations, particularly in long loops where the existence of a
given condition makes all further tests unnecessary. Here's a long (but
hopefully understandable) pseudo-example:

<pre class="code"> 
...

while [ "$hosting_party" = "true" ]
do
    case $FOOD_STATUS
    in
	potato_chips_gone) replace_potato_chips;;
	peanuts_finished) refill_peanut_bowl;;
	pretzels_gone) open_new_pretzel_bag;;
	...
	...
    esac


if [ police_on_scene ]
then
	talk_to_nice_officers
	continue
fi

case $LIQUOR_STATUS
in
	vodka_gone) open_new_vodka_bottle;;
	rum_gone) open_new_rum_bottle;;
	...
	...
esac

case $ANALYZE_GUEST_BEHAVIOR
in
	lampshade_on_head)     echo "He's been drinking";;
	talking_to_plants)     echo "She's been smoking";;
	talking_to_martians)   echo "They're doing LSD";;
	levitating_objects)    echo "Who spiked my lemonade??";;
        ...
        ...
        ...
esac
  
done
  
echo "Dude... what day is it?"
</pre>

<p> A couple of key points: note that in checking the status of various
party supplies, you might be better off writing multiple "if" statements
- both potato chips <b>and</b> pretzels may run out at the same time (i.e.,
they are not mutually exclusive).  The way it is now, the chips have
top priority; if two items do run out simultaneously, it will take two
loops to replace them.

<p>  We can keep checking the food status while trying to convince the cops
that we're actually holding a stamp-collectors' meeting (in fact, maintaining
the doughnut supply is a crucial factor at this point), but we'll skip
right past the liquor status - as it was, we got Joe down off the chandelier
just in time...

<p>  The "continue" statement skips the last part of the "while" loop as
long as the "police_on_scene" function returns 'true'; essentially, the
loop body is truncated at that point. Note that even though it is actually
inside the "if" construct, it affects the loop that surrounds it:
both "continue" and "break" apply only to loops, i.e., "for", "while",
and "until" constructs.

<h3>Back to the Future</h3>

Here is the script we created last month:

<pre class="code"> 
#!/bin/bash
# "bkup" - copies specified files to the user's ~/Backup
# directory after checking for name conflicts.

a=$(date +%T-%d_%m_%Y)
cp -i $1 ~/Backup/$1.$a
</pre>

Interestingly enough, shortly after finishing last month's article, I was
cranking out a bit of C code on a machine that didn't have 'rcs' (the GNU
Revision Control System) installed - and this script came in very handy as
a 'micro-RCS'; I used it to take "snapshots" of the project status.
Simple, generalized scripts of this sort become very useful at odd times...


<h3>Error Checking</h3>

The above is a workable script - for you, or anyone who cares to read and
understand it. Let's face it, though: what we want from a program or a
script is to type the name and have it work, right? That, or tell us
exactly why it didn't work. In this case, though, what we get is a somewhat
cryptic message:

<pre>
cp: missing destination file
Try `cp --help' for more information.
</pre>

For everyone else, and for ourselves down the road when we forget exactly
how to use this tremendously complex script with innumerable options :), we
need to put in error checking - specifically, syntax/usage information.
Let's see how what we've just learned might apply:

<pre class="code"> 
#!/bin/bash

if [ -z $1 ]
then
    echo "'bkup' - copies the specified file to the user's"
    echo "~/Backup directory after checking for name conflicts."
    echo
    echo "Usage: bkup &lt;filename&gt;"
    echo
    exit
fi

<p>  a=$(date +%T-%d_%m_%Y)
cp -i $1 ~/Backup/$1.$a

</pre> 

The '-z' operator of 'test' returns '0' (true) for a zero-length string;
what we're testing for is 'bkup' being run without a filename. The very
beginning is, in my opinion, the best place to put help/usage information
in a script - if you forget what the options are, just run the script without
any, and you'll get an instant 'refresher course' in using it. You don't
even have to put in the original comments, now - note that we've basically
incorporated our earlier comments into the usage info. It's still a good
idea to put in comments at any non-obvious or tricky places in the script
- that brilliant trick you've managed to pull off may cause you to cuss
and scratch your head next year if you don't.

<p>  Before we wrap up playing with this script, let's give it a few more
capabilities. What if you wanted to be able to send different types of
files into different directories? Let's give that a shot, using what we've
learned:

<pre class="code"> 
#!/bin/bash

if [ -z $1 ]
then
    echo "'bkup' - copies the specified file to the user's ~/Backup"
    echo "directory tree after checking for name conflicts."
    echo
    echo "Usage: bkup filename [bkup_dir]"
    echo
    echo "bkup_dir Optional subdirectory in '~/Backup' where the file"
    echo " will be stored."
    echo
    exit
fi

if [ -n $2 ]
then
    if [ -d ~/Backup/$2 ]
    then
	subdir=$2/
    else
	mkdir -p ~/Backup/$2
	subdir=$2/
    fi
fi

a=$(date +%T-%d_%m_%Y)
cp -i $1 ~/Backup/$subdir$1.$a

</pre> 

Here is the summary of changes:

<p>  1) The comment section of the help now reads "...directory tree" rather
than just "directory", indicating the change we've made.

<p>  2) The "Usage:" line has been expanded to show the optional (as shown
by the square brackets)  argument; we've also added an explanation
of how to use that argument, since it might not be obvious to someone else.

<p>  3) An added "if" construct that checks to see if $2 (a second argument
to 'bkup') exists; if so, it checks for a directory with the given name
under "~/Backup", and creates one if it does not exist (the "-d" tests
if the file exists and is a directory).

<p>  4) The 'cp' command now has a 'subdir' variable tucked in between "Backup/"
and "$1".

<p>  Now, you can type things like

<pre>
bkup my_new_program.c c
bkup filter.awk awk
bkup filter.awk filters
bkup Letter_to_Mom.txt docs
</pre>

etc., and sort everything into whatever categories you like. Plus, the
old behavior of "bkup" is still available -

<p>  bkup file.xyz

<p>  will send a backup of "file.xyz" to the "~/Backup" directory itself;
useful for files that fall outside of your sorting criteria.

<p>  By the way: why are we appending a "/" to $2 in the "if" statement instead
of right in the "cp" line? Well, if $2 <i>doesn't</i> exist, then
we want 'bkup' to act as it did originally, i.e., send the file to the
"Backup" directory. If we write something like

<p>  cp -i $1 ~/Backup/$subdir/$1.$a

<p>  (note the extra "/" between $subdir and $1), and $2 isn't specified,
then $subdir becomes blank, and the line above becomes

<p>  cp -i $1 ~/Backup//$1.$a

<p>  - not that it hurts anything, but we want to stick with standard shell
syntactic practice wherever possible (since shell quirks, such as a double
'/' being ignored, are not guaranteed to stick around.)

<p>  In fact, it's a really good idea to consider all the possibilities whenever
you're building variables into a string; a classic mistake of that sort
can be seen in the following script -

<pre class="code"> 
DO NOT USE THIS SCRIPT!

#!/bin/bash
# Written by Larry, Moe, and Shemp - the Deleshun PoWeR TeaM!!!
# Checked by Curly: "Why, soitainly it woiks! Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk!"

# All you've gotta do is enter the name of this file followed by
# whatever you want to delete - directories, dot files, multiple
# files, anything is OK!

rm -rf $1*

DO NOT USE THIS SCRIPT!
</pre>

<p>  Well, at least they commented it. :)

<p>  What happens if somebody does run "three_stooges",
and <i>doesn't enter a parameter</i>? The active line in the script becomes

<p>  rm -rf *

<p>  Assuming that you're Joe User in your home directory, the result is
pretty horrible - it'll wipe out all of your personal files. It becomes
a catastrophe if you're the root user in the root directory - <b>the entire
system goes away</b>!!

<p>  Viruses seem like such friendly, harmless things about now...

<p>  Be careful with your script writing. As you have just seen, you have
the power to destroy your entire system in a blink.

Unix was never designed to keep people from doing stupid things,
because that policy would also keep them from doing clever things.
 -- Doug Gwyn

Unix gives you just enough rope to hang yourself - and then a
couple more feet, just to be sure.
 -- Eric Allman
</pre>

<p>  The philosophy makes sense: unlimited power in the tools, restriction
by permissions - but it imposes a responsibility: you must take appropriate
care. As a corollary, whenever you're logged in as root, do not run any
shell scripts that are not provably harmless (note the Very Large assumptions
hanging off that phrase - "<i>provably harmless</i>"...)


<h3>Wrapping it up</h3>

Loops and conditional execution are a very important part of most scripts.
As we analyze other shell scripts in future articles, you'll see some of
the myriad ways in which they can be used - a script of even average complexity
cannot exist without them.

<p>  Next month, we'll take a look at some tools that are commonly used in
shell scripts - tools that may be very familiar to you as command-line
utilities - and explore how they may be connected together to produce desired
results. We'll also dissect a couple of scripts - mine, if no one else
is brave enough to send in the results of their keyboard concoctions. (Be
Afraid. Be Very Afraid. :)

<p>  I welcome all comments and corrections in regard to this series of articles,
as well as any interesting scripts that you may send in. All flames will
be sent to <code>/dev/null</code> (oh no, it's full...)

<p>  Until next month - <br>
Happy Linuxing!

<h1>Linux: A Clear Winner for Hardware I/O</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/radcliffe.html">P. J. Radcliffe</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> Hardware I/O is important to quite a few people but the traditional
way in which Windows and Linux treat I/O is far from ideal. In this
article we will look at these traditional ways, and show a new
way which makes Linux a clear winner over Windows for hardware I/O.</p>

<p> <b>Who cares</b> about hardware I/O,  where a computer directly
controls hardware?</p>
<ul>
	<li><p> Hobbyists love hardware I/O to control microprocessors,
	motors, robots, their home and more. For example in the February
	2004 Linux Gazette, Pramode C.E. interfaced Linux to a PIC microprocessor
	(see "<a href="../issue99/pramode.html">Let's Build a Cool Linux Toy</a>").</p>
	
	<li><p> Engineering students who do subjects in electronics and
	computing often need to interface their computer to hardware. This
	can make great projects and to be used to test constructed hardware.</p>
	
	<li><p> Industry needs cheap and powerful controllers for
	manufacturing and serious hardware control. In many cases Linux
	works just fine, especially with some of the real time extensions
	that can be added. To read about real time extensions see the GPL
	RTAI at <a href="http://www.aero.polimi.it/~rtai">http://www.aero.polimi.it/~rtai</a>
	or the free RTLinux from FSM Labs at <a href="http://www.fsmlabs.com/">www.fsmlabs.com</a>
	<br>At RMIT University where I work we have a security system based
	on Redhat 6.1 that has been operational for some 8 years. It has
	briefly crashed twice, once due to the log file filling the hard
	disk and once due to a problem with the database engine.</p>
</ul>

<br>

<h2>Problems With DOS, Windows, and Linux</h2>


<p> <b>DOS, Windows 95 and Windows 98</b> did not block I/O access in
any way so command line or GUI programs could happily control I/O.
This made I/O access easy but created both a vulnerability and a
security hole. A misbehaving application could accidentally access
any I/O address and so create havoc with network cards or hard disks.
A malicious application could deliberately access networks or disks,
and possibly wipe the entire hard disk.

<p>Even if these problems are acceptable to you there is worse - none of
these operating systems are supported by Microsoft and most of the newer
applications and development tools do not run on them. Few people want to
run such old systems so anything you create most probably wont be used by
anyone else.</p>


<p> <b>Windows 2000, NT, ME and XP</b> all block I/O access by using
security features build into the x86 microprocessor core. You would think
this meant no I/O access is possible but - yes, there is a hack.  For
example, two programs called <code>giveio.sys</code> and
<code>totalio.sys</code> can be used to bypass I/O security; you can
download <code>giveio.sys</code> to suit Windows XP from <a
href="http://www.physik.rwth-aachen.de/group/IIIphys/CMS/tracker/en/silicon/arcs_nt.html">http://www.physik.rwth-aachen.de/group/IIIphys/CMS/tracker/en/silicon/arcs_nt.html</a>.

<p>Such programs have several problems. Firstly, most of them give I/O
access to every port, or access to a limited range of I/O for every
application. Perhaps more important is the fact that these programs are
hacks, and the very next Microsoft security update may render them useless.
In fact, the existence of these I/O programs represents a security weakness
for Windows so Microsoft should be finding ways to block their action.</p>

<p> <b>Traditional Linux I/O</b> restricts I/O access to the root user, or
to device drivers which run in kernel space. For applications running under
root privilege, the C code function ioperm() can give access a limited
range of I/O ports between 0 and 0x3FF. The C code function iopl() can give
access to all I/O ports (0 to 0xFFFF) and allow the application to turn
interrupts on and off. See the UNIX info pages on both these functions for
more details.

<p> On close inspection none of these methods are really acceptable. It is
very foolish to work as root during software development as a simple
mistake can delete key parts of the operating system and so make your
system crash and burn. Running an application with root privileges opens up
all the vulnerability and security problems found with DOS and Windows 98.
Writing kernel drivers is no better as they have the same security
weaknesses and are significantly more difficult to write and debug compared
to normal applications.</p>

<p> On the face of it, it seems as if Linux is little better than Windows
for hardware I/O. It has the same weaknesses but at least I/O access will
not disappear with the next security update.</p>

<h2>The Linux Solution</h2>

<p> Linux allows significant manipulation of the permissions and
ownership of running software processes. It is possible to link
together several well defined Linux features to create a bullet-proof
method that will allow a user-level program to have I/O access to a
limited range of I/O, typically just a parallel printer port or serial
port. This means no security weaknesses and very easy programming of
hardware I/O.</p>


<p> <b>The tricks</b> used to make this happen are as follows -</p>
<ul>
	<li>A trusted I/O enabling program is created with the ownership
	set to root and the UID bit set. The UID bit means that even if a
	normal user starts the I/O enabling program then it runs with root
	privileges. This can be set up from the command line:
<pre>
   su - root                 # become root, give password when requested.
   chown root IO_enabler     # make root the owner of the enabling program.
   chmod u+s IO_enabler      # set the SUID bit.
</pre>
	
	<li><p> The I/O enabling program is run and first enables I/O access
	but only to the desired ports - typically all parallel printer ports
	and the serial ports. This is done using the C function ioperm().</p>
	<li><p> Optionally the process priority can be set using the C function
	setpriority(). A higher priority will ensure the application about to be
	started experiences fewer delays as other process run at a lower priority.</p> 
	<li><p> The I/O enabling
	program then drops down to the privileges of the real user who
	started it using the C functions setgid() and setuid(). These
	functions do not effect the I/O access permissions or process
	priority.</p>
	<li><p> The I/O enabling program then loads the application program
	over its own code space by using the C function execvp(). This means
	the application program is now running with user (not root)
	privileges, and with I/O access limited to only those I/O ports
	enabled by the trusted I/O enabling program. 
	</p>
</ul>

<p> <b>Running an application</b> becomes quite simple -</p>
<pre>
   ./IO_enabler ./application_program  parameter_1  parameter_2 ...... 
</pre>
<p> <b>The code</b> behind the I/O enabling program is surprisingly
short -</p>
<pre>
   /*--- optionally set process priority, 0= normal, -20 highest, +20 lowest.*/
     setpriority( PRIO_PROCESS, -10, 0) ;

   /*--- get access to the ports.*/ 
     if (ioperm(0x378, 3, 1)) 
       perror(&quot;Failed ioperm lp0 on&quot;) ;
       
   /*---  remove root privileges.*/     
     setgid( getgid() ) ;
     setuid( getuid() ) ; 

   /*--- overwrite code space with the application program, 
         send arguments to the application program.*/
     execvp(argv[1], &amp;argv[1]) ;

   /*--- if get here exec must have failed.*/ 
     perror(&quot; execv failed&quot;) ;
</pre>
  
<p class="editorial">[ <strong>Note</strong>: in general, creating SUID
programs without understanding all the security implications of doing so
can be very dangerous. <strong>Do</strong> try this at home... but read
much and consider deeply before you do. -- Ben ]</p>

<h2>Useful Code Examples</h2>

<p> Here are a few real bits of code to get started. Unless otherwise
stated, compile a program ( lets call it 'x') as follows -</p>
<pre>
   gcc  -o  x  x.c
</pre>

<p> <a href="misc/radcliffe/lp_tty_start.c.txt">lp_tty_start.c</a>: this I/O enabler
allows access to the standard three printer ports and four serial
ports but nothing else. Ensure it is owned by root with the UID bit
set as described earlier in this article.</p>

<p> <a href="misc/radcliffe/port_write_then_read.c.txt">port_write_then_read.c</a>: this
will write a single byte to an I/O port and read back the new value of
the I/O port. It is probably best to use /dev/lp0 data port (888) to test
this program. To ensure that your /dev/lp0 is active, reboot your machine
and go into the BIOS setup. Ensure the parallel port is in either
"compatible", "SPP", or "bidirectional" mode. Remember to save your BIOS
settings on exiting the setup screens. Start the program as follows to
write 85 (55 hex or 01010101 binary) to the /dev/lp0 data port which will
come out on pins 2 to 9 -</p>
<pre>
   ./lp_tty_start  ./port_read_then_write  888  85
</pre>
<p>
<a href="misc/radcliffe/iopl_start.c.txt">iopl_start.c</a> is another I/O enabler based
around the iopl() function. This gives access to all I/O ports (0 to
0xFFFF) and has the ability to enable and disable interrupts. Like
lp_tty_start it must be owned by root and have the SUID bit set.</p>

<p> <a href="misc/radcliffe/blockio.c.txt">blockio.c</a> must be started
with iopl_start.  It will turn off interrupts and hang your machine for
about 8 seconds, as well as causing pin D0 of /dev/lp0 to output a 500 kHz
squarewave. After 8 seconds the program will terminate normally and your
machine will resume its usual operations.

<p> Start this as follows -</p>
<pre>
   ./iopl_start ./blockio
</pre>

<p> <a href="misc/radcliffe/hide_lp_tty_start.txt">hide_lp_tty_start</a> is a 
script file that shows how to hide the fact that your program was started using
 lp_tty_start.  Unfortunately programs started thus way must take a fixed
 set of parameters.  The application is simply a read of the data port of
 lp0 using 
<a href="misc/radcliffe/port_read.c.txt">port_read.c</a>. 
Start it as follows -</p>
<pre>
   ./hide_lp_tty_start
</pre>

<p> <b>What ports have you got?</b> The code below implements a
program that will check which serial and parallel ports are active
and available on your machine. To make the program easy to run, the code is
designed to be executed as root (not really a security issue, as you
have the source and can see the code is benign).</p>

<p> <a href="misc/radcliffe/main.c.txt">main.c</a> shows the basic flow
of the code, and the instructions for use. 
</p>

<p> <a href="misc/radcliffe/pp_access.h.txt">pp_access.h</a> and
<a href="misc/radcliffe/pp_access.c.txt">pp_access.c</a> form a neatly
packaged parallel port access module that can save and restore the
parallel port state, and help manipulate the bits in the port. You
may want to reuse this module in your own applications. 
</p>

<p> <a href="misc/radcliffe/serial_access.h.txt">serial_access.h</a> and
<a href="misc/radcliffe/serial_access.c.txt">serial_access.c</a> provide
a similar functionality for the serial port. 
</p>

<p> <a
href="misc/radcliffe/make_pp_serial_check.txt">make_pp_serial_check</a> is
a script file that compiles the code above to make an executable.  Compile
the code using make_pp_serial_check and execute the program
(./pp_serial_check) as root with no parameters to see the instructions. The
program can identify whether ports exist and perform a simple loopback test
as further verification that the port works. </p>

<br>

<h2>Some Dangers, and Help Needed!</h2>

<p> <b>Remaining dangers</b>: the software dangers of using I/O have been
largely eliminated by using the I/O enabling programs shown in this article
but one danger does remain - if you fail to design the hardware circuitry
properly, or mis-wire it, then you can blow up your precious parallel
port (serial ports carry only signals, and are therefore much harder to
damage.) Fortunately, there are a few simple warnings and a few simple
circuits that can protect your ports. If there is enough response to this
article then perhaps we can follow up with an article on safe hardware
interfacing.</p>

<p> <b>Where to now?</b> This article has shown how user-level
programs can safely access I/O in a very simple manner. Linux should
now be the operating system of choice for all hardware I/O. It should
be the operating system of choice for engineering students, computer
science students, hobbyists and industry that uses hardware I/O. 
</p>

<p> Linux can access not only the standard ports such as the printer port;
it can also connect to many of the plug-in cards that provide more
sophisticated functions, such as relay cards and high speed analogue I/O.
</p>

<p> What is needed is a wider range of I/O projects visible on the web
so students, hobbyists, and practicing engineers have a head start
when they create projects. New projects are needed and a lot of those
old DOS projects need to be updated and ported to Linux. Can you be
part of the Open Source community and help?

<h1>Lexical Closures In C</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/ramankutty.html">Hiran Ramankutty</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

Even if one is an experienced C programmer, a successful compilation of
your program in the first attempt certainly brings a sense of satisfaction
- whatever the logic behind it may be. "Hey, look! The GNU C Compiler has
accepted my program!" Take a look at the two code samples given below;
these are the two most common methods used by programmers to start coding a
program.

<pre class="code">
/* Sample 1. */
main()
{
}
</pre>

<p>

<pre class="code">
/* Sample 2. */
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
	return 0;
}
</pre>

<p> What is important while writing code is not the caution but the
approach - but at times, it is good to be skeptical about your C programs
to some extent. Not necessarily the logic, but the compiler you are using.

<p> The GNU C compiler provides several options for compiling a piece of
code; the more options you know, the more useful (<em>and</em> the more
confusing) it can be. I have aliased the GCC front-end <i>cc</i> like this:

<pre>
alias cc='gcc -Wall --pedantic-errors -Wstrict-prototypes'
</pre>

<p> The option <i>--pedantic-errors</i> helps me make my C programs adhere
to strict ANSI standards. GCC provides several extensions to the C
language, which are often either unnoticed or taken for granted due to
people's assumptions.  Here, I am going to give a brief description on one
such extension - <em>nesting of functions</em>.

<h3>Nesting of Functions and Closures</h3>
<p>
In the article <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/109/pramode.html">
Functional Programming with Python</a>, a function or a procedure is said to 
have some analogy to mathematical functions. If 'x' is a variable, then we have a 
function <i>f(x)</i> which does some operations on 'x' to give some value 'y'. Hence
we have:

<pre>
y = f(x)
</pre>

<p> The article also briefly describes <i>closures</i>. A <b>closure</b> is
a property associated with functions; when a function manipulates input and
produces output which holds the features and characteristics of the input,
then the function is said to possess (we should say 'satisfy' instead of
'possess') the <i>closure</i> property.

<p class="editorial">[ The above definition is, perhaps, less rigorous than
it could be; the standard definition of 'closure' in programming is a data
structure that contains both a function and a set of variables defining the
environment in which that function will be executed. -- Ben ]

<p> For example: consider the set of natural numbers 'N'. If x<sub>1</sub>
and x<sub>2</sub> are elements in the set N, and the function <i>f(x)</i>
is an addition (by binary operator `+') of x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub>
then addition has the closure property. Since sum of x<sub>1</sub> and
x<sub>2</sub> is again a natural number, we can say that the binary
operator '+' satisfies the closure property over the set of natural
numbers.

<p> Programming languages like Python and LISP support nesting of
functions. The above mentioned article explains with an example in Python.
An example for LISP is given below:

<pre class="code">
(defun foo (a) (defun bar (b) (+ b 1)) (+ a (bar 3)))

(setq a (foo 4))
(print a)
</pre>

<p> The function `bar' is nested and defined inside the definition of
`foo'. `bar' increments and returns the parameter that it takes, and `foo'
returns the sum of the return value of `bar' invoked with parameter 3
and the parameter that <em>it</em> takes. The variable `a' then is set to:

<pre>
3 + 1 + 4 = 8
</pre>

Hence, `a's value is printed as 8.

<p> This feature of function nesting is seen in the C language, as an
extension of GCC. Compiling the code below, with the <i>--pedantic-errors</i>
option enabled, will tell you that `ISO C forbids nested functions' - but
the code will compile cleanly without the option. Check out the code:

<pre class="code">
/* compile it with gcc --pedantic-errors <i>filename.c</i>*/
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
int main()
{
	void foo()
	{
		printf("Hello World\n");
	}
	foo();
	return 0;
}
</pre>

Like local variables, nesting of functions will restrict the scope of the
function in which it is defined. For the above example, the binding of
function <b>foo</b> is not visible outside <b>main</b>.  The association
between identifiers and the place to store their values is called binding,
and scope refers to the part of the code where the binding of the
identifier is visible.

<p> Consider another example given below:

<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
int main()
{
	int x;
	x = 10;
	{
		float x;
		x = 4.2
	}
	return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
In the above example, `x' has two bindings with respect to main. But if we remove the 
declaration <i>float x;</i>, then the binding will be same throughout. 


<h3>Scope</h3>

<p> Consider a binary search algorithm performed over a list of sorted
numbers. The code can be seen here, in <a
href="misc/ramankutty/listing1.c.txt">listing 1</a>.

<p> We can localize the array 'A' and the function 'binary_search' to
'main' if we don't have any other functions that need to access
'binary_search'; an example of this can be seen here, in 
<a href="misc/ramankutty/listing2.c.txt">listing2</a>.

<p> Now both 'A' and 'binary_search' are within the lexical scope of
'main'; hence, they are enclosed in the same scope. Let us define lexical
scoping a bit more: <em>Lexical Scope is the scope defined by the structure
of the code</em>.

<p> A language with lexical scoping can support function definitions within
another function. With this, the nested function gets access to the local
variables defined in the enclosing scope, and is itself visible during the
definition of the function being nested. That is:

<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main()
{
	int x=10;
	void foo()
	{
		printf("hello\n");
	}
	int y=20;
	void bar()
	{
		printf("World\n");
	}
}
</pre>

Here, only the binding of 'x' is visible to 'foo', whereas 'bar' can "see"
the binding of 'x', 'foo', and 'y'.  We can now say that the textual
arrangement determines the lexical scope. Now, what if function 'foo' wants
to access function 'bar'? One of the options here would be to declare the
prototype of 'bar' before the definition of 'foo'. See the listing below:

<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main()
{
	int x=10;
	auto void bar(void);
	void foo()
	{
		printf("Hello\n");
		bar();
	}
	int y=20;
	void bar()
	{
		printf("World\n");
	}
	foo();
	return 0;
}
</pre>

<p> Thomas M. Bruel's paper on lexical closures in C++ describes this as a
method to allow definition of mutually recursive functions at inner lexical
levels. Removing the 'auto' keyword will give a warning message. Try it!
(Refer to Section A.8.1 in <i>Storage Class Specifiers</i> by Kernighan
&amp; Ritchie for clarification and details.)

<p> The other type of scoping is <em>dynamic scoping</em>, in which the
active call stack handles name resolution during run time. To make it
more clear, see <a href="misc/ramankutty/listing3.c.txt">listing3</a>.

<p> 'x' in function 'foo' is a non-local reference, but it is local to
function 'bar'. The print statement in function 'main' is also a non-local
reference. If C was a dynamically scoped language (thank god that it
isn't), then reference to 'x' in function 'foo' would be bound to its
definition in the function 'bar'. However, C is a lexically scoped
language, and thus reference to 'x' in function 'foo' is bound to its
global definition. If we run this program, the output will be '1', not '0'.

<p> Now consider the following (<a
href="misc/ramankutty/listing4.c.txt">listing4</a>): we have the definition
of function 'add' within the scope of 'init_add'.  It is interesting to
note that 'add' refers to the parameter 'i', which is passed to the
function 'init_add'. For the function 'init_add', the binding of 'i' is
retained (even inside the function 'add') until 'init_add' returns. Now,
from the mathematical definition of 'closure', the function 'add' is said
to "close over" the parameter 'i'; therefore, 'add' satisfies the closure
property over 'i', and this is termed a <b>lexical closure</b>, in which
the lexical scoping is preserved (the reference for 'i' is not overridden
by any other local definition of 'i' - not that there are any).

<p> It should be clear by now that lexical scoping provides several
advantages. Functions can be made reentrant and hence the compiled machine
code will be reentrant. Local declarations can be stored in registers (in
an optimized way) which eliminates the symbol references upon compilation
(an optimization performed by the compiler.) We are no longer restricted to
declaring all variables global (a very bad practice leading to problems
like <em>variable suicide</em> among others) and passing parameters to
every function that is invoked. 


<h3>Why is there no nesting in ANSI, then?</h3>

I had mentioned earlier that nesting of functions is only seen in C as an
extension of GCC. While it is an advantage to some extent, we cannot
guarantee safe access to variables or functions within the lexical scope
just because the closure property has been satisfied. We must not forget
that even when the closure property is retained, in certain cases there
will be no reference to a variable within the current activation record in
the stack.

<h3>Conclusion and Further Reading</h3>

We have seen what the nesting of functions means and can do to some extent,
given the lexical scoping rules of C. If you are interested in further
reading, you should go through <a
href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">Structure And Interpretation of
Computer Programs</a> and the Wiki entry on <a
href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LexicalClosure">Lexical Closure</a>. For the
article that inspired me, and which gives more details on the
implementation part, see <a

<h3>Logorrhea</h3>

<p>Snow is falling outside my window as I write this, so it's still
officially winter. But this month we'll leverage off our winter sports
company logo to discuss the basics of logos and logotypes.

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="misc/seymour/AlpineGearColor.jpg"
alt="Alpine Gear logo" border="0">

<p>The AlpineGear logo, just to be confusing, is actually a logotype, or a
logo constructed solely from letters or words. We could refer to logotypes
as a subgroup of logos, but there isn't a different word for a logo that's
just an image rather than text, so this system is illogical:

<dl><dt>Logo:<dd>Logo<br>Logotype</dl>

<p>If someone knows of a word that would be more representative than the
"logo:logo" construct, or can make up a good one, let me know.

<p>As I noted in the January column, a pure logo (that
darned<em>logo:logo</em> naming problem again) is an icon, a picture, a
'bug' that communicates the image (and hopefully, if only subconsciously,
the name) of the company without additional words. Companies that sell
products (something that needs to be recognizable at a distance, whether on
a building or a shelf) often use logos, and for companies where instant
recognition (from a freeway at high speed, for example) is important, this
is a defining quality of the mark.

<p>Here are some well-known examples (well, to Linux users, anyway):

<p>
<img src="misc/seymour/AppleAqua.jpg" border="0">
<img src="misc/seymour/Linux.jpg" alt="" border="0">
<img src="misc/seymour/Olympics.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="100" width="185">
<img src="misc/seymour/Shell.jpg" alt="" border="0">

<p>Note that the first and last images are capable of communicating the
name of the company (at least to English-speakers, though even in other
languages they'll know what it refers to) to someone who has never seen the
logo before, or may never have heard of the company before. Now
<b>that's</b> good design!

<p>An entire study could probably be done just on logos using various ring images:

<p>
<img src="misc/seymour/Audi.jpg" alt="" border="0">
<img src="misc/seymour/Mercedes.jpg" alt="" border="0">
<img src="misc/seymour/Olympics.jpg" alt="" border="0">

<p>Isn't the mind amazing? There's not a name in sight, and yet you
<b>know</b> who these represent, don't you?

<p>Here are some familiar logos that incorporate letters or words into a
logo-shaped image and, while very recognizable (even at a distance), are
neither pure logos or pure logotypes (by my definition, anyway):

<p> <img src="misc/seymour/BMW.jpg" alt="" width="75" height="75"
border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/CNN.jpg" alt="" height="75" width="155"
border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/IBM.jpg" alt="" height="75" width="173"
border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/LG.jpg" alt="" height="75" width="75"
border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/Virgin.png" alt="" height="75"
width="75" border="0">

<p>Without prior knowledge, of course, you couldn't determine from these
designs that BMW stands for Bayerische Motoren Werke (or that the logo is
derived from a spinning propeller, since BMW really started out as
Bayerische Flugzeug-Werke, making aircraft engines during World War One),
or that CNN stands for Cable News Network, or that IBM stands for
International Business Machines, or especially that LG doesn't stand for
anything (though it's apparently derived from their product lines, two of
which are 'Lucky' and 'Goldstar', and represents the 'Face of the Future').
Virgin, of course, is into so many business segments now (including space
travel) that almost any other logo would be too limiting.

<p>Oftentimes, to provide otherwise obscure name information, the company
will settle on a combination logo/logotype:

<p><img src="misc/seymour/Ford.jpg" alt="" height="75" width="181"
border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/GSK.jpg" alt="" height="75" width="204"
border="0">

<p>But fewer and fewer people know that Henry Ford perfected the assembly
line and made cars cheap enough for the working man to own. (Among car
company names, even fewer people remember the racing career of R.E. Olds,
founder of the Oldsmobile company, let alone the line of trucks by his REO
company.) GSK reportedly paid a million dollars for the 'guitar pick' logo
and then had to settle a suit with the pork producers (not that I'm
implying <b>any</b> similarity, of course, in shape, type style, bleed, or
other graphical aspects):

<p><img src="misc/seymour/Pork.jpg" alt="" height="75" width="92"
border="0">

<p>A logotype is the company name used in a particular typography that,
hopefully, also communicates the image of the company. Here are some recent
examples from the Internet (the Mapquest and Yahoo! logotypes even come
complete with their own punctuation, though I'm never sure if that Mapquest
logo is excited or just sweating):

<p><img src="misc/seymour/AltaVista.jpg" alt="" height="77" width="199"
border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/eBay.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="70"
border="0"><img src="misc/seymour/Google.jpg" alt="" width="276"
height="110" align="top" border="0"> 

<p><img src="misc/seymour/Mapquest.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="51"
border="0"><img src="misc/seymour/Yahoo.jpg" alt="" width="232" height="44"
border="0">

<p>And, just to be fair (<i>as if</i>; see caveat below), the Gates Empire
logotype and logo/logotype:

<p><img src="misc/seymour/Microsoft.jpg" alt="" height="75" width="245"
border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/Windows.jpg" alt="" height="75"
width="74" border="0">

<p>Here are some more, from various points on the economic compass. These
are designed to work well at different sizes, which is important when
you're using it on everything from signage to small objects or packaging:

<p><img src="misc/seymour/Ace.jpg" alt="" width="144" height="75"
border="0"><img src="misc/seymour/Craftsman.jpg" alt="" height="75"
width="333" border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/WellsFargo.jpg" alt=""
height="75" width="75" border="0">

<p>The true classic among logotypes, of course, is this one:

<p><img src="misc/seymour/CocaCola.jpg" alt="" height="75" width="217"
border="0">

<p>Along with the trademarked shape of the original glass bottle, it is the
most widely recognized brand symbol in the world. (If a designer were to
emulate it today, including its illegal drug reference and obscure
agricultural product reference and archaic script design, he'd likely be
fired by the client.)

<p>But, even with the best of intentions, sometimes you never know how your
logo is going to end up being used:

<p><img src="misc/seymour/HomeDepot.jpg" alt="" height="75" width="75"
border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/HomeDepotApron.jpg" alt="" height="75"
width="67" border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/HomeDepotRacing.jpg" alt=""
height="75" width="100" border="0">

<p>Companies often can't make up their minds whether they want a logo or a
logotype, and so they end up with a mark that's both (and often doesn't
work well as either):

<p><img src="misc/seymour/BofA.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="230"
border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/Citizens.jpg" alt="" height="50"
width="180" border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/Fandango.jpg" alt=""
width="123" height="50" border="0">  <img src="misc/seymour/Southwest.jpg"
alt="" height="50" width="147" border="0">
<div align="left">

<p>Most of these, like many current logos and logotypes, violate my old
typography instructor's adage about not using all-caps: it's not nearly as
readable, especially in small sizes, as upper and lower case. (Though the
Fandango and Citizens logos try to cheat by using a big leading cap with
the small caps; the late Professor Arnold Bank, bless him, would give them
all a bad grade.)

<p>These four examples show why you should make a choice early on, and get
the client to agree. Remember, as we showed above, the best logos stand on
their own without any text, and the best logotypes don't have any imagery
attached. As Chuco might have said in a graphic designer's cut of <i>The
Good, The Bad, and the Ugly</i>: &quot;If you're going to logo, logo. If
you're going to logotype, logotype&quot;. My sentiments exactly.
<div align="left">

<p>[Caveat for the following: I worked for Apple/Claris for a dozen years,
and still do my own work on a Macintosh. I was even involved for awhile at
Regis McKenna Advertising when Apple barely existed, during the time the
striped logo was born. It took weeks, and many thousands of dollars in
color separations, to determine the exact percentages of four-color-process
used in the now-almost-forgotten rainbow stripes. (And, no, the stripes had
nothing to do with the gay pride movement when they started or when they
ended.) For those interested in the history of these changes, see the <a
href="http://www.kelleyad.com/histry.htm">Kelley Ad site</a> for some of
the earliest work on the Apple logo, along with this list of sites of <a
href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/7588/">Apple
history</a>.]
</div>
</div>

<p>Note that companies like Apple may use a logo in one situation on a
product and a logotype in another situation, but not usually both in
combination; this avoids excessive and sometimes difficult trademarking
requirements (remember to multiply your trademark registration by about 50
for worldwide coverage; see these lists of trademarks from both <a
href="http://www.apple.com/legal/trademark/appletmlist.html">Apple</a> and
<a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/library/toolbar/3.0/trademarks/en-us.mspx">Microsoft</a>
for how many logotypes may need to be designed and trademarked for a large
client):

<p><img src="misc/seymour/MacMini.jpg" alt="" height="100" width="100"
border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/iMac.jpg" alt="" height="100"
width="104" border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/iWork.jpg" alt=""
height="100" width="80" border="0">

<p>Logos or logotypes may change, due to graphic style changes or market
pressures, during the company's lifetime. The Apple logo is a classic
example:

<p> <img src="misc/seymour/AppleFirst.jpg" alt="" height="100" width="69"
border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/AppleII.jpg" alt="" height="100"
width="246" border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/AppleSerif.jpg" alt=""
height="100" width="240" border="0">

<p>Even when they decided to kill the text portion of the logo and just
concentrate on the fruit, it was redesigned (or at least recolored) many
times over the years:

<p><img src="misc/seymour/AppleStripe.jpg" alt="" height="100" width="84"
border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/AppleRed.jpg" alt="" height="100"
width="84" border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/AppleBlack.jpg" alt=""
height="100" width="84" border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/AppleWhite.jpg"
alt="" height="100" width="84" border="0"><img
src="misc/seymour/AppleAqua.jpg" alt="" height="100" width="100"
border="0">

<p>Sometimes more than one variant existed at the same time, for differing
uses; the solid red and solid black logos were used alongside each other
for many years, and the white logo appeared at first only on brown
cardboard product boxes. The Aqua logo, of course, ushered in the OS X era,
and engendered an entire new graphic gestalt now used for products and
services totally unrelated to the Macintosh, or even computers.

<p>Other than a trip down memory lane for those Apple fanatics among us (so
sue me; this column is free), what have we learned from this review of
corporate marks about designing logos and/or logotypes?

<p>First off, decide what's important. Is the name of the company (Fred's
Shoes) the most vital information, or is it having brand recognition (Nike)
no matter where the mark appears? If it's the name, consider a logotype. If
it's a universal mark, consider a logo.

<p>Weigh the need to have both a 'bug' and the company name as part of the
design. My own work is often done under the trademark 'Proofmark' for
design jobs or <a href="http://www.proofmark.com">Proofmark Publishing</a>,
and I use a mythological beast as my icon:

<p><img src="misc/seymour/Gryphon.png" alt="" width="100" height="100" border="0">

<p>While my gryphon often sits alongside or atop the Proofmark logotype, it
is not a required part of it. The two pieces can coexist, with different
positioning or scaling as appropriate, or appear separately; this gives my
own corporate identity more flexibility. If, for instance, I was producing
a piece for or sending an invoice to some country or organization that
disliked mythological beasts (and don't think they don't exist), I could
leave it off without having to totally rework all my pieces.

<p>This points out the need to review the scope of the use of the logo. Is
it for Fred's Shoes, and won't be seen outside the circulation of the local
newspaper or the range of the local television station? (You <i>did</i>
think about how it was going to be used in video images, didn't you? Or in
PowerPoint presentations?) Or is it for some multinational corporation
whose products are sold in 172 countries? If it's global, you need to worry
about your logo symbology and how it will be perceived in those markets;
dogs aren't perceived well in certain countries, and other images can
appear either too sacred, like crosses, or too profane, like body parts, in
some cultures. If you're using a name or word, does it translate into
something counterproductive (the famed 'Nova' car from Chevrolet; meaning
'no go', it didn't sell in Latin America for some reason) or downright
obscene in another language?

<p>How many countries your mark will be used in drives how many trademark
applications you'll have to make. (See <a
href="http://www.inta.org/">http://www.inta.org/</a> for help with this.)
Remember, however, that you should protect your marks even in countries
where, for the moment, you're not selling or even planning to sell;
graymarket (quasi-legal) or blackmarket sales can be used to defeat your
trademark in those and other countries. Real words (screwdriver or feather)
are going to be harder to trademark; this is why there's an entire industry
built around naming products with nonsensical or semi-recognizable names.

<p>Then there's scalability and legibility.

<p>Scalability means you can use the mark really big or really small, and
have it be recognizable at either extreme:

<p><img src="misc/seymour/AppleBlack.jpg" alt="" height="100" width="84"
border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/AppleBlack.jpg" alt="" height="10"
width="8" border="0">

<p>Don't think you'll ever need it really big? What about when the client
wants it to fill the entire back wall of her store? Or a street-level
billboard? Don't think you'll ever need it really small? Take out your
designer sunglasses and look at the logo or logotype on the inside of the
temples. <b>That's</b> small.

<p>Legibility means the mark is readable against a wide range of
backgrounds; using different color ways can seriously improve legibility,
especially in smaller sizes:

<p>
<img src="misc/seymour/AppleBlack.jpg" alt="" height="50" width="42" border="0">
<img src="misc/seymour/AppleBlack.jpg" alt="" height="50" width="42" border="0">
<img src="misc/seymour/AppleBlack.jpg" alt="" height="50" width="42" border="0">
<img src="misc/seymour/AppleWhite.jpg" alt="" height="50" width="42" border="0">
<img src="misc/seymour/AppleRed.jpg" alt="" height="50" width="42" border="0">
<img src="misc/seymour/AppleRed.jpg" alt="" height="50" width="42" border="0">
<img src="misc/seymour/AppleRed.jpg" alt="" height="50" width="42" border="0">
<img src="misc/seymour/AppleAqua.jpg" alt="" height="50" width="50" border="0">

<p>But there are cases where you, as the designer, will just have to stamp
your pretty little boot-shod foot and insist that, in order for your
precious logo design to work, all underlying screen images, corporate
identity paper, bus stop transparencies, box cardboard, and email
backgrounds will have to represent the color PMS 666. (Just kidding; a cool
designer would specify a Toyo color, right?) 

<p>Insisting that a mark must sit on a specified color has its own
limitations, of course; paper doesn't always come in the right color for a
particular usage (laser printers, box board), and you can't afford to print
four-color-process on every job. It also binds your hands when you're
designing for the Web, as photos and small text don't show well on a
colored background.

<p>Mostly, you should start the design with white as a background; paper
always comes that way, and most electronic media display white as a
default. However, there are going to be times where, for cost or marketing
or political reasons (printing on recycled paper, for instance), you will
have to use your mark on a background that's a color. This is where a
universal mark (if there is such a thing; I can think of situations, like
metallic labels, where almost no color other than black works well) or a
predetermined range of 'legal' logo colors comes in handy.

<p>Font usage has become more critical, as well, since so much corporate
information is now being presented via the Web. Using cross-platform and
cross-browser fonts can reduce how much data needs to be generated as
images and how much can relied on to be in the viewer's font list. (This
column, for instance, is set to display in the generic fonts on your
machine.) Anything that is spec'd for a particular font runs the risk (or
near-certainty) of 'blowing up' on a viewer's computer. Any piece that must
be imported as a graphic image slows down web file transfer, and runs the
risk of printing incorrectly.

<p>Let's analyze our own logo against these criteria:

<p><img src="misc/seymour/AlpineGearColor.jpg" alt="Alpine Gear logo" border="0">

<p>It's a logotype, pure and simple. It will have to be provided
electronically as a PNG or similar format, as few computers will have the
fonts in residence, but it prints well, both in commercial and desktop
forms.

<p>It scales well: <img src="misc/seymour/AlpineGearColor.jpg" alt="Alpine Gear logo" height="12" width="58" align="absmiddle" border="0"> but does better small, as do most logos, in one color: <img src="misc/seymour/AlpineGear.png" alt="" height="12" width="58" align="absmiddle" border="0">

<p>We've provided it in several colorways, for good legibility in different media:
<table width="150" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="0">
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#999999"><img src="misc/seymour/AlpineGearWhite.png" alt="" height="30" width="145" border="0"></td>
<td><img src="misc/seymour/AlpineGearOnBlue.jpg" alt="" height="30" width="145" border="0"></td>
<td><img src="misc/seymour/AlpineGearColor.jpg" alt="" height="30" width="145" border="0"></td>
<td><img src="misc/seymour/AlpineGear.png" alt="" height="30" width="145" border="0"></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>It totally fails as a recognizable mark outside  English-speaking
countries, unless it garners enough familiarity (think Adidas, Nike, Kodak,
Apple, even Microsoft) for that not to matter. Of course, that may be
enough marketplace for even a large company, and people using the Internet
in other countries are used to dealing with English-only websites. (Note,
however, that we provided access on the Landing Page in the February column
to translated pages for  customers in major non-English-speaking markets.)

<p>I hope this has helped you analyze your own logo projects. As ever, let
me know if there's a particular aspect of design you'd like covered.

<h1>How to Set Up a Jabber Server</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/tomar.html">Suramya Tomar</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<h3>1.0 Introduction:</h3>

<p>Unless you have been living under a rock for the past few years, you
must have heard about instant messaging and how it has changed the world of
communications over the Internet. According to <a
href='http://www.webopedia.com'>http://www.webopedia.com</a>, Instant
Messaging (IM) is a service that alerts users when their friends or
colleagues are on line and allows them to communicate in real time through
private online chat areas. Two of the most popular IM services are <a
href='http://www.aim.com'>AOL Instant Messenger</a> (AIM) and <a href=
'http://messenger.msn.com/'>MSN Messenger</a>. Unfortunately, most of the
publicly available servers use proprietary protocols that only allow you to
communicate with users on the same system. These systems are not compatible
with each other and can't be accessed from other clients.</p>

<p>Jabber is an open source implementation of the IM server that
aims to change this. It uses streaming XML protocols that are free,
open, and public. These protocols have been formalized by the
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as the approved instant
messaging and presence technology under the name of XMPP. The first
Jabber technologies were developed in 1998 by Jeremie Miller and is
now used on thousands of servers world-wide to enable millions of
users to communicate with each other.</p>

<p>The biggest advantage of the Jabber server when compared with
commercial IM servers is that, since it is open source, anyone can
run a Jabber server and it can be restricted to a specific
community like a company work force or a group of friends. In this
article, I will document the steps I took to set up a Jabber server
and how I managed to overcome the difficulties I faced. Hopefully
this will make it easier for you to set up your own Jabber server.</p>

<h3>2.0 Pre-Configuration</h3>

<p>Before we compile the server, we need to make some changes to the system
on which we'll be installing the server to make it more secure. The first
thing we have to do is create a new user so the Jabberd server process is
not run as root. This is highly recommended, since running server processes
as root is a pretty bad idea.</p>

<p>Now, you might be wondering why that's the case. Right? Well,
imagine this scenario: a buffer overflow flaw is discovered in the
Jabberd server code and before a fix for it has been written a
script-kiddy who has hated you since you stole his place in the 5th
grade cafeteria finds out that you are running a version of the
server that is vulnerable to the attack and decides to hack you.
Now, if you are running the server as root, he would have you at his
mercy, as he would have full control of the server and he could do
whatever he wanted with it. On the other hand, if you were running
it as another user, he would still have to jump through a lot of
hoops to get root access and hopefully he would set off some kind
of alarm before he gets it, allowing you to catch him. Convinced
yet? No? Well it's your funeral...</p>

<p>To add a user to the server, run the following command as root:
<code>adduser jabber</code>. Then, choose a password for the account
by running the following command: <code>passwd jabber</code>.</p>

<p>After changing the password, we need to create a directory where
the jabberd process will store its logs and pids. You do it by
running the following commands:<br>
<br>
<code>mkdir -p /usr/local/var/jabberd/pid/</code><br>
<code>mkdir -p /usr/local/var/jabberd/log/</code></p>

<p>Once the directories are created, we need to change the ownership of
the directories so that the user jabber can write to them. We do
this by running the following commands:<br>
<br>
<code>chown -R jabber:jabber /usr/local/var/jabberd/pid/</code><br>
<code>chown -R jabber:jabber /usr/local/var/jabberd/log</code></p>

<h3>2.1 Getting the Jabber Server</h3>

<p>Since Jabber is an Open Source project, there are multiple
implementations of the Jabber server. A list of some of the servers
is available at: <a href=
'http://www.jabber.org/software/servers.shtml'>http://www.jabber.org/software/servers.shtml</a>.
I decided to use the Jabberd 2.x implementation of the server as I
already had the source for the server on my computer. Also, it wasn't
possible to download another server source due to the recent hack
of the Jabber Studio servers and the subsequent shutdown of the
download section of the site while they figured out what was going
on.</p>

<p>Hopefully, by the time you read this, their machines should be back to
normal and you will be able to download the latest version of Jabberd from
their site.

<h3>2.2 Configuring and Installing Jabber</h3>

<p>First thing we have to do after we download the source is to
uncompress it by issuing the following command: <code>tar -zxf
jabberd-2.0s2.tar.gz</code>. Then we change our current working
directory to the jabberd source directory by issuing the following
command: <code>cd jabberd-2.0s2</code></p>

<p>The jabberd server has a lot of configuration options that can
be set during the initial configuration. To see a list of all the
options available run the following command: <code>./configure
--help.</code> I decided to go with the default settings so I used
the following command to configure the install process:
<code>./configure</code></p>

<p>Once the configure script has finished running without giving
any errors, we can go ahead and compile the program by issuing the
following command: <code>make</code>. Once this is done, we
install the server by running: <code>make install</code> as
root.</p>

<p>By default, jabberd uses MySQL to store the user data, so we'll need to
setup a new MySQL database that jabberd can access. There is a script in
the 'tools' subdirectory of the jabberd source that makes this really easy
to do. To run the script issue the following command:<br> <code>mysql -u
root -p &nbsp;&lt; tools/db-setup.mysql</code></p>

<p>Enter the MySQL root password when you are prompted for it. This
script creates a new database and populates it with tables that the
jabberd server requires. Once the script finishes running, we need
to create a user called jabberd2 in MySQL to allow jabberd to
manipulate the database. This is done by issuing the following
command:<br>
<code>mysql -u root -p</code>.</p>

<p>Now enter the root password when you are prompted for it and you
will get the MySQL command prompt. At this prompt enter the
following command:<br>
<code>GRANT select,insert,delete,update ON jabberd2.* to jabberd2
at localhost IDENTIFIED by 'examplepassword';</code></p>

<p>replacing "examplepassword" with a password of your choice. Once you run
this command type <code>exit</code> to exit the program. This finishes the
installation of the jabberd server.  Now we need to customize the server
for our use.</p>

<h3>2.3 Customizing the jabberd server install</h3>

<p>To customize the server, we first need to change to the jabberd
directory by running the following command: <code>cd
/usr/local/etc/jabberd/</code>. Then we want to edit the sm.xml
file so we follow the following steps as root:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open <code>sm.xml</code> in your favorite text
editor</li>

<li>Change the ID on the network from localhost to
<code>jabber.yoursite.com</code> (Make sure that
jabber.yoursite.com resolves)</li>

<li>Scroll down to the User Options and uncomment the
<code>&lt;auto-create/&gt;</code> tag. This allows users that are
not registered on the server to register themselves.</li>

<li>If you want to have a predefined userlist to populate all new
users, scroll to the the end of the file and uncomment
<code>&lt;roster&gt;/usr/local/etc/jabberd/templates/roster.xml&lt;/roster&gt;</code>.
We will cover the contents of the roster.xml in a few minutes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once we are done editing, save sm.xml and exit the editor. Now we need
to customize c2s.xml, so follow these steps as root:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open <code>c2s.xml</code> in your favorite text editor</li>

<li>Scroll to the <code>'Local network configuration'</code>
section and change the &lt;id&gt; from localhost to
jabber.yoursite.com</li>

<li>Save and exit</li>
</ul>

<p>This completes the configuration of the jabberd server. This
gives us a basic jabber server that allows users to register
themselves and chat with each other. However, if we want to have the
ability to create chat rooms, we need to install some additional
software called <code>mu-conference</code>. We will cover the
installation of mu-conference momentarily.</p>

<h3>2.4 Creating a default buddy list for new users</h3>

<p>jabberd gives us the ability to create a template buddy list so
that each new user has a default buddy list. This is very useful in
environments where the administrator wants to make sure each user
has all the important people in their buddy list without spending a
lot of time adding each user manually.</p>

<p>The template file is located in the templates subdirectory and is
called <code>roster.xml</code>. The file has the following
format:</p>

<pre>
&lt;query xmlns=&rsquo;jabber:iq:roster&rsquo;&gt;
 &lt;!--
  &lt;item name=&rsquo;Buddy Name&rsquo; jid=&rsquo;JID@Host.domain&rsquo; subscription=&rsquo;both&rsquo;&gt;
   &lt;group&gt;BuddyGroup&lt;/group&gt;
  &lt;/item&gt;
 --&gt;
 &lt;/query&gt;
</pre>

<p>To add new users we need to uncomment the &lt;item name&gt; tag
and add a new line for each user. For example if you wanted to add
me to the default roster and my JID (Jabber ID) was
suramya@jabber.suramya.com the entry for my name would look like
this:</p>

<pre>
&lt;item name='Suramya' jid='suramya@jabber.suramya.com' subscription='both'&gt;
 &lt;group&gt;Support&lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/item&gt;
</pre>

<p>The group field tells the client the group under which the entry is
supposed to be stored. In this case Suramya is being stored under
the Support group. All entries need to be enclosed within the
&lt;query&gt; &lt;/query&gt; tag, so the complete file with one
user would look something like:</p>

<pre>
&lt;query xmlns=&rsquo;jabber:iq:roster&rsquo;&gt;
 &lt;item name=&rsquo;Suramya&rsquo; jid=&rsquo;suramya@jabber.suramya.com&rsquo; subscription=&rsquo;both&rsquo;&gt;
  &lt;group&gt;Support&lt;/group&gt;
 &lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/query&gt;
</pre>

<h3>2.5 Install mu-conference server</h3>

<p>Before we can install mu-server we need to install the Jabber
Component Runtime(JCR) which is available for download at: <a href=
'http://jabber.terrapin.com/JCR/jcr-0.1.2.tar.gz'>http://jabber.terrapin.com/JCR/jcr-0.1.2.tar.gz</a>.
To download and install JCR follow these steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download the source using: <code>wget
http://jabber.terrapin.com/JCR/jcr-0.1.2.tar.gz</code></li>

<li>Uncompress the archive using: <code>tar -zxf
jcr-0.1.2.tar.gz</code></li>

<li>Change to the jcr source directory using: <code>cd
jcr-0.1.2</code></li>

<li>Compile jcr by running: <code>make</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Once jcr finishes compiling we can proceed with the installation
of mu-conference by following these steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download the mu-conference source in the jcr directory from
<a
href='http://jabberstudio.org/projects/mu-conference/releases/view.php?id=357'>here</a></li>

<li>Uncompress the archive using: <code>tar -zxf
mu-conference-0.6.0.tar.gz</code></li>

<li>Copy main.c to the src directory using the following command:
<code>cp src/main.c mu-conference-0.6.0/src</code></li>

<li>Copy jcomp.mk to the src directory using the following command:
<code>cp src/jcomp.mk mu-conference-0.6.0/src</code></li>

<li>Change to the mu-conference source directory using: <code>cd
mu-conference-0.6.0/src</code></li>

<li>Compile mu-conference using: <code>make -f jcomp.m</code></li>

<li>Copy the mu-conference executable created to the jabberd folder
using: <code>cp mu-conference /usr/local/bin</code></li>

<li>Copy the Configuration file to jabberd configuration folder
using: <code>cp ../muc-jcr.xml /usr/local/etc/jabberd/</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Now we have to customize mu-conference by editing
<code>muc-jcr.xml</code>. To customize the conference follow these
steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open <code>muc-jcr.xml</code> in your favorite text editor</li>

<li>Change the name and host fields to
<code>conference.yoursite.com</code></li>

<li>Add &lt;user&gt;jabberd&lt;/user&gt; before the
&lsquo;secret&rsquo; line</li>

<li>Change the spool, logdir and pidfile lines to:</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li><code>/usr/local/var/jabberd/spool</code>
</li>

<li><code>/usr/local/var/jabberd/log</code>
</li>

<li><code>usr/local/var/jabberd/pid</code>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Create the spool directory using: <code>mkdir -p
/usr/local/var/jabberd/spool/</code></li>
</ul>

<p>This finishes the configuration of the mu-conference server and
we are now ready to run it.</p>

<h3>2.5 Running the Jabberd server</h3>

<p>To run the server run the following commands:</p>

<ul>
<li>Switch to the jabber user using: <code>su jabber</code></li>

<li>Start the jabberd server process using:
<code>/usr/local/bin/jabberd &amp;</code></li>

<li>Start the mu-conference server using:
<code>/usr/local/bin/mu-conference -c /etc/jabberd/muc-jcr.xml
&amp;</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>3.0 Conclusion</h3>

<p>By now I have hopefully saved you a lot of trouble by telling
you how to setup a jabber server quickly and easily. If you think

<p> I was born in 1980 in a small Air Force hospital in Hashimara, India. I
then spent the next 18 years of my life all over India during which I had
the pleasure of attending 7 schools to complete 12 years of schooling.

<p> I started using Linux in late 1999 when a friend lent me a Redhat 7.1
installation CD and another friend 'donated' a 6GB harddisk. This was right
after my Win98 had crashed for the nth time so I decided to give Linux a
shot. I tried it and got hooked almost instantly. Over the next 2 years I
upgraded to Redhat 7.3 but when Redhat decided to stop support for RH 7.3 I
switched to Debian and have been living happily ever since.

<p> I like to program a lot and have recently figured out how to decipher 
the jumble of characters some people like to call Perl and found that I
actually like it. For websites I like using PHP with MySQL backends and can
program with C, C++, VB and .Net. I am also very interested in computer
security and Artificial Intelligence and try to read as much on
these topics as I can.

<p> Other than working on the computer I like reading (mainly Fantasy and
Science Fiction but I will read anything except romance novels), listening
to music (fav singers include: Shania Twain, In-Grid, Crystal Waters) and
taking stuff apart to see how it works.

<p> If you are really bored and want to learn more about me then feel free to
visit my website at: <a 
href="http://www.suramya.com">http://www.suramya.com</a> where you will find 
more info about me than you ever wanted to know.

<p align="center">...............</p>
<P>
Hmmm, seems I've fallen behind the times...
</P>
<P>
So, I'm sitting here in my computer store, doing business. A client
comes in - one of those good ones, you can see right away that if he
buys anything, it'll be a lot, and expensive. In other words, quality.
He's got all the accessories, too - the hat, the coat, the high-priced
tie, the Armani suit... He's walking around, looking at stuff, flashing
his Parker, checking his list.
</P>
<P>
I ask him if I can help in any way.
</P>
<P>
Client: Certainly, if it's not a bother. I'm looking for a home
computer, something fairly speedy.
</P>
<P>
Me: - No problem! I see you have a list, so you already know the general
configuration?
</P>
<P>
C: - Yes, I was advised to get an AMD64+...
</P>
<P>
(Oh, sure - I know <EM>all</EM> about these "advisors"...)
</P>
<P>
Me: Actually, I'd wait a bit on buying that particular CPU, at least for
now.
</P>
<P>
C: Oh? Why?
</P>
<P>
(Well, hell. Now I'm got to explain CPU architecture...)
</P>
<P>
Me: Well, you see, it's a brand new architecture, and Wind0ws has not
yet been fully developed for it.
</P>
<P>
C: And why do I need Wind0ws?
</P>
<P>
(Holy crap... Another clueless lame-o! Now I've got to explain Wind0ws!)
</P>
<P>
Me: You see, for a computer to work, you need an operating system, and
the one for this processor is still being developed.
<p>
C: So?
<p>
Me: Well, Wind0ws is the operating system...
<p>
C: Young man! You might as well call <EM>DOS</EM> an operating system! (I go
into a slight state of shock) Wind0ws is no operating system - it's a
commercial result of Bill Gates' activity (I can feel myself turning to
stone). Now, <EM>Linux</EM> is a real operating system! (I go into total
catatonia)
<p>
C (interested): So, you have Wind0ws installed here?
</P>
<P>
I nod slowly.
</P>
<P>
- No, really?
</P>
<P>
He walks over to the monitor and looks at it.
</P>
<P>
C: - Hmm. <em>  Seemed  </em> like decent people, at first sight...
</P>
<P>
He stays silent for about a half a minute, and then delivers the killing
blow:
</P>
<P>
C: - <em>Tell me, please... why would I entrust the installation of complex
and expensive equipment to DOS-using, pingless lamers who don't know and
don't <strong> care</strong> to know about anything except Wind0ws?</em>
</P>
<P>
Turns around and walks out.

I'd imagine that they did - but spammers commonly misppel keywords such
as "degrees" in hopes of foiling spam blockers. Not that it helped them;
I never saw the thing (presumably, it got processed and dumped with the
rest of my spambucket during my weekly cleaning, a couple of hours ago.)

They don't grow cabbage in Ireland?  Considering it grows in Russia (schi

"Stanford University Network", of course. The bright yellow thing in The
Big Room? Just a shared recurring multiperson hallucination, easily
explained by modern psychological theory. I've noticed that if you
ignore it for 12 hours (or even less, at times), it goes away
eventually.

"Destroy the sun! We hatessss it! It burns! The pale yellow face mocks us,
keeps us from hearing the machine. It causes global warming. It causes
sunburns. DARPA says the sun is bad, it warms our enemies. It weakens our
dependence on foreign oil. There's only one logical conclusion: we must
destroy the sun." -- Mike Salib, <em>  Starkiller  </em> talk, at PyCon 2004.

I'm <em>  definitely</em> not leaving DC without some good Indian food; I've been

Agustine was brought in by the Krishnas during the yoga teacher training
that I took; it was simply awesome (all vegetarian, of course, but I
didn't mind a bit.) However, they don't run a restaurant - they just
cater for groups. At $6 apiece, it was a great deal, and the only reason
we had it only once a week was that the other students weren't as keen

By the way Urdu and Hindustani were almost the same language until around
Partition (the division of British India into India and Pakistan). At that
point religious fanatics decided to create one language called
Hindi
(supplanting an earlier language of the same name) which adopted more and
more Sanskrit words and is the language spoken on India(n) Radio and TV,
and another language called
Urdu
which adopted more and more Persian words and is the language spoken on
Pakistani Radio and TV.

The

Thanks, Mike! I don't know if I'll make it down there this time, but
it's a good pointer for future reference. The Vietnamese place I went to
last night definitely hit all the high marks for me - and there was a
Vietnamese supermarket in the same shopping mall, so there was much
happy sighing and many satisfied munching noises. I was also looking for
the latches used to attach these places to the ground, on the theory
that I could perhaps carry them away with me to St. Augustine (they'd be
a little bulky in the luggage, and the airlines would probably get
snotty about weight and size limits, but we all have our crosses to
bear)... no luck, darn it.

By the way, if you know - <TT>/como se llame 'lemoncillo' en Ingles?/</TT> I used
to munch on these things in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico,
where they grow wild - you can just reach out and tear off a little

what they were to the friend I was with, but one taste, and he was
hooked.

Since I'm still in an area where there are definite signs of
civilization (Baltimore), last night's culinary adventure was Chinese.
Although to many people, Chinese food might sound like "ho-hum, old
standby", I assure you that this was definitely NOT the case here: I
knew this place from the old days, when I lived here, and there's
<EM>nothing</EM> on their menu that is commonplace. I don't think they even
<em> have  </em> sweet-and-sour whatever or chop suey anything, and would probably
give you a dirty look for even asking. Well, maybe not - they're
<EM>really</EM> nice folks; just a look of pity, maybe.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The meal, all the better for being shared with one of my best friends,
consisted of "Jellyfish with Pickle and Red Vinegar", "Clams with Ground
Pork and Onion", "Snow Pea Greens with Roasted Garlic", and, I kid you
not, "Froggy with X. O. Sauce", all washed down with pu'u-er tea (which
I'd never heard of before but enjoyed) and finished off with a dessert
soup.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The jellyfish was somewhat surprising, both in its texture (rather firm
and even "crisp", like a good pickle) and its subtle but definite
flavor; the "Pickle" that came with it turned out to be mildly pickled
julienned cucumbers, carrots, and some sort of squash. The snow pea
greens, of which both I and my friend are quite enamored, are actually
the greens - not the snow peas thomselves, as some might expect - and
had a very delicate flavor, nicely enhanced by nut-brown roasted garlic
cloves.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The clams... it would take a more experienced food writer than me to do
justice to their description. Suffice it to say that you end up licking
the shells to make sure you get every last trace of the sauce, and Some
People put down their chopsticks and use a spoon (!) to get every last
bit off the plate. I forgave her, since pregnant women must be humored.
Besides, she has a devastating pout - quivering lower lip and
everything - and is not afraid to use it.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The "Froggy" turned out to be a bunch of, well, froggy drumsticks. Good,
although a little too bland to be on par with the other dishes and just
a little too fiddly (those are <em>  tiny  </em> little bones!) for my tastes. They
made a good vehicle for the excellent sauce - which, as my friend
commented, is more than some people have as a mission in life.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
We had just enough room left for a few spoonfuls of the dessert soup,
which was a sweet tapioca-based concoction. It was fine, but did not
cause either one of to go into transports of ecstasy (which was OK,
since we were both a little too tired to be transported anywhere.)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
All in all, <EM>quite</EM> the memorable meal.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Would you believe that we originally stumbled on this place by accident?
It looked like a slightly seedy "ballroom"-type of Chinese restaurant,
probably nothing special... I plan to return to worship at the shrine of
its food whenever I visit Baltimore.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Tomorrow, New York - and dinner at the Harvard Club. Due to a number of
interesting reasons (long story), I shall be wearing a Roman toga and
lounging on a couch in high Roman tradition - along with six or seven
similarly-attired people. The meal will be something very close to the
cuisine of pre-Octavian Rome, and should be quite interesting. We'll be
off in a section which has been reserved for us; the other patrons may
stare but will not actually have to rub shoulders with the crazies.

   Jan 02 01:48:06 &lt;jimregan&gt; You were measuring with '-- \n' so you

   Jan 06 20:33:30 &lt;editorgal&gt; a chicken pot pie.
   Jan 06 20:34:29 * jimregan looks at the door that just materialised
   behind him
   Jan 06 20:34:33 &lt;jimregan&gt; Kitchen, eh?
   Jan 06 20:34:54 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hmm... and it conveniently has a piping hot
   chicken pot pie at the ready
   Jan 06 20:34:57 &lt;editorgal&gt; TAG bar and girl.
   Jan 06 20:35:12 &lt;jimregan&gt; Eh?
   Jan 06 20:35:15 &lt;editorgal&gt; &lt;--
   Jan 06 20:35:44 &lt;jimregan&gt; oh, right. You were tending through my flu
   Jan 06 20:35:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'm up to serving drinks now.
   Jan 06 20:36:05 &lt;editorgal&gt; good
   Jan 06 20:36:11 &lt;editorgal&gt; a ginger beer would be grand
   Jan 06 20:36:19 * jimregan passes one over
   Jan 06 20:37:31 * editorgal amazes herself by actually catching it
   Jan 06 20:39:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh. Didn't put too much effort into
   sliding it. Too tired.
   Jan 06 20:39:45 &lt;editorgal&gt; yeah well it's for the best
   Jan 06 20:39:57 &lt;editorgal&gt; neither of us are up to cleaning up after
   a broken one
   Jan 06 20:40:02 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 06 20:40:13 * jimregan googles for a bar cleaning robot
   Jan 06 20:40:30 * jimregan wonders if chatbot can be repurposed.
   Jan 06 20:40:44 * editorgal makes gimp do it
   Jan 06 20:40:48 &lt;editorgal&gt; it has script-fu :)
   Jan 06 20:41:03 &lt;jimregan&gt; The Gimp! Now with added script-fu!
   Jan 06 20:41:17 &lt;jimregan&gt; Script-fu your way out of those tricky
   corners!
   Jan 06 20:41:20 &lt;editorgal&gt; "added" script-fu was python support.
   Jan 06 20:41:22 &lt;jimregan&gt; It slices! It dices!
   Jan 06 20:41:26 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah.
   Jan 06 20:41:37 &lt;editorgal&gt; it makes juliene fonts. yeah
   Jan 06 20:41:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; Saw that in the pretty pretty Gimp 2 that
   came with Ubuntu
   Jan 06 20:47:25 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; jimregan: Coffee, please.
   Jan 06 20:48:01 &lt;jimregan&gt; With the usual green glow?
   Jan 06 20:48:27 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; What is this, Starbucks? You know I
   don't have anything, bar normal coffee. :P
   Jan 06 20:48:32 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Yeesh. Can't get the staff.
   Jan 06 20:48:39 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 06 20:49:01 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I'd try propping up the bar, but I'm too
   short.
   Jan 06 20:49:02 * jimregan passes over what passes for normal coffee
   in Thomas's twisted worldview
   Jan 06 20:49:15 * jimregan takes off the lead gloves
   Jan 06 20:49:17 * thomas_adam sips through a mobius straw.
   Jan 06 20:52:36 &lt;jimregan&gt; I gotta go. Heather, I leave the bar in
   your hands.
   Jan 06 20:52:50 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; jimregan: Thanks, Jim. Toodles.
   Jan 06 20:52:50 --- You are now known as jimregan_away
   Jan 06 20:52:54 &lt;editorgal&gt; right, he doesn't know what he's in for...
   Jan 06 20:53:12 * thomas_adam pours all the alcohol away, and serves
   nothing but coffee.
   Jan 06 20:53:15 &lt;jimregan_away&gt; Hey... at least wait until I've gone
   through the door
   Jan 06 20:53:17 &lt;editorgal&gt; \o/
   Jan 06 20:53:22 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; jimregan_away: Sssssh -- you're not
   here. :P
   Jan 06 20:53:28 &lt;jimregan_away&gt; Have fun with the safe...
   Jan 06 20:53:30 * editorgal has made a pot extra strong
   Jan 06 20:53:38 &lt;jimregan_away&gt; where I keep the 'good' stuff

   Jan 07 01:52:21 &lt;editorgal&gt; my teddybear, bear, has agreed to be a
   model for xteddy
   Jan 07 01:52:31 &lt;editorgal&gt; since he's fairly similar of form
   Jan 07 01:52:47 &lt;editorgal&gt; I want to come up with a bio for bear
   Jan 07 01:52:57 &lt;jimregan&gt; "You're beautiful dahling. Tease the
   camera"
   Jan 07 01:53:04 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)))
   Jan 07 01:53:07 &lt;editorgal&gt; I've the plans for the little newspaper

   Jan 07 01:53:47 * jimregan waves back

   Sorry 'bout that)
   Jan 07 01:54:06 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :)
   Jan 07 01:54:08 &lt;editorgal&gt; I've a plan for a teacup but it occurs to
   me I still have some fimo left
   Jan 07 01:54:29 &lt;editorgal&gt; I might just make him his own teacup and
   put something LG lookin' on it
   Jan 07 01:55:01 &lt;jimregan&gt; Huh? Potentially lethal liquid concoction?
   Possibly toxic?
   Jan 07 01:55:26 &lt;jimregan&gt; Guaranteed to make you either extremely
   drunk or extremely knurd?
   Jan 07 01:55:45 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh I dunno
   Jan 07 01:55:51 &lt;editorgal&gt; what would a teddybear drink?
   Jan 07 01:56:03 * jimregan tries to remember the words
   Jan 07 01:56:14 &lt;jimregan&gt; c/~ if you go down to the woods today...
   Jan 07 01:56:30 * thomas_adam sings along.
   Jan 07 01:56:38 &lt;editorgal&gt; teddybear's picnic!
   Jan 07 01:56:42 &lt;editorgal&gt; * bear sings along
   Jan 07 01:56:43 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 07 01:56:53 * editorgal pats bear
   Jan 07 01:57:21 * editorgal avoids singing ewoks picnic til the
   original is done ;P
   Jan 07 01:58:22 &lt;jimregan&gt; Um... I only know a few of the words.
   Jan 07 01:58:33 * thomas_adam knows it all. :))

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 08 02:03:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'm sure you'll get it sorted
   Jan 08 02:04:28 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Though I've had the universe move in
   strange ways for me today, so I might just be overly positive)
   Jan 08 02:05:11 &lt;editorgal&gt; thanks
   Jan 08 02:05:18 &lt;editorgal&gt; it's been kind of strange for me too
   Jan 08 02:05:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; How so?
   Jan 08 02:06:23 &lt;editorgal&gt; I saw a rainbow
   Jan 08 02:06:30 &lt;jimregan&gt; ?
   Jan 08 02:06:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hmm... OK... you're in California, not
   Ireland
   Jan 08 02:07:09 &lt;editorgal&gt; when among my errands I bought a cellphone
   battery, the store clerk (who was indian) gave me a very sincere ~10m
   chatter about how god looks out for us, and the soul is eternal
   Jan 08 02:07:24 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 08 02:07:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; (I finished reading another Paulo Coelho
   book today, so I got basically the same thing :)
   Jan 08 02:09:20 &lt;jimregan&gt; It turns out that Beata and I ended up
   giving each other the same present twice.
   Jan 08 02:10:34 &lt;jimregan&gt; When she said I made one of her dreams come
   true, I was like... "OK". Then today, blam!
   Jan 08 02:14:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; When I was reading that book, there was
   something I desperately want to talk about with someone - anyone - but
   then, out of nowhere, another thought swept in and said "No, you can't
   talk about this"
   Jan 08 02:15:42 &lt;jimregan&gt; Blam. I had a secret. I can still have
   them! I'm not empty handed.
   Jan 08 02:19:27 * jimregan pours a vodka
   Jan 08 02:19:38 * jimregan swirls the glass to watch the ripples
   Jan 08 02:21:43 &lt;editorgal&gt; heh
   Jan 08 02:23:08 &lt;jimregan&gt; Makes me reevaluate that "her boyfriend's
   days are numbered" crap I was spewing last month, safe in the
   knowledge I wasn't really going to pursue her anyway
   Jan 08 02:26:40 &lt;jimregan&gt; Now... I just wish her well.
   Jan 08 02:29:24 &lt;jimregan&gt; Anyways, I gotta get up in the morning. All
   the best.

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 14 07:15:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; So... what did Santa bring?
   Jan 14 07:17:01 &lt;editorgal&gt; um
   Jan 14 07:17:06 &lt;editorgal&gt; not much
   Jan 14 07:17:19 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hee hee. Best presents I got this year were
   from foreigners I didn't even know 4 months ago
   Jan 14 07:17:24 &lt;editorgal&gt; a jar that looks like sweets, containing
   smaller jars that look like sweets
   Jan 14 07:17:31 &lt;editorgal&gt; some tea and biscuits
   Jan 14 07:17:49 &lt;editorgal&gt; a bit of money, very much needed
   Jan 14 07:18:00 &lt;editorgal&gt; heh
   Jan 14 07:18:16 &lt;editorgal&gt; more cookies than we knew what to do with,
   really
   Jan 14 07:18:17 &lt;jimregan&gt; My gift choices were universally praised :)
   Jan 14 07:18:27 &lt;editorgal&gt; that's cool
   Jan 14 07:18:38 &lt;jimregan&gt; I got "Wyrd Sisters" for Trev - "How did
   you know that was the book I was on?"
   Jan 14 07:18:56 &lt;editorgal&gt; I dunno, how did you?
   Jan 14 07:18:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; I got a book about the human body for my
   sister - "I was going to buy that"
   Jan 14 07:19:02 &lt;jimregan&gt; I didn't.
   Jan 14 07:19:16 &lt;jimregan&gt; I actually didn't even buy that for him
   (Shhh!)
   Jan 14 07:19:18 &lt;editorgal&gt; she an artist?
   Jan 14 07:19:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; Masseuse
   Jan 14 07:19:27 &lt;editorgal&gt; ah
   Jan 14 07:19:29 &lt;jimregan&gt; (in training)
   Jan 14 07:19:39 &lt;editorgal&gt; (ok)
   Jan 14 07:19:46 &lt;jimregan&gt; ((righto))
   Jan 14 07:20:08 &lt;jimregan&gt; I got my Dad a book he had bought for
   himself earlier that week
   Jan 14 07:20:13 &lt;editorgal&gt; and we already know beata liked hers
   Jan 14 07:20:16 &lt;editorgal&gt; whoops well
   Jan 14 07:20:22 &lt;jimregan&gt; Erm... yeah.
   Jan 14 07:20:34 &lt;editorgal&gt; see if he'd held off on xmas buying for
   self ..
   Jan 14 07:20:42 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yep
   Jan 14 07:20:56 &lt;jimregan&gt; Got my other sister a bottle of vodka
   Jan 14 07:21:03 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 14 07:21:10 &lt;editorgal&gt; do stores there refuse to take back books
   with eyeball tracks on them?
   Jan 14 07:21:27 &lt;jimregan&gt; Dunno. Never tried to return anything,
   ever.
   Jan 14 07:22:07 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh.
   Jan 14 07:22:28 &lt;editorgal&gt; jim got a sweater I need to get size
   exchanged
   Jan 14 07:22:52 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'd never return a gift.
   Jan 14 07:23:02 &lt;editorgal&gt; his mom's a bit ditzy about her baby boy
   is bigger than he was when he was 8, so she waaaay blew past the size
   margin
   Jan 14 07:23:06 &lt;jimregan&gt; To me, it's the embodiment of a thought.
   Jan 14 07:23:13 &lt;editorgal&gt; awww
   Jan 14 07:23:13 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 14 07:23:30 &lt;editorgal&gt; luckily the vendor's very good about that
   stuff
   Jan 14 07:23:32 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah. Which is why I have /no/ expectations
   for Christmas or birthdays
   Jan 14 07:24:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; Though now, I suppose, I can rely on at
   least one of my sisters, and my son is showing signs of great reserves
   of thoughtfulness
   Jan 14 07:25:14 &lt;jimregan&gt; It should be great when he's old enough to
   buy the gifts himself.
   Jan 14 07:25:19 &lt;editorgal&gt; I find it's more interesting to put good
   thought in, than to just merely throw money at a box
   Jan 14 07:25:33 &lt;editorgal&gt; you might be surprised
   Jan 14 07:25:37 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh. When I was fifteen, I was given money
   in a box
   Jan 14 07:25:51 &lt;editorgal&gt; when I was a kid I did my shopping with
   adults, but made sure to make seperate trips
   Jan 14 07:26:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; My mother made some comment about how
   shitty it'd be if she did that to one of my sisters
   Jan 14 07:26:10 &lt;jimregan&gt; "Uh... you did that to me when I was
   fifteen"
   Jan 14 07:26:14 &lt;jimregan&gt; "Oh..."
   Jan 14 07:26:26 &lt;jimregan&gt; "Ended my expectations for Christmas"
   Jan 14 07:26:26 &lt;editorgal&gt; someone always knew someone else's
   present, but it was when they were shopping for $that_person too
   Jan 14 07:26:52 &lt;editorgal&gt; :(
   Jan 14 07:27:48 &lt;editorgal&gt; I was able to provide the added benefit of
   spot-checking whether the recipient probably would or wouldn't like
   their pick, too
   Jan 14 07:28:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; I can't be too hard on my parents though...
   /I/ can't even buy stuff for me :)
   Jan 14 07:29:25 &lt;editorgal&gt; at *least* it could be a giftcert at
   someplace you enjoy shopping at.
   Jan 14 07:29:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nah. Cash is great. Pubs don't do
   giftcerts.
   Jan 14 07:30:09 &lt;editorgal&gt; well ok, how about cash used to pack a
   couple pintglasses.
   Jan 14 07:30:13 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Tried to talk the barman in my old
   regular...)
   Jan 14 07:30:26 &lt;jimregan&gt; erm ... into it
   Jan 14 07:30:38 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nah. I rarely have drink in the house.
   Jan 14 07:30:57 &lt;jimregan&gt; Contrary to my own myth, I don't drink that
   often.
   Jan 14 07:31:00 &lt;editorgal&gt; s/pintglasses/coffeemugs/ ?
   Jan 14 07:31:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nah. We've already got a set that are
   attached to my ritual.
   Jan 14 07:31:30 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh.
   Jan 14 07:31:34 &lt;jimregan&gt; Anything else wouldn't work.
   Jan 14 07:32:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; 's why I try to go for different coffee
   types when I'm elsewhere
   Jan 14 07:32:11 &lt;editorgal&gt; here the ritual includes mild cussing that
   the pot is a dribble pot for a cup and a half worth
   Jan 14 07:32:27 &lt;jimregan&gt; I think I need to kill that ritual. I had
   ~10 cups today.
   Jan 14 07:32:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; Just out of boredom
   Jan 14 07:33:12 &lt;editorgal&gt; // the shake becomes a warning // it is
   caffeine alone that sets the mind in motion
   Jan 14 07:33:31 &lt;jimregan&gt; Shake?
   Jan 14 07:33:34 &lt;jimregan&gt; Pfft.
   Jan 14 07:33:46 &lt;jimregan&gt; I need ~20 cups before I get the shakes
   Jan 14 07:34:04 &lt;jimregan&gt; I've been drinking coffee from an
   unhealthily young age
   Jan 14 07:34:06 &lt;editorgal&gt; then you'd be more likely to get them from
   not drinking at least 8...
   Jan 14 07:34:12 &lt;jimregan&gt; True
   Jan 14 07:34:15 &lt;editorgal&gt; I didn't start til I was 15
   Jan 14 07:34:22 &lt;editorgal&gt; blame my programmer friends
   Jan 14 07:34:25 &lt;editorgal&gt; well...
   Jan 14 07:34:38 &lt;editorgal&gt; strictly speaking I tasted some younger
   Jan 14 07:34:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; I was around 10
   Jan 14 07:34:54 &lt;editorgal&gt; and what we drank in the lab as it were
   wasn't coffee, it was instant
   Jan 14 07:35:15 &lt;jimregan&gt; I brought coffee to school every day when I
   was 11
   Jan 14 07:35:33 &lt;editorgal&gt; well then
   Jan 14 07:35:37 &lt;jimregan&gt; Until it spilled on my books
   Jan 14 07:35:43 &lt;editorgal&gt; your nerves are probably wired for it.
   Jan 14 07:37:25 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah, but last time I tried to quit
   smoking, I tried to quit caffeine too, and managed just fine on 1 cup
   Jan 14 07:37:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; until the smoking habit kicked back in, and
   I said fuck it

   Jan 14 07:39:46 * editorgal shuffles her feet and looks down
   Jan 14 07:39:52 &lt;editorgal&gt; I don't follow slashdot
   Jan 14 07:40:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; WHAAAAAT!
   Jan 14 07:40:02 &lt;editorgal&gt; I sometimes surf freshmeat
   Jan 14 07:40:19 &lt;editorgal&gt; I figure the good stuff gets retold to me
   anyway...
   Jan 14 07:40:47 &lt;jimregan&gt; (OK, I haven't read much more than the
   headlines for a month now, but still)
   Jan 14 07:41:08 &lt;lunatech&gt; neither do i, others on channel usually
   point out interestig stories
   Jan 14 07:42:33 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh good, then you won't rat me out and
   make me turn in my union card
   Jan 14 07:42:46 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh.
   Jan 14 07:43:00 &lt;lunatech&gt; :)
   Jan 14 07:43:04 &lt;jimregan&gt; When I made the switch to ubuntu, I didn't
   bother installing liferea
   Jan 14 07:43:22 &lt;lunatech&gt; being a conformist geek is higly overrated
   Jan 14 07:43:25 &lt;jimregan&gt; So, I don't read the stuff I used to... and
   don't miss most of it either
   Jan 14 07:43:30 &lt;editorgal&gt; installin wha ?
   Jan 14 07:43:36 &lt;jimregan&gt; A feedreader
   Jan 14 07:43:41 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh
   Jan 14 07:43:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; That can take input from a pipe
   Jan 14 07:43:47 &lt;lunatech&gt; bloglines is the best feed reader jimregan
   :)
   Jan 14 07:43:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; Pfft
   Jan 14 07:44:05 &lt;jimregan&gt; See my answer before yours
   Jan 14 07:44:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; Y'know, I had this whole screen scraping
   thing going on...
   Jan 14 07:44:28 &lt;jimregan&gt; don't use them anymore
   Jan 14 07:44:28 &lt;editorgal&gt; webfetch and add ones you care about to
   your website.
   Jan 14 07:44:38 &lt;jimregan&gt; Website?
   Jan 14 07:44:50 &lt;jimregan&gt; That's, like, soooo 1997
   Jan 14 07:44:51 &lt;lunatech&gt; i think reading blogs can keep you ahead of
   the curve
   Jan 14 07:44:54 &lt;editorgal&gt; yeah I know
   Jan 14 07:45:08 &lt;lunatech&gt; you get to know cool things before anyone
   else
   Jan 14 07:45:22 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah, but it doesn't replace reading
   mailing lists
   Jan 14 07:45:27 &lt;jimregan&gt; (or using gmane)
   Jan 14 07:45:29 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 14 07:45:35 &lt;lunatech&gt; i agree with that :)
   Jan 14 07:46:06 &lt;jimregan&gt; For sites you really do read on a daily
   basis, it's a lot better
   Jan 14 07:46:28 &lt;jimregan&gt; But most sites have such shitty feeds
   Jan 14 07:46:46 * lunatech wonders what feeds jimregan reads
   Jan 14 07:46:46 &lt;jimregan&gt; (And I hold up my hands for LG's being
   among the worst)
   Jan 14 07:46:52 &lt;jimregan&gt; Pfft.
   Jan 14 07:47:15 &lt;jimregan&gt; Check LG back issues. I put my OPML and my
   screen scrapers in back issues
   Jan 14 07:47:34 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Don't ask me which :)
   Jan 14 07:48:39 &lt;lunatech&gt; i remember reading your screen scraper
   article :)
   Jan 14 07:48:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; The only feed I really keep an eye on
   anymore is my del.icio.us feed
   Jan 14 07:48:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; To keep tracks of the sites I liked :)
   Jan 14 07:49:24 &lt;lunatech&gt; del.icio.us is ingenious
   Jan 14 07:49:33 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah.
   Jan 14 07:49:37 &lt;lunatech&gt; i stumble upon lots of nifty things on it
   Jan 14 07:49:39 &lt;jimregan&gt; I like flickr too.
   Jan 14 07:50:16 &lt;jimregan&gt; I like bookmarking my articles with it, so
   I can see who else liked them :)
   Jan 14 07:50:42 &lt;jimregan&gt; The two articles in this month's LG were
   the most popular so far, I think
   Jan 14 07:50:50 &lt;jimregan&gt; I really wasn't expecting that
   Jan 14 07:51:24 &lt;lunatech&gt; :)
   Jan 14 07:51:38 &lt;lunatech&gt; nice hack that one
   Jan 14 07:51:47 &lt;jimregan&gt; Though I have to say, my montage script is
   pretty cool
   Jan 14 07:52:32 &lt;jimregan&gt; First time I sat down and wrote a program
   thinking "how can I make this /fully/ useful?"
   Jan 14 07:53:08 &lt;lunatech&gt; i have seen a flick zeitgist(sp?) on some
   blogs,
   Jan 14 07:53:15 &lt;jimregan&gt; Suppose it was something to do with my
   writing it on Christmas Day/the 26th
   Jan 14 07:53:20 &lt;jimregan&gt; That flash thing?
   Jan 14 07:53:38 &lt;jimregan&gt; Flash hangs my computer, that's why I wrote
   the script :)
   Jan 14 07:54:35 &lt;lunatech&gt; yes, yes that flash thing. it is nifty
   Jan 14 07:54:57 &lt;jimregan&gt; I was tearing my hair out, wrestling with
   Image::Magick's strangeness, while Charlton Heston delivered the 10
   commandments on TV :)
   Jan 14 07:55:39 &lt;jimregan&gt; (I had a few "thou shalt nots" for the
   creator of Image::Magick
   Jan 14 07:56:26 &lt;lunatech&gt;
   http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~anthony/graphics/imagick6/
   Jan 14 07:56:51 &lt;lunatech&gt; useful examples on that page
   Jan 14 07:58:46 &lt;jimregan&gt; Eh... I don't feel like going down that
   route again.
   Jan 14 07:59:22 &lt;lunatech&gt; hehe .. useful resource, bookmark it .
   trust me you won't regret it :)

   Jan 14 05:04:46 &lt;okopnik&gt; Hi, Jimmy!
   Jan 14 05:04:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; Erm... I wrote a story.
   Jan 14 05:04:59 &lt;editorgal&gt; what kind?
   Jan 14 05:05:03 &lt;jimregan&gt; Guess
   Jan 14 05:05:07 &lt;editorgal&gt; er
   Jan 14 05:05:12 &lt;editorgal&gt; allergy meds time again
   Jan 14 05:05:16 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 14 05:05:42 &lt;okopnik&gt; Erotica involving computers?
   Jan 14 05:05:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; I was daydreaming and wrote it down for a
   change
   Jan 14 05:05:49 &lt;jimregan&gt; No.
   Jan 14 05:06:11 &lt;jimregan&gt; The mind boggles...
   Jan 14 05:06:20 &lt;okopnik&gt; Binary division never sounded so
   interesting...
   Jan 14 05:06:20 &lt;editorgal&gt; the bog mindles..
   Jan 14 05:06:26 &lt;jimregan&gt; I like my computer, but it's a purely
   platonic thing
   Jan 14 05:06:42 * editorgal brings out some carrots to tease the
   square root out of them
   Jan 14 05:06:43 &lt;okopnik&gt; Yes, but does your computer think so???
   Jan 14 05:06:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hmm...
   Jan 14 05:07:03 &lt;editorgal&gt; or does it have a warm sense of ftp behind
   its firewall?
   Jan 14 05:07:08 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 14 05:07:33 &lt;okopnik&gt; If you take the square root of a caret
   (5^2), doesn't that get you right back to where you started?
   Jan 14 05:07:36 &lt;jimregan&gt; I really should be more careful about what
   I say. I keep holding it as evidence against myself
   Jan 14 05:07:49 &lt;editorgal&gt; aww
   Jan 14 05:07:52 * editorgal hugs jimmy
   Jan 14 05:08:05 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nah, I was talking about the ftp/firewall
   comment
   Jan 14 05:08:11 * editorgal pours him a shotglass full of something
   tasty
   Jan 14 05:08:15 &lt;editorgal&gt; here, take the fifth
   Jan 14 05:08:18 &lt;jimregan&gt; I sent it to Trev so he can laugh at me :)
   Jan 14 05:08:27 &lt;okopnik&gt; That's a BIG shotglass.
   Jan 14 05:08:29 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nah, gimme a glass. Ripples
   Jan 14 05:08:39 &lt;editorgal&gt; okopnik: texas
   Jan 14 05:08:50 &lt;okopnik&gt; Jimmy, you don't want Ripple. That's _nasty_
   stuff.
   Jan 14 05:08:57 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 14 05:09:04 &lt;editorgal&gt; geez Jimmy I said *tasty* not *nasty*
   Jan 14 05:09:12 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh.
   Jan 14 05:09:22 &lt;jimregan&gt; That's actually what I saw
   Jan 14 05:09:24 * editorgal finds these shotglasses are good for 307
   ale though
   Jan 14 05:09:40 &lt;okopnik&gt; Never heard of it.
   Jan 14 05:09:47 &lt;editorgal&gt; I refuse to keep anything stocked whose
   vintage is by week rather than year
   Jan 14 05:09:53 &lt;editorgal&gt; !
   Jan 14 05:09:57 * okopnik laughs
   Jan 14 05:10:01 &lt;editorgal&gt; you never heard of 307 ale??
   Jan 14 05:10:08 &lt;okopnik&gt; Nope. Whatsit?
   Jan 14 05:10:27 &lt;jimregan&gt; ??
   Jan 14 05:11:03 &lt;jimregan&gt; I refuse to keep anything in the TAG bar
   that goes by proof instead of half-life, but to each his/her own
   Jan 14 05:11:20 &lt;okopnik&gt; Ah. Found the Tom Smith ref.

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 14 06:52:52 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh... found a quote in a book about Celtic
   religion
   Jan 14 06:52:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; The folk of a Celtic type, whether
   pre-Celtic, Celtic, or
   Jan 14 06:52:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; Norse, have all spoken a Celtic language
   and exhibit the same old
   Jan 14 06:52:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; Celtic characteristics--vanity, loquacity,
   excitability, fickleness,
   Jan 14 06:52:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; imagination, love of the romantic,
   fidelity, attachment to family
   Jan 14 06:52:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; ties, sentimental love of their country,
   religiosity passing over
   Jan 14 06:52:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; easily to superstition, and a comparatively
   high degree of sexual
   Jan 14 06:52:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; morality. Some of these traits were already
   noted by classical
   Jan 14 06:52:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; observers.
   Jan 14 06:53:07 &lt;jimregan&gt; Sound like anyone?

   Jan 14 06:56:19 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hi Raj
   Jan 14 06:56:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; Cup of chai?
   Jan 14 06:56:25 &lt;creighton&gt; Hullo
   Jan 14 06:56:36 &lt;editorgal&gt; huh
   Jan 14 06:56:37 &lt;lunatech&gt; hello jimregan ,
   Jan 14 06:56:49 &lt;lunatech&gt; yes a cup would be nice :)
   Jan 14 06:56:53 &lt;lunatech&gt; hello editorgal
   Jan 14 06:56:56 * jimregan passes one over
   Jan 14 06:57:02 &lt;editorgal&gt; when I did renfaire regularly my "cup" of
   chai was taller than the average beer stein
   Jan 14 06:57:17 &lt;jimregan&gt; That's the handy thing about a virtual
   bar... really cuts down the prep time
   Jan 14 06:57:34 &lt;editorgal&gt; That was also the time I managed to get
   bee stung, entirely mom's fault
   Jan 14 06:57:55 &lt;editorgal&gt; since I put an indecent amount of honey in
   my 18-20 oz of chai
   Jan 14 06:58:36 &lt;editorgal&gt; the bees did hang around the honey thing,
   and I wouldn't have been stung by them on that basis, they weren't
   stressy actually
   Jan 14 06:58:49 &lt;editorgal&gt; snacking, more like, and frankly, bees
   don't eat much
   Jan 14 06:59:19 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah. Make great house guests
   Jan 14 06:59:26 &lt;jimregan&gt; Take up little room, too
   Jan 14 06:59:40 &lt;editorgal&gt; but mom wails &lt;accent
   type="valleygirl"&gt;like &lt;em&gt;toooo&lt;/em&gt;tally freaked&lt;/accent&gt;
   Jan 14 06:59:48 &lt;lunatech&gt; :)
   Jan 14 07:00:03 &lt;jimregan&gt; fer sher
   Jan 14 07:00:15 &lt;editorgal&gt; and I turn around and cross-move out of
   the intersection rather quickly, expecting to narrowly avoid a troop
   in platemail or the scots or somesuch
   Jan 14 07:00:37 &lt;jimregan&gt; Ye wha?
   Jan 14 07:00:37 &lt;editorgal&gt; thereby smanging the back of my hand into
   a terribly surprised (and now dying) bee.
   Jan 14 07:00:54 &lt;editorgal&gt; well the way she yelped I thought I was
   about to be run over.
   Jan 14 07:00:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; I think you omitted part of that story
   Jan 14 07:01:21 &lt;editorgal&gt; what? the part about renaissance pleasure
   faire?
   Jan 14 07:01:35 * jimregan scrolls back
   Jan 14 07:01:55 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yep
   Jan 14 07:02:10 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'm just a bit confused, OK...
   Jan 14 07:02:14 &lt;editorgal&gt; "when I did renfaire regularly..." &lt;-
   that?
   Jan 14 07:02:27 &lt;editorgal&gt; um
   Jan 14 07:02:36 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh renfaire == renaissance pleasure faire.
   Gotcha
   Jan 14 07:02:47 &lt;editorgal&gt; 6 weekends worth of everyone pretends it's
   elizabethan tourist trap
   Jan 14 07:02:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh, not /just/ about that story. In general
   Jan 14 07:03:02 &lt;jimregan&gt; You read the story :)
   Jan 14 07:03:28 &lt;jimregan&gt; (For those coming late to the table, I
   wrote a story. All icky gooey yuck)
   Jan 14 07:04:00 &lt;editorgal&gt; the tale of the poor dead bee isn't done
   yet of course... damn that hurt... I was really annoyed too, but put a
   damper on my heartbeat el pronto...
   Jan 14 07:04:23 &lt;editorgal&gt; and laurie started clearing the way to get
   us down to first aid
   Jan 14 07:04:52 &lt;editorgal&gt; jimmy: you forgot mushy, that came first
   Jan 14 07:04:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh, yeah. Mea culpa.
   Jan 14 07:05:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; I think the letter was so much more mushy
   though.
   Jan 14 07:05:29 &lt;editorgal&gt; *now* if someone got in our way there was
   gonna be someone run over...
   Jan 14 07:05:32 &lt;jimregan&gt; Public shaming? [Y]/n?
   Jan 14 07:06:16 &lt;editorgal&gt; so I got down to first aid and they were
   able to extract the bee remains before much of its poison sac got into
   my hand
   Jan 14 07:06:17 &lt;jimregan&gt; I did promise Mike something to razz me
   about
   Jan 14 07:06:25 &lt;editorgal&gt; mom, however, needed a tranquilizer.
   Jan 14 07:06:32 &lt;jimregan&gt; *snort*
   Jan 14 07:06:36 &lt;jimregan&gt; Splart!
   Jan 14 07:06:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh...
   Jan 14 07:06:54 &lt;jimregan&gt; Just noticed the splart! notice is gone.
   Jan 14 07:06:59 &lt;editorgal&gt; yeah thomas took it off
   Jan 14 07:07:15 &lt;editorgal&gt; we do change these things from time to
   time you know
   Jan 14 07:07:16 &lt;jimregan&gt; Splart is the sound you make when you try
   to hold the coffee in with your hand and fail
   Jan 14 07:07:26 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah... but so rarely :P
   Jan 14 07:07:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Erm... when laughing...)
   Jan 14 07:07:48 &lt;editorgal&gt; given how unhappy my new year has been...
   Jan 14 07:08:15 &lt;jimregan&gt; (I just remembered certain stories... felt
   the need to specify)
   Jan 14 07:09:02 &lt;creighton&gt; unhappy?
   Jan 14 07:09:27 &lt;creighton&gt; Heh heh...people kept telling me "Happy
   New Year!" I said "We'll see, won't we?"
   Jan 14 07:09:29 --- editorgal has changed the topic to: The Answer
   Gang, linux 'r' us and maybe the kernel will even compile this time |
   linuxgazette.net #110 | The TAG bar is open, look out for the
   watzamocha
   Jan 14 07:09:45 &lt;editorgal&gt; creighton: two of my friends died, one
   very close to me :(
   Jan 14 07:09:58 &lt;editorgal&gt; although I think the total score goes...
   Jan 14 07:10:09 &lt;jimregan&gt; You're keeping score?
   Jan 14 07:10:25 &lt;jimregan&gt; Dammit, I'm the morbid one. You stick to
   -ose, you!
   Jan 14 07:10:50 &lt;editorgal&gt; 1 death by old age, 1 utterly unfair early
   death for no known reason (yet), 2 people suicidal during xmastime
   still around, and 1 wedding proposal of a friend accepted by his
   sweety
   Jan 14 07:10:56 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Erm... too facetious?)
   Jan 14 07:11:38 &lt;jimregan&gt; Wow. Wedding proposal accepted? You really
   are more morbid than me :)
   Jan 14 07:11:57 &lt;editorgal&gt; jimregan: the king of ose died a few years
   ago of brain cancer
   Jan 14 07:12:24 &lt;jimregan&gt; Gah...
   Jan 14 07:12:26 &lt;editorgal&gt; aww that's not morbid - they're both sweet
   people
   Jan 14 07:12:42 &lt;jimregan&gt; Fitting...
   Jan 14 07:12:48 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh yeah and a couple who'd broken up got
   back together over xmas
   Jan 14 07:12:55 &lt;jimregan&gt; but still... at the same time... erm...
   fitting
   Jan 14 07:13:11 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah. Quite common.
   Jan 14 07:13:18 &lt;jimregan&gt; You get better presents that way
   Jan 14 07:13:34 &lt;editorgal&gt; um
   Jan 14 07:13:45 &lt;editorgal&gt; I don't think that's how it worked out,
   but nevermind
   Jan 14 07:13:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh, did I forget to mention I'm in cynical
   mode?

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 14 05:22:38 &lt;editorgal&gt; bye ben
   Jan 14 05:23:05 &lt;jimregan&gt; OK, so aside from the morbid ending...
   Jan 14 06:32:42 --&gt; creighton (~jason@ppp46.polson.net) has joined
   #tag-chat
   Jan 14 06:33:05 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hi Jason
   Jan 14 06:33:11 &lt;editorgal&gt; hi jason
   Jan 14 06:33:41 &lt;creighton&gt; Hi Jason. (Oh, wait...) :-)
   Jan 14 06:34:06 &lt;editorgal&gt; "say goodnight, gracie" &lt;gracie&gt;
   goodnight, gracie.
   Jan 14 06:34:38 &lt;jimregan&gt; When I think expresso, I think raw
   expresso, not... non caffeinated stuff
   Jan 14 06:34:41 * editorgal breaks out the espresso cups
   Jan 14 06:34:48 &lt;editorgal&gt; not expresso
   Jan 14 06:34:50 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Where 'stuff' is to be said with much
   disdain)
   Jan 14 06:35:01 &lt;editorgal&gt; expresso's probably some courier brand
   name in podunk iowa
   Jan 14 06:35:07 &lt;jimregan&gt; Espresso, sorry
   Jan 14 06:35:12 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeesh.
   Jan 14 06:35:14 &lt;creighton&gt; Whoa! non caffeinated espresso?
   Jan 14 06:35:32 &lt;jimregan&gt; No.... Heather was telling me about her
   bowl size cups
   Jan 14 06:35:35 &lt;editorgal&gt; and /me thought diet jolt cola was
   antimatter
   Jan 14 06:35:37 &lt;jimregan&gt; "For espresso?"
   Jan 14 06:35:43 &lt;editorgal&gt; yeah
   Jan 14 06:35:48 &lt;creighton&gt; jimregan: Yeah, spelling will kill you.
   I'll ship you a dictionary via Fed-Es. :)
   Jan 14 06:36:13 &lt;jimregan&gt; capuccino == espresso drink... but with
   non-caffeinated crap
   Jan 14 06:36:22 &lt;editorgal&gt; 1 cup standard coffee, N shots espresso,
   additives per (latte cappucino mocha wtf etc)
   Jan 14 06:36:34 &lt;editorgal&gt; no way
   Jan 14 06:36:38 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Though if they ever manage to make
   caffeinated cream...)
   Jan 14 06:36:40 &lt;editorgal&gt; it isn't coffee without caffiene
   Jan 14 06:36:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hey, hey, hey
   Jan 14 06:37:08 &lt;jimregan&gt; Noone was talking about decaf, just a
   simple misunderstanding
   Jan 14 06:37:12 &lt;jimregan&gt; Stay calm!
   Jan 14 06:37:14 &lt;editorgal&gt; good
   Jan 14 06:37:19 &lt;editorgal&gt; just so we have that stright
   Jan 14 06:37:25 &lt;editorgal&gt; +ai
   Jan 14 06:37:27 &lt;jimregan&gt; Eep! I said the 'd' word
   Jan 14 06:37:50 * editorgal commits jimmy to 40 lashes with a wet
   noodle
   Jan 14 06:37:50 &lt;jimregan&gt; De (/me spits at the ground) caf
   Jan 14 06:37:56 &lt;jimregan&gt; much better
   Jan 14 06:38:07 &lt;jimregan&gt; brb
   Jan 14 06:38:16 &lt;jimregan&gt; (all this talk of caffeine)
   Jan 14 06:38:54 &lt;creighton&gt; I don't drink coffee. Never tried it. I
   see too many people who just can't go without the stuff, I don't think
   I want jokes made about "not really awake until the second cup of
   coffee" to be *true*. But I mentally file "Capuccino" under "Something
   weird that coffee people like. See also: Mocha, Frappe, etc..."
   Jan 14 06:38:59 &lt;editorgal&gt; darnit, wasn't very lit here today, and I
   want the photos I'm going to merge in similar lighting
   Jan 14 06:39:15 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh well
   Jan 14 06:39:22 &lt;editorgal&gt; I mostly drink tea...
   Jan 14 06:39:30 &lt;editorgal&gt; coffee I savor, tea I drink
   Jan 14 06:39:47 &lt;editorgal&gt; I don't put up with icky coffee either
   Jan 14 06:40:53 &lt;editorgal&gt; Mocha = method to get the maximum amount
   of stimulant into a sysadmin's body, consisting of espresso,
   chocolate, cream, with whipped cream on top, chocolate powder for
   cuteness optional.
   Jan 14 06:41:20 &lt;editorgal&gt; cute lil shavings of a chocolate brick
   also pleasantly acceptable
   Jan 14 06:42:05 &lt;editorgal&gt; anyways
   Jan 14 06:42:19 &lt;editorgal&gt; jason, what do you actually prefer to
   drink?
   Jan 14 06:42:38 * editorgal could just go back and look at the thread,
   but..
   Jan 14 06:43:14 &lt;creighton&gt; You mean, if someone asked me, "What would
   you like to drink? Come on, anything at all!" what would I want?
   Jan 14 06:43:23 &lt;editorgal&gt; sure
   Jan 14 06:43:31 &lt;creighton&gt; Hmm
   Jan 14 06:44:19 &lt;creighton&gt; This is going to sound weird...
   Jan 14 06:44:36 * editorgal grins, weird's fine by *me* ...
   Jan 14 06:44:47 &lt;jimregan&gt; Fine by me, and I stock the bar
   Jan 14 06:45:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; What? Human blood?
   Jan 14 06:45:37 &lt;jimregan&gt; I got some, y'know... any blood group in
   particular?
   Jan 14 06:45:37 &lt;editorgal&gt; smurf juice?
   Jan 14 06:45:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hee hee hee
   Jan 14 06:46:02 &lt;jimregan&gt; (sorry, spent the evening watching some
   really juvenile stuff)
   Jan 14 06:46:25 * editorgal looks up a vendor ID number for Gargamel
   Jan 14 06:46:38 &lt;editorgal&gt; says he's out, lil buggers keep getting
   away.
   Jan 14 06:46:43 &lt;creighton&gt; But I really like a good lemonade. No, not
   *real* lemonade. The stuff you can order at a restaurant, or buy in
   2-Liter bottles at Wal-Mart. Probably loaded with Bad Stuff, but a
   nice smooth taste, which I tend to prefer over carbonated soft drinks.
   Jan 14 06:47:12 &lt;jimregan&gt; Lemonade?
   Jan 14 06:47:14 &lt;jimregan&gt; OUT!!
   Jan 14 06:47:16 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 14 06:47:24 &lt;editorgal&gt; right, one high fructose corn syrup laden
   something lemony with yellow coloring coming up.
   Jan 14 06:47:32 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hey!
   Jan 14 06:47:36 &lt;creighton&gt; editorgal: That's the spirit! :)
   Jan 14 06:47:47 &lt;jimregan&gt; That's my damned bar!
   Jan 14 06:47:50 &lt;editorgal&gt; most of the stuff you can get at
   restaurants here came from lemons. sorry bought that jason
   Jan 14 06:48:11 &lt;creighton&gt; "damned"? What did it do?
   Jan 14 06:48:11 &lt;editorgal&gt; he didn't say he wanted a drink, that
   makes it my stock
   Jan 14 06:48:23 * jimregan finds something sufficiently chemical
   laden, with a hint of cirtus
   Jan 14 06:48:25 &lt;creighton&gt; editorgal: Sorry, brain's gone fuzzy.
   Where's "here"?
   Jan 14 06:48:32 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Note: not 'citrus')
   Jan 14 06:48:34 * editorgal giggles
   Jan 14 06:48:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; The bar!
   Jan 14 06:48:56 * jimregan points at the kegs and spirit bottles
   Jan 14 06:49:00 &lt;editorgal&gt; that's what you get for drinking what
   Jimmy put in front of you...
   Jan 14 06:49:18 &lt;editorgal&gt; as for where *I* am...
   Jan 14 06:49:20 &lt;editorgal&gt; er
   Jan 14 06:49:23 * jimregan grabs a lemonade
   Jan 14 06:49:34 * jimregan grabs a wutka
   Jan 14 06:49:48 * editorgal skips the mental nav specs, them probably
   not being what he wants to here.
   Jan 14 06:50:12 &lt;editorgal&gt; especially with the under destruction
   signs in there :/
   Jan 14 06:50:31 &lt;jimregan&gt; (wutka == vodka, but moreso)
   Jan 14 06:50:45 * editorgal is presently typing from a chair in
   northern california

<p><strong>From #tag-chat 
</strong></p> 
<p></strong></p>

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 04 06:37:31 &lt;jimregan&gt; I've only ever given one presentation, ever
   Jan 04 06:37:46 &lt;jimregan&gt; (And brought the draft version instead of
   the final)
   Jan 04 06:37:52 &lt;editorgal&gt; I've given a stack of them and made
   presentation software for more
   Jan 04 06:37:56 &lt;editorgal&gt; whoops
   Jan 04 06:37:58 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'm a public speaking disaster :)
   Jan 04 06:38:20 * editorgal loans jimmy a copy of "Technically
   Speaking"
   Jan 04 06:38:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; At the hustings when I went for a student's
   union position, I got a big laugh
   Jan 04 06:39:05 &lt;jimregan&gt; Looked down at my hand, noticed I still had
   a lit cigarette in it, and flicked it from the podium
   Jan 04 06:39:38 &lt;editorgal&gt; lol
   Jan 04 06:39:39 &lt;jimregan&gt; Had to ad lib my speech, 'cos I had my cue
   cards upside down &amp; out of order
   Jan 04 06:39:49 &lt;jimregan&gt; Kept it to 3 sentences :)
   Jan 04 06:39:57 &lt;editorgal&gt; I have a trick for that part
   Jan 04 06:40:23 &lt;editorgal&gt; punch holes in the corner, and run one of
   these round keychain loops through them
   Jan 04 06:40:24 &lt;jimregan&gt; Threw those off the podium too. Made it
   part of the speech
   Jan 04 06:40:32 &lt;editorgal&gt; that way they're stuck in order
   Jan 04 06:40:38 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh well, ok
   Jan 04 06:41:01 &lt;editorgal&gt; especially if it's a feature in this crowd
   to be short er, ahem, brief about it
   Jan 04 06:41:10 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah
   Jan 04 06:41:17 &lt;editorgal&gt; "short" here is sometimes used to mean a
   cross attitude
   Jan 04 06:41:27 &lt;editorgal&gt; "don't be short with me"
   Jan 04 06:41:45 &lt;editorgal&gt; ^ == adult version of "you meanybutts stop
   it"
   Jan 04 06:41:30 &lt;jimregan&gt; First of the 3 sentences was "Fuck it, I'm
   not going to waste your time"
   Jan 04 06:41:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; heh
   Jan 04 06:42:00 &lt;editorgal&gt; heh bet that got good attention
   Jan 04 06:42:25 &lt;editorgal&gt; so did you get the job or not?
   Jan 04 06:42:37 &lt;jimregan&gt; Dunno. I was the only person going for the
   job, so all I needed was to get the basic amount of votes
   Jan 04 06:42:52 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh, I got the job. Well, position.
   Jan 04 06:42:59 &lt;editorgal&gt; you don't know if you got it??
   Jan 04 06:43:01 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh ok
   Jan 04 06:43:12 &lt;jimregan&gt; "Job" to me implies payment.
   Jan 04 06:43:15 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh you don't know if what you did really
   counted as good
   Jan 04 06:43:17 &lt;editorgal&gt; ah
   Jan 04 06:43:25 &lt;editorgal&gt; I worked with the student union
   Jan 04 06:43:40 &lt;editorgal&gt; but as a tutor; we did get paid, just
   wretchedly.
   Jan 04 06:43:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; :(
   Jan 04 06:43:58 &lt;editorgal&gt; with a shush on telling students needing
   tutoring how much we're paid
   Jan 04 06:44:17 &lt;editorgal&gt; don't want to discourage people from
   offering or seeking help by discussing money
   Jan 04 06:44:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; It did annoy me that I my president was
   less organised than me.
   Jan 04 06:44:24 &lt;editorgal&gt; just get to the topic
   Jan 04 06:45:09 &lt;editorgal&gt; I did fine at that of course
   Jan 04 06:45:19 &lt;jimregan&gt; There's a college quiz show on TV here...
   he told me we were to submit a team the Monday of the week it was due
   Jan 04 06:45:21 &lt;editorgal&gt; english and higher math and computing
   Jan 04 06:45:39 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh that's a lot of help
   Jan 04 06:45:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah. Due Wednesday.
   Jan 04 06:46:30 &lt;jimregan&gt; The vice president was fairly neurotic
   anyway, and gave out to me because she knew he wouldn't pay attention
   :)

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 15 13:30:47 &lt;jimregan&gt; Though these days we tend to get the
   American tourist leprechauns
   Jan 15 13:30:57 &lt;jimregan&gt; With their bad accents
   Jan 15 13:31:07 &lt;jimregan&gt; No bloody gold either
   Jan 15 13:31:19 &lt;jimregan&gt; Keep trying to fob us off with rubbish
   cereal
   Jan 15 13:32:54 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :)
   Jan 15 13:33:03 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I like accents...
   Jan 15 13:33:14 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Which kind of Irish one do you have?
   Jan 15 13:33:22 &lt;jimregan&gt; Erm...
   Jan 15 13:33:36 &lt;jimregan&gt; I have a fairly flat southern accent.
   Jan 15 13:33:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; Depends on who I'm talking to.
   Jan 15 13:34:01 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Why?
   Jan 15 13:34:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; More use of idiom around certain people
   Jan 15 13:34:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Because they don't really 'get' standard
   English)
   Jan 15 13:34:43 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Oh. I suppose we're all guilty of that.
   Jan 15 13:34:55 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; That's OK, neither do the Americans. :P
   Jan 15 13:34:58 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh. I make no bones about being a
   pretentious git
   Jan 15 13:35:17 * thomas_adam wasn't going to mention it.
   Jan 15 13:35:27 &lt;jimregan&gt; It's actually something I've been giving
   thought to.
   Jan 15 13:35:43 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Being a git? :)
   Jan 15 13:35:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; A coworker and I are going to teach each
   other languages
   Jan 15 13:35:58 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nah. Don't need to think about that, it
   comes naturally.
   Jan 15 13:36:14 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Hehehe.
   Jan 15 13:36:26 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; You could teach other languages, aye.
   Jan 15 13:37:09 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I know that over here, if one wants to
   teach at a University -- no teaching experience is needed. In fact,
   apart from one or two, most of my lecturers are people whom have been
   in industry for ages.
   Jan 15 13:37:10 &lt;jimregan&gt; He wants to improve his English. It doesn't
   really help that there are three main versions he'd have to be
   familiar with
   Jan 15 13:37:28 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah. Tend to be better lecturers for it.
   Jan 15 13:38:13 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; ... then there are those who are
   clueless.
   Jan 15 13:38:16 &lt;jimregan&gt; The academic types tend to be a bit strange
   Jan 15 13:38:26 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Ivory towers, and all that.
   Jan 15 13:38:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; "So we were doing research into foo..."
   Jan 15 13:38:44 &lt;jimregan&gt; "Why?"
   Jan 15 13:38:47 &lt;jimregan&gt; "Erm...."
   Jan 15 13:39:22 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh. Media Lab Europe shut down.
   Jan 15 13:39:33 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; It's not even that -- there's one
   lecturer who used to be in the army, and post that, did acting. It
   shows, too. He doesn't know shit. Quite how he got a job lecturing, I
   don't know.
   Jan 15 13:40:40 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh. We had to do a course in basic
   office-type applications in first year. Our lecturer just about knew
   how to use Word...
   Jan 15 13:40:53 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :)
   Jan 15 13:41:36 &lt;jimregan&gt; A friend of mine is doing his masters, and
   was giving lecturing work.
   Jan 15 13:42:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; He said that every lecture, he's guaranteed
   to 'zone'
   Jan 15 13:42:12 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Zone?
   Jan 15 13:42:13 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; (brb)
   Jan 15 13:42:27 &lt;jimregan&gt; He'll start talking about something, tune
   out, tune back in and wonder what the hell he's talking about.
   Jan 15 13:42:43 &lt;jimregan&gt; His students loved his lectures, for the
   comedy appeal.
   Jan 15 13:43:12 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Aww.
   Jan 15 13:43:47 &lt;jimregan&gt; Mostly it'd be telling them exactly how
   useless aspect X of the course was
   Jan 15 13:44:17 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :D
   Jan 15 13:44:39 &lt;jimregan&gt; I think he was giving lectures on software
   design techniques, so he had plenty of ammunition
   Jan 15 13:45:11 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Not that he ever stuck to his own subject)
   Jan 15 13:45:51 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Hehehehehe.
   Jan 15 13:45:54 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; He sounds cool.
   Jan 15 13:46:28 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah. He's the type who studies religions
   so he can annoy their adherents in depth.
   Jan 15 13:46:56 &lt;jimregan&gt; "Oh, you can't fully appreciate the Quran
   unless you're read it in Arabic"
   Jan 15 13:47:05 &lt;jimregan&gt; "What, bullshit doesn't translate?"
   Jan 15 13:47:12 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :)
   Jan 15 13:47:42 &lt;jimregan&gt; He decided to become a Buddhist because
   "you can tag on another religion"
   Jan 15 13:48:07 &lt;jimregan&gt; He loooves telling the Jehovah's Witnesses
   that he'll convert
   Jan 15 13:48:16 &lt;jimregan&gt; because it doesn't conflict with Buddhism
   Jan 15 13:48:33 &lt;jimregan&gt; "But... but...."
   Jan 15 13:48:44 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; LOL!
   Jan 15 13:49:12 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh. Once he wrote a program in Java and in
   8088 asm to show that the 8088 version was faster
   Jan 15 13:49:28 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; He didn't need to do that...
   Jan 15 13:49:34 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; It was a foregone conclusion.
   Jan 15 13:49:35 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Again, picking on a religious fanatic)
   Jan 15 13:50:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; I remember being highly amused when I saw
   the quote about you being the type who'd write his own operating
   system.
   Jan 15 13:50:54 &lt;jimregan&gt; 'Cos this guy actually did it.
   Jan 15 13:51:21 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I never would.
   Jan 15 13:51:27 &lt;jimregan&gt; Some NT apologist lecturer really got to
   him, so he wrote it for his thesis.
   Jan 15 13:51:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; Just so he could say "see, there's no good
   reason for NT to do [whatever it was]"
   Jan 15 13:52:00 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :D
   Jan 15 13:52:28 &lt;jimregan&gt; It's strange how the world works.
   Jan 15 13:52:53 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Indeed.
   Jan 15 13:52:54 &lt;jimregan&gt; Once he'd decided to write about that, he
   stumbled across a bunch of books about OS design at a book fair
   Jan 15 13:53:27 &lt;jimregan&gt; And so did another friend: "You wouldn't by
   any chance be interested in these?"
   Jan 15 13:53:41 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :))
   Jan 15 13:54:01 &lt;jimregan&gt; The other day, I had my first serious
   thought about needing to earn more
   Jan 15 13:54:12 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Oh?
   Jan 15 13:54:20 &lt;jimregan&gt; 10 minutes later, one of the senior
   operatives told me he was changing jobs
   Jan 15 13:54:45 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Ah.
   Jan 15 13:55:06 &lt;jimregan&gt; I didn't say a word to anyone about it, the
   universe just dumped it in my lap.
   Jan 15 13:55:24 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; What would you do about another job?
   Jan 15 13:55:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; You mean working elsewhere, or going for
   this job?
   Jan 15 13:56:02 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'm not really ready to move on to
   somewhere else.
   Jan 15 13:56:24 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Hmm.
   Jan 15 13:57:11 &lt;jimregan&gt; I mean, I could go get another job,
   possibly quite easily
   Jan 15 13:57:34 &lt;jimregan&gt; But I decided to use this job as a learning
   experience, and I still have something to learn.
   Jan 15 13:57:59 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; But to what end? It seems like a horrid
   place.
   Jan 15 13:58:01 &lt;jimregan&gt; It's just a feeling, but that feeling has
   always steered me right in the past.
   Jan 15 13:58:28 &lt;jimregan&gt; Well, everything happens for a reason. (Or
   at least, I'm superstitious enough to believe that)
   Jan 15 13:59:03 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Fatalistic?
   Jan 15 13:59:13 &lt;jimregan&gt; I needed to learn the right kind of
   humility, working where I am has taught me that.
   Jan 15 13:59:39 &lt;jimregan&gt; And I needed to unlearn the wrong kind that
   got me consistently screwed over.
   Jan 15 13:59:55 * thomas_adam nods.
   Jan 15 14:00:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; I've had a very strange week and a half...
   Jan 15 14:00:46 &lt;jimregan&gt; Basically, if I've thought about anything I
   needed, it happened.
   Jan 15 14:02:36 &lt;jimregan&gt; I suppose it's really that I learned to
   attempt things without presuming failure from the start.
   Jan 15 14:03:39 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; That's always a good frame of mind to
   start with
   Jan 15 14:04:47 &lt;jimregan&gt; Well, attempt most things. I think I know
   what I need to do now.

   Jan 16 08:37:42 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh... dear... god...
   Jan 16 08:37:46 &lt;editorgal&gt; with it being an excuse to cross point at

   Jan 16 08:38:12 &lt;jimregan&gt; Look, just because I've been all puppy-like

   Jan 16 08:39:36 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hmm... wonder if there's a teddy bear mod
   for Doom...
   Jan 16 08:39:56 &lt;editorgal&gt; they have a stock white teddy bear they
   put lil t-shirts on.
   Jan 16 08:40:08 &lt;jimregan&gt; I don't play games, but I'd make an

   Jan 16 08:44:36 &lt;jimregan&gt; Grr.
   Jan 16 08:44:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; I was gonna growl back, but the effect is

   Jan 16 08:48:27 &lt;editorgal&gt; there was a teddybear computing services -

   Jan 16 08:48:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh heh.
   Jan 16 08:48:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; I saw 'colony' and jumped to conclusions

   Jan 16 08:49:48 &lt;editorgal&gt; err
   Jan 16 08:50:25 &lt;editorgal&gt; I take that back, according to her TechWeb

   Jan 16 08:58:08 &lt;editorgal&gt; * bear is well defended, he doesn't care.
   Jan 16 08:58:30 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hah.
   Jan 16 08:59:03 * jimregan turns on the full force of his glare.
   Across the globe echoes the sound of children sobbing
   Jan 16 08:59:46 &lt;editorgal&gt; interesting
   Jan 16 09:00:08 &lt;jimregan&gt; ?
   Jan 16 09:00:24 &lt;editorgal&gt; he says he started that project when he
   was ill, and it probably helped him not forget how to program.
   Jan 16 09:02:54 * editorgal bookmarks him
   Jan 16 09:03:41 &lt;editorgal&gt; and alas, there's some windows virus
   called teddybear :(
   Jan 16 09:04:29 &lt;editorgal&gt; hm. a mention on telsa's diary?
   Jan 16 09:04:30 * jimregan feels the urge to torture kittens to repair
   the cutesy balance
   Jan 16 09:05:12 &lt;editorgal&gt; giggle. she has a beeblelbear
   Jan 16 09:05:20 &lt;editorgal&gt; don't panic jimmy
   Jan 16 09:05:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; Groan
   Jan 16 09:05:49 &lt;editorgal&gt; you can always come up with less cutesy
   ideas for covers
   Jan 16 09:06:08 &lt;jimregan&gt; Crucified bear?
   Jan 16 09:06:12 &lt;editorgal&gt; and if I can do the art I might even give
   em the shot what the heck
   Jan 16 09:06:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; }:)
   Jan 16 09:06:25 &lt;editorgal&gt; where's the linux in that?
   Jan 16 09:06:33 &lt;editorgal&gt; xteddy is at least already an app.
   Jan 16 09:07:01 &lt;jimregan&gt; Mmm hmm.
   Jan 16 09:07:31 &lt;editorgal&gt; hmm
   Jan 16 09:19:26 &lt;editorgal&gt; !
   Jan 16 09:19:43 &lt;editorgal&gt; "teddybear housed wireless access point
   400 meter range"
   Jan 16 09:20:00 &lt;editorgal&gt; wrong
   Jan 16 09:20:04 &lt;editorgal&gt; 400 feet
   Jan 16 09:20:23 * editorgal needs to learn to read
   Jan 16 09:20:28 &lt;editorgal&gt; wireless video
   Jan 16 09:20:37 &lt;editorgal&gt; bet it's supposed to be a baby monitor
   Jan 16 09:33:26 &lt;editorgal&gt; right now xteddy's still reading an upside
   down phone book, which looks pretty silly.
   Jan 16 09:33:34 &lt;editorgal&gt; But it is a good save point.
   Jan 16 09:33:55 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)

   Jan 18 20:51:57 * jimregan thought he called in the teddy bear
   exterminator...
   Jan 18 20:52:05 * thomas_adam larts jimregan
   Jan 18 20:52:07 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :(
   Jan 18 20:52:18 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; What's wrong with bears?
   Jan 18 20:52:33 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nothing, as long as they're real bears.
   Jan 18 20:52:51 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; teddy bears, then?
   Jan 18 20:53:07 &lt;jimregan&gt; It's part of my "Just say no to cuteness"
   campaign.
   Jan 18 20:53:22 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :(

   Jan 18 20:54:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hee hee hee
   Jan 18 20:54:47 * editorgal buys jimmy a stuffed cold virus
   Jan 18 20:54:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)))
   Jan 18 20:55:05 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah, the cold virus can get stuffed
   Jan 18 20:55:54 &lt;editorgal&gt; jimregan: there really is a site selling
   plushy viruses.
   Jan 18 20:56:09 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh... dear... God...
   Jan 18 20:56:43 &lt;jimregan&gt; Although a plush 'Bender' or 'Zoidburg'...
   Jan 18 20:57:20 &lt;editorgal&gt; someone in thomas' lug has a plushy ebola.
   Jan 18 20:57:30 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Hmm.
   Jan 18 20:57:35 &lt;jimregan&gt; Aw. Now that I /do/ like.
   Jan 18 20:57:36 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Teddy bears are good.
   Jan 18 20:57:52 &lt;jimregan&gt; "Who's a cute little flesh eating virus?
   You are"
   Jan 18 20:58:56 &lt;editorgal&gt; right
   Jan 18 20:59:01 &lt;editorgal&gt; found his price point
   Jan 18 20:59:03 &lt;editorgal&gt; sold.
   Jan 18 20:59:18 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh. I wonder if it's possible to get a
   plush half-brick
   Jan 18 20:59:30 &lt;editorgal&gt; almost certainly
   Jan 18 20:59:33 &lt;jimregan&gt; (For those people you want to hit with one,
   figuratively)
   Jan 18 20:59:39 &lt;editorgal&gt; in fact, if it isn't I could make one
   Jan 18 20:59:52 &lt;editorgal&gt; my pal Katy (aka Chaos) has a boffer trout
   Jan 18 21:00:19 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah, you told me about that
   Jan 18 21:01:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; I wonder if you can get a "my little
   executioner" toy set?
   Jan 18 21:01:15 &lt;jimregan&gt; An electric chair with a victim that
   /really/ wets itself
   Jan 18 21:01:21 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :|
   Jan 18 21:01:51 &lt;editorgal&gt; jimmy, you're more warped than usual
   today.
   Jan 18 21:01:57 * thomas_adam h4x0rs jimregan's computer and runs
   xteddy indefinitely.
   Jan 18 21:02:08 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 18 21:02:13 &lt;editorgal&gt; but I'm pretty sure I can get you a
   guilotine type cheese slicer from one of the horror shops.
   Jan 18 21:02:15 &lt;jimregan&gt; Why yes, yes I am.
   Jan 18 21:02:27 &lt;jimregan&gt; You can get cigar guilotines too
   Jan 18 21:02:42 &lt;jimregan&gt; Just the right size for Barbie as Marie
   Antoinette
   Jan 18 21:03:41 &lt;editorgal&gt; thomas_adam: that script that andy found
   :D
   Jan 18 21:03:55 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I wouldn't be that cruel.
   Jan 18 21:04:06 &lt;editorgal&gt; hehe
   Jan 18 21:04:14 &lt;editorgal&gt; ok, only if jimmy continues to act up.
   Jan 18 21:04:33 &lt;jimregan&gt; Awww... I'm all curious and shit
   Jan 18 21:04:45 * editorgal grins wickedly
   Jan 18 21:04:54 &lt;jimregan&gt; But I'm out of teddy torture ideas
   Jan 18 21:04:59 &lt;editorgal&gt; &lt;Andy&gt; xteddytakeover ! aggh :)
   Jan 18 21:06:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; So... what's with xteddy getting the cover
   for next month? Is it a Valentines tie-in, or just an "I like xteddy"
   thing?
   Jan 18 21:06:46 &lt;editorgal&gt; it was what I thought of that I have
   baesline partial photo ideas for
   Jan 18 21:06:52 &lt;editorgal&gt; I asked for ideas
   Jan 18 21:07:00 &lt;editorgal&gt; you had something sounded good for march
   Jan 18 21:07:01 &lt;jimregan&gt; Xteddy giving Tux a heart?
   Jan 18 21:07:11 &lt;jimregan&gt; No!
   Jan 18 21:07:11 &lt;editorgal&gt; I hadn't thought of valentines tie in, but
   Jan 18 21:07:16 &lt;jimregan&gt; Damn, gone the wrong way!
   Jan 18 21:07:22 &lt;jimregan&gt; Ermm....
   Jan 18 21:07:28 &lt;editorgal&gt; come to think of it the grab-me cursor
   over xteddy is a little heart. so it could be.
   Jan 18 21:07:35 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Flintgirl. :)
   Jan 18 21:07:39 &lt;editorgal&gt; aww
   Jan 18 21:07:40 &lt;jimregan&gt; ?
   Jan 18 21:07:54 &lt;editorgal&gt; jimmy: my teddybear's girlfriend.
   Jan 18 21:08:06 &lt;editorgal&gt; but there should be some linuxy tie in
   Jan 18 21:08:08 &lt;jimregan&gt; Excuse me for a minute
   Jan 18 21:08:10 &lt;editorgal&gt; xteddy's an app
   Jan 18 21:08:20 * editorgal chuckles
   Jan 18 21:08:33 &lt;jimregan&gt; Sorry, just needed to throw up :-P
   Jan 18 21:14:50 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh. Just stick a bow on the teddybear
   girlfriend's head: "Ms. Xteddy"
   Jan 18 21:15:02 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Wayne's World quote elided)
   Jan 18 21:15:27 &lt;editorgal&gt; xteddy married? better for a june issue.
   Jan 18 21:15:34 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I hope he isn't
   Jan 18 21:15:57 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Because you could say he's having an
   affair, being packaged with all distros...
   Jan 18 21:16:00 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; But he has friends, though.
   Jan 18 21:16:14 &lt;editorgal&gt; anyways no I was just thinking, we
   inaugurate the TAG bar with xteddy reading his newspaper
   Jan 18 21:16:20 &lt;editorgal&gt; LG, of course.
   Jan 18 21:16:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; So... xteddy is polyamourous?
   Jan 18 21:16:44 &lt;thomas_adam&gt;
   http://linuxmafia.com/~n6tadam/fvwm/Ne2.png
   Jan 18 21:16:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; Not in my bleedin' bar!
   Jan 18 21:16:57 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Omnipresent; Ubiquitous.
   Jan 18 21:23:43 &lt;editorgal&gt; xteddy doesn't bleed, jimmy. your bar is
   safe.
   Jan 18 21:24:31 * editorgal imagines xteddy and friends doing the
   'ewoks picnic' thing to the Microsoft campus. hee hee hee
   Jan 18 21:29:42 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :)
   Jan 18 21:29:59 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I changed my .signature file, Jimmy...
   Jan 18 21:30:09 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; "Today's the day that teddy bears have
   their picnic"
   Jan 18 21:30:40 &lt;editorgal&gt; "today's the day the ewoks destroy the
   Empire" :)
   Jan 18 21:37:45 &lt;editorgal&gt; to answer the question as you might have
   preferred to ask it, jimmy
   Jan 18 21:37:57 &lt;editorgal&gt; no, the cover art doesn't have to be
   insanely cute
   Jan 18 21:37:59 * thomas_adam prefers his quote.
   Jan 18 21:38:05 &lt;editorgal&gt; it was just the first two things I thought
   of.
   Jan 18 21:43:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeesh...
   Jan 18 21:44:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hmm... wonder if I should start a Cult of
   Clandestine Satanic Teddybear Murderers
   Jan 18 21:44:37 --- ChanServ gives channel operator status to
   thomas_adam
   Jan 18 21:44:41 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :((
   Jan 18 21:44:49 &lt;jimregan&gt; "I spill the stuffing of this bear in
   tribute to you, Dark Lord"
   Jan 18 21:44:54 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :|
   Jan 18 21:44:55 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 18 21:45:02 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Hmm.
   Jan 18 21:45:05 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I'm special again.
   Jan 18 21:45:12 * thomas_adam lowers himself to jimregan's level.
   Jan 18 21:45:14 --- thomas_adam removes channel operator status from
   thomas_adam
   Jan 18 21:45:18 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 18 21:45:32 &lt;editorgal&gt; aww
   Jan 18 21:45:35 * editorgal hugs thomas
   Jan 18 21:45:39 * editorgal hugs jimmy too
   Jan 18 21:45:43 &lt;jimregan&gt; Gerroff!
   Jan 18 21:45:55 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; jimregan: Do you own a teddy bear?
   Jan 18 21:45:56 * editorgal tickles jimmy mercilessly
   Jan 18 21:45:59 &lt;editorgal&gt; :)
   Jan 18 21:46:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'm sacrificing teddy bears here...
   Jan 18 21:46:17 &lt;jimregan&gt; It's not good for the image to have teddy
   bear lovers hugging you, y'know
   Jan 18 21:46:23 &lt;editorgal&gt; lol
   Jan 18 21:46:27 &lt;editorgal&gt; good ;P
   Jan 18 21:46:30 &lt;jimregan&gt; No, I don't own a teddy
   Jan 18 21:46:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; I did once...
   Jan 18 21:46:47 &lt;jimregan&gt; When I was five.
   Jan 18 21:47:09 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; hi all :)
   Jan 18 21:47:21 * Frodo-NL owns a teddy... two even...
   Jan 18 21:47:28 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Yay!
   Jan 18 21:47:31 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Cue long load of psychobabble crap about
   not having closure with my teddybear lead to my hatred of teddies :)))
   Jan 18 21:48:00 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; and a tweety... and three taz's... and a
   beaver (no, you guys, I mean the animal)
   Jan 18 21:48:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; I take it you're not interested in joining
   my Super Secret Satanic Society(R) then?
   Jan 18 21:48:46 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; oh - and I have a Tux
   Jan 18 21:48:55 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; So do I. :)
   Jan 18 21:49:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; OK, I'll fess up. I used to have a stuffed
   ejog named "Snugglemuffin".
   Jan 18 21:49:33 &lt;jimregan&gt; I hasten to add that I /did not/ choose the
   name
   Jan 18 21:49:46 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; as to my teddies - they can be seen in this
   pic... http://rodolf.com/metsfan.jpg
   Jan 18 21:49:58 &lt;jimregan&gt; Is it a picnic pic?
   Jan 18 21:50:38 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nope... oh well.
   Jan 18 21:51:12 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; and no, Jim, the teddy bear picnic was a
   few days earlier... *G*

   Jan 18 23:47:17 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; That would be the pile of work I'm

   Jan 18 23:47:35 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I've got...
   Jan 18 23:47:46 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; A report due in Monday.
   Jan 18 23:47:52 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Two presentations.
   Jan 18 23:48:02 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Some UML/Java bullshit.
   Jan 18 23:48:06 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Another presentation.
   Jan 18 23:48:09 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Ah, bugger.
   Jan 18 23:48:13 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I forgot about that.
   Jan 18 23:48:41 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Rickeh: How's you?
   Jan 18 23:48:56 &lt;Rickeh&gt; fine :P
   Jan 18 23:49:01 &lt;Rickeh&gt; i had fun with java today
   Jan 18 23:49:09 &lt;Rickeh&gt; wrote a signed motion jpeg viewer applet
   Jan 18 23:49:20 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Don't try and justify it. We both know
   it wasn't fun. :)
   Jan 18 23:49:28 &lt;editorgal&gt; heh
   Jan 18 23:49:47 * Rickeh vaguely remembers something about exceptions
   Jan 18 23:50:11 * editorgal sneaks behind the bar and starts prepping
   the real coffee.
   Jan 18 23:50:27 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; try (..) {..} catch (..) {...} final
   (switchToC) { System.exit(0); }
   Jan 18 23:50:45 &lt;editorgal&gt; heh
   Jan 18 23:52:41 * editorgal fills thomas' cow mug
   Jan 18 23:52:46 &lt;editorgal&gt; milk?
   Jan 18 23:52:49 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Moo.
   Jan 18 23:52:55 * editorgal pours
   Jan 18 23:53:02 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :)
   Jan 18 23:53:03 &lt;editorgal&gt; there ya go
   Jan 18 23:53:04 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Thanks.
   Jan 18 23:53:09 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Rickeh: About gettys...
   Jan 18 23:53:25 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Rickeh: Either it is the case you're too
   busy, or that bath you took is sodding long. :)
   Jan 18 23:53:59 &lt;Rickeh&gt; ROFL
   Jan 18 23:54:17 * Rickeh passes thomas_adam the Golgafrincham "B" Ark
   guide to Baths.
   Jan 18 23:54:32 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Heh.
   Jan 18 23:54:32 &lt;Rickeh&gt; I've had shedloads.
   Jan 18 23:54:39 &lt;Rickeh&gt; I've recently renovated the bathroom and
   toilet,
   Jan 18 23:54:43 &lt;Rickeh&gt; I've just got an iMac up and running
   Jan 18 23:55:04 &lt;Rickeh&gt; I've recently purchased two games consoles
   and wired them thru a data switchbox to my TV via SCART
   Jan 18 23:55:06 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Somehow the renovation of the toilet and
   an iMac are related, aren't they...
   Jan 18 23:55:15 &lt;Rickeh&gt; i've got a media PC to furnish with a 30GB HD
   Jan 18 23:55:20 &lt;Rickeh&gt; no :P
   Jan 18 23:55:30 &lt;Rickeh&gt; a new laptop that requires a HD transplant
   from the old laptop

   Jan 18 23:55:41 &lt;Rickeh&gt; and, at the bottom of the list: gettys.
   Jan 18 23:55:48 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Ah, cool.
   Jan 18 23:55:59 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; As long as it is not top priority.
   Jan 18 23:56:30 &lt;editorgal&gt; bob-lad: what'll you have?
   Jan 18 23:56:52 * editorgal pours myself a nice strong coffee too.
   Jan 18 23:59:50 &lt;Rickeh&gt; thomas_adam: oh, and when you get a moment
   from scaling Mount Kilaminjava, we need to go to the pub.
   Jan 19 00:00:35 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Chin-chin.
   Jan 19 00:01:25 &lt;editorgal&gt; minimum java? oooh
   Jan 19 00:02:30 &lt;Rickeh&gt; kill-a-min-java
   Jan 19 00:02:32 &lt;Rickeh&gt; min being minute
   Jan 19 00:02:34 &lt;Rickeh&gt; MANY minutes.
   Jan 19 00:02:50 &lt;jimregan&gt; Pftt. Kill nothing.
   Jan 19 00:03:05 &lt;jimregan&gt; It also violates the corpse.
   Jan 19 00:05:09 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Sorry. Been getting too much into this
   Satanic Teddybear Cult idea)
   Jan 19 00:05:49 &lt;editorgal&gt; hey. this is a family zine.
   Jan 19 00:06:12 &lt;jimregan&gt; Satanists have families too.
   Jan 19 00:06:22 &lt;jimregan&gt; And occasionally refrain from sacrificing
   them too!
   Jan 19 00:06:51 &lt;editorgal&gt; the last unicorn&gt; there comes a time when
   the witch must sacrifice her own liver, and not expect to get it back.
   Jan 19 00:07:25 &lt;jimregan&gt; Cool. You've given me an idea
   Jan 19 00:08:10 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'll start an Irish Satanic Cult, where you
   have to sacrifice your own liver through the ritualistic drinking of
   way too much booze
   Jan 19 00:08:54 &lt;jimregan&gt; The tithes should see me a millionaire by
   2007

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 19 00:29:14 &lt;editorgal&gt; but thomas and I are pretty much always
   here
   Jan 19 00:29:32 &lt;editorgal&gt; and now that many of the gang pop by more
   often
   Jan 19 00:29:43 &lt;editorgal&gt; Jimmy added the bar and snuck in a
   jukebox.
   Jan 19 00:29:52 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I want Mike Orr in here. :)
   Jan 19 00:30:02 &lt;editorgal&gt; he's at work.
   Jan 19 00:30:05 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; So? :)
   Jan 19 00:30:15 &lt;jkarns&gt; gotta get some herbie hancock on that 'box,
   then!
   Jan 19 00:30:27 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I'm sure he could use PySlither to get
   here. :P
   Jan 19 00:32:42 * jkarns wonders what PySlither is, and figures it's a
   metal band or something
   Jan 19 00:34:03 * jkarns gets it - a python based irc client ... \o/
   Jan 19 00:34:15 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; jkarns: A fictitous python script Mike
   Orr might write to get on IRC from work. Py for Python, and 'Slither'
   as in Snake, slippery.
   Jan 19 00:35:23 &lt;jkarns&gt; .. as in ben's recent remark about a
   'slithery python script' ..
   Jan 19 00:35:27 * jkarns nods
   Jan 19 00:35:41 * jimregan recites the fell incantation that opens the
   door to the good stuff
   Jan 19 00:35:55 &lt;jimregan&gt; Drinks anyone?
   Jan 19 00:36:12 &lt;jkarns&gt; cold bass ale!
   Jan 19 00:36:19 &lt;jimregan&gt; Coming up
   Jan 19 00:36:23 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; jimregan: Barkeep? Damn slow.
   Jan 19 00:36:31 * jimregan slides it down the bar
   Jan 19 00:36:41 * jimregan sweeps up the pieces of the glass
   Jan 19 00:36:49 &lt;jimregan&gt; Gotta get a hang of that
   Jan 19 00:36:51 * jkarns fetches
   Jan 19 00:37:03 * jimregan hands over this one carefully
   Jan 19 00:37:13 &lt;jkarns&gt; oops, ... the dog will drink it ...
   Jan 19 00:37:33 &lt;jkarns&gt; thankya ..
   Jan 19 00:37:35 &lt;jimregan&gt; Watzamocha anyone?
   Jan 19 00:38:50 &lt;jimregan&gt; Or freshly ground, freshly irradiated
   coffee?
   Jan 19 00:39:12 * jimregan pats his new particle accelerator
   Jan 19 00:39:22 &lt;jkarns&gt; yeah, some that's been through at least 10
   airport checkpoints
   Jan 19 00:39:42 &lt;editorgal&gt; heh
   Jan 19 00:40:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nah. No weapons grade coffee yet. Waiting
   for it to come through LA
   Jan 19 00:41:02 &lt;jimregan&gt; (When you hear about Arizona Bay in the
   news, you'll know it's here)
   Jan 19 00:41:15 &lt;jkarns&gt; doncha just love it when they run all your
   food and medicine through those airport irradiators?
   Jan 19 00:41:16 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heather, you may wish to consider moving
   Jan 19 00:41:42 &lt;editorgal&gt; back to LA so I can be closer to my
   coffee?
   Jan 19 00:42:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; No... about 3 timezones away
   Jan 19 00:42:09 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh I already did that
   Jan 19 00:42:18 &lt;editorgal&gt; thomas noticed I darn near live in his.
   Jan 19 00:42:20 &lt;jimregan&gt; /Someone/ will drop the coffee, I'm sure...
   Jan 19 00:42:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah, but Thomas pretty much makes up his
   timezone as he goes along.
   Jan 19 00:43:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah, yeah. You heard me - the kettle's
   black.
   Jan 19 00:43:42 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; GMT
   Jan 19 00:43:43 &lt;jkarns&gt; mine's GMT, greenwich mean twilight
   Jan 19 00:44:26 &lt;jkarns&gt; .. RIP, rod sterling ...
   Jan 19 00:45:09 &lt;jimregan&gt; I was in "Jimmy Mean Time" earlier, but
   I've lightened up
   Jan 19 00:45:42 &lt;jkarns&gt; your SO will 'preciate that
   Jan 19 00:48:10 &lt;jimregan&gt; SO? NO more like.
   Jan 19 00:49:01 &lt;editorgal&gt; jimregan: that pretty much describes me
   too.
   Jan 19 00:51:10 &lt;jimregan&gt; Eh? I haven't decided what I want the 'N'
   to stand for yet
   Jan 19 00:51:35 &lt;editorgal&gt; Nsignificant?
   Jan 19 00:51:58 &lt;jimregan&gt; Non-existant

   having
   Jan 19 03:40:46 &lt;okopnik&gt; Oh, good idea. I should have something...
   I'm getting a bit dry. BRB.
   Jan 19 03:41:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yowza! Coffee time!
   Jan 19 03:46:02 * jimregan kickstarts the jukebox
   Jan 19 03:46:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; Some Tool, I think.
   Jan 19 03:46:36 * jimregan puts on "Parabol" &amp; "Parabola"
   Jan 19 03:48:24 &lt;okopnik&gt; One thing about a Russian household...
   people would *kill* you if you tried to starve to death. :)
   Jan 19 03:48:56 &lt;okopnik&gt; I went downstairs to get something to drink,
   and came back with a plate of food.
   Jan 19 03:49:04 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh.
   Jan 19 03:49:56 &lt;okopnik&gt; Never mind that it's awesome food that I
   can't get while I'm at home, darn it!
   Jan 19 03:50:08 &lt;okopnik&gt; It's just... it's just... YUMMY. :)
   Jan 19 03:50:28 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 19 03:51:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; My one tiny taste of Polish food left me
   curious.
   Jan 19 03:51:10 &lt;okopnik&gt; My sister-in-law is an *amazing* cook - and
   I say that as a pretty damn good cook myself.
   Jan 19 03:51:50 &lt;jimregan&gt; It's pretty difficult to get interesting
   food around here.
   Jan 19 03:52:34 &lt;okopnik&gt; New York, you
   Jan 19 03:52:46 &lt;okopnik&gt; d have the opposite "problem":
   Jan 19 03:53:07 &lt;okopnik&gt; you can't _find_ boring food around here if
   you searched for it.
   Jan 19 03:53:10 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh. Maybe after I get my promotion &amp; can
   afford the the trip
   Jan 19 03:53:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; I start into it unofficially next week,
   officially pending the posting of the job opening
   Jan 19 03:54:17 &lt;jimregan&gt; Six month probationary period, but after
   that my pay goes up ~50%
   Jan 19 03:54:38 &lt;okopnik&gt; Very much the foodie town - I mean,
   Italians, Russians, and Jews? Whew. Corned beef sandwiches they have
   to use a forklift to deliver to your table... and the owner is likely
   to commit suicide if you can finish it.
   Jan 19 03:54:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 19 03:55:13 &lt;okopnik&gt; Into it... which it? (and congrats if it is
   what I think)
   Jan 19 03:55:33 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'm taking over as a senior operative
   Jan 19 03:55:44 &lt;okopnik&gt; Of?
   Jan 19 03:55:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; Erm... a line supervisor, basically.
   Jan 19 03:56:25 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'll be taught to drive a forklift, which
   is the cool part for me :)
   Jan 19 03:56:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; One of the things that's been keeping me in
   this job is the determination to be promoted before I left.
   Jan 19 03:56:50 &lt;okopnik&gt; Well hey, cool beans! Get me a corned beef
   samwish, will ya? :)
   Jan 19 03:56:56 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 19 03:57:24 &lt;jimregan&gt; Next thing is to record and release some
   music (this week)
   Jan 19 03:57:30 &lt;jimregan&gt; Then, quit smoking.
   Jan 19 03:57:33 &lt;okopnik&gt; YAY!
   Jan 19 03:57:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; Then this penitant portion of my life is at
   a close, and I can move on.
   Jan 19 03:57:52 &lt;okopnik&gt; Go, Jimmy! (and lots of other supportive
   noises)
   Jan 19 03:57:55 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 19 03:58:49 &lt;okopnik&gt; Hey, man, I'm all for friends improving
   their lives.
   Jan 19 03:59:37 &lt;jimregan&gt; I came across a link to the Tao Te Ching,
   courtesy of Raj, and it had exactly the missing piece to my personal
   puzzle
   Jan 19 03:59:44 &lt;okopnik&gt; ?
   Jan 19 04:00:23 &lt;okopnik&gt; Which particular piece?
   Jan 19 04:00:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; Basically, that the usefulness of a bowl, a
   room, etc. comes from the emptiness within.
   Jan 19 04:00:30 &lt;okopnik&gt; Ah. YES.
   Jan 19 04:00:47 &lt;okopnik&gt; Definitely familiar with that one; rang me
   like a bell when I read it.
   Jan 19 04:01:26 &lt;jimregan&gt; Well, I had a few days before that done
   some intense introspection, and ejected the black hole that had been
   there.
   Jan 19 04:01:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; Only to find a new emptiness. That quote
   put it in perspective.
   Jan 19 04:02:16 &lt;okopnik&gt; [Nod] Qualitatively different emptiness.
   Jan 19 04:02:43 &lt;jimregan&gt; It wasn't so much that I got rid of an
   emptiness; I got rid of the walls around it
   Jan 19 04:02:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; And got some great lyrics in the process :)
   Jan 19 04:03:27 &lt;okopnik&gt; Hey, [thread tangle]!
   Jan 19 04:03:32 &lt;jimregan&gt; ?
   Jan 19 04:03:39 &lt;okopnik&gt; Have you read much in a way of Polish poets?
   Jan 19 04:03:54 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nope. I'm still learning to pronounce
   Polish.
   Jan 19 04:04:03 &lt;okopnik&gt; Whatsername, Wyszowska or something? Stand
   by a few.
   Jan 19 04:04:04 &lt;jimregan&gt; Fighting misleading tutorial material.
   Jan 19 04:05:06 &lt;jimregan&gt; Trying to learn the basics of linguistics
   so I can understand how the material is framed.
   Jan 19 04:05:40 &lt;okopnik&gt; Wislawa Szymborska
   Jan 19 04:05:52 &lt;okopnik&gt; That's who I was thinking about.
   Jan 19 04:06:13 &lt;jimregan&gt; Plus, I'm going to be teaching my friend
   Pawel English in return for Polish lessons, so I've been putting
   thought into the difficulties Polish speakers have with it
   Jan 19 04:06:32 &lt;okopnik&gt; Pronunciation. :)
   Jan 19 04:06:38 &lt;okopnik&gt; &lt;=&gt;
   Jan 19 04:07:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; Well, I was thinking the dropping of the
   object in sentences, and the lack of a definitive object
   Jan 19 04:07:47 &lt;jimregan&gt; I think the pluperfect has fallen into
   disuse in Polish too
   Jan 19 04:08:09 &lt;okopnik&gt; Ah. Yeah, and the whole articles thing.
   Jan 19 04:08:12 &lt;jimregan&gt; But yeah, pronunciation is a big one.
   Jan 19 04:08:17 &lt;jimregan&gt; Articles thing?
   Jan 19 04:08:50 &lt;okopnik&gt; Yeah - 'a', 'the'... Russians have a
   terrible time with those, as I recall.
   Jan 19 04:08:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah.
   Jan 19 04:09:10 &lt;jimregan&gt; Trying to explain that is going to be fun
   :)
   Jan 19 04:09:54 &lt;okopnik&gt; Pretty much the problem in a nutshell. "What
   the hell arethose things *for*?"
   Jan 19 04:10:57 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh. I think you came up with a good
   example of what it is good for :)
   Jan 19 04:11:11 &lt;jimregan&gt; '/the/ problem'
   Jan 19 04:11:45 &lt;okopnik&gt; What, intonation isn't good enough for you?
   :)
   Jan 19 04:11:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; Then again, Polish is a highly
   context-driven language, so it probably won't seem that way :)
   Jan 19 04:13:24 &lt;jimregan&gt; I've got to make time from some proper
   study, but whenever I have a few moments I look over a few bits and
   pieces and just let it slowly sink in.
   Jan 19 04:14:01 &lt;okopnik&gt; Now that I've mentioned her, I'm looking at
   her poetry in another window. The woman is *strikingly* good.
   Jan 19 04:14:28 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah. I'm looking at one about torture at
   the moment.
   Jan 19 04:15:12 &lt;okopnik&gt; How about this one:

   Jan 19 04:17:37 &lt;jimregan&gt; Rings with what Rick was talking about.
   Jan 19 04:17:59 &lt;okopnik&gt; Yep. That struck me too.
   Jan 19 04:18:16 &lt;jimregan&gt; always good / because they can't be
   otherwise
   Jan 19 04:18:22 &lt;jimregan&gt; That rang with me.
   Jan 19 04:18:26 &lt;okopnik&gt; "better not to know"...
   Jan 19 04:18:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; The demon I defeated recently was that I
   was regarding myself as evil
   Jan 19 04:18:48 &lt;okopnik&gt; Ah. Well, me, I know otherwise. However...
   Jan 19 04:19:06 &lt;okopnik&gt; I don't regard myself as evil in any way...
   Jan 19 04:19:32 &lt;jimregan&gt; Well... I lost my faith at a young age, and
   with my faith questioned, I turned on my morality
   Jan 19 04:19:53 &lt;okopnik&gt; ...just human. And on the average, I must
   say that I'm pretty pleased with the balance; it's better than I would
   have expected.
   Jan 19 04:20:08 &lt;jimregan&gt; I decided long ago that I was capable of
   every evil and despicable act imaginable, and of enjoying them
   Jan 19 04:20:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; It never occurred to me to look at it from
   the point of view that... "hey, I /am/ capable of it, and I know it,
   but I /choose/ not to"
   Jan 19 04:20:45 &lt;okopnik&gt; Hmm. Can't say I've ever believed that last
   part about myself.
   Jan 19 04:21:25 &lt;jimregan&gt; Not because a priest or parent told me not
   to, but because I've checked the scales myself
   Jan 19 04:21:37 &lt;okopnik&gt; [Nod] Which is what differentiates 'evil'
   from simply ignorant.
   Jan 19 04:21:59 &lt;okopnik&gt; If you just don't know, and are doing
   something negative, you're not evil.
   Jan 19 04:22:19 &lt;okopnik&gt; (negative = "really horrible")
   Jan 19 04:22:34 &lt;okopnik&gt; If you *do*, though - different kettle.
   Jan 19 04:22:42 &lt;jimregan&gt; There are circumstances, still, where I
   would kill, but not likely.
   Jan 19 04:23:07 &lt;okopnik&gt; I can think of several in which I would
   kill.
   Jan 19 04:23:17 &lt;okopnik&gt; However, they are all pretty clearly
   defined.
   Jan 19 04:23:49 &lt;okopnik&gt; And I can see the necessity for all of them
   even from a rational frame of mind.
   Jan 19 04:23:52 &lt;jimregan&gt; If anyone ever kills or seriously hurts my
   son, intentionally, they can expect a slow, agonising death
   Jan 19 04:24:16 &lt;okopnik&gt; Something like that would be one, yes.
   Jan 19 04:25:09 &lt;okopnik&gt; I will kill to protect those who are *mine*.
   There aren't many of those, but - yeah, no doubt.
   Jan 19 04:25:42 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh. I noticed a pattern in my life after I
   came to terms with that.
   Jan 19 04:25:52 &lt;okopnik&gt; Hmm?
   Jan 19 04:26:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; I have a need for someone who can act as my
   moral compass.
   Jan 19 04:26:17 &lt;okopnik&gt; Interesting. Why do you think so?
   Jan 19 04:26:33 &lt;jimregan&gt; In school, my friend Paul (my son's
   godfather); in college, Martin; now, Trev.
   Jan 19 04:27:12 &lt;okopnik&gt; So... who makes the ultimate moral decision
   in trusting them to determine your morality? :)
   Jan 19 04:27:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; I've always had at least one geographically
   close friend who has an unshakeable moral sense
   Jan 19 04:27:39 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nah, just someone I can bounce these ideas
   off
   Jan 19 04:28:04 &lt;okopnik&gt; If you can't determine your moral stance,
   how can you determine theirs?
   Jan 19 04:28:09 &lt;jimregan&gt; A solid surface against which to test my
   elasticity
   Jan 19 04:28:28 &lt;okopnik&gt; Ah. Well, sounding boards are good things to
   have.
   Jan 19 04:28:50 &lt;jimregan&gt; The voice of the morality I was brought up
   with is still loud and clear.
   Jan 19 04:28:55 &lt;okopnik&gt; Every guitar I know says so.
   Jan 19 04:29:06 &lt;jimregan&gt; I just need to argue with someone other
   than myself from time to time.
   Jan 19 04:29:35 &lt;okopnik&gt; Sure - I develop and refine my ideas this
   way.
   Jan 19 04:29:35 &lt;jimregan&gt; Though I also recently realised that this
   other voice isn't trying to argue, it's trying to agree.
   Jan 19 04:30:05 &lt;okopnik&gt; In all aspects? That's the part to be
   careful of.
   Jan 19 04:30:13 &lt;jimregan&gt; No.
   Jan 19 04:30:19 &lt;okopnik&gt; (Even - especially - if it is.)
   Jan 19 04:30:49 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'm still capable of being in two minds
   about things.
   Jan 19 04:31:20 &lt;jimregan&gt; It's more a fundamental agreement, that
   these things are the right things to give this sort of consideration
   to, y'know?
   Jan 19 04:31:35 &lt;okopnik&gt; Your morality may/will change with time. A
   fixed morality in a book won't. Revisiting decisions, particularly
   moral ones, is something I see as very important.
   Jan 19 04:32:01 &lt;okopnik&gt; [Nod] The issues themselves, the root ones,
   they don't change much.
   Jan 19 04:32:33 &lt;okopnik&gt; That's why we can read an author from 2000
   years ago and enjoy every twist of the plot.
   Jan 19 04:32:43 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah.
   Jan 19 04:33:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; I've been getting a lot of this stuff
   recently, reading Paulo Coelho, because his books basically use
   archetypes
   Jan 19 04:34:57 &lt;jimregan&gt; Getting past the stumbling block of
   thinking that these things couldn't be that simple was probably the
   most important thing
   Jan 19 04:36:03 &lt;okopnik&gt; :) Man, ain't that the truth!
   Jan 19 04:36:30 &lt;jimregan&gt; It's made me a bit more superstitious
   though :)
   Jan 19 04:37:10 &lt;okopnik&gt; ???
   Jan 19 04:37:34 &lt;jimregan&gt; After I asked my supervisor about getting
   the job, he basically hinted that I would have had the job 6 months
   ago
   Jan 19 04:37:43 &lt;jimregan&gt; If I'd filled out an application form
   Jan 19 04:37:54 &lt;okopnik&gt; [rolling eyes]
   Jan 19 04:38:09 &lt;jimregan&gt; That was something I could have looked at
   negatively, but I'm glad it didn't happen
   Jan 19 04:38:26 &lt;jimregan&gt; If I had, I wouldn't have cut my finger.
   Jan 19 04:38:42 &lt;jimregan&gt; If I hadn't cut my finger, I wouldn't have
   gotten to know Beata
   Jan 19 04:39:20 &lt;jimregan&gt; I wouldn't have had the... coincidence that
   lead to me breaking out of the spiral of self defeatism
   Jan 19 04:39:30 &lt;okopnik&gt; One of the things I had to teach my brother
   today is the one prnciple of salesmanship that's managed to stick in
   my brain: at the end of your pitch, *ASK* for what you want, clearly
   and specifically.
   Jan 19 04:39:56 &lt;jimregan&gt; ?
   Jan 19 04:41:37 &lt;jimregan&gt; Erm... I'm not chasing her anymore
   Jan 19 04:41:44 &lt;okopnik&gt; He was writing a letter to a customer who
   had been dragging their feet on a payment. He did the whole "you owe
   us $BLAH, and you know the payment cycle starts on the $BLAH of the
   month... thank you..."
   Jan 19 04:41:50 &lt;okopnik&gt; What, again? :)
   Jan 19 04:43:02 &lt;jimregan&gt; Well, firstly, I don't have a good leash on
   the inner puppy, but mainly... I owe her the chunk of my soul I
   thought I'd thrown away. If she's happy, I don't want to interfere.
   Jan 19 04:44:56 &lt;okopnik&gt; Jimmy... you don't *owe* ANYBODY even the
   slightest bit of your soul. You can be grateful to people for helping
   you recover or discover it, but it's totally *yours*, in any way that
   can possibly count. Responsibility and ownership, complete.
   Jan 19 04:45:10 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 19 04:45:17 &lt;jimregan&gt; Thanks Ben.
   Jan 19 04:45:37 &lt;okopnik&gt; Hey, I get protective of my friends. Even
   from them. :)
   Jan 19 04:45:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah, fuck it. That was a classic example
   of puppy speak, wasn't it?
   Jan 19 04:45:58 &lt;okopnik&gt; :)))
   Jan 19 04:46:15 &lt;jimregan&gt; And I said /if/, didn't I?
   Jan 19 04:46:19 &lt;okopnik&gt; Didn't take you long to get past it, did it?
   Jan 19 04:46:36 &lt;okopnik&gt; :) You did.
   Jan 19 04:46:43 &lt;jimregan&gt; I told you the two parts weren't in
   complete agreement.
   Jan 19 04:46:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 19 04:47:07 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nah, I found out who her boyfriend is
   today.
   Jan 19 04:47:28 &lt;okopnik&gt; [shrug] What, did they have perfection on
   sale at your local market this week? You're not required to have that
   in stock, either.
   Jan 19 04:47:57 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hey, my flaws are my best parts!
   Jan 19 04:48:08 &lt;okopnik&gt; :)
   Jan 19 04:48:38 &lt;jimregan&gt; "She's with /that/ dipshit?"
   Jan 19 04:48:56 &lt;okopnik&gt; [laugh]
   Jan 19 04:49:19 &lt;okopnik&gt; Lost all respect for her over him, didja?
   Jan 19 04:49:29 &lt;jimregan&gt; I worked with him last week. Didn't know
   who he was, didn't speak a word to him, nor him to me (too busy).
   Instantly disliked him anyway.
   Jan 19 04:50:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; I normally stop the 'instantly dislike'
   reflex in its tracks, but couldn't find a good reason to do so for
   that guy.
   Jan 19 04:52:08 &lt;okopnik&gt; Happens. Not too often for me, and I'm
   usually pretty good about discovering why, anyway.
   Jan 19 04:52:35 &lt;jimregan&gt; Same here.
   Jan 19 04:52:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'm bloody good at reading people.
   Jan 19 04:53:55 &lt;jimregan&gt; Did I tell you about the Christmas present
   I got her?
   Jan 19 04:53:58 &lt;okopnik&gt; Says a fair amount about you, Jimmy.
   Jan 19 04:54:05 &lt;okopnik&gt; Nope.
   Jan 19 04:54:29 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh, well. I got her a Paulo Coelho book, in
   Polish.
   Jan 19 04:54:49 &lt;jimregan&gt; She basically told me, to my ears, to get
   her that.
   Jan 19 04:54:54 &lt;okopnik&gt; Oh, yeah... I forgot. You'd mentioned it.
   Jan 19 04:55:03 &lt;jimregan&gt; She didn't know that though.
   Jan 19 04:55:08 &lt;okopnik&gt; And?
   Jan 19 04:55:30 &lt;jimregan&gt; She swayed on the spot "Oh my God! Is this
   a joke?"
   Jan 19 04:55:42 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Got me the same thing in English)
   Jan 19 04:56:03 &lt;okopnik&gt; Whoa!
   Jan 19 04:56:05 &lt;jimregan&gt; Got a text from her later "You made one of
   my dreams come true"
   Jan 19 04:56:58 &lt;okopnik&gt; And you _don't_ want to go out with this
   girl, even to save her from that vile creep? :)
   Jan 19 04:57:29 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)))
   Jan 19 04:58:38 &lt;jimregan&gt; Fuck it. Yes I do. I was just shying away
   from changing certain realities.
   Jan 19 04:58:45 &lt;okopnik&gt; 'Scuse me a bit - my nephew is flooding the
   LAN here with his net.game nearly to the point of unusability. I have
   to DOS him for a while. :) BIAF.
   Jan 19 04:58:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 19 05:00:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hey Ben, Jason can't get in - you locked
   the damn door!
   Jan 19 05:01:27 &lt;jimregan&gt; Ah. Never mind. Unregistered nick
   Jan 19 05:01:40 &lt;okopnik&gt; Whoops! How did I do that?
   Jan 19 05:02:03 &lt;jimregan&gt; He's registering his nick now, 'sok
   Jan 19 05:02:58 &lt;okopnik&gt; (Oh, and the LAN is clear now. Must have
   been something wrong with the network, the poor boy got knocked off or
   something... :)

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 02 00:42:57 &lt;editorgal&gt; start a wiki entry on it and stub it with
   the netjoke about why the countries can't have a summit that makes
   sense
   Jan 02 00:43:13 &lt;editorgal&gt; and the one about the military not getting
   the same language
   Jan 02 00:43:13 &lt;jimregan&gt; ?
   Jan 02 00:43:25 &lt;editorgal&gt; the military one first, its simpler
   Jan 02 00:44:02 &lt;editorgal&gt; When the Marines say secure a building,
   they mean bomb the area and go room to room with guns, taking
   prisoners and recuing hostages.
   Jan 02 00:44:02 &lt;jimregan&gt; Eh? My gears have been running slowly all
   day
   Jan 02 00:44:10 &lt;jimregan&gt; Ah
   Jan 02 00:44:28 &lt;editorgal&gt; When the army says secure a building they
   mean make sure it can't shoot at you. if this means blow it up
   entirely, fine.
   Jan 02 00:44:52 &lt;editorgal&gt; when the Navy says secure a building they
   mean lock the door when you leave.
   Jan 02 00:44:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 02 00:45:07 &lt;editorgal&gt; when the Air Force says secure a building
   they mean lease with option to buy.
   Jan 02 00:49:40 &lt;jimregan&gt; rofl
   Jan 02 00:50:58 &lt;editorgal&gt; ok the other one
   Jan 02 00:51:13 &lt;editorgal&gt; an international survey doesn't work out.
   why? language. take a look...
   Jan 02 00:51:24 &lt;editorgal&gt; only one question was asked
   Jan 02 00:51:33 &lt;editorgal&gt; "Please give your honest opinion
   Jan 02 00:51:37 &lt;editorgal&gt; about solutions to the food shortage in
   the rest of the world?"
   Jan 02 00:51:55 &lt;editorgal&gt; in South America they didn't understand
   'please'
   Jan 02 00:52:10 &lt;editorgal&gt; in Scotland they didn't understand 'give'
   Jan 02 00:52:16 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 02 00:52:22 &lt;editorgal&gt; in Eastern Europe they didn't understand
   'honest'
   Jan 02 00:52:33 &lt;editorgal&gt; in China they didn't understand 'opinion'
   Jan 02 00:52:38 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'm guessing the US didn't understand
   'shortage'
   Jan 02 00:52:49 &lt;editorgal&gt; In the Middle East they didn't understand
   'solution'
   Jan 02 00:53:02 &lt;editorgal&gt; in Africa they didn't understand 'food'
   Jan 02 00:53:15 &lt;editorgal&gt; in Western Europe they didn't understand
   'shortage'
   Jan 02 00:53:33 &lt;editorgal&gt; and in the USA they didn't understand
   'rest of the world'
   Jan 02 00:54:19 &lt;editorgal&gt; (I'm sure there might be a few mortified
   souls out there who didn't understand what 'funny' meant when they
   read this, either.)

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 02 14:04:06 &lt;editorgal&gt; hi Frodo
   Jan 02 14:04:07 &lt;jimregan&gt; hi
   Jan 02 14:04:09 &lt;editorgal&gt; how's the hand?
   Jan 02 14:04:19 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; still the same :)
   Jan 02 14:04:27 &lt;jimregan&gt; Still attached?
   Jan 02 14:04:27 &lt;editorgal&gt; attached is good
   Jan 02 14:04:32 &lt;jimregan&gt; Good good.
   Jan 02 14:04:34 * editorgal high fives jimmy
   Jan 02 14:04:39 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; four more weeks of cast to go, at least
   Jan 02 14:04:45 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; lol - yep, still attached :)
   Jan 02 14:04:53 * editorgal scribbles on Frodo's cast
   Jan 02 14:05:04 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; :)
   Jan 02 14:05:11 * jimregan writes carefully on Frodo's cast
   Jan 02 14:05:25 * editorgal checks the font on his word
   Jan 02 14:05:26 &lt;jimregan&gt; (which ends up looking like more of a
   scribble than editorgal's)
   Jan 02 14:05:33 &lt;editorgal&gt; rofl
   Jan 02 14:05:36 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; lol
   Jan 02 14:05:56 &lt;editorgal&gt; your write like my dad jimmy
   Jan 02 14:06:02 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh. I have to write in block capitals
   because it's only illegible that way.
   Jan 02 14:06:05 &lt;editorgal&gt; ...almost unrecognizable
   Jan 02 14:06:23 &lt;editorgal&gt; nah dad's block caps are neat
   Jan 02 14:06:33 &lt;editorgal&gt; from years of deskchecking in grid paper
   Jan 02 14:06:56 &lt;editorgal&gt; his handwriting however could get him
   accused of being a doctor
   Jan 02 14:07:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; heh
   Jan 02 14:07:14 &lt;jimregan&gt; My handwriting looks like arabic
   Jan 02 14:07:19 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 02 14:07:26 &lt;editorgal&gt; I know someone who does calligraphy, and
   her ordinary printing is 1) fast 2) pretttttty
   Jan 02 14:07:45 &lt;editorgal&gt; you a lefty jimmy?
   Jan 02 14:07:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nope
   Jan 02 14:08:06 &lt;jimregan&gt; Though my handwriting looks better with my
   left than my right :)
   Jan 02 14:08:11 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh ok, most lefty seem to whine their
   handwriting is ugly, just curious.
   Jan 02 14:08:34 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nah. I've been using computers since I was
   7, so I always prefered to type
   Jan 02 14:08:40 &lt;editorgal&gt; &lt;- 5
   Jan 02 14:08:48 &lt;editorgal&gt; maybe 4 and a half
   Jan 02 14:08:52 &lt;jimregan&gt; Eep.
   Jan 02 14:08:59 &lt;editorgal&gt; I swear
   Jan 02 14:09:05 &lt;jimregan&gt; Ah

   batch control language I've never heard of
   Jan 02 14:09:28 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 02 14:09:43 &lt;jimregan&gt; CP/M was my first OS
   Jan 02 14:09:52 &lt;editorgal&gt; giggle
   Jan 02 14:10:07 * editorgal puts on the ol beard and cane look

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 02 15:37:45 * editorgal is thinkng the laundrette might mark up
   voices by who drinks and doesn't
   Jan 02 15:37:56 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh. I was think that too.
   Jan 02 15:37:59 &lt;editorgal&gt; vbeers for drinkers, coffee for those of
   us who don't
   Jan 02 15:38:05 &lt;editorgal&gt; ok it's a plan
   Jan 02 15:38:17 &lt;jimregan&gt; "I love it when a plan comes together"
   Jan 02 15:38:18 &lt;editorgal&gt; vbeer unless they're on the teetotal list
   Jan 02 15:38:29 * editorgal pats assoc arrays
   Jan 02 15:38:55 &lt;jimregan&gt; So... to check who drinks and who doesn't,
   everyone is going to get hashed?
   Jan 02 15:39:05 &lt;jimregan&gt; griiiiiin
   Jan 02 15:39:14 &lt;editorgal&gt; yeah
   Jan 02 15:39:18 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; lol
   Jan 02 15:39:28 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh, sorry
   Jan 02 15:39:34 &lt;jimregan&gt; Watzamocha
   Jan 02 15:39:44 &lt;jimregan&gt; Can I get two vbeers :))))
   Jan 02 15:39:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; j/k
   Jan 02 15:39:57 &lt;editorgal&gt; I could give you a tall one..
   Jan 02 15:40:32 &lt;editorgal&gt; anyways they'll look tall, because if I do
   a coffee mug in proportion to a pint, they're shorter
   Jan 02 15:41:54 &lt;jimregan&gt; Right... gotta diff to members-faq.html to
   send to Ben.
   Jan 02 15:43:30 * editorgal ponders a stein for really heavy beer
   drinkers, won't bother unless someone asks after it.
   Jan 02 15:45:55 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 02 15:46:03 * jimregan googles 'stein'
   Jan 02 15:46:39 &lt;editorgal&gt; capped beer mug, usually made of metal,
   sometimes heavy glass
   Jan 02 15:46:57 &lt;jimregan&gt; Ah
   Jan 02 15:46:58 &lt;editorgal&gt; often great artwork
   Jan 02 15:47:07 &lt;jimregan&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_stein :)
   Jan 02 15:47:08 &lt;editorgal&gt; the linuxbierwanderung guys have steins
   Jan 02 15:47:19 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah. I gotta go on one of those
   Jan 02 15:47:32 &lt;jimregan&gt; http://www.beerstein.net/articles/bsb-1.htm
   :)))
   Jan 02 15:48:06 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; I don't like drinking from steins... I
   prefer a _good_ glass...
   Jan 02 15:48:40 &lt;jimregan&gt;
   http://www.findgift.com/Graphics/Gifts/PR_35025.jpg
   Jan 02 15:48:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; Like that?
   Jan 02 15:49:20 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; lol - I actually drank from one of those,
   once...
   Jan 02 15:49:22 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; but nah :)
   Jan 02 15:49:52 &lt;jimregan&gt; I was in a drinking competition with those.
   Jan 02 15:49:58 &lt;jimregan&gt; Got through to the final!
   Jan 02 15:50:12 &lt;jimregan&gt; My best time was 36 seconds
   Jan 02 15:50:17 &lt;editorgal&gt; damn that's a tiny pic
   Jan 02 15:50:25 &lt;editorgal&gt; uh, I think that's a yard of beer
   Jan 02 15:50:25 &lt;jimregan&gt; Here's a half yard:
   http://www.wineenthusiast.com/weimages/products/thumbnails/P633B.jpg
   Jan 02 15:50:28 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt;
   http://www.sintsixtus.be/foto/soorten%20bier.jpg
   Jan 02 15:50:33 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; more like this :)
   Jan 02 15:50:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeep.
   Jan 02 15:51:03 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; (it happens to be my favourite beer -
   Westvleteren Abt)
   Jan 02 15:51:04 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nah. Gimme a pint glass.
   Jan 02 15:51:24 &lt;jimregan&gt; Grr. You can push off. The tag drinks list
   is done!
   Jan 02 15:51:27 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 02 15:51:49 &lt;editorgal&gt; anyways vbeer and coffee are fine
   Jan 02 15:51:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 02 15:52:18 &lt;jimregan&gt; (just when I was going to look for a
   tequila bottle image)
   Jan 02 15:52:48 --- You are now known as senor_tequila
   Jan 02 15:52:51 &lt;senor_tequila&gt; :)
   Jan 02 15:53:19 &lt;editorgal&gt; no
   Jan 02 15:53:29 --- You are now known as jimregan
   Jan 02 15:53:31 &lt;editorgal&gt; I'd want it to be recognizable and amusing
   in the small form
   Jan 02 15:53:34 * jimregan pouts
   Jan 02 15:53:46 &lt;editorgal&gt; nobody would get why a bottle's any better
   than vbeer
   Jan 02 15:53:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; (It's after Christmas, so I can)

<p><strong>From #tag-chat

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 02 17:31:42 * editorgal got distracted. Thomas got his xmas
   present.
   Jan 02 17:31:43 &lt;editorgal&gt; :D
   Jan 02 17:32:01 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 02 17:32:18 &lt;editorgal&gt; well presents really
   Jan 02 17:32:36 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nice.
   Jan 02 17:32:45 &lt;editorgal&gt; when they told me I had to have it
   repacked for intl, I made sure the packing material wasn't a waste
   Jan 02 17:32:54 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh.
   Jan 02 17:33:08 &lt;jimregan&gt; Bubble wrap?
   Jan 02 17:33:14 &lt;jimregan&gt; Bubble wrap never goes to waste :)
   Jan 02 17:33:14 &lt;editorgal&gt; so a nice antistatic bubble pack and one
   of my fluffier scarves went along for the ride
   Jan 02 17:33:59 &lt;editorgal&gt; true but this is even better
   Jan 02 17:34:09 &lt;editorgal&gt; considering he works on raw devices at
   times.
   Jan 02 17:34:17 &lt;jimregan&gt; My sister got me a portable phone charger
   'cos she knows how much I love my phone
   Jan 02 17:34:30 &lt;editorgal&gt; ok so that's what she got your phone
   Jan 02 17:34:30 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh.
   Jan 02 17:34:35 &lt;editorgal&gt; what'd she get you?
   Jan 02 17:34:43 &lt;jimregan&gt; Erm... that.
   Jan 02 17:34:50 * editorgal wonders when jimmy will marry his phone
   Jan 02 17:34:54 &lt;jimregan&gt; My other sister got me sweets.
   Jan 02 17:35:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh, that reminds me.
   Jan 02 17:35:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; I got a message just after you went
   yesterday: "My phone break up with your phone"
   Jan 02 17:35:35 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 02 17:35:44 &lt;editorgal&gt; did you only get one of it?
   Jan 02 17:35:47 &lt;jimregan&gt; (only got that one twice)
   Jan 02 17:36:03 &lt;jimregan&gt; "My phone is heartbroken"
   Jan 02 17:36:05 &lt;editorgal&gt; right so they're still going together only
   5 times
   Jan 02 17:36:12 &lt;editorgal&gt; lol
   Jan 02 17:36:19 &lt;jimregan&gt; "I'm going to stop texting you, because my
   phone is sulking"
   Jan 02 17:36:30 &lt;editorgal&gt; hahaha
   Jan 02 17:37:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; In the meantime I asked what type of phone
   she had, googled it, gave up on the ringtone idea
   Jan 02 17:37:13 &lt;editorgal&gt; not a re-tonable phone?
   Jan 02 17:37:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; So I emailed her a picture of a dozen roses
   and one of a Claddagh ring, from my phone to hers
   Jan 02 17:37:36 &lt;jimregan&gt; No, though it can use actual sounds.
   Jan 02 17:37:37 &lt;editorgal&gt; aww it's trying to say sorry how sweeeet
   Jan 02 17:38:19 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nah... this was the "my phone is proposing"
   thing, after she said she didn't see flowers or a ring
   Jan 02 17:38:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; I can claim innocence about the timing :)
   Jan 02 17:39:06 &lt;editorgal&gt; lol
   Jan 02 17:39:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; I can always baffle her with techno babble
   bullshit
   Jan 02 17:40:06 &lt;editorgal&gt; right. so when were you going to do
   coffee, and will you have to use paper airplanes because the phones
   won't do lunch?
   Jan 02 17:40:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; Ha ha.
   Jan 02 17:40:36 &lt;editorgal&gt; hey just checkin'
   Jan 02 17:40:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'll probably bump onto her on the way
   to/from work next week.
   Jan 02 17:41:04 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'll bow: "Your Highness".
   Jan 02 17:41:40 &lt;jimregan&gt; (she wants to marry a prince)
   Jan 02 17:42:21 &lt;editorgal&gt; aren't princesses your grace?
   Jan 02 17:42:35 &lt;jimregan&gt; Duke/Duchess
   Jan 02 17:42:41 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh ok
   Jan 02 17:42:47 &lt;jimregan&gt; (iirc)
   Jan 02 17:42:51 &lt;editorgal&gt; hm
   Jan 02 17:43:02 &lt;editorgal&gt; wikipedia::forms of address ?
   Jan 02 17:43:06 &lt;jimregan&gt; Highness for a member of a royal family,
   majesty for a reigning monarch/next in line
   Jan 02 17:43:13 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh.
   Jan 02 17:44:12 &lt;jimregan&gt;
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_(manner_of_address)
   Jan 02 17:44:35 &lt;editorgal&gt; close enough
   Jan 02 17:44:37 &lt;jimregan&gt; Woo!

<p><strong>From #tag-chat

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 03 00:56:45 &lt;okopnik&gt; Oh, totally off LG topics - you guys would
   *love* the weirdness of this hotel I'm in....
   Jan 03 00:57:06 &lt;okopnik&gt; I'm in room 1215. Care to take a guess what
   floor it's on?
   Jan 03 00:57:36 &lt;okopnik&gt; There's an electric outlet in the elevator.
   Jan 03 00:57:39 &lt;okopnik&gt; ....
   Jan 03 00:58:05 &lt;okopnik&gt; Presumably, because the elevator takes SO
   long that you should be able to recharge your phone while going from 1
   to 2.
   Jan 03 00:58:27 &lt;editorgal&gt; the 13th floor because there's an M level
   between 1 and 2 ?
   Jan 03 00:58:39 &lt;okopnik&gt; As you exit the elevator, rooms 1214 and
   1216 bracket the elevator....
   Jan 03 00:58:55 &lt;okopnik&gt; (Nope - the 2nd floor. [scratches head])
   Jan 03 00:58:55 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I never understood how you consider
   level 0 to be "Ground" and Ground to be below level 0. Most strange.
   Jan 03 00:59:23 &lt;okopnik&gt; ....but that doesn't matter, because the
   *next* room on the opposite side is - 1225.
   Jan 03 00:59:24 &lt;editorgal&gt; well they have a tendency to only mark one
   level ground
   Jan 03 00:59:33 &lt;editorgal&gt; but sometimes more than one level leads to
   the outdoors
   Jan 03 00:59:54 &lt;editorgal&gt; maybe the rooms are numbered their
   dialcode.
   Jan 03 01:00:00 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; That threw me at Uni last year -- I
   pressed 'G' thinking it was ground, but actually it was the basement.
   :)
   Jan 03 01:00:05 &lt;okopnik&gt; 1215 is *way the hell around a bend and a
   couple of corners... and the count _revereses_ as you go up the
   corridor.
   Jan 03 01:00:33 &lt;jimregan&gt; Ben, you have entered... the twilight zone.
   Jan 03 01:00:39 &lt;okopnik&gt; Jimmy, do you know if Bloody Stupid Johnson
   is still in business, by any chance? :)
   Jan 03 01:00:40 &lt;jimregan&gt; With room service!
   Jan 03 01:00:43 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 03 01:01:10 &lt;okopnik&gt; I suspect that if I search the drawers in
   the room, I may find The Colossus....
   Jan 03 01:01:14 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hmm. If so, it was probably meant to have
   been a well
   Jan 03 01:01:30 * okopnik cracks up
   Jan 03 01:01:38 &lt;editorgal&gt; Thomas, so they meant G as in lowest
   instead of G as in outdoors
   Jan 03 01:01:40 &lt;editorgal&gt; ?
   Jan 03 01:02:02 &lt;okopnik&gt; pTerry references
   Jan 03 01:02:04 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Yes. Ground in this case is Level 0.
   Jan 03 01:02:27 &lt;editorgal&gt; computer department, computers count from
   zero.
   Jan 03 01:02:55 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; This lift is for the entire building
   (well, one of them) :).
   Jan 03 01:03:16 &lt;okopnik&gt; "All sane array indexes start at zero"...
   but "real world" items always start at one!
   Jan 03 01:05:27 &lt;editorgal&gt; I suppose this Uni is hyperaware of not
   being the real world
   Jan 03 01:07:06 &lt;okopnik&gt; Oh, despite the fact that the scummiest
   hole-in-the-wall coffee shop in DC has wireless access, this
   supposedly-luxury hotel has a "business center". *One* computer. *One*
   Ethernet connection. I suspect that if I unplugged it, these people
   would wet their pants and start crying in terror.
   Jan 03 01:07:21 &lt;okopnik&gt; Oh, and they want *money* to use the thing.
   Jan 03 01:07:34 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Sounds better equipped than the labs at
   Uni.
   Jan 03 01:08:28 &lt;okopnik&gt; Well, heck, Thomas... come on over any time,
   then. :) We'll fix you right up.
   Jan 03 01:08:56 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Heh.

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 03 03:10:10 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; jimregan: I swear the before/after pics
   of you with/without your facial fluff are different people.
   Jan 03 03:10:20 &lt;jimregan&gt; He
   Jan 03 03:10:25 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh, even
   Jan 03 03:10:30 &lt;jimregan&gt; No, same me.
   Jan 03 03:10:47 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; That's scary.
   Jan 03 03:11:13 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; To think you looked so different before.
   Hardly the same person in appearence.
   Jan 03 03:11:17 &lt;jimregan&gt; Imagine how my friends felt when I turned
   up to the pub.
   Jan 03 03:11:28 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Jimmmmmmmmmmay!
   Jan 03 03:11:33 &lt;jimregan&gt; &lt;squint&gt;
   Jan 03 03:11:33 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; No doubt.
   Jan 03 03:11:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; "Whathefuckdjadotoyerhair????"
   Jan 03 03:12:02 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; (That was done in my best Irish accent,
   btw).
   Jan 03 03:12:08 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 03 03:12:43 &lt;jimregan&gt; Sorry, that should've been:
   "Whathefuckdjadotayerhair????"
   Jan 03 03:13:03 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Geordi?
   Jan 03 03:13:20 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nah. You'd have to hear a Thurles accent.
   Jan 03 03:14:05 &lt;jimregan&gt; "I /fair/ didn't recognise ya, lad"
   Jan 03 03:14:06 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Can't say that I have.
   Jan 03 03:15:04 &lt;jimregan&gt; Though my friend Trev, to do him credit,
   did need to use the wall for support, and wave me away so the laughter
   could subside
   Jan 03 03:15:09 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; My understanding of the Irish is that
   (apart from the creul jokes about you all being brain-dead :|) you
   raise leprichorns and wait for rainbows to bring you pots of gold. :P
   Jan 03 03:15:30 &lt;jimregan&gt; While drinking Guinness and whiskey, of
   course.
   Jan 03 03:15:38 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Heh.
   Jan 03 03:15:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; On the way to Mass.
   Jan 03 03:15:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; Complaining about the weather all the way.
   Jan 03 03:15:55 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I am not that naive -- but there are
   some.....
   Jan 03 03:16:01 &lt;jimregan&gt; rofl.
   Jan 03 03:16:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh, and say "begor" and "bejaysus"
   Jan 03 03:17:04 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; heh.
   Jan 03 03:17:08 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Yeah - you got it. :)
   Jan 03 03:17:16 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Though, to be fair, my grandfather does
   say "Be the lord")
   Jan 03 03:17:29 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Seamus is the predominant name.
   Jan 03 03:17:34 &lt;jimregan&gt; Grrr.
   Jan 03 03:17:46 &lt;editorgal&gt; lure the unicorns with a pot of guiness
   Jan 03 03:17:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; Seamas == James
   Jan 03 03:17:53 &lt;editorgal&gt; or something like that
   Jan 03 03:17:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 03 03:18:06 &lt;editorgal&gt; ok for your mutual amusement
   Jan 03 03:18:11 &lt;jimregan&gt; OK
   Jan 03 03:18:16 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Ah -- "James Heaney". That sounds more
   like it.
   Jan 03 03:19:02 &lt;jimregan&gt; There's no 'J' in Irish, so foreign names
   got an 'S'. 'Seamas', 'Sean' (John) etc
   Jan 03 03:21:25 &lt;jimregan&gt; I always hated being called Seamas in Irish
   class. Nothing against the name, but it's not my name.
   Jan 03 03:21:44 &lt;jimregan&gt; It was worse in the Gaeltacht, when
   everyone figured out how much it bugged me.
   Jan 03 03:21:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; Haaaaaayyyyyyymwish
   Jan 03 03:22:12 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Became Haybob, inexplicably)
   Jan 03 03:24:18 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh. Sheamais (Haymwish) is the accusative
   form of Seamas.

   she indulged in, accepts a ginger beer.

   Jan 04 02:36:56 &lt;editorgal&gt; yeah
   Jan 04 02:37:06 &lt;editorgal&gt; that's the stuff.

   Jan 04 02:37:29 &lt;editorgal&gt; pistachios.
   Jan 04 02:37:45 * jimregan munches some pistachios

   Jan 04 02:37:50 &lt;editorgal&gt; there isn't a distro named after

   Jan 04 02:38:43 * jimregan stops looking at the sambucca, pours a
   glass and sets fire to it

   a shell prompt
   Jan 04 02:38:57 * jimregan groans

   Jan 04 02:39:44 &lt;jimregan&gt; I thought it was too obvious, and you
   wouldn't stoop that low :-P
   Jan 04 02:40:14 &lt;editorgal&gt; I'm already in a chair, why would I need

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 05 20:05:38 &lt;jimregan_away&gt; Hi hi hi
   Jan 05 20:06:21 --- You are now known as jimregan
   Jan 05 20:07:52 &lt;jimregan&gt; ok, now that i'm here: hi hi hi
   Jan 05 20:11:31 &lt;editorgal&gt; hehehe
   Jan 05 20:11:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; Um... guess who got me a Christmas present?
   Jan 05 20:11:58 &lt;editorgal&gt; Beata?
   Jan 05 20:12:02 &lt;jimregan&gt; Bingo.
   Jan 05 20:12:05 &lt;jimregan&gt; Now...
   Jan 05 20:12:24 &lt;jimregan&gt; I gave her her present, a book called
   "Jedenascie Minut"
   Jan 05 20:13:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; I gave it to her, and turned to leave. She
   called after me, and told me she had a present for me.
   Jan 05 20:14:06 &lt;jimregan&gt; She asked what her present was, I told her.
   Jan 05 20:14:06 &lt;editorgal&gt; awwwwww
   Jan 05 20:14:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; She started saying "Is this a joke? This is
   crazy"
   Jan 05 20:14:25 &lt;jimregan&gt; I was puzzled.
   Jan 05 20:14:35 &lt;jimregan&gt; She started getting giddy.
   Jan 05 20:14:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; "wait there"
   Jan 05 20:14:49 &lt;jimregan&gt; She went into the women's locker room
   Jan 05 20:15:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; She came out, and told me she thought about
   getting me a pterry book, but figured I'd probably read all his books
   Jan 05 20:15:35 &lt;jimregan&gt; So she got me a book by her favourite
   author.
   Jan 05 20:15:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; Didn't click with me.
   Jan 05 20:15:58 &lt;jimregan&gt; She said to open it, I said I'd do it
   later, I had to start work
   Jan 05 20:16:01 &lt;Rickeh&gt; easy cd creator blows monkeys for pleasure,
   and collects money for it.
   Jan 05 20:16:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'd kinda figured what it was, but didn't
   want to give away any look on my face.
   Jan 05 20:16:30 &lt;jimregan&gt; She got me "Eleven Minutes"
   Jan 05 20:16:49 &lt;jimregan&gt; I don't think you need to look at a
   Polish-English dictionary...
   Jan 05 20:18:38 &lt;jimregan&gt; I just checked my phone: "You came true one
   of my dreams...thank you :) It is in polish-I am surprised."
   Jan 05 20:18:44 &lt;jimregan&gt; (9 times)
   Jan 05 20:24:02 &lt;editorgal&gt; :D
   Jan 05 20:26:08 &lt;jimregan&gt; I don't know how the hell I'm going to
   repond to that.
   Jan 05 20:27:11 &lt;jimregan&gt; She's just too damn sincere -- I don't know
   how deal with that :)
   Jan 05 20:28:10 &lt;editorgal&gt; take life as it comes
   Jan 05 20:28:16 &lt;editorgal&gt; she makes her choices
   Jan 05 20:28:26 &lt;editorgal&gt; live with 'em, make your own.
   Jan 05 20:34:46 &lt;editorgal&gt; jimregan: you ok there?
   Jan 05 20:34:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah.
   Jan 05 20:35:40 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'm kinda at a loss for words, really.

<blockQuote>
So... this month's laundrette starts here. I couldn't concentrate on
anything at all last month -- it took a lot of effort to scrape out
the one article I did write, and I'm only doing this now because
after wasting a lot of my own time, and quite a lot of other people's
time, I felt the need to do something worthwhile (but couldn't think of
anything, and did this instead

<blockQuote>
Oh, and yeah, this was meant to turn into "The TAG Bar". Maybe some
other time.

Anyway, last month's song of the (end of the) month was going to be Tool's
<a href="http://www.seeklyrics.com/lyrics/Tool/Forty-Six-2.html">Forty Six &amp; 2</a>
but, for reasons I'm not going to go into, I think Tool's
<a href="http://www.lyricsondemand.com/t/toollyrics/schismlyrics.html">Schism</a>
is a bit more fitting for this month.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
(The start of the month song for last month would have been more Tool:
<a href="http://www.letssingit.com/tool-parabol-464pr7v.html">Parabol</a>
and
<a href="http://www.lyricscafe.com/t/tool/parabola.html">Parabola</a>
-- two parts of the same thought).

Heh.  That always makes me laugh.  It seems America has a habit
(addiction?) to electing previous film actors into politics.  Ronald
Regen, being the prime example.  Any particular reason for this?

<blockQuote>
But as for particular reason, I don't know. I wasn't alive for most of
his presidency, so I am not in a position to directly judge how well he
did. But on the other hand, I have at my disposal all the information
(archived newspapers, press releases and whatnot) that the average
American had during that time period <EM>plus</EM> the advantage of hindsight
<EM>plus</EM> any addition information that may have been written, so you could
also argue I should be able to have a <EM>more</EM> accurate view <EM>now</EM> than
someone living <EM>then</EM> had <EM>then</EM>. But presumably <EM>not</EM> as accurate as

it actually makes sense, trust me on this one.

Voter turnout of the voting age population hovers around 60%, so if the
40% that doesn't vote suddenly started voting, they would constitute
about 28% of the new voting population, which, if they were all
like-minded, would be enough to swing most any election.

Put another way, if everybody who doesn't vote did, they could run the

I'm offline now, so someone has doubtless pointed this out by now, but
the 28% figure is obviously wrong. If there was a 40% <EM>increase</EM> in
People Who Actually Vote, the new 40% would be 28% of the new total.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
But the case we have here is 40% of the people who can vote, not voting.
So if they started voting, they would obviously be 40% of the voting
population.

They are not alone in this. Actors-turned-politicians collect votes by the
zillions in India---especially in Tamil Nadu where I live.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Someone suggested a twin-states tie-up between Tamil Nadu and California
based on:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<ol>
<li>Both are on the sea.</li>
<li>The language of the majority of people in the state is different
   from the language of the majority of people in the country.</li>
<li>The climate is semi-arid so both states have perennial problems with
   water scarcity.</li>
<li> The largest film industry (in terms of employment) in the world resides
   in Tamil Nadu while the largest film industry (in terms of capital)
   resides in California.
<br><br>
And the killer point is ...</li>
<br><br>
<li>California has the leading man and we have the (now large never svelte)
   leading lady.</li>
</ol>
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
More seriously, I think (other) politicians tend to underestimate the political
skills and general intelligence of actors based on their on-screen
personas---they thus put these actors in positions of power in the hope of
controlling them like puppets (he/she took the direction of &lt;name of
director here&gt; so why not political direction from me). I think our
Amma/Madam/JJ has proved them wrong and I have a strong guess that Arnie
is no one's chump/chimp either.

Still this doesn't quite answer why <strong>people</strong> elect them when other
politicians put them up as front (wo)men.

Chris McAvoy describes his Linux-based cat feeder.  You click on a web
link (so you can feed kitty remotely!), the Python program sends a
character on the serial port, a BASIC program on a microcontroller turns
the paddles on his gizmo, and the gizmo delivers a fish to the hungry
feline.

Jimmy has been using computers from the tender age of seven, when his father was left an
Amstrad PCW8256. He was shown a Unix box several years later, and instantly fell in love.
But it could never be, as Unix vendors tended to demand first-born children, and when
Mark came along in 1997, the trade didn't seem worth it.


<p>
Within weeks of starting college, Shane, a fellow first year student, started a
computer
society and so Jimmy found his introduction to Linux. Jimmy was made an admin pretty
quickly, because Shane figured he'd get the root password one way or another.
<p>
Jimmy has since reformed his l33t wayz, and could pass for a productive member of society
in dim lighting, at a distance, if you're only looking out of the corner of your eye.
In "Moving Pictures", Terry Pratchett wrote:</em>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Of course, it is very important to be sober when you take an exam.
Many worthwhile careers in the street-cleaning, fruit-picking, and
subway-guitar-playing industries have been founded on a lack of understanding
of this simple fact.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<em>Jimmy hadn't read these words of wisdom. Jimmy now works in a meat factory.
Jimmy plays guitar, but his dream of playing in a subway is on hold, pending
the construction of a subway in his locality.
