<H2>Introduction</H2>

The <TT>sendfile</TT> system call is a relatively recent addition to
the Linux kernel that offers significant performance benefits to
applications such as ftp and web servers that need to efficiently
transfer files. In this article I will explore <TT>sendfile</TT>, what
it does, and how to use it, illustrated by some example programs.

<H2>Background</H2>

A server application, such as a web server, spends much of its time
transferring files stored on disk to a network connection connected to
a client running a web browser. Simple pseudo-code for the data
transfer might look like this:

<PRE>
    open source (disk file)
    open destination (network connection)
    while there is data to be transferred:
        read data from source to a buffer
        write data from buffer to destination
    close source and destination
</PRE>

The reading and writing of data would typically use the <TT>read</TT>
and <TT>write</TT> system calls respectively, or library functions
built on top of them.

<P>

If we follow the path of the data from disk to network, it needs to be
copied several times. Each time the <TT>read</TT> system call is
invoked, data must be transferred from the disk hardware to a kernel
buffer (typically using DMA). Then it needs to be copied into the
buffer used by the application. When <TT>write</TT> is called, data in
the application's buffer needs to be transferred to a kernel buffer
and then from the kernel buffer to the hardware device (e.g. network
card). Every time a system call is invoked by a user program, there is
a <EM>context switch</EM> between user and kernel mode, which is a
relatively expensive operation. If there are many calls to
<TT>read</TT> and <TT>write</TT> in the program, there will be many
context switches required.

<P>

This copying of data between kernel and application buffers and back
is redundant if the data does not need to be changed. Many operating
systems, including Windows NT, FreeBSD, and Solaris, offer what is
called a zero-copy system call that can perform a file transfer in a
single operation. Early versions of Linux were criticized for lacking
this feature, until it was implemented in the 2.2 kernel series. It is
now used by popular server applications such as Apache and Samba.

<P>

The implementation of <TT>sendfile</TT> varies on different operating
systems. For the rest of this article we will just focus on the Linux
version. Note that there is a file transfer utility called
<TT>sendfile</TT>; this has nothing to do with the kernel system call.

<H2>A Detailed Look</H2>

To use <TT>sendfile</TT>, include the header file
<TT>&lt;sys/sendfile.h&gt;</TT>, which declares a function with
the following prototype:

<PRE>
    ssize_t sendfile(int out_fd, int in_fd, off_t *offset, size_t count);
</PRE>


The parameters are as follows:

<DL>

<DT>out_fd</DT>
<DD>a file descriptor, open for writing, for the data to be written</DD>

<DT>in_fd</DT>
<DD>a file descriptor, open for reading, for the data to be read</DD>

<DT>offset</DT> <DD>the offset in the input file to start transfer
(e.g. a value of 0 indicates the beginning of the file). This is
passed into the function and updated when the function returns.</DD>

<DT>count</DT>
<DD>the number of bytes to be transferred</DD>

</DL>

The function returns the number of bytes written or -1 if an error occurred.

<P>

On Linux, file descriptors can be true files or devices, such as a
network socket. The <TT>sendfile</TT> implementation currently
requires that the input file descriptor correspond to a true file
or some device which supports <TT>mmap</TT>. This means, for example,
it cannot be a network socket. The output file descriptor can
correspond to a socket, and this is usually the case when it is used.

<H2>Example 1</H2>

Let's look at a simple example to illustrate using <TT>sendfile</TT>.
Listing 1 shows <TT>fastcp.c</TT>, a simple file copy program that uses
<TT>sendfile</TT> to perform a file copy.

<P>

The listing here is slightly abbreviated for clarity. The full listing
available <A HREF="misc/tranter/fastcp.c.txt">here</A> has additional
error checking and the include directives needed so it will compile.

<P>

<HR>

<PRE>
Listing 1: fastcp.c

1     int main(int argc, char **argv) {
2         int src;               /* file descriptor for source file */
3         int dest;              /* file descriptor for destination file */
4         struct stat stat_buf;  /* hold information about input file */
5         off_t offset = 0;      /* byte offset used by sendfile */
6
7         /* check that source file exists and can be opened */
8         src = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY);

9         /* get size and permissions of the source file */
10        fstat(src, &amp;stat_buf);

11        /* open destination file */
12        dest = open(argv[2], O_WRONLY|O_CREAT, stat_buf.st_mode);

13        /* copy file using sendfile */
14        sendfile (dest, src, &amp;offset, stat_buf.st_size);

15        /* clean up and exit */
16        close(dest);
17        close(src);
18    }
</PRE>

<HR>

<P>

On line 8 we open the input file, passed as the first command line
argument. On line 10 we get information on the file using
<TT>fstat</TT>, as we will need the file size and permissions
later. On line 12 we open the output for for writing. Line 14 performs
the call to sendfile, passing the output and input file descriptors,
the offset (zero in this case), and specifying the number of bytes to
transfer using the input file size. We then close the files in lines
16 and 17.

<P>

Try compiling the program (using the full version <A
HREF="misc/tranter/fastcp.c.txt">here</A>). I suggest experimenting
with using it to copy various types of files, such as the following,
and see which source and destination devices support
<TT>sendfile</TT>:

<UL>
<LI> from a disk file to another disk file
<LI> using files located on different disks or partitions
<LI> from a mounted CD-ROM to a file
<LI> from a disk file to /dev/null or /dev/full
<LI> from /dev/zero or /dev/null to a disk file
<LI> from a disk file to the floppy device (/dev/fd0)
</UL>

<H2>Example 2</H2>

The first example was simple, but not very representative of the
typical use of <TT>sendfile</TT> using a network destination. The
second example illustrates sending a file over a network socket. This
program is longer, mostly due to the setup required to work with
sockets, so I don't include it in-line. You can see the full source
listing <A HREF="misc/tranter/server.c.txt">here</A>.

<P>

The program, called <TT>server</TT>, does the following:

<UL>
<LI> Listens on a network socket for a client to connect.
<LI> When a client connects, waits for the client to send it a filename.
<LI> Sends the specified file back to the client using <TT>sendfile</TT>.
<LI> Disconnects the client and listens for another connection.
</UL>

I assume here you are familiar with the basics of network socket
programming. If not, there are many good books on the subject.
such as <EM>UNIX Network Programming</EM> by Richard Stevens.

<P>

The server arbitrarily uses port 1234 but you can specify it as a
command line option. Start the server by running it ("./server"). To
act as the client side, you can use the <TT>telnet</TT> program. Run
it from another console window while the server is running, specifying
the host name and port number (e.g. "telnet localhost 1234"). Once
<TT>telnet</TT> indicates it is connected, type the name of a file
that exists, such as <TT>/etc/hosts</TT>. The server should send
the contents of the file back to the client and then close the connection.

<P>

The server should remain running so you can connect again. If you use
a filename of "quit" then the server will exit. If you have another
machine on a network, try verifying that you can connect to the server
and transfer a file from another machine.

<P>

Note that this is a very simplistic example of a server: it can only
handle one client at a time and does does little error checking,
exiting if an error occurs. There are also other performance
optimizations that can be done at the TCP layer, that are outside the
scope of what can be covered here.

<H2>Summary</H2>

The <TT>sendfile</TT> system call facilitates high performance network
file transfers, a requirement for applications such as ftp and web
servers. If you are developing a server application, consider using
<TT>sendfile</TT> to give your code a performance boost. Outside of
the server arena, it is an interesting feature in it's own right and
you may find some other creative uses for it.

<P>

Finally, after all this discussion of <TT>sendfile</TT>, I will leave
you with this question to ponder: why is there no corresponding
<TT>receivefile</TT> system call?
