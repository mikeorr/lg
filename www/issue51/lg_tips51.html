<FONT COLOR="navy">Get a weather report on your desktop

Sat, 12 Feb 2000 13:08:03 -0500 (EST)
<BR>From: Matthew Willis &lt;<A HREF="mailto:matt@optimus.cee.cornell.edu">matt@optimus.cee.cornell.edu&gt;</A>

<P> On my KDE desktop, I have semi-live satellite images on several of
the pages. I used cron and wget to get the latest weather for my
desktop background. Here's how. First I made a couple of directories
<PRE>
   mkdir ~/weather ~/bin/cron
</PRE>
Then in the file ~/bin/cron/hourly.job I did this
<PRE>
  #!/bin/sh
  W=$HOME/weather
  wget http://www.cis.ec.gc.ca/goes/huron_f.jpg \
    -O $W/goes_huron_f.jpg
  wget http://www.cis.ec.gc.ca/goes/gulf_f.jpg \
    -O $W/goes_gulf_f.jpg
  wget http://sgiot2.wwb.noaa.gov/COASTWATCH/GOES/G8CWNEVS.GIF \
    -O $W/G8CWNEVS.GIF                                          
</PRE>

<P> Then, I made it executable
<PRE>
   chmod +x ~/bin/cron/hourly.job 
</PRE>
and set up a crontab entry like this, using 
<PRE>
   crontab -e
</PRE>
and creating this line:
<PRE>
   10 * * * * $HOME/bin/cron/hourly.job &gt;&gt; /tmp/out.h 2&gt;&amp;1
</PRE>
then I saved the file and exited. 

<P> I used 10 minutes after the hour to avoid a race on the hour. 
Finally, you're ready. Give a test with the command: 
<PRE>
    ~/bin/cron/hourly.job
</PRE>
Did it work? If so, let's set up the window manager. If not, you may
not have wget installed. (Note- you can snag wget at
<A HREF="ftp://gnjilux.cc.fer.hr/pub/unix/util/wget/">
ftp://gnjilux.cc.fer.hr/pub/unix/util/wget/</A>)

<P> Setting up your WM:

<DL>
	<DT> KDE
	<DD> Use kcontrol to change the wallpaper to ~/weather/*****
whatever. You probably want "Centred" arrangement, or "maxpect". If
you uncheck "Common background" you can have different pictures on
each page.<P>

	<DT> GNOME
	<DD> With GNOME, use gnomecc to set the background image to
something in ~/weather/****.<P>

	<DT>Windowmaker 
	<DD> With windowmaker, you can use wmsetbg ~/weather/*****
to sync a new picture. I'm not too sure you want to do this if you're
logged out though. You could put the line in your cron job if you
want. <P>

<FONT COLOR="navy">Info-search tips for Midnight Commander users
</FONT> </H3>
Mon, 31 Jan 2000 14:57:13 -0800
<BR>From:  Ben Okopnik &lt;<A HREF="mailto:fuzzybear@pocketmail.com">fuzzybear@pocketmail.com&gt;</A>

<P> Funny thing; I was just about to post this tip when I read Matt Willis' "HOWTO searching script" in LG45. Still, this script is a good bit more flexible (allows diving into subdirectories, actually displays the HOWTO or the document whether .gz or .html or whatever format, etc.), uses the Bash shell instead of csh (well, _I_ see it as an advantage <grin>...), and reads the entire /usr/doc hierarchy - perfect for those times when the man page isn't quite enough. I find myself using it about as often as I do the 'man' command.

<P> You will need the Midnight Commander on your system to take advantage of this (in my opinion, one of the top three apps ever written for the Linux console). I also find that it is at its best when used under X-windows, as this allows the use of GhostView, xdvi, and all the other nifty tools that aren't available on the console.

<P> <A HREF="misc/tips/doc.sh.txt">Here's the script.</A>

<P> To use it, type (for example)

<PRE>
doc xl
</PRE>

<P> and press Enter. The script will respond with a menu of all the /usr/doc subdirs beginning with 'xl' prefixed by menu numbers; simply select the number for the directory that you want, and the script will switch to that directory and present you with another menu. Whenever your selection is an actual file, MC will open it in the appropriate manner - and when you exit that view of it, you'll be presented with the menu again. To quit the script, press 'Ctrl-C'.

<P> A couple of built-in minor features (read: 'bugs') - if given a nonsense number as a selection, 'doc' will drop you into your home directory. Simply 'Ctrl-C' to get out and try again. Also, for at least one directory in '/usr/doc' (the 'gimp-manual/html') there is simply not enough scroll-back buffer to see all the menu-items (526 of them!). I'm afraid that you'll simply have to switch there and look around; fortunately, MC makes that relatively easy!

<P> Oh, one more MC tip. If you define the 'CDPATH' variable in your .bash_profile and make '/usr/doc' one of the entries in it, you'll be able to switch to any directory in that hierarchy by simply
 typing 'cd &lt;first_few_letters_of_dir_name&gt;' and pressing the Tab key for completion. Just like using 'doc', in some ways...

<P> Hope this is of help.

Mon, 14 Feb 100 11:51:22 Australia/NSW
<BR>From: Harry &lt;<A HREF="mailto:hfphillips@iname.com">hfphillips@iname.com&gt;</A>

<P> In a recent two cent tip there was a suggestion to use NT loader to triple 
boot, I have another method use lilo.

<P> Install all three OS'es, the order I did it, Win95(FAT32), NT4(NTFS) then linux 
(ext2).

<P> Edit lilo.conf and add the following sections:

<PRE>
# Windows 95 stanza
       other=/dev/hda1
       table=/dev/hda
       label=windows
# End Windows 95 stanza

# Windows NT stanza
       other=/dev/hda2
       table=/dev/hda
       loader=/boot/os2_d.b
       label=NT
# End Windows NT stanza
</PRE>

<P> Then run lilo and when you can select between the three of them. If you select 
NT it then comes up with the NT loader. I have set this to appear for 0 seconds 
so that it starts straight away instead of having a menu.

Configure your display with the help of 'XF86Setup' (you have to write it as
I do, with upper and lower cased letters), or, if it doesn't run the
'xf86config' program.
Try to find your ATI Card, and if you don't, use simply SVGA. Most of cards
which are not listed are standard SVGA Cards (my Matrox Millenium G200 also),
and they run very well with the SVGA driver.

	<P> Overclocking a Motherboard? 233Mhz to 450Hmz?
	
	<P> From Steve on Fri, 07 Jan 2000 
	
	<P> I have a motherboard in my PC that says it has a max processor speed of 233mhz, i did'nt know this when i resently purchased a 450mhz CPU. Is
	there any way i can override this issue, my max bus speed is 66. 
	
	<P> I wouldn't recommend it. Bare motherboards are not very expensive so you should be able to pick up one for about a $100 or less
	that will take the CPU that you got and still allow you to pull in your old DIMMs, and adapter cards from the existing system. 
	
	 <P> Of course I'd double check the RAM (DIMMs, SIMMs or whatever you've got) and make sure it is fast enough that you aren't wasting the
	investment in the new CPU. 
	
	<P> Personally I don't recommend CPU upgrades at all. I suggest that people buy the CPU, motherboard, and RAM together, and get them
	matched to one another. Also it is quite unlikely that you applications are actually CPU bound. Your CPU investment would probably have
	been better spent in extra RAM or a faster controller. 
	
	<P> As you say your current motherboard's bus speed is only 66Mhz. You probably want a motherboard that runs at closer to 100Mhz (at least
	PC100 RAM). You don't want the CPU sitting there waiting for its own RAM all the time. 

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Sometimes it can be done!  I just managed to get my old DFI 586STC Rev
D+ motherboard to run an AMD k6-2/400.

<P> The jumper settings for the cpu voltage only went down to 2.5v  The K6-2
needs 2.2v. There are three jumpers used to set voltage. I noticed a
binary pattern to the settings suggesting that there are undocumented
settings for: 2.4-2.0v.  Following this pattern, I set the jumper for
what should be 2.2v.  I installed a K6/300 and turned on the computer. 
It fired up fine. I let it run a while and the cpu stayed cool. I now
had a K6/300 running but the bios was saying it was a MMX processor at
50mhz. It was running at 300mhz: Bogomips was 597 which is what it
should be for a K6/300. The K6-2/400 will run at 6x (66mhz times 6x 396mhz) when the multiplier jumpers are set to 2x.  I tried that and it
was no go. She wouldn't boot.  I put the K6/300 back in and reset the
multiplier jumpers to 4.5x.  I went to DFI's web page and downloaded the
latest bios.  I flashed the new bios and success, the cpu was now
recognized as a K6/300. So, I put the K6-2/400 back in and set the
jumpers back to 2x.  Success again!  My old DFI motherboard is now
running at 400mhz. I have SUSE 6.3 on it and it seems rock stable. With
a K6-2/400 selling for under $50 I don't see this as a bad day's work.
However, I WAS prepared to suffer the consequences if this project had
failed! The motherboard was old, retired from service and failure
wouldn't have been that great a lost.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> This is caused by buffering being done in the C++ stream library.  To get
the result you desire, you just need to flush the stream before writing
directly to stdout.  In other words, just put the statement
"cout.flush();" right after statement 1.


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P> I don't why,how can it be corrected. Second,I had believed the
	statement 2 is illegal in grammar.Because if you define an array, char
	buffer[BufferSize] ,the BufferSize indicate the number of elements in
	array and should be a constant or at least be a const variable,and it
	can't be a variable, otherwise the program cann't be compiled. But the
	fact is this program is compiled smoothly and functions normally. What
	is wrong? 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> ANSI C++ does not allow this, but g++ does.  If you run g++ with the
"-pedantic" flag, it will issue a warning about that statement.


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P> Question 2, I write a c program.  But when compiling, gcc reports
	that all the functions with "vga_" profix are undefined,what is the
	problem? I had included "vga.h" in my programe as indicated in "man"

<P> You need to link with the vga library.  Just include the flag "-lvga" when

<BR>From: Curly &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ocurtin@usa.net">ocurtin@usa.net&gt;</A>

<P> Wei Huang did write an email asking:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P> I want to show the sentence in statement 1 ahead of the body

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The two statements in your code:
	<PRE>
      cout&lt;&lt;"\nThis is the body of file.\n";
      	</PRE>
and
	<PRE>
      write(1,buffer,sizeof(buffer));
      	</PRE>

<P> are using two different methods of writing to the terminal.

<P> The C++ statement "cout" uses a buffer inside your program to
collect individual output statements into a larger block.  When
your program writes "\nThis is the body of file.\n" the first
time, it goes into the buffer.  When it writes the same line
again,
it gets added to the buffer.  Finally, when your program ends (or
if the buffer gets full) then the contents of the buffer are sent
to the screen.

<P> The kernel call "write" has very different behavior.  This uses
the method that cout uses when it writes the buffer to the screen.
When you call "write", your program does not continue until the
data has been written.

<P> Since the "cout" library call buffers data inside your program
and the "write" kernel call does not, then the strings you "write"
will usually arrive on your screen before the strings you "cout".

<P> The solution is to use one method for writing strings throughout
your program rather than mix different methods.  For almost all
programs, "cout" is a better choice than "write".  Do some more
reading about the C/C++ library.  A good place to start is your
Linux system, where you can type `info libc`.

<P> In your second question:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	gcc reports that all the functions with "vga_"
	profix are undefined,

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> the message "undefined reference to ..." comes from the linking
phase of the compile.  That is, the compiler has already
translated your code into machine language, and is now trying
to find the library routines needed to run the program.  Vga
programming is not a standard thing, so you have to tell the
compiler which library to look into.  Add the compiler option
"-lvga" to your command line.

ANSWER: <FONT COLOR="navy">dual booting NT and linux

Thu, 03 Feb 2000 22:30:06 +0000
<BR>From: Clive Wright &lt;<A HREF="mailto:clive_wright@telinco.co.uk">clive_wright@telinco.co.uk&gt;</A>

<P> 	I am not familiar with Norton Ghost; however I have been
successfully dual booting NT 4 and versions of linux
(currently Redhat 6.0) for the past year.

<P> First let me refer you to the excellent article on
multibooting by Tom de Blende in issue 47 of LG. Note step
17. "The tricky part is configuring Lilo. You must keep Lilo
OUT OF THE MBR! The mbr is reserved for NT. If you'd install
Lilo in your mbr, NT won't boot anymore".

<P> As your requirements are quite modest they can easily be
accomplished without any third party software ie.
"Bootpart".

<P> If NT is on a Fat partition then install MSdos and use the
NT loader floppy disks to repair the startup environment. If
NT is on an NTFS partition then you will need a Fat
partition to load MSdos. Either way you should get to a
stage where you can use NT's boot manager to select between
NT and MSdos.

<P> 	Boot into dos and from the dos prompt: "copy bootsect.dos
*.lux".

<P> 	Use attrib to remove attributes from boot.ini "attrib -s -h
-r boot.ini" and edit the boot.ini file; after a line
similar to C:\bootsect.dos="MS-DOS v6.22" add the line
C:\bootsect.lux="Redhat Linux".

<P> Save the edited file and replace the attributes.

<P> 	At the boot menu you should now have four options: two for
NT (normal and vga mode) and one each for msdos and Linux.
To get the linux option to work you will have to use
redhat's boot disk to boot into Linux and configure Lilo.
Log on as root and use your favorite text editor to edit
/etc/lilo.conf. Here is a copy of mine:

<PRE>
boot=/c/bootsect.lux
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=1
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.14
	label=linux
	root=/dev/hda5
	read-only
</PRE>

<P> 	It can be quite minimal as it only has one operating system
to boot; there is no requirement for a prompt and the
timeout is reduced to 1 so that it boots almost immediately
without further user intervention. If your linux root
partition is not /dev/hda5 then the root line will require
amendment.

<P> I mount my MSdos C: drive as /c/ under linux. I am sure
this will make some unix purists cringe but I find C: to /c
easy to type and easy to remember. If you are happy with
that; then all that is required is to create the mount
point, "mkdir /c" and mount the C: drive. "mount -t msdos
/dev/hda1 /c" will do for now but you may want to include
/dev/hda1 in /etc/fstab so that it will automatically
mounted in the future; useful for exporting files to make
them available to NT.
	
<P> 	Check that /c/bootsect.lux is visible to Linux "ls
/c/bootsect*"

<PRE>
/c/bootsect.dos  /c/bootsect.lux
</PRE>

<P> Then run "lilo" 

<PRE>
Added linux *
</PRE>

<P> Following an orderly shutdown and reboot you can now select
Redhat Linux at NT's boot prompt and boot into Linux.
	I hope you find the above useful.

<BR>From: Ron Poulton &lt;<A HREF="mailto:thok@surrey1.bc.wave.home.com">thok@surrey1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;</A>

<P> Any modem that is not a WinModem is Linux-compatible, in a nutshell.  Why?

<P> A normal modem has two components:

<UL>
	<LI> the basic analog-to-digital conversion to convert whatever you want to
  send or receive into signals that can be sent on a phone line.
	<LI>extra junk due to compression (to make it transfer at 56K like it should),
  error correction (so that your download doesn't end up messed up due to
  phone line problems), interpreting commands and other neat things.
  </UL>

<P> WinModems (or "software based modems") require that your dialer program
handle the second part up there about compression and error correction.  This
means that the manufacturer only has to implement the first feature, and
therefore means it's cheaper to produce.  MUCH cheaper.

<P> Although there are whispers in the shadows about future WinModem compatibility
within Linux, this feature doesn't exist.  It's always better to go for a
hardware-based modem anyway, because that means your dialer doesn't have to
do all the work, which means your programs may run faster.

<P> This entails the basics.  Check out http://www.56k.com/winmodem.shtml for more
technical information.

<P> Again, if it's not a WinModem, it's Linux compatible.  I use an Aopen 56K
modem and it works beautifully.

ANSWER: <FONT COLOR="navy">2 cents entry: Microsoft Cordless Wheel Mouse
</FONT> </H3>
Sun, 6 Feb 2000 14:54:20 -0500 (EST)
<BR>From: Lee Sonko &lt;<A HREF="mailto:sp1@swiftmail.com">sp1@swiftmail.com&gt;</A>


<P> Getting a PS/2 Microsoft Cordless Wheel Mouse working correctly under X-windows
takes a litte bit of tweaking.

<P> In the Pointer Section of /etc/X11/XF86Config, set the following:

<PRE>
    Protocol    "MouseSystems"
    Device      "/dev/gpmdata"
</PRE>

<P> Then, make your gpm start like so:
<PRE>
    gpm -R -t imps2
</PRE>

<P> You should be all set.

<P> To explain:
-gpm's "-t imps2" option reads the mouse input as if it were a "Microsoft
Intellimouse (ps2) - 3 buttons, wheel unused".
-Then gpm's "-R" option pushes mouse output to /dev/gpmdata in the
"MouseSystems" format.
-So you have to set X-windows to read the new device in the new format.


<P> You can also control mouse speed and acceleration and other things from 
gpm. Check it out.

I'm trying to create a dual boot image with Redhat and NT Workstation. I'm
using Norton ghost version 6 to create the image. It will ghost fine but
after ghosting, lilo comes up as "LI" only. The problem is fixable by
booting to the Linux floppy and rerunning Lilo which rewrites the mbr. After
that everything is great, but why won't Lilo work properly the first time?
I've searched Symantec's page and I've tried the switches but they all

	<P> I have just installed version 6.1 and set up my modem to dial out to my

	pop-up box opens up and wants me to enter the root-password! This does
	not seem right. is there a way to avoid having to enter the root pass
	word when logged on as a non-root user?

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> This is probably related to the permissions of the serial port that your
modem is using.

<P> For instance my modem is /dev/modem. This is a symbolic link:

<PRE>
rsmith@aragorn:~$ ls -l /dev/modem
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           10 Nov 28  1998 /dev/modem -&gt; /dev/ttyS2
</PRE>

<P> Now for the permissions on this device:

<PRE>
rsmith@aragorn:~$ ls -l /dev/ttyS2
crw-r-----   1 root     dialout    4,  66 Feb 22 21:24 /dev/ttyS2
</PRE>

<P> So only the owner [root] has read/write acess [cRW-r-----], and the group
has read access [crw-R-----]. Your setup is probably similar.

<P> So you can do a chmod (see `man chmod') to grant wider access to the
device. This can be done in two ways.  

<P> - You can give read/write access to the group that owns the device (in my
  case dialout), and make yourself a member of the relevant
  group. 
- Alternatively you can give read/write access to everybody. 

<P> Both of these approaches have security implications on a multi-user
machine.

<P> Another approach could be to make pppd setuid root. That means that pppd
assumes the identity of root even if you start it as a normal user. I would
not reccommend this. These suid programs can be a major security risk.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P> I am trying to run Linux on a system with a NEC Multisync monitor. Where
	can I find a driver Or what monitor should I use.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The X Window System doesn't use a monitor driver as such.

<P> Information about the monitor's characteristics should be entered in the
configuration file for the X server program, usually /etc/X11/XF86Config.

<P> Some tools like xconfigurator or xf86config can help you with this. Your
monitor might even be in their database. The X server distribution XFree86
also comes with a list of so-called modelines for lots of monitors.

<P> Alternatively you can use the following example:

<PRE>
Section "Monitor"
    Identifier  "SAM M174"
    VendorName  "S.A.M. GmbH"
    ModelName   "M174"
    HorizSync   30-64   
    VertRefresh 47-100  
    Gamma 1.2
    Mode "640x480@72Hz" # Standard VESA
        DotClock        31.5
        HTimings        640 664 704 832
        VTimings        480 489 492 520
    EndMode
    Mode "800x600@72Hz" # Standard VESA   
        DotClock         50
        HTimings         800 856 976 1040
        VTimings         600 637 643 666
        Flags            "+HSync" "+VSync"
    EndMode
    Mode "1024x768@70Hz" # Standard VESA
        DotClock          75
        HTimings          1024 1048 1184 1328
        VTimings          768 771 777 806
        Flags             "-HSync" "-VSync"
    EndMode
EndSection
</PRE>

<P> It is the "Mode"'s that you want. All VESA compliant monitors should
support these modes. Note that you have to look-up the "HorizSync" and the
"VertRefresh" in your monitor's documentation.

<P> For more in-depth information, see the XFree86-Video-Timings-HOWTO
(usually in /usr/doc/HOWTO/XFree86-Video-Timings-HOWTO.gz)

<P> Your X installation has not been finished. This is/was a common problem
with Red Hat and probably other distro's

<P> Basically, /etc/X11/X is a symbolic link to the real X server (that usually
lives in /usr/X11R6/bin/.

<P> In your case the link probably doesn't point to the right file.

<P> Try configuting X again (using whatever program you used for that) or make
a link using `ln -s' to the appropriate server.
