I have a question about the "finger" option on telnet.  I know that you ccan
find out when someone has logged in by entering "finger name" But I was
wondering if it possible to find out who has tried to finger your e-mail
account??
<br>Please keep my name anonymous.

The short answer:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
If you are the sysadmin, you can run "fingerd" with the "-l" option to
log incoming requests; see "man fingerd".  Otherwise, if you have Unix
progamming experience, it <EM>may</EM> be possible to write a script that logs
information about the requests you get.  If you're merely concerned
about security, the correct answer is to turn off the "fingerd" daemon
or read the "finger" and "fingerd" manpages to learn how to limit what
information your computer is revealing about you and about itself.
However, you have some misconceptions about the nature of "finger" which
we should also address.
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The long answer:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
"finger" and "telnet" are two distinct Internet services.  "http" (WWW)
and "smtp" (sending e-mail) are two other Internet services.  Each
service is completely independent of the others.
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Depending on the command-line options given and the cooperation of the remote
site, "finger <A HREF="mailto:user@host"
	>user@host</A>" may tell you:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(1) BASIC USER INFORMATION: the user's login name, real name,
terminal name and write status, idle time, login time, office location and
office phone number.
</BLOCKQuote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(2) EXTENDED USER INFORMATION: home directory, home phone number, login shell,
mail status (whether they have any mail or any unread mail), and the contents
of their "~/.plan" and "~/.project" and "~/.forward" files.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(3) SERVER INFORMATION: a  &quot;Welcome to ...&quot; banner which also shows some
informations (e.g. uptime, operat­ing system name and release)--similar
to what the "uname -a" and "uptime" commands reveal on the remote system.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Normally, ".plan", ".project" and ".forward" are regular text files.
".plan" is normally a note about your general work, ".project" is a note
about the status of your current project(s), and ".forward" shows
whether your incoming mail is being forwarded somewhere else or whether
you're using a mail filter (it also shows where it's being forwarded to
and what your mail filter program is, scary).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've heard it's possible to make one of these files a named pipe
connected to a script.  I'm not exactly sure how it's done.  (Other TAG
members, please help.)  You use  "mkfifo" or "mknod -p" to create the
special file, then somehow have a script running whose standard output
is redirected to the file.  Supposedly, whenever "finger" tries to read
the file, it will read your script's output.  But I don't know how your
script would avoid a "broken pipe" error if it writes when there's
nobody to read it, how it would know when there's a reader, or how the
reader would pass identifying information to the script.  Each Internet
connection reveal's the requestor's IP, and if the remote machine is
running the "identd" daemon, one can find out the username.  But how
your "finger" script would access that information, I don't know, since
it's not running as a subprocess of "finger", so there's no way for
"finger" to pass it the information in environment variables or
command-line arguments.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, "finger" is much less useful nowadays than it was ten years
ago.  Part of this is due to security paranoia and part to the fact
that we use servers differently nowadays.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(1) Re security, many sysadmins have rightly concluded that "finger" is a big
security risk and have disabled "fingerd" on their servers, or enable it
only for intranet requests (which are supposedly more trustworthy).
Not only is the host information useful to crackerz and script kiddiez,
but users may not realize how much information they're revealing.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

	> [Nick]
The notion that fingerd is a security risk because it reveals
usernames is a bit misleading.  It's true that having information
about login status can be useful (don't try to hack in while root is
on, and don't crack jack242's account while he's logged in, either!),
the real problem is in the implementations of many finger servers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Part of this lay in the fact that finger daemons ran as the
superuser, or root.  On systems that have shadow passwords enabled,
only root can read the file that has the encrypted password data.  A
malicious user wishing to obtain the superuser's password data could
simply create a symbolic link from ~/.plan to <TT>/etc/shadow</TT>, and finger
his or her own account (stolen or otherwise) to display the
information!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is due to the fact that fingerd was written in an era
when most computers on the Internet were run by research institutions.
The security was lax, and people didn't write software with resilience
to mischief in mind.  In fact, adding <EM>features</EM> was the main push
behind most software development, and programs like fingerd contain
some extremely dangerous features as a result.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are, however, some modern implementations that take
security into consideration.  I personally use cfingerd, and have it
configured with most of the options off.  Furthermore, I restrict it
to local traffic only, as was suggested earlier.  I also know that
my file security is maintained, since cfingerd will not follow
symbollic links from .plan or .project files, and it runs as "nobody"
(the minimal-privilege account that owns no files).

(2) Re how we use servers, in 1991 at my university, we had one Unix
computer (Sequent/Dynix) that any student could get an account on.
Users were logged in directly from hardwired text terminals, dialup or
telnet.  You could use "finger" to see whether your friends were logged
in.  Since you knew where your friends normally logged in from, you had
a fair idea where they were at the moment and could meet them to hack
side-by-side with them or to read (Usenet) news or to play games
together.  (Actually, you didn't even need to use "finger".  "tcsh" and
"zsh" would automatically tell you when certain "watched" users logged
in and out.) You could even use "w" to find out which interactive
program they were currently running.  But soon demand went above 350
simultaneous users, especially when the university decided to promote
universal e-mail use among its 35,000 students and 15,000 staff.  The
server was replaced by a cluster of servers, and every user logging in
to the virtual host was automatically placed on one of the servers at
random.  Since "finger" and "w" information--as well as the tcsh/zsh
"watch" service--are specific to a certain server, it was a pain to
check all the servers to see if your friends were on any of them.  About
this time, people started using X-windows, and each "xterm" window would
show up in "finger" as a separate logged-in user.  Also, finger access
became disabled outside the intranet.  "finger" became a lot less
convenient, so it fell into disuse.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(3) "finger" only monitors login sessions.  This includes the "login"
program, "telnet", "xterm", "ssh" (and its insecure cousins "rsh" and
"rlogin").  It does not include web browsing, POP mail reading, irc or
interactive chat, or instant messaging.  These servers <EM>could</EM> write
login entries, but they don't.  Most users coming from the
web-browser-IS-my-shell background never log in, wouldn't know what to
do at the shell prompt if they did log in, don't think they're missing
anything, and their ISPs probably don't even have shell access anyway.
That was the last nail in the coffin for "finger".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So in short, "finger" still works, but its usefulness is debatable.
Linus used to use his ".plan" file to inform people of the current
version of Linux and where to download it.  SSC used to use it to
propagte its public PGP key.  There are a thousand other kinds of
useful information it could be used for.  However, now that everybody
and his dog has a home page, this ".plan" information can just as easily
be put on the home page, and it's just as easy (or easier for some
people) to access it via the web than via "finger".
