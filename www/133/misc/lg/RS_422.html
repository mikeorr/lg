Dear James T. Dennis,
</p>

<p>
I bought a midi interface with rs422 ports,and i read about it(because =
this interface quite old)and i know its for macintosh.
</p>

<p>
But one thing isn't too clear in my mind:
</p>

<p>
Can i use devices with my pc which are made for macintosh?Because i'm =
not sure that those devices are made ONLY for macintosh.
</p>


<p>
Thanks a lot,
</p>

I'm not Jim Dennis - although he started this whole shebang, he hasn't
been around for quite a while - but I'm willing to help to what degree I
can.

In fact, they are. The only internal hardware that I know of that is
swappable between Macs and PCs is memory - and even that's not true in
all cases. Other than that, Apple's hardware and bus architecture is
different from those in the PC, and trying to use pieces of one in the
other is, at best, a waste of time (and at worst, the cause of a
still-smoking machine being dumped in the trash.)

A very good answer.  <strong>Never</strong> try to plug a card intended for one bus
into another.  It will probably go up in smoke if it doesn't just break
the socket.
</p>

<p>
What I do know about RS422 interfaces, is that the last time I saw one
was on an old PDP 11/23+ around 20 years ago.  I have never seen one for
the PC at all.  The port i/o is in fact quite similar to the RS232,
having the same sort of registers and control lines (CD/RTS/CTS/DSR/DTR
&amp; signal ground).  AFAIK, the only real difference is the distance (I
seem to recall 300m) for cable length and supported baud rates.
</p>

<p>
Linux seems to have a couple of drivers for RS422 under Macintosh sound
(this is probably the one), Edgeport, ioc4_serial, Radstone and
RocketPort.
