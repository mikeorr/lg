<h1>The Back Page</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/okopnik.html">Ben Okopnik</a></b></p>

</p>

<p>
<p>
This month, LG is on hiatus. The main, and most obvious reason is that
we're short of good content this month: as has historically been the case
for LG, this time of year is a busy one for most people, and article
submissions take a back seat (and appropriately so) to family turkey
dinners. It would be unreasonable for me to complain... and yet, if we'd
had enough quality content submitted over the previous few months, we could
have built up a small buffer to carry us over. That has not been the case.
In fact, the total number of article submissions has slowly tapered off
over the years, to the point where the continued existence of LG now looms
as a large question mark in my mind. To continue, or not? To be, or not to
be? That, as William Shakespeare wrote, is the question. 
</p>

<p>
Dear readers... we need your input, in more than one way and for a number
of reasons. We need to hear your voices - and firing off an email <a
href="mailto:editor@linuxgazette.net">right now</a>, as you're reading
this, would not be taken amiss - to know that we have an active readership
that wants LG to continue. We need to hear about your commitment to Open
Source, about your willingness and desire to contribute to this community,
by sharing your experiences with Linux and Free software - by writing about
it and submitting articles. We need you to send your Linux-related
questions to <a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net">The Answer
Gang</a> so that we can help you and so that we can share that help, those
solutions, with our readership.
</p>

<p>
Because <strong>you</strong> - you, our readers, our authors, the
participants in this process, the people who get involved and passionate
and interested - you are the reason for the continuing existence of LG. If
you're not there, not involved, and not interested... then LG has outlived
its usefulness to the community, and all that's left is to thank everyone
who has contributed, publish a wrap-up issue, turn off the lights, and go
home. I can only hope that things have not reached that state - and I hope
to see those articles, those questions, that commitment to tell me so.
</p>

<p>
My best wishes to everyone for the holidays - and I hope to see all of you
here in the coming year.
</p>

<p>
Ben is the Editor-in-Chief for Linux Gazette and a member of The Answer Gang.
</p>

<p>
<em>
Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became interested in electricity
at the tender age of six, promptly demonstrated it by sticking a fork into
a socket and starting a fire, and has been falling down technological
mineshafts ever since. He has been working with computers since the Elder
Days, when they had to be built by soldering parts onto printed circuit
boards and programs had to fit into 4k of memory (the recurring nightmares
have almost faded, actually.)
</p>

<p>
His subsequent experiences include creating software in more than two dozen
languages, network and database maintenance during the approach of a
hurricane, writing articles for publications ranging from sailing magazines
to technological journals, and teaching on a variety of topics ranging from
Soviet weaponry and IBM hardware repair to Solaris and Linux
administration, engineering, and programming. He also has the distinction
of setting up the first Linux-based public access network in St. Georges,
Bermuda as well as one of the first large-scale Linux-based mail servers in
St. Thomas, USVI.
</p>

<p>
After a seven-year Atlantic/Caribbean cruise under sail and passages up and
down the East coast of the US, he is currently anchored in northern
Florida. His consulting business presents him with a variety of challenges
such as teaching professional advancement courses for Sun Microsystems and
providing Open Source solutions for local companies.
</p>

<p>
His current set of hobbies includes flying, yoga, martial arts,
motorcycles, writing, Roman history, and <strike>mangling</strike> playing
with his Ubuntu-based home network, in which he is ably assisted by his <a
href="tanaka-okopnik.html">wife</a> and <a href="okopnik1.html">son</a>;
his Palm Pilot is crammed full of alarms, many of which contain exclamation
points.
</p>

<p>
He has been working with Linux since 1997, and credits it with his complete
loss of interest in waging nuclear warfare on parts of the Pacific Northwest.
