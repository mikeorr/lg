<h1>Plots, Graphs, and Curves in the World of Linux</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/okopnik.html">Ben Okopnik</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3>Making the Choice</h3> 
Most people have trouble visualizing the meaning of lists or tables of
numerical data; unless you're an engineer working in a familiar field, a
mathematician used to interpreting matrices, or just plain have the knack
for it, groups of numbers hold little obvious information. However - given
that ~80% of us are visually-oriented in terms of how we best accept
information - graphs, when properly chosen and presented, bring that same
data across in a way that is much easier to comprehend.

<p>As is very common with Linux, particularly in anything related to science,
there's not just one program to do graphs - there's a large list. A quick
scan of the Debian database returns 95 matches for "plot"; not all of these
are plotting utilities, but limiting the list to those that have "plot" or
"graph" in the program definition (rather than the full description) only
shrinks the list to 57. For myself, I experimented with a few of them - I
was looking for something that was not restricted to a specific application
or field, but was a general-purpose plotting program - and quickly settled
on <i>gnuplot</i>.

<h3>Taking Those First Steps</h3>
The initial stage, i.e., learning <i>gnuplot</i> syntax, was surprisingly
easy: the syntax is sensible and structured in such a way that it generally
follows the construction of English. Obviously, there are breaks in that
model - English can be ambiguous, and that is one thing that a computer
language cannot be - but in general, the commands make sense. As well, the
built-in help of <i>gnuplot</i> is a life-saver: you can type "help &lt;command&gt;"
at a prompt, and you'll see the complete syntax for that command as well as
an explanation of what it does, including sub-topical help for each option
of the command. This, by the way, is one of the best textual help systems
I've seen in <b>any</b> program.

<p>The URLs and file locations for the <i>gnuplot</i> FAQ and manual can be
found at the end of this article. However, I found that simply
experimenting with it for about half an hour let me produce usable results
and accomplish what I wanted the first time; later, when I had more time to
spare, I spent a total of about three hours learning it to the point where
I felt reasonably comfortable with it. Despite having used it a fair number
of times since then, I am by no means an expert - but I find it very useful
nonetheless.

<h3>Producing Your First Plot</h3>
If you have a body of data, such as - let's say - a list of 1,000
randomly-generated numbers arranged one per line (<i>gnuplot</i> can use
other layouts; however, this would require using additional syntax),
generating a plot is very easy, and can actually be done right from the
shell prompt:
<pre>
echo 'plot "data"; pause 10'|gnuplot
</pre>
<p>
<img src="misc/okopnik/1st.png" alt="First plot">
<p>
<i>gnuplot</i> will now display your data - after automatically computing
the X and Y ranges, one based on the count of elements and the other on
your values - and show the data points as small red crosses for 10 seconds.
Conversely, you could just type <code>gnuplot</code> at the command line,
then enter <code>plot "data"</code> at the prompt (no pause is necessary -
the image will stay up until you press 'q' to quit.)

<p>However, most people want to do more than just show points on a field.
What about a line graph?
<pre>
echo 'plot "data" with lines; pause 10'|gnuplot
</pre>
<p>
<img src="misc/okopnik/2nd.png" alt="Second plot">
<p>
Red is boring. How about plotting it in blue?
<pre>
echo 'plot "data" with lines 3; pause 10'|gnuplot
</pre>
<p>
<img src="misc/okopnik/3rd.png" alt="Third plot">
<p>
How about plotting the range of sorted file sizes in a directory, with a
separate line showing the magnitude of each datapoint? Sure, we can do
that too - although the "filename" parameter will now be a bit special
(note the preceding &lt; in it; this creates a pipe from the output of the
specified program that <i>gnuplot</i> will read as the data input):
<pre>
echo 'plot "&lt;ls -l /bin|sort -nk5" using 5 with impulses 3; pause 10'|gnuplot
</pre>
<p>
<img src="misc/okopnik/4th.png" alt="Fourth plot">
<p>
<p>Since file size is the 5th column in the output of "ls -l", I've specified
that <i>gnuplot</i> should be 'using' that column.

<p>So far, so good; we've managed to do some useful work at the command
line. Obviously, though, there are many complex tasks that we might want to
perform with our plotting software - and one-line commands don't preserve
our work. Fortunately, <i>gnuplot</i> supports script files; more than that,
that's what it expects to read when you invoke it with a filename.

<h3>Saving Your Work</h3>
Unix FAQ #3,229: "So, what's the difference between a script and a program?"
<pre>
A script is what you give the actors. A program is what you give the audience.
 -- Larry Wall, the creator of Perl
</pre>
<p>Creating a <i>gnuplot</i> script requires nothing more than opening a
text file and entering the desired commands. Just like in a shell script,
the commands may be separated by newlines or semicolons; the two are
equivalent. Also, note that you can abbreviate the <i>gnuplot</i> commands
as long as you keep them unambiguous; <b><code>p "data" w p</code></b> is
the same as <b><code>plot "data" with points</code></b> (don't do this if
somebody else will be reading your script, however; be kind and make the
syntax at least somewhat readable.) I like to name these scripts with a
".plt" extension so that when I hit 'Enter' on one of them in Midnight
Commander, it's automatically loaded into <i>gnuplot</i> (I've set up a
stanza in the MC preferences which does just that), but there's no
requirement of that sort from <i>gnuplot</i> itself.

<p> Let's start with a script that I used just a little while ago to
demonstrate graph creation to one of our recent authors (he had mentioned
that his graph file sizes either came out too large or the labels became
too small and fuzzy to read.) Note that the data I'm using is purely
arbitrary and has no relation to his article - I've just picked some random
numbers.

<pre><hr>
set terminal png size 600, 400
set output 'gnuplot-hor.png'
unset xtics
set ytics
set x2tics ( "XFS" 0, "JFS" 1, "JFFS" 2, "ReiserFS" 3, "ext3" 4 )
set xrange [ -0.5:4.5 ]
set boxwidth 1
set style fill solid border -1
set label "Deleting 10,000 files" at graph .05, .9 
plot "-" notitle with boxes fill, \
     "-" notitle with boxes fill, \

<hr></pre>

Since I want the plot to be saved as an image file, there are two things I
have to set first: the terminal (i.e., the type of output, set to 'x11' by
default) and the output (set to STDOUT by default.) There's a very large
range of terminal options - <i>gnuplot</i> supports a multitude of output
formats - but since we're interested in a small file size and are dealing
with large color blocks, this makes the PNG format perfect for our
purposes. Note that, in keeping with my original purpose of creating a
graph for publication in the Linux Gazette, I've set the size to the
maximum image width we accept - 600 pixels, even if the resulting images
look too large for the purpose. As for the output, I'm going to give it the
same filename as I did to the plot, except the extension is now ".png"
instead of ".plt". 

<p>Next, I'm going to unset the default X tick marks and their associated
values - I want that side of the graph to be empty - and I'm going to set
the "x2tics" (ticks on the opposite side of the graph) to the labels I
want: "XFS" where the 0 would normally be shown, "JFS" at 1, and so on.
Next, I define the X range: each of the 5 bars I'm going to draw is 1 unit
wide with the first one centered on 0 and the last one on 4, which means
that I want the display to begin at -0.5 and end at 4.5. I could, of
course, shift the bar positions to whole numbers - but then the labels
would line up at the half-way positions. 

<p>Now, for a little prettying up: I want a black border around the bars,
and the bars themselves should be nice and wide - I'll set them to 1 unit.
A little more style setting, then a descriptive label set at a position
where it won't interfere with anything, <i>et voila</i> - we're ready to
plot our data!

<p>But wait! Where's our data set? Well, since I want a range of colored
bars, I'm going to have to make an individual plot for each one (since
they're successive plots, <i>gnuplot</i> will color them by progressing
through its color range sequentially - although I could have set the colors
explicitly.) This is how you would normally do a comparison of several data
files; however, here we're plotting only one data point apiece - so I've
decided to include that data right in the script file. Specifying five
separate data sources seems like it would be a lot of work... but not with
<i>gnuplot</i>. All we have to do is specify the "filename" as "-", meaning
standard input, then follow it with the X and Y data terminated by an 'e'
(end) marker. As well, the "plot" command can handle multiple plots all at
once - so that's what I've done here.

<p>Last, I ask <i>gnuplot</i> to execute a shell command by preceding it
with a '!'; in this case, I want to run the "any2png" script (available on
the Net; my tweaked version is located <a
href="http://okopnik.freeshell.org/shell/any2png">here</a>), which squeezes
PNGs down to their minimum size. As a result, I end up with this graph - at
a file size of <b>1354 bytes</b>, with crisp edges and no "jaggies" or
fuzziness in the letters. By comparison, the originals were all in the 20kB
range.
<p>

<img src="misc/okopnik/gnuplot-hor.png" alt="Horizontal plot">

<p> Actually, this isn't exactly the type of graph that the author had
originally presented; his had horizontal bars and a vertical layout. Well,
fair enough - we can do this too, even though it requires a little extra
juggling:

<pre><hr>
set term png size 800, 600
set output 'gnuplot-vert.png'
unset xtics
set ytics rotate
set x2tics rotate ( "XFS" 0, "JFS" 1, "JFFS" 2, "ReiserFS" 3, "ext3" 4 )
set xrange [ -0.5:4.5 ]
set boxwidth 1
set style fill solid border -1
set label "Deleting 10,000 files" at graph .05, .5 rotate 
plot "-" notitle with boxes fill, \
     "-" notitle with boxes fill, \
     "-" notitle with boxes fill, \
     "-" notitle with boxes fill, \
     "-" notitle with boxes fill
0 22

! convert -rotate 90 gnuplot-vert.png gnuplot-vert2.png
! any2png
! mv gnuplot-vert2.png gnuplot-vert.png
</pre><hr>
<p>
<img src="misc/okopnik/gnuplot-vert.png" alt="Vertical plot">
<p>
The differences all come from the "rotate" keywords used in several of the
commands and the final use of "convert" to rotate the entire plot. The
file size in this case came out a little smaller yet - 1332 bytes - and the
script itself isn't any more complicated or difficult.

<h3>Look, Dorothy - it's the Emerald City!</h3>

<p>
<img src="misc/okopnik/gnuplot-surface.jpg" alt="3-D plot">
<p>

If you've never had a chance to play with a 3-dimensional graph - I'm
talking about having the ability to rotate it, shrink or expand it, zoom in
or out, or any combination of the above - you're in for a pleasant shock.
Here's a simple and cute 3D plot of the above function; go ahead and launch
it. You can just start <i>gnuplot</i>, copy the script from the screen and
paste it at the prompt.

<pre><hr>
set xrange [-pi/2:pi/2]; set yrange [-pi/2:pi/2]
set contour
set isosamples 100,100; set samples 100,100
splot sin(x)*cos(y) with lines palette linewidth 4
pause -1
</pre><hr>

Now, place your cursor over the plot and hold down your left mouse button.
Move it around. Now, try your middle button; slide the mouse up and down as
well as from side to side while pressing it. Nice, isn't it? The 'x11'
terminal supports all of that, plus a large range of command line options.
When you install the <i>gnuplot-x11</i> package, that terminal becomes the
default output method for <i>gnuplot</i>. The 'q' key will quit; 'h' will
show you (on the text terminal) the other keys available during the display.

<h3>Last But Not Least</h3>
The material I've covered above has been a bare-bones introduction to
<i>gnuplot</i>; the program is much more flexible, capable, and powerful
than what I've discussed. In the world of Linux, the more tools you have in
yor toolbox, the better off you are - and the more capable you are of
performing a wide range of tasks. Given that visual methods are a large
part of how we humans communicate, I believe that <i>gnuplot</i> should
definitely be a part of everyone's standard toolbox.
