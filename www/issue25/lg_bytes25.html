Netscape Announces Plans To Make Source Code Free
</H3> 
January 22, 1998 
<P> 
     Netscape Communications Corporation today announced bold plans
     to make the source code for the next generation of its highly popular
     Netscape Communicator client software available for free licensing on
     the Internet. The company plans to post the source code beginning
     with the first Netscape Communicator 5.0 developer release, expected
     by the end of the first quarter of 1998. 
<P> 
     Netscape is releasing its currently available Netscape Navigator and
     Communicator Standard Edition 4.0 software products immediately
     free for all users. 
<P> 
     In addition, the company separately announced the launch of an
     aggressive new software distribution program called "Unlimited
     Distribution" to broadly distribute its market-leading Internet client
     software for free. Unlimited Distribution enables Original Equipment
     Manufacturers (OEMs), Internet Service Providers (ISPs),
     telecommunications companies, Web content providers, publishers
     and software developers to download and redistribute Netscape
     Communicator and Netscape Navigator easily with "no strings
     attached." 
<P> 
     To read and post reactions about this latest announcement, <I>Linux
Journal</I> has added a discussion group to our <A

Japanese Word Processor
</H3> 
<P> 
Perhaps you'd like to work on another exciting project?  There is
a Windows application, called JWP -- a Japanese Word Processor.  This
package was written by Stephen Chung, and as a GNU product it is freely
distributable.  I've used it extensively over the past few years, and
it is a *great* package.
<P> 
Unfortunately, JWP is only available for Windows right now, which is
locking out a lot of people under other platforms who might benefit from
it.  As Stephen is quite busy with full-time work and maintaining the
Windows versions (he's developing version 2.00 now), Steve Frampton has
decided to go ahead with a port to X-Windows.
<P> 
The JWP-Port Project home page contains more information on the JWP
package as well as the JWP-Port project itself.  If you are interested,
please visit the page at <A HREF="http://qlink.queensu.ca/~3srf/jwp-port/">

Quikscript
</H3> 
<P> 
Quikscript is a PostScript text formatting and typesetting program.
It enables documents to be prepared on any type of hardware, using
visible layout marks to control the appearance of the output, and
produce output on a PostScript printer by despatching Qs and the
document file to the device.  No processing is performed by the
host hardware;  all processing is done within the printer.
<P> 
The advantage that Quikscript provides, other than portability,
is precision of control over output.  Because it is written in
PostScript, it is interpreted at run-time within the printer.
It is possible to create documents that modify the Quikscript
program during execution.  It is very easy to include other
PostScript programs or fragments with Quikscript.  It is possible
to use special PostScript fonts, such as hand-generated ones.
Graphics generated from a variety of sources can be easily included,
as can text output from computer programs.  It is possible to embed
Quikscript within a document, such as an advertisement or a telephone
bill.
<P> 
The Quikscript distribution is available by anonymous ftp from
"ftp.adfa.oz.au" in the directory "pub/postscript".  It may also be 
accessed through the World Wide Web at URL
