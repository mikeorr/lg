Thanks to all our authors, not just the ones above, but also those who wrote
giving us their tips and tricks and making suggestions. Thanks also to our
new mirror sites.
<P> 
With this issue, <EM>Linux Gazette</EM> has a new editor.  My name is Mike
Orr, and I have been SSC's Webmaster since April.  Margie is still here to
advise me on the <EM>Gazette</EM>, and without her and Darcy's help, this
first issue would not have come out.  Special thanks also goes to
Jim Dennis and Heather Stern, who also helped me out immensely this month.
<P>
I have been a Linux enthusiast since November 1991 and got my own computer
to install Linux on in 1993.  I started with SLS and Slackware, but have been
running Debian since 1995.  At times I can be seen lurking on the debian-devel
mailing list, but currently I hang out mostly in the comp.lang.python
newsgroup.  
<P>
I have a personal web page at

Have fun!
