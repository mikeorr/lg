Hi Rick,
</p>

<p>
Just a quick note responding to your comment in the "More About RHX" 
section of RHX. We're working on a solution that will make the license 
approach used by each RHX software vendor very clear to users, including 
whether or not they are OSI-approved. I'd love to get your feedback on 
our approach if you have the time and interest. Let me know....
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
Matt
Product Manager, RHX
</p>

Hi, Matt.  Thank you for your note.  
</p>

<p>
The main problem is actually the statements on the RHX main Web pages
that serve as entry points to RHX (and, in the recent past, by all RHX
press releases).  For example:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/rhx/">http://www.redhat.com/rhx/</a>
<pre>
  Starts out with "Trusted open source software" -- without saying that 
  some offerings are open source and some proprietary -- and goes on for
  the entire page talking how RHX has helped you select open source 
  applications, etc.
</pre>
<a href="http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/support/article/DOC-1285">http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/support/article/DOC-1285</a> ("More about RHX" page)
<pre>
  Starts out with "Red Hat Exchange helps you compare, buy, and manage
  open source business applications. All in one place and backed by the
  open source leader. We've collaborated with our open source software
  partners to validate that RHX applications run on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux and are delivered through the Red Hat Network."
</pre>
Letting people _dig down_ to licensing specifics would be nice but
wouldn't fix the problem of false and misleading general statements 
everyone encounters on the way in.  The latter should be replaced
without delay.
</p>

<p>
And future RHX press releases should mention that it includes both
proprietary and open source applications.
</p>

<p>
The longer the delay in fixing this problem, the more Red Hat's
reputation for integrity is suffering.  Please make no mistake:  Your
firm is being damaged by this.
</p>

<p>
It's credible that someone in Marketing went off the reservation in the
first place, in creating the deceptive Web pages and press release text,
<em>but</em> it strains credulity to suppose that nobody within the firm had
noticed the misrepresentation of fact, over several months.
</p>

<p>
I find the feet-dragging disappointing.  They <em>should</em> be rushing to fix
this.

Rick,
</p>

<p>
Thanks for the quick response.
</p>

<p>
You raise some great points. You're right about the marketing copy in 
those sections. We'll take a shot at updating them. We're also working 
with the OSI to provide easy-to-understand descriptions of what users 
can, and can not, do according to each license agreement on RHX. Stay 
tuned...and let me know if you have other thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Thanks!
Matt

I'm also somewhat reminded of a quotation passed along, recently, by my
friend Karsten Self, who heard it from a career Army officer:  "It's
difficult to hold a conversation with someone whose livelihood requires
that he not understand you."
