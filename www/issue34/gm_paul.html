Paul Sargent over at 3Dlabs was quite helpful in the writing of this article.&nbsp;
When I started researching video cards I found I'd fallen way behind on
hardware memory types.&nbsp; I&nbsp;asked him for short descriptions or
definitiions and he came through with a terrific response.&nbsp; I've included
it here.&nbsp; Its a little more technical than the rest of the article,
but will definitely be of interest if you have a need to understand the
hardware a little better.</FONT></FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT>
<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>EDO RAM</FONT></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>This is the stuff that was
found in PC's about two years ago.&nbsp; Basically it's normal DRAM with
_E_nhanced _D_ata _O_ut functionality.&nbsp; This means that the graphics
controller can perform burst reads on the memory, hence increasing the
amount of read bandwidth from the memory.&nbsp; For example this would
make the read half of a BLIT that much quicker.&nbsp; It's a single ported
memory (see below).</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT>
<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>VRAM</FONT></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>This is normal DRAM (sometimes
with EDO functionality). It's big thing is that it's dual ported. I'll
deal with Dual Vs Single ports a bit later. It also has some special features
like block writes (see SGRAM)</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT>
<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>SDRAM</FONT></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Synchronous DRAM is the stuff
you find in your new PC's (Pentium II's and such like). This type of memory
tends to run about 3-4 times as fast as EDO DRAM. It supports functions
such as burst writes and burst reads.&nbsp; All Synchronous Memory I've
ever heard of is Single Ported.</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT>
<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>SGRAM</FONT></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Synchronous Graphics RAM
is the same stuff as SDRAM, but it contains various features that are graphics
specific. For example, Block Writes allow an area of memory to be filled
with a single colour by issuing only one write. Combine that with Masked
writes (another SGRAM feature) where you can load a bit mask to say which
pixels are written to and you have a very powerful mechanism for drawing
things like single colour text.</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT>
<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>WRAM: Windows RAM</FONT></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>WRAM was developed by Mitsubishi
for E&amp;S (I believe) and is a variant on VRAM. They included some more
special feature that are graphics related, but it's based on old technology.
It's dual ported like VRAM.</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT>
<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Single Vs Dual Ports:</FONT></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Imagine a RAMDAC. It needs
to send signals to the monitor each 75th of a second to refresh the display,
therefore it needs to know what colour all the pixels should be. Therefore
one way or another the graphics controller must supply the RAMDAC with
the full contents of the framebuffer each frame. There are two ways it
can do this.</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>1) It can periodically read
a batch of pixels from the Frambuffer and squirt these down a dedicated
pixel bus that lies between the Graphics controller and the RAMDAC. The
trouble is, while it's doing this the graphics controller can't do any
reads or writes to the framebuffer for normal jobs. This becomes more of
a problem as the screen resolution goes up.&nbsp; More reads have to be
performed to keep the RAMDAC fed. If this doesn't occur the display would
have artefacts, so these reads takes priority over everything else. The
net result is as the display resolution goes up, the performance of the
graphics card goes down.</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>2) The RAMDAC can have it's
own connection to the graphics memory. By doing this the data stream required
to refresh the display doesn't get in the way of the graphics controller.
Therefore screen resolution tends not to impact performance (i.e. a 100x100
pixel BLIT will take the same amount of time, but remember that you now
have a larger screen to fill. The graphics controller tends to do more
work at higher res's anyway)</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Method 1 is the only option
with single ported RAM (EDO, SDRAM, SGRAM) and Method 2 is a better if
your using Dual ported RAM (VRAM, WRAM)</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The thing is that these days
the memory bandwidth has got large enough that the bandwidth needed to
refresh the screen is becoming less of a problem, and there are no fast
Dual ported memories any more.</FONT></FONT>

What are the differences between these?&nbsp; My understanding is that
VRAM and EDO RAM are primarily used on older cards (>2 years old) and SGRAM
is the latest thing, fastest because of how its integrated with the video
processor.&nbsp; Am I close?</FONT></FONT></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>You're time scales are about
right, for reason of speed see above.</FONT></FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1><B><FONT COLOR="#993300">'Muse:</FONT></B>&nbsp;
An old article from ComputerShopper.com says that 3D cards (from early
1997) used VRAM for displaying video and DRAM for offscreen display and
textures.&nbsp; How does DRAM fit into the current picture then?</FONT></FONT></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Cards tend to only have one
type of memory on them these days, and the Graphics controller stores everything
in it. That said, if we were to make a card with a memory arrangement like
that on it, we would replace the VRAM with SGRAM and the DRAM with SDRAM.</FONT></FONT>

Boy, no wonder the average person gets lost trying to set up X on Linux.</FONT></FONT></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>This sort of stuff doesn't need
to be visible to the end user, and hopefully more recent cards are getting
better at hiding it.</FONT></FONT>
