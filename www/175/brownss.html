<h1>NAT routing with a faulty uplink</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/brownss.html">Silas Brown</a></b></p>


<p>
Faulty uplinks are common, especially if you are using a UMTS (or GPRS)
modem over a mobile phone network.  In some cases <tt>pppd</tt> will
automatically re-establish the connection whenever it goes down, but if it
doesn't you can run a script like this:
</p>

<pre>
export GoogleIp=74.125.127.100
while true; do
  if ! ping -s 0 -c 1 -w 5 $GoogleIp &gt;/dev/null
  &amp;&amp; ! ping -s 0 -c 1 -w 5 $GoogleIp &gt;/dev/null
  &amp;&amp; ! ping -s 0 -c 1 -w 5 $GoogleIp &gt;/dev/null
  &amp;&amp; ! ping -s 0 -c 1 -w 5 $GoogleIp &gt;/dev/null; then
    echo "Gone down for more than 20secs, restarting"
    killall pppd ; sleep 1 ; killall -9 pppd ; sleep 5
    # TODO restart pppd here; give it time to start
  fi
  sleep 10
done
</pre>

<p>
Each <tt>ping</tt> command send a single empty ICMP packet to Google and
waits up to 5 seconds for a response.  Four failures in a row mean the
connection is probably broken so we restart <tt>pppd</tt>. I use a more
complex version of this script which, if it cannot get connectivity back by
restarting <tt>pppd</tt>, will play a voice alert over the speakers (as
there is no display on the router machine); the message asks for the modem
to be physically reset.  (This message is in Chinese because that's what
I'm learning; it tends to surprise anyone who's visiting me at the time.
See <A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/141/brownss.html">An NSLU2 (Slug)
reminder server</A> in LG #141.)
</p>

<H2>NAT</H2>

<p>
Many Linux administrators will be familiar with how to set up a NAT
router using <tt>iptables</tt>, for connecting other computers on a local
network to the outside world.  NAT (Network Address Translation) will not
only forward outgoing IP packets from any of your computers, but will also
keep track of the virtual connections that these packets are making, so it
knows which computer to forward the replies to when they arrive.  The basic
way to set up NAT is:<p>


<pre>
modprobe iptable_nat
iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE
</pre>

<p>
However, there is a problem with this basic NAT setup: It doesn't cope
at all well if the uplink to the outside world has to change its IP
address.
</P>

<H2>Stuck connections</H2>

<P>
If the uplink is broken and re-established, but one of your other
computers continues to send IP packets on a previously-opened connection,
then the kernel's NAT system will try to forward those packets using the
same source port and IP address as it had done before the uplink failed,
and this is not likely to work.  Even in the unlikely event that
<tt>pppd</tt> acquired the same IP address as before, the ISP's router
might still have forgotten enough of the state to break the connections.
One simply cannot assume that already-open connections can continue to be
used after a modem link has been re-established.
</p>

<p>
The problem is, there may be nothing to tell the applications running on
your other computers that their individual connections need to be dropped
and re-established.  Applications on the <em>same</em> computer stand a
chance because the operating system can automatically cut their connections
when the interface (ppp) goes down, but it's not so easy to tell
<em>other</em> computers about what just happened to the interface.  Should
any of them try to continue sending IP packets on an old connection, the
packets will be faithfully forwarded by NAT using the old settings, and
probably get nowhere.  In the best case, some upstream router will reply
with an ICMP Reject packet which will tell the application something has
gone wrong, but more often than not the packets simply get lost, and your
application will continue to hold onto the opened connection until it
reaches its timeout, which could take very many minutes.  (One example of
an application where this is annoying is the Pidgin instant messaging
client.  It may look like you're online and ready to receive messages from
your contacts, but those messages won't reach you because Pidgin is holding
onto an old connection that it should have discarded when your uplink was
renewed.)
</p>

<h2>Clearing the connections</h2>

<p>
Ideally, it would be nice if the NAT router could, as soon as the
connection is renewed, send a TCP "reset" (RST) packet on all open TCP
connections of all your computers, telling them straight away that these
old connections are no longer useful.  Unfortunately, this is not practical
because to send a reset packet you need to know the current TCP "sequence
number" of each connection, and that information is not normally stored by
the NAT lookup tables because NAT doesn't need it for normal operation.
(It <em>is</em> possible to flood your local network with thousands of
reset packets on all possible sequence numbers, for example by using a
packet-manipulation library like Perl's <tt>Net::RawIP</tt> or a modified
version of the <tt>apsend</tt> script that uses it, but it takes far too
long to go through all the sequence numbers.)
</p>

<p>
Unless you patch the kernel to make NAT store the sequence number, the
best you can hope for is to send a reset packet the next time an outgoing
IP packet from the old connection is seen going through your router.  This
is normally soon enough, as most applications will at least have some kind
of "keep-alive" mechanism that periodically checks the connection by
sending something on it.
</p>

<p>
Here is the modified NAT setup script.  Besides <tt>iptables</tt>, you
will need a program called <tt>conntrack</tt> which is normally available
as a package.
</p>

<pre>
modprobe iptable_nat
iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
iptables -F FORWARD
iptables -A FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --syn -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset
conntrack -F
echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>conntrack -F</tt> command tells the kernel to flush (i.e. clear)
its connection-tracking tables, so it doesn't know about old connections
anymore.  That by itself is not enough, however, since any further attempt
to send IP packets on these old connections will cause NAT to add them back
into its tables and the packets will still be forwarded; this time they
probably will reach the remote server, but it won't recognise them because
they'll be coming from a different source port (and probably a different IP
address), and if it's not very nice (as many servers aren't because they
have to live in a big bad world where people launch denial-of-service
attacks), it won't bother to respond to these stray packets with ICMP
rejections, so your application still won't know any better.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, as well as flushing the connection-tracking tables, we add
some filtering rules to the <tt>FORWARD</tt> queue that tell the kernel to
reject any attempt to send TCP packets, unless it's either making a new
connection (SYN set), or it's on a connection that we know about.  (Note
that we do have to specify that a new TCP connection is one that has SYN
set; we can't use the <tt>NEW</tt> criterion in iptables' conntrack module,
because that will say it's new if it's part of an old connection that just
isn't in the table.  For the same reason, we can't use conntrack's
<tt>INVALID</tt> criterion here.) If the IP packet is not from an established
connection that we know about, then it's probably from a connection that
existed before we flushed the tables, so we reply to it with a reset
packet, which should cause the application to realise that this connection
is no longer working and it should try to make a new one.  (Pidgin will
actually prompt the user about this, but if it's left unattended then after
a short time it will answer its own question automatically and
reconnect.)
</p>

<p>
Non-TCP packets (UDP etc) are not affected by this filter, because it
would be very hard to determine accurately whether they're part of an old
"connection" or a new one. (It's also not possible to send a "reset" packet
outside of TCP, although an ICMP rejection can still be generated. For TCP
connections I'm using reset rather than ICMP-reject because reset seems to
have a more immediate effect, although I haven't proved that properly.)
Thankfully, most Internet applications (particularly the ones that are
likely to run unattended) use TCP at least for their main connections, so
TCP is probably all we need to concern ourselves with here.
</p>

<p>
All that remains is to arrange for the above NAT script to be re-run
whenever <tt>pppd</tt> is restarted.  That's why it includes the
<tt>iptables -F</tt> instructions to clear the IP tables before adding
rules to them; if you always start by clearing the table then running the
script multiple times will not cause the tables to become cluttered with
more and more duplicate rules.
</p>

<h2>Et tu, ISP?</h2>

<p>
In conclusion I'd like to hazard a guess about some of the cases of
"stuck SSH sessions" that happen even when the uplink in general seems to
be working.  Sometimes it seems that new connections work but old
connections are frozen, although nothing ever happened to the uplink (it's
still running and was not restarted).  I wonder if in this case some NAT
box at the ISP simply forgot its association table, and has not been
configured to send reset packets as above.
</p>

<p>
Of course I do set <tt>ServerAliveInterval</tt> in my
<tt>~/.ssh/config</tt> to make sure that any idle SSH sessions I have will
periodically send traffic to keep reminding the ISP's NAT boxes I'm still
here so please don't discard my table entry yet.  I use the line
<tt>ServerAliveInterval 200</tt> in <tt>~/.ssh/config</tt> for this.
</p>

<p>
But sometimes a session can still hang permanently, even while I'm
actively using it, and I have to close its window or press <tt>~.</tt> to
quit it, although at the same time any <em>new</em> connections I make work
just fine.  Perhaps this happens when some event at the ISP causes a NAT
box to forget its translation table ahead of schedule.  It would be nice if
they could use a script like the above to kindly send their customers
TCP-reset packets when this happens, so we're not just left hanging
there.
