Saving Trees: Laying up Multiple Pages per Printer Sheet

<P><STRONG>
Hi Answerguy
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I'm running Solaris 2.6 and I'm using HP Jetadmin to administer my network
HP laser printers. I've seen some organization who are able to print double
pages on 1 sheet, with the time stamp, user as well as page number
information neatly printed on the side. All I'm able to achieve now is
printing 1 page per sheet and the formatting is ugly.
I know I can use HP JetPrint to format my printing, but is there any other
alternative way?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Please help
</STRONG></P>

Kong Liong

Is this a PostScript (TM) printer?  If not you probably want to
install a Ghostcript filter so that any PostScript that you send
to the queue will be converted into your printer's native control
language (some version of PCL for your HP).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Once that is accomplished it's very easy to configure your system
to perform lay up as you describe.  There's a program called
'<tt>mpage</tt>' which is commonly available with Linux distributions
(you'll have to dig around to find the sources and compile them
for Solaris).  It's what you want.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
'<tt>mpage</tt>' (<A HREF="http://gate.mesa.nl/pub/mpage"
	>http://gate.mesa.nl/pub/mpage</A>) allows you to print 1,
2, 4 or 8 pages of text per side of a printed sheet.  It does
this by arranging the text into PostScript pages, and using the
scaling and rotation features of PostScript to do the the layout.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
'<tt>mpage</tt>' will add a small frame and a set of headers and footers
to each printed sheet by default.  It offers a number of options
to disable or control these features.  There's where you can get
your filename, date, username and other information onto the
output.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
That's fine for text.  However, your output is already in
PostScript there's a program called '<tt>pstops</tt>' which can do a
PostScript to PostScript "conversion/translation" according to
the parameters you specify.  In that model you can provide it
with parameters to scale each odd numbered page to 60%, rotate it
ninety degrees, position it on an output sheet, take every even
numbered page, scale it, rotate it another direction, add it to
your output page, etc.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Notice that I gave an example of scaling/reducing the pages by
less than 50% for a reason.  It turns out that typical margins
around your original pages are just a bit larger than they need
to be when you do this layout.  So scaling by 55% to 65% actually
produces better looking and more readable output.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It can be a bit tricky to get your pstops parameters right.
While I was writing my book I'd generate the PS file from my
LaTeX <tt>.dvi</tt> files (using '<tt>dvips</tt>'), then for some of the draft
printouts I'd use '<tt>pstops</tt>' to lay that out and '<tt>gv</tt>' to select
the even sheets (print those), and finally use '<tt>gv</tt>' to toggle my
sheet/page selections, turn the paper around and print the
other sides.  Most of the work was done by my book's Makefile
(using '<tt>make</tt>').  The result was that I could generate a full
draft of my book while only using about 100 sheets of paper for
400 pages of writing.  (Luckily my eyes are fine with the reduction).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Here's a sample '<TT>pstops</TT>' command like the one that I used:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><code>pstops -q -pletter "2:0L@.7(21cm,0)+1L@.7(21cm,11.6cm)" 
		lsa.ps &gt; /tmp/quarto.ps
</code></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(The term "quarto" is probably a misnomer here --- but
that's what I called it in my Makefile).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
While writing this I've been running a couple of web searches in
my other '<tt>screen</tt>' terminals (to get a good URL on mpage and to
check the man page).  While I was doing that I noticed that
'<tt>mpage</tt>' wasn't installed on my 
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> box so I did an '<tt>apt-get
install</tt>' of that and found that it apparently supports layup of
PostScript as well as text files.  It's probably a newer version
than I remember.  Possibly it's just a feature that's been there
for years, which I just never noticed before.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Considering how obtuse the '<tt>pstops</tt>' command arguments can be
perhaps you should just stick with '<tt>mpage</tt>'.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
'<tt>pstops</tt>' is part of the PSUtils page by Angus J. C. Duggan
(<A HREF="http://www.tardis.ed.ac.uk/home/ajcd/psutils"
	>http://www.tardis.ed.ac.uk/home/ajcd/psutils</A>).  There are a
number of other free tools that he's provided which might be of
interest to anyone with advanced printing needs.  In fact,
glancing at his web page I see that I probably should have been
using '<tt>psnup</tt>' instead of '<tt>pstops</tt>' for what I was doing.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Oh well.  Live long enough and you can learn lots.  One of the
reasons I spent so much time on TAG is that it gives me the
incentive to double check the man pages and look up the web sites
for packages that I use --- so I often learn new tricks in the
process.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Incidentally I'd like to make a special notice on Angus' web page
for the PSUtils package.  It's beautiful.  There's lots of very
useful information about the package --- and he's taken the time
to give credit to a large number of people that inspired his work
or otherwise contributed to the package.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Thanks, Angus.  (I've copied you, and the current maintainer of
'<tt>mpage</tt>' on this message.  It will be published in the Linux
Gazette Answer Guy column later this month.  Linux Gazette is
at <A HREF="http://www.linuxgazette.net"
	>http://www.linuxgazette.net</A> --- which is odd since it's a
free webazine with very little commercial sponsorship).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><em>[ Given the number of commercial support bullets, and the generous
	 hosting by SSC, I'm tempted to disagree on the amount of commercial
	 sponsorship, though I must admit that I'm very pleased not to
	 see it smothered with "regulation size" banner ads.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In any event, Mr. Wong, I hope these tips will help you get what
you want out of your printer.  Of course, there are many other
print filtering packages available for Linux and other forms of
UNIX.  I'm sure I'll learn about a few more, probably as a result
of some future "Answer Guy" question.
