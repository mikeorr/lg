<p>I'm writing this article after a couple of weeks of messing around 
getting our local school network hooked up to the net. Our problem was 
similar, I guess, to that of many schools: how do you give students' 
boxes access to the net, but restricting both certain types of content 
and certain services altogether (IRC)?</p>

<p>A minor extra point was that I wanted to separate our two 
computer labs' networks into different segments with some kind 
of packet filtering in between. With the number of computers  going up, so 
was the collision rate.</p>

<p>I had the following material considerations to take into account:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>A connection to our ISP via an ISDN card - of a make unfortunately not 
supported right now by the Mandrake kernels I use. So the box connecting 
directly to the net had to run under Windoze, with the WinGate proxy 
installed. This is not in itself a bad thing, as configuring dial-on-demand 
on a Linux box would have taken too much of my time to find 
out how it is done.</li>
<li>An eclectic collection of Windows 95 / 98 / 2000 client machines, 
plus an occasional Macintosh and PC under Linux or QNX. All running 
various browsers.</li>
<li>A P-III 450 MHz I managed to scrounge, with several ethernet cards. 
This one was to do the filtering, and was so definately a Linux box.</li>
<li>Finally, I wanted http and ftp access to a local web server in 
much the same way as access to the net: i.e. the user just has a 
different address to type in.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>By now, the network hardware setup was more or less clear, thusly:</p>

<p align=center><img src="misc/ward/net1.jpg"></p>

<p>The filtering server also runs our local web server (Apache).

<p>Now came the interesting part: how was I to configure the lot into a 
working setup?<p>

<p><b>The Linux built-in firewall</b></p>

<p>My first idea was to use Linux' routing capacities. You can set 
up just about any Linux box as a router to separate two or more ethernet 
segments. It just needs a card for each segment - not even necesserily 
running at the same speed. You then configure the kernel built-in firewall 
to ignore packets that have source and destination addresses within 
the same segment, but to forward packets with source and destination 
addresses in different segments.</p>

<p>This can be a definite gain of speed as the number of collisions 
on an ethernet network goes up with the number of nodes on each 
segment - and each collision requires a time-out to retry sending 
the packet. So, for example, three segments with ten nodes each and a 
Linux firewall in between outperforms a single segment with all 
thirty nodes under normal and heavy traffic loads.
 
<p>For more information, read the Firewall-HOWTO and the ipchains manual 
page</p>

<p>A simple setup would then be to program the clients to use the 
net access server as their web proxy, and use the filtering server 
as a firewall. This is just about the most classical distribution of 
roles imaginable.</p>

<p>So why couldn't this work for me? The answer lies in the fact that 
to enable routing, both the client boxes and the net access server had to 
have the filtering server as their gateway. This worked fine as long 
as the ISDN wasn't up. But when ISDN went up, the default gateway on 
the net access server (running under Windows, remember?) became our 
ISP.</p>

<p>So a request emanating from a client box goes into the filter, 
and is forwarded to the net access. The WinGate proxy does its 
stuff, and replies to our local client - but this message is 
routed back off to our ISP ... and the client gets no reply.</p>

<p><b>The Squid proxy</b></p>

<p>As a second approach, I thought of using the squid proxy, 
cascaded under WinGate. This way, a client request goes to squid on the 
filter. Squid then determines if the request goes to the local 
server, or has to be forwarded to the WinGate machine:</p>

<p algin=center><img src="misc/ward/net2.jpg"></p>

<p>And did this work? Yes, very well ... as long as the client 
requested either the local server or an internet website by giving 
its IP address. The problem was with DNS.</p>

<p>The squid proxy has to determine where to send each request. 
So even if you give it a default cascaded proxy, it still tries 
to perform DNS address resolution on each URL it receives.</p>

<p>I then tried the following: set up WinGate as a DNS proxy 
as well as www, and tell the filter to use the net access 
box as its main DNS. The requests went through to WinGate, 
but got no reply from the 'net. Confounding ... and the client 
box gets a message from squid complaining it can't proceed with 
address resolution. Needless to say, 
the net access server's DNS setup works well on its own.</p>

<p>Another approach was to use the Apache webserver's proxy 
capabilities. This worked just as well - and just as badly - 
as squid.</p>

<p>Recommended reading: all 1907 lines of /etc/squid/squid.conf . 
Same for /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf .</p> 

<p><b>Homebuilt Java proxy</b></p>

<p>As you may imagine, I was at this time fresh out of ideas. And 
school-in was 48 hours away. So I took the only reasonable decision - 
write my own proxy daemon in Java, to be installed on the filter.</p>

<p>This may take a bit of explaining. First of all, why is writing 
a proxy daemon reasonable? In this case, the proxy just had to:<br>
<ul>
<li>accept a socket connection from a client, and read the client browser's 
request;</li>
<li>establish a second socket connection to WinGate, send the client's 
request on with no changes;</li>
<li>listen on the second connection, and send whatever came down 
the line back on the first connection;</li>
<li>terminate the first connection as soon as the second one is dropped 
by WinGate.</li>
</ul></p>

<p align=center><img src="misc/ward/net3.jpg"></p>

<p>There is no caching, no address resolution, nothing else to be done.</p>

<p>Secondly, why is it reasonable to write such a program in Java, 
when network programming is traditionnaly done in C? Mainly because 
programming sockets in C is a pain, and doing it in Java is painless. 
All relevant classes are available in java.net.* : Socket, ServerSocket, 
DataInputStream and PrintStream are about all you need.</p>

<p>It is also as easy in Java as is C to fork off a process to handle 
separately each client connection. The difference is that in Java, 
one usually uses a <u>thread</u>, not a separate process. This has some 
advantages on the typical C solution. Each process has its own memory 
allocation, etc, and so takes relatively longer to establish. A thread 
is an altogether lighter structure.</p>

<p>Finally, it works. To be quite honest, it works more quickly 
than I thought, and what was initially conceived as a quick solution 
looks to stay as a permanent one. In fact, with 20-30 clients going 
full steam on Internet, the limiting factor is ... our ISP.</p>

<p><b>Future improvements</b></p>

<p>Just one on my TODO list: as it stands, there is no page 
content filtering. I will work on that later on (and cut out 
web-based chats at the same time).</p>

naturally under GPL. Please send me any comments you may have.</p>
