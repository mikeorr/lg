Good stuff. Thank you! I've modified it a tiny bit by adding
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>die "Usage: ", $0 =~ m{([^/]*)$}, " &lt;iso_file|cd_device&gt;\n"
        unless @ARGV &amp;&amp; -e $ARGV[0];
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
at the beginning - just in case I forget how to use it - and modified the
"open" to check the return value in case of problems:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>open CD, $ARGV[0] or die "Can't open $ARGV[0]: $!\n";
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
It's great otherwise - I've already got it stowed away as "iso9660info" in
my "<TT>/usr/local/bin</TT>".

If your spanish is rusty, the paragraph above the Perl code reads more

<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
'Nevertheless, before someone asks "How can I find out who prepared
the CD? When? For what company? Does it belong to a multiple-CD set?
Which one on the set is it?", and since I know <em>that</em>  isn't in the
HOWTO, allow me to present a small fragment of (hopefully useful) code.
BTW, the comments along de Volume Descriptor are nothing but the
appropiate mkisofs options needed to fill the values while creating
the ISO image.'
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
If that sounds harsh is because someone <em>suggested</em>  that I didn't know
jack about the ISO-9660 filesystem and was quoting HOWTO's to get
credit &lt;g&gt; (go figure). And so I made a pun at the end of the message,
but only works in spanish.

Didn't sound harsh to me - I certainly give (and get!) credit for quoting
HOWTOs. The trick is knowing which <em>ones</em>  to quote, and which part.
Besides, why does it matter where you got the answer as long as it's right?

I just came across in your November issue a question on reading the
volume label from a CD. If it's in ISO9660 format, which includes the
Joliet type CD your reader was burning, it's actually pretty easy to
write a command line tool to read the label.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Here's a bash shell script:
</STRONG></P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="../misc/tag/blum-rd_label.bash.txt">blum-rd_label.bash.txt</a></tt></p>
<P><STRONG>
Note that the parameter is the device file for the CD, e.g. <TT>/dev/hdc</TT>,
and that the CD does not have to be mounted. You need to be 'root' to
run the script.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Here's a C program to do the same thing. I've used this program under
both Linux &amp; IBM's AIX.
</STRONG></P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="../misc/tag/blum-rd_label.c.txt">blum-rd_label.c.txt</a></tt></p>
<P><STRONG>
The only real advantage of the C program is that when compiled the
executable can be made suid to root, allowing you to run the program as
a non-root user. Just as with the shell script the parameter is the
device file for the CD, and the CD does not have to be mounted.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Hope you find this useful! Thanks for your publication - I've learned a
lot from it over the years.

I finally broke down and read the iso9660 format instead of sleeping the
other night.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Here are the basic commands to get the data. It will clean it up later to
make sure there is a disk in the drive first, and that no errors have
occurred. It should run dd only once to load the CD header into a file.
Then report the results out of that.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I don't know what formats will be compatible with this, but it seemed to
work fine on all of my Windoze CDs and even my <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> install CD. I guess
I will have to check and make sure that it will work with UDF format someday.

&lt;wince&gt; This is not a good idea. You're hitting the hardware device over
and over when you could do it all in one read:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>#!/bin/sh
# Make sure that a block device was specified
[ -b "$1" ] &amp;&amp; { printf "Usage: ${0##*/} &lt;cd_device&gt;\n"; }

# Read the entire header
data=`dd if=$1 ibs=863 skip=32769 count=1 2&gt;/dev/null`
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Now you can let your CD go back to sleep, and extract whatever pieces you
wanted from the variable:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>echo "FSTYPE: ${data:0:5}"
echo "OSTYPE: ${data:6:32}"
...
...
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
This also lets you cut out the temporary variables.

	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Mike] 
Ben's suggestions got me wondering - did all those clever tricks really
work?  Unfortunately not, because the CD header format includes a lot of
NUL characters (ASCII 0) which bash treats as "end of variable".

<br>863
</font></code></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Works for me, Mike. The problem may be that you're not quoting the string -
or, quoting the individual chunks (<em>not</em>  quoting them is what I use to get
rid of the extra whitespace.) I didn't experiment with this all that much,
but I tested the solution that I suggested, at least for the first few
variables:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>#!/bin/sh

data="`dd if=/dev/hdc ibs=1024 skip=32 count=1 2&gt;/dev/null`"

echo "FSTYPE    :" ${data:1:5}
echo "OSTYPE    :" ${data:8:32}
echo "CDNAME    :" ${data:40:32}

</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
provides the output:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>ben@Baldur:~$ ./cdinf
FSTYPE    : CD00
OSTYPE    : LINUX
CDNAME    : LNX
</pre></blockquote>

Here's my version of the CD volume label extractor... the handling of non-UTC

&lt;gazes admiringly at the data = dd stuff piped through tr line&gt;
That <em>is</em> a cute trick, though. &lt;stuffing it away in my own toolbox&gt;
Thanks!

<blockQuote>
An even cheaper way to fold that whitespace: don't quote the variable.
"bash" will swallow anything that is defined as the first two characters
of $IFS - and that happens to be spaces and tabs.

That's why you only do that when printing out the individual variables, not
for the entire string. The program flow is "get string -&gt; grab chunks via
offsets -&gt; print w/o spaces."

Now all I am missing is the cd serial number that Windoze generates. I

I seem to vaguely remember Windows showing some weird number. Are you sure
it's not stored in the CD header itself? Note that I'm not saying that it
is; I'm just wondering.

 The file creation is completely unnecessary,

 I think this would be even better. What we <em>really</em>  care about is that
we have data in $data, right? Best to test the end result - although
intermediate tests, in addition to the final one, certainly don't hurt.

If I
want to use tr to trap for weird characters, then I will have to store the
data somewhere. I suppose it is possible for it to crash before reaching
the rm -f <TT>/tmp/cdinfo$$</TT> line but, if that does happen I probably have
something seriously wrong with tr.

Well, Mike's contention was that you would lose anything past a null when
just assigning it that way. I didn't do any rigorous testing, but I'm
willing to believe - "\0"s being the way strings are normally terminated.
The one header that I tested didn't chop off short, but it may not have
contained any nulls.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
BTW, Mike - that "tr" function could stand a bit of twiddling. 
	<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)"
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
 The extra
'\'s in your "first list" convert backslashes to '.'s; the '*' in your
"second list", as the second character, has the "truncated second list"
effect - i.e., all matches other than backslashes will be converted to
asterisks. That's probably not what you wanted.

Thanks! Just a matter of clean code. Although printing out an unquoted
"$data" has a <em>very</em>  interesting result: it shows the header with all the
control chars converted to stars... and immediately followed by a listing
of the current dir. Why is only the last asterisk interpolated? &lt;shrug&gt;
These are the questions that try men's souls.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I usually try to make sure that my code doesn't do anything that I
didn't tell it to do, like hanging out in seedy bars with suspicious
characters and drinking till all hours. Gotta watch that stuff, or - bam! -
it'll grab your credit card and be buying drinks all around.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
As well, since all of the data is in the first K, it's not necessary to
grab a 2K block; and since the numbers divide neatly by 1024, it's more
effective to have "dd" reading it a K - rather than a byte - at a time.

Also a good point,  although I'd go one stage further since the CD block
size is standardised as 2K,  it's probably most clear (and quickest...?)
to use
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>data=`dd if=$1 bs=2048 skip=16 count=1 2&gt;/dev/null|tr '[\000-\037]' '.'`

Yes...  The drivers "probably" optimize the command, but it would be
