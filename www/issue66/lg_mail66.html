<!-- ::
Device Drivers for Linux Gazette
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:: -->
<P><STRONG>
Hi. Just dicovered Linuxgazette today. This is a really great site.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
If you are looking for article ideas, I'd like to see an article, or
even series, on writing device drivers for Linux. This is a topic I
have found very little information about on the net.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Just my two cents.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Writing the Linux kernel's device driver interfaces are enough
of a subject to fill a whole book.  Maybe the O'Reilly
<EM>Writing Linux Device Drivers</EM> (by Allessandro Rubini) and
their <EM>Understanding the Linux Kernel</em> by Daniel Pierre Bovet
(among others) would be a good choice for you.
</P>
<P>
As for documention online:  You could always read the sources,
copy and paste parts of the Makefiles, copy an existing (similar)
device driver and edit.  I realize that this is a horrible
oversimplification; but that's how must of the Linux kernel hackers
started.

<BR>Vivek Kumar (<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net?cc=ascon_system@netkracker.com"
	>ascon_system from netkracker.com</a>)

<P><STRONG>
how to write a parallel port device driver,ie, interrupt driven.
Not, for printer, but,for general device connected to EPP port..?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
If you need something to be interrupt driven than you need a
kernel module.  You might be able to have a very simple kernel
module that simply relays the interrupt as a character through
a device node.  Then you could have a user space process listening...
</P>
<P>
[ Some guesses about the nature of <TT>poll()</TT> and <TT>select()</TT>, 
trimmed. ] Please post a message to a good linux programming
newsgroup for better details.  Actually I've posted an abstracted
version of this question to the 
<a href="news:comp.os.linux.development.system"
	>comp.os.linux.development.system</a>
newsgroup on your behalf.  So, perhaps there's already an answer
waiting...
<br>-- JimD</P>

<p><em>Well, the Answer Guy is just barely getting into this subject,
	so for this topic, he's a newbie like the rest of us.  It 
        looks like some of our weekend mechanics really want to get 
        down into the spark plugs, there.
	So, if anyone feels inclined to write a down and dirty device
	driver article that explains a bit of deep wizardry in plain
        english, especially if it covers something that's new in the 
        2.4 series kernels, we'd love to publish it. -- Heather</em></p>

<p><em>Or if anybody would like to dissect and explain a small driver
	they've written, that would also make a good article. -- Mike</em></p>

<P>
Finally, a way to subscribe to Linux Gazette!
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> has long had the lg-issue## packages.  Now it has a couple
new packages:
</P>
<ul>
<li> lg-subscription : install new issues as they arrive.
<li> lg-ltest-two : install the latest two issues and remove older ones.
<li> lg-all : install all of the currently-available issue.
</ul>
<P>
Of course, it adds/removes packages only when you do a general package
update.
Note that these programs are supported by Debian, not by <EM>LG</EM>.</p>
<P>
-- Mike (your friendly <EM>Linux Gazette</EM> Editor)
</P>
<P>
Looks like you have to get it from testing (aka woody) or unstable (aka
sid) but at least it shouldn't require a libc update, if you temporarily 
add one of these to your sources list to get them.  If one of these 
<EM>does</EM> ask for a libc change, it's a packaging bug and you should 
report it immediately.
</P>
<P>
But be especially careful to change things back, or you may find yourself
in for a big surprise when you run "<tt>apt-get upgrade</tt>" to catch
the latest security patches.  -- Heather

<BR>Dave Tabor (<a href="mailto:gazette@linuxgazette.net">dtabor from mageeop.com</a>)

<P><STRONG>
Hi,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Just a note of constructive criticism.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I just read a copy of your writing of "Integrating" Linux/sendmail with MS
Exchange, on this site.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
<A HREF="../issue38/tag/5.html"
	>http://lhd.datapower.com/LDP/LDP/LG/issue38/tag/5.html</A>
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
It's something you wrote in 1999, so you may be writing differently now.  If
so, please disregard this letter.
</STRONG></P>

<p>What you are about to say is still valuable as a reminder to new members
   of the Answer Gang, potential article authors, and in fact just about 
   anybody who hopes to be a very vocal Linux advocate.  So I hope you
   don't mind that we've published it anyway.  -- Heather</p>

<P><STRONG>
Although I found this information helpful, you appear to have trouble
staying on track with the useful information, and like to get off subject
with the Microsoft bashing.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I do use Microsoft products, as well as Linux and AIX products, and
understand your point of view (even agree with most, if not all, of it).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
My constructive criticism is that you should refrain from the Microsoft
bashing or at least keep it to one line, and keep more to the point of
trying to relay useful information.  (I'm assuming that is what you are
really trying to do.)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
If someone is having trouble with something like integrating sendmail and
exchange, they may not have a choice about what systems or software to use,
and just need some well written, detailed information, not an anti-Microsoft
commercial.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
- Dave
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Thanks, Dave.  Issue 38 was a long time ago now.
</P>
<P>
The Answer Gang now includes a number of more cheerful sorts in addition to
the curmudgeonly Answer Guy himself.  One or two even still use Windows for
some of their work.  (Note: we avoid answering Windows questions at all,
unless they're really about working with Linux environments.)  Having more
of us frees the ones who really don't want to touch anything about MS, from
even having to answer.  Also, a heavier editorial hand is being applied now.
</P>
<P>
As for myself, I look forward to the day when systems will be sufficiently
easy to use that it will not be clear... nor terribly necessary to know...
which OS is chugging along "under the hood".  I don't think that day is at
all <EM>close</EM> but I look forward to it anyway.

sorry pal, but after reading your reponse to a post for help, i couldnt

very much surprised if anyone would want you on the payroll....

<P>
[ HTML version of same text, also deleted ]
</P>
<P>
Curiously, he chose to "rag" on the Answer Guy for one of his clearer
answers to an unclear question.  He calls him a bad name, then signs
off "respectfully".  Right.
</P>
<P>
Is it really "insensitive" to mention that LG has a search engine
(<A HREF="http://www.linuxgazette.net/search.html"
	>http://www.linuxgazette.net/search.html</A>)?  
Nope, I think not.
</P>
<P>
Is it "insensitive" to ask that querents mention what they've tried
already?   Maybe - but it's a fact of life in tech support, most people
say "it's broken" not "I tried this, and that, and the other thing, and...
yada yada ... anyways so you can see I tried everything, and it hates
me".  In plain verbal conversation it's rude to maunder on like that,
so people tend not to do it.  In tech support, the more info you can
send us (that is related to the question) the better we can help.  If
this were a phone call, we could have this merry back and forth, and
it still probably wouldn't take an hour.  At typical Answer Gang speeds
though... more info will help you as much as it helps us.
</P>
<P>
Is it "insensitive" to suggest that the poor bloke may have to buy a
new card or new server?  Probably.  Oh well.  Life's tough that way
sometimes.   Turns out that he's probably okay, according to another
reader who assured us that the Jotan is indeed a Trident relative.
</P>
<P>
Is it insensitive to send us the same text as both plaintext and HTML?
No, usually it just means someone didn't know how to turn off this "feature"
(cough cough.  cough.  no, I'm okay.  cough cough.  water.  Ahem) in
MS Outlook.  Try this great answer from Chris G. in last month's Answer Gang:

	>http://linuxgazette.net/issue65/tag/8.html</A>
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
Lastly, I'm pretty sure it's insensitive to publish this, but Joe, you
mailed us, and this is what we normally do with letters to the editors.
Let us know when you have a linux question, and we'll try to answer it --
if you give us enough information!
