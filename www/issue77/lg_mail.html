<P>
First, some recommendations for a video card (other than Nvidia) that works
very well with Mesa and other standard OpenGL apps.  I'm considering Ati
Radeon, but would like to hear input from others.
</P>
<P>
Second, I have a TNT2 and run the Nvidia drivers and Nvidia GLX.  I have
had random success compiling OpenGL based programs in the past.  Today, I
learned that Nvidia's headers are not placed in <TT>/usr/include/GL</TT> 
so as not to
override the defaults that are installed with your system.  I'm not sure
whether this was a recent addition to the Nvidia readme, or I just missed it
all those times in the past.  I run slack 8.0 and often create packages from
the sources I compile to be used on other systems.  If I switch to using the
nvidia OpenGL headers will this cause problems with systems not running
Nvidia GL?
</P>
<P>
Thanks for considering my issues.

Hello:
</P>
<P>
I am doing my homework for the "Networking" class, if you can help me
I'd appreciate it.
</P>
<P>
How do I create a VPN with two PC's using Linux 7.0 and Freeswan 1.4 ?
</P>
<P>
How do I configure the files ipsec.conf and ipsec.secrets ? Besides, I
want to find out if the connection works using ping and telnet with and
without encryption from a PC to the other and, lastly; using Etherreal,
how can I verify if a packet is or is not encrypted. ?
</P>
<P>
I want to do all this using first fixed IP addresses and later on
dynamic IP addresses; let me show you the example with a fixed IP first:
</P>
<P>
PC1 has ip 1.2.3.225 and PC2 has ip 1.2.3.226, gateway has ip 1.2.3.1.
How do I configure this with Freeswan ?
</P>
<P>
Second, with fixed IP on PC1 and PC2 has IP x.x.x.x, gateway remains the
same with ip 1.2.3.1. How do I configure this with Freeswan ?
</P>
<P>
The LAB DIAGRAM to comply with is as follows: How do I make to configure
all this with Freeswan ?:

<BR>Heather Stern (<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net?cc=pea@ahlquist.org&subject=%20Re%3A%20%5BLG%2077%5D%20help%20wanted%20%234%20very%20dynamic%20linking">The Editor Gal</a>)
<br>answer offered by Paul E Ahlquist Jr 

<P><strong>
In Issue76 [Heather] mused....
</strong></P>
<P><STRONG>
...a way to ask a program which libraries it is potential-linking
as well as dynamic-linking to, ...
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Paul Ahlquist answered with this basic Tip:
<br>If your system lib's deity of choice is "ld", then "ldd" should
answer the burning question.
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
Hmm, I guess I wasn't entirely clear what I was really asking:
</P>
<P>
dynamic-linking:  as in not static, see 'ldd'.  Binaries which are dynamically
linked will fail if the library is not present.  This is what almost every
program on the planet does, because nobody wants to waste the memory space
for extra copies of glibc, at least without a good reason.
</P>
<P>
potential-linking:  as in "if this library is not present I won't shed a
tear, but if it <EM>is</EM> I'd like to use GTK please", see ... ?
</P>
<P>
Such a binary would have to somehow check that the library was somewhere
it had access to, then use <TT> dlopen()</TT> to request loading the one 
it found.  'strings' might reveal it, but I'm not sure how reliable it is
for this, thus the question.
</P>
<P>
I suppose not very many people code potential-linking into their programs,
so it's not the first thing that leaps to mind; still... since I mention
"dynamic linking" in the same sentence as this other sort, one would have
thought I meant <EM>something</EM> different?
</P>
<P>
Anybody know a reliable way to ask a program about the library-load
requests it <EM>hopes</EM> to make?   (as opposed to <EM>has to</EM> make)
</P>
<P>
But while I'm at it, another question:
if anyone knows a reliable way to ask a binary which libraries it has been
statically-linked to, that'd be nice too.  'strings' usually <EM>does</EM> 
reveal this, but... anyone know how reliable or complete it is?
</P>

<P>
Hi, dear Heather,
</P>
<P>
This is Clement from University of Virginia. I am working
on a project involving serial port programming under linux.
I am new in the linux world and don't quite know where to
start.
</P>
<P>
I have read most of the Serial-HOWTO online but none gave
me the information that I needed.
</P>
<P>
I came across the linuxgazette.com and saw your discussion
on serial programming. I am wondering if you can give me
some pointers here. Any help will be greatly appreciated.
</P>
<P>
Things that I am trying to do:
I want to connect the 9DB RS232 on my linux box to a
Ericsson Bluetooth module. At the same time, I want to use
one of unused pins, RI or CD pin for instance, to serve as
a trigger to another circuit. Therefore, I need to be able
to turn that specific pin to high and low at desired time.
</P>
<P>
My questions are:
</p><ol>
<li> How can I control a specific pin?
<li> What are the header files I shall be looking at? (I have
been using termios.h and fcntl.h along with some other
files. However, I found it very hard to understand. )
</ol>
<P>
Thank you very much. I am looking forward to hearing from
you.
</P>
<P>
Clement Song

<br>Answer offered by Ben Okopnik

<P>
Two questions - one hardware matter, <EM>probably</EM> not linux.  The other, a
good question, especially in the general form, and would make an excellent
article.
</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000066"><EM>
I have an V90/K56flex external modem that I use to connect with my ISP via
a dial-up line. The modem obeys the Hayes command set. Now the point to
note is that I have make a long distance call or STD call as we call it here in
India, to establish a connection. This might seem a very expensive
thing to do but I have no other option. Now each time I establish a
connection using kppp the modem waits for almost 40secs inbetween
transmission of packets whose duration is approximately 5secs. Thus after
establishing a connection the modem activity is as follows:
</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000066"><EM><BLOCKQuote>
40secs-no TD/RD, 5secs-TD/RD, 40secs-no TD/RD, 5secs-TD/RD, ........
</BLOCKQuote></EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000066"><EM>
Is this normal or is something wrong? Do you think there is something
wrong with some configuration somewhere?
</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I suspect that there <EM>is</EM> something wrong... but it's most likely not
configuration, at least not software-wise; it's either your modem, or your
ISP.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000066"><EM>
The same thing happens in Windows too.
</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
So... it's got nothing to do with Linux, then.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Try using another modem, preferably with a different computer, from your
location. If the problem persists, it's your ISP. If it goes away, it's
your computer and/or modem.
</STRONG></P>

<!-- sig -->

<P>
Thanks for your prompt reply. I have been trying out your suggestions.
Unfortunately there aren't any Linux boxes in my locality. Changing the
computer does not seem to improve the performance of the modem. As for
trying out another ISP, I don't have any options.
</P>
<P>
Are there any parameters in the Hayes set that could affect the TD/RD rate
of the modem?
</P>
<P>
Finally may I add another question? Could someone point me to an article
or HOWTO about setting up qmail in a stand-alone home computer for
transfering mail to an ISP mail server over a dial-up line. The
documentation with the package isn't of much help.

<p><em>I considered putting this in TAG - it's a mite large for Tips - but
since I've given the nod to our readers rather eloquently, I put it here 
instead. Thanks to all our fans -- Heather</em></p>

<P><STRONG>
Hi,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I was disturbed to read Heather's suggestion to put kernel modules on a
<TT>/boot</TT> partition ("booting multiple linux distributions" TAG #5, Issue
76).  My question is, why would you bother to do this?  It seems error
prone to me.
</STRONG></P>

<blockquote>
<P>
Because on triple boot systems where all three are Linux, it means they
can all use the kernels.  As soon as the symlinks are established it works
marvelously - personal experience.
</P>
<P>
I didn't recommend it as the only thing one could do;  just a possibility
among many, and part of an answer to a question asking "which partitions
can be shared?"
</P>
<P>
To summarize:  <TT>/tmp</TT>, swap, and ... if you are careful ... <TT>/home</TT> and <TT>/boot.</TT>
If "error prone" are the kind of words that scare you from even trying
something, or learning what "careful" means for your context, you should
share neither <TT>/home</TT> nor <TT>/boot.</TT>
</P>
</blockquote>
<P><STRONG>
Unlike the kernel itself(1), modules are read through the filesystem so
their visibility does not depend on which partition they are on.  In
fact, putting them on <TT>/boot</TT> means they are not available until <TT>/boot</TT> is
mounted, which is noticably after the kernel is loaded.  This
complicates the boot process by adding a dependency that <TT>/boot</TT> must be
mounted before any modules are loaded.  (Normally <TT>/boot</TT> doesn't need to
be mounted at all unless building kernels or modifying lilo).
</STRONG></P>
<blockquote>
<P>
The kernel wouldn't load sanely if a module were needed to mount <TT>/boot</TT>
successfully.  In my philosophy <TT>/boot</TT> is always mounted read-only because
I keep its symbol map there, and a copy oof the .config I used to make it.
</P>
<P>
But of course, I build kernels all the time, it's something I do for clients
as well as myself.
</P>
</blockquote>
<P><STRONG>
Further, there is more chance of causing collisions between distros in
the modules tree.  Presumably multi-boot systems use a separate /
partition for each distro.  This means that each will have its own
<TT>/lib/modules</TT> tree with subtrees for each kernel version.  Moving each of
these to <TT>/boot</TT> means that each distro shares modules with the others.  I
would guess that usually that won't be a problem, but if it is then it
would probably be hard to debug.
</STRONG></P>
<blockquote>
<P>
kernels are not distro specific and anybody who tries to tell you so needs
to be whapped a good one.  The only thing about them that even <EM>approaches</EM>
it is that some distros are kind enough to package kernel-and-module kits
for you.  For each distro:
</P>
<P><CODE>
ln -s /lib/modules /boot/modules
</CODE></P>
<P>
There, now they are all happy.  "complicated" ?  no.  "error prone" ? only
if you're foolish enough to trust a packging system to remove kernels for
you.  The only one I even let <EM>try</EM> is debian, and then only when I have
known good kernels that LILO knows about already.
</P>
<P>
mounting <TT>/boot</TT> earlier in a startup sequence may be needed for some distros.
If one such distro is among your dual-or-more Linux mix,  then I heartily
recommend initrd so you'll never need to worry about that.

But it works fine for mixing <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> with RedHat, as of a few revisions ago
on both of them.

The only advantage I can see to putting modules on <TT>/boot</TT> is being able
to share disk space for them between distributions.
</STRONG></P>
<blockquote>
Gawd yes.

<P><STRONG>
But the
complication of having several distros mucking with each other's modules
seems to outweigh that.
</STRONG></P>
<blockquote>
I don't let package managers "muck" with my kernels and you shouldn't either.
As soon as you know enough about what you want in kernels to care this deeply
then you should not be worrying about packaged kernels anymore - roll your
own, make it match your real hardware, and use the same, well behaved kernel
no matter which userland you select to run today.
</blockquote>
<P><STRONG>
I don't follow Heather's assertion that running
a 2.4.x kernel package and a 2.5.x kernel built from source is simplier
with this scheme - the modules are already kept separate in <TT>/lib/modules</TT>
by separate version directories.  Am I missing something more
significant?
</STRONG></P>
<blockquote>
Ohhh, you had some sort of delusion that I was taking (for instance) 2.2.18
modules, 2.4.12 modules, 2.4.19-pre3 modules, and throwing them all in one
directory together?  <EM>That</EM> certainly wouldn't work.
</blockquote>
<P><STRONG>
Certainly this method can be made to work, but I would guess it is only
for sophisticated users with specific circumstances.  That's not typical
of readers of The Answer Gang, is it?
</STRONG></P>
<blockquote>
<P>
There is no such thing as a "typical" reader of The Answer Gang.  We get
complex questions, simple questions, complex phrasings of simple questions
(ugh), and simple phrasings of complex questions (yay!).  We get discussions
about the deep magic of programming and how to properly use the "date"
program.  And everything in between.
</P>
<P>
If you assume that by having a worldwide audience we are always going to
play to the dumbest possible reader, sorry but that's not so.  Every member
of the Gang will answer any given question their own way;  when all is said
and done, I'm mostly just turning a conversation originally written "radio
reciever" style (everybody gets their say in big paragraphs) into a more
readable "group conversation" style.
</P>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<P>
In <EM>my</EM> case, by the time someone is considering triple booting anything,
they are sophisticated enough to consider options such as these that I
have used.
</P>
<P>
But a good point to bring up is:  distros do change over time.  Something
that worked very nicely a year ago may be all wrong now, or very complicated
now, or just have a much easier answer at hand now.  As with maps, the
picture and the advice are not the territory itself.

(1) Boot loaders like lilo need to load the kernel as disk blocks using
bios calls.  There was a period when disk sizes were large enough that
the bios could not address the entire disk.  On such a system, it is
convenient to make a <TT>/boot</TT> partition at the beginning of the disk so
lilo will be able to load the kernel.  On smaller disks or with newer
bios, this work around isn't necessary.
</STRONG></P>
<blockquote>
<P>
But may be handy if you have a disk disaster, to know that kernels were
nearer to the front than the back of the drive.
</P>
<P>
Of course if you fear this, give up on LILO and switch to a boot loader
which will seek out kernels wherever they happen to live on the disk.
(Advice good for PC users only.  Sparc's SILO already does that.)
</P>
</blockquote>
<P><STRONG>
P.S. <TT>/lib/MOVING</TT> can be deleted safely before rebooting.  Although
directory information will be removed immediately, open files will not
have their inodes freed until they are closed.  That's why <TT>/lib/modules</TT>
can be replaced by a symlink while the system is running in the first
place.
</STRONG></P>
<blockquote>
<P>
If one is going to be complicated, it pays to keep an eye on the details.
In this case it cautions one, and may even comfort one, that you have not
deleted the original directory until you actually make that choice, as a
sysadmin, and after your new boot sequences are tested.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.toms.net/rb/">Tom's rootboot</A> is good to have around too.

Thanks for the reply Heather.  I'm amazed how quickly you guys turn questions
around.  I used to be an avid LG reader and just picked it up again this month.
Now I remember why I liked it so much

</em></p>
<P>
Ahh, I see.  I had assumed you had different kernels for different distros 
but of course the first time I found myself building the same kernel on two 
different distros I'd realize they should be shared.  I guess I don't use 
enough different distros at the same time to run into that, which is why I 
asked about it.

Thanks for enlightening me.

<p><em>...no such thing as a "typical" reader of The Answer Gang.  ... more

<P>
Well, I appreciate that immensely.  It's always nice to have something 
intriguing to think about even though the overall topic may be well known 
(if not to beginners).  You do a great service to your readers when you 
throw in a little something over their heads.  It gives them something 
further to explore rather than making them think everything has been 
said (never the case, of course).

Count me a fan!

<BR>Multiple recruiters (<a href="mailto:gazette@linuxgazette.net?subject=%20Re%3A%20%5BLG%2077%5D%20gazette%20matters%20%231%20job&20postings">anonymous</a>)


<P>
We got a handful of a requests for job postings this month.  Here's the
policy.
</P>
<HR width="10%" align="center"><P>
LG doesn't publish job listings because they are temporary in
nature.
</P>
<P>
LG is for more permanent material.  Job openings change so frequently
that by the time the next issue is published, the job could well be filled.
And if we publish one job listing, we'd have to publish them all.
</P>
<P>
We do not currently have any other place to post job listings, so I
suggest you try another site such as 
<a href="http://mojolin.com/">mojolin.com</a>, 
<a href="http://dice.com/">dice.com</a>, 
<a href="http://monster.com/">monster.com</a>, etc.
</P>
<P>

<em>
<p>Sadly jobs.osdn.com closed down, but they recommend (in addition to some
of the above) <a href="http://www.hotlinuxjobs.com/">hotlinuxjobs.com</a>,
<a href="http://www.brassring.com/">Brass Ring</a>,  and 
<a href="http://www.jobpenguin.com/">JobPenguin</a>.
</p>
<P>
Attending any of the related user groups in the region to make your
announcement may also be valuable.  It may be useful to consider if you
need someone who already has the skills, or if you'd gladly settle for
someone talented enough that they can become the person you seek to hire.
</P>
<p>
SSC, our host, also hosts a "Groups of Linux Users Everywhere" resource
listing a lot of LUGS worth visiting:

<p><em>...after some effort to get Mike his article submission...</em></p>

<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
PS: I'm trying a roundabout route to get this email to you; it seems
that your email server doesn't like my ISP's email server and has
rejected my last two attempts at emailing this to you. Since my ISP is a
large Canadian provider, it may take some time to persue and correct the
mutual email problems, and in the mean time, I'm trying this end-run to
get the article to you.
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P>
Our sysadmin Dan Wilder verified we're refusing mail connections from
sympatico.ca because they're refusing mail connections from us.  Or rather, the
connection times out when we try to reach them.  This causes a load on our
mail server because the message sits on our outgoing queue for several days as
it keeps trying to send it.  Ask your ISP whether their mail server is
blacklisting ssc.com.  If not, we'll turn off the lock.  But you may mention
that we're still unhappy about the large amount of spam we receive from
sympatico.ca.
</P>
<P>
Setting up a mail server in send-only mode is a common tactic by spammers.
Not saying that sympatico is doing this, because they need to receive mail
for their users.  But that's why we block out any site that sends us mail but
consistently refuses connections from us.  They do it because those "1 million
e-mail address" lists have a large number of obsolete addresses that cause
bounces, and their mail server couldn't handle the bounce traffic.  (Or maybe
it could, but that would slow down their spam-sending. 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> ) 
Which is exactly what's happening: sympatico users send spams to fifty
or a hundred accounts here that have been deactivated or never existed, and our
mail server bogs down trying to send back the bounce messages--which they
refuse.  But probably what sympatico has is a misconfigured mail server.  Our
error message tells who to call if their postmaster cares.  From
/etc/postfix/access:
</P>

<p><TT>sympatico.ca 550 You refuse our connections so we refuse yours: 1-206-782-8808
if you have corrected the problem.
</TT></p>
<P>
I'm cc'ing your sympatico address with this letter to see if it gets through.
