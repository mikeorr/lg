<P>SSC is expanding Matt Welsh's <I>Linux Installation & Getting
Started</I> by adding chapters about each of the major distributions. Each
chapter is being written by a different author in the Linux community.
Here's a sneak preview--the Caldera chapter by Evan Leibovitch.--editor

<p>This section deals with issues specific to the Caldera releases of
Linux, how to install the current release (Caldera OpenLinux) and
prepare for the steps outlined in the following chapters. It is
intended to be a complement to, not a replacement for, the "Getting
Started Guides" Caldera ships with all of its Linux-based
products. References to the Getting Started Guide for Caldera Open
Linux Base will be indicated throughout this chapter simply as "the
Guide".

<h3>What is Caldera?</h3>

<p>The beginnings of Caldera the company come from an internal Novell
project called "Corsair". While Novell had owned Unix System V in
the early 1990s, Corsair was formed to see if there were things Novell
could learn from Linux.

<p>Corsair was a casualty of the changing of the guard at Novell that
also caused it to sell off Unix to SCO and WordPerfect to
Corel. Novell founder Ray Noorda gave startup capital to this group
with the intention of making Linux available in a manner that would be
as acceptable to business users and corporate MIS as commercial
versions of Unix. Caldera is a privately-held company based in Orem,
Utah.

<p>The implementation of this goal has resulted in a series of
Linux-based products that "broken the mold" in a number of
ways. Caldera was the first Linux distribution to bundle-in commercial
software such as premium X servers, GUI desktops, backup software and
web browsers; at the time of writing, Caldera is the only Linux
distribution officially supported by Netscape.

<h3>The Caldera Network Desktop</h3>

<p>Caldera's first product, the Caldera Network Desktop (CND), was
released to the public in early 1995 in a $29 "preview" form (a
rather unusual manner to run a beta test), and in final release
version in early 1996.  The CND was based on the 1.2.13 Linux kernel,
and included Netscape Navigator, Accelerated-X, CrispLite, and the
Looking Glass GUI desktop.  It also was the first Linux release to
offer NetWare client capabilities, being able to share servers and
printers on existing Novell networks.  Production and sale of CND
ceased in March 1997.

<h3>Caldera OpenLinux</h3>

<p>In late 1996, Caldera announced its releases based on the Linux 2.0.25
kernel would be named Caldera Open Linux (COL) and would be made
available at three levels;

<ul>
<li>COL Base, which includes Navigator, CrispLite, and the Metro-X server;

<li>COL Standard, which would add the Netscape FastTrack secure web
server, the StarOffice desktop productivity suite, and NetWare
connectivity;

<li>COL Deluxe, which incorporates all the features of Standard and
also offers NetWare--server--capabilities.
</ul>

<p>As this is written, only the COL Base release is shipping,
and feature sets of the other packages are still being determined.
For specific and up-to-date lists of the comparative features of the
three levels, check the Caldera web site <a href="http://www.caldera.com">http://www.caldera.com</a>.

<p>Because all three levels of COL build on the Base release, all three
are installed the same way. The only difference is in the different
auxiliary packages available; their installation and configuration
issues are beyond the scope of this guide. Most of COL's add-on
packages contain their own documentation; check the /doc directory of
the Caldera CD-ROM for more details.

<h3>Obtaining Caldera</h3>

<p>Unlike most other Linux distributions, COL is not available for
downloading from the Internet, nor can it be distributed freely or
passed around. This is because of the commercial packages which are
part of COL; while most of the components of COL are under the GNU
Public License, the commercial components, such as Looking Glass and
Metro-X, are not. In the list of packages included on the COL media
starting on page 196 of the Guide, the commercial packages are noted
by an asterisk.

<p>COL is available directly from Caldera, or through a network of
Partners around the world who have committed to supporting Caldera
products. These Partners can usually provide professional assistance,
configuration and training for Caldera users. For a current list of
Partners, check the Caldera web site.

<h3>Preparing to Install Caldera Open Linux</h3>

<p>Caldera support the same hardware as any other release based on Linux
2.0 kernels. Appendix A of the Guide (p145) lists most of the SCSI
hosts supported and configuration parameters necessary for many
hardware combinations.

<p>Taking a page out of the Novell manual style, Caldera's Guide provides
an installation worksheet (page 2) that assists you in having at hand
all the details of your system that you'll need for installation. It
is highly recommended you complete this before starting installation;
while some parameters, such as setting up your network, are not
required for installation, doing it all at one time is usually far
easier than having to come back to it. Sometimes this can't be
avoided, but do as much at installation time as possible.

<h3>Creating boot/modules floppies</h3>

<p>The COL distribution does not come with the floppy disks required for
installation. There are two floppies involved; one is used for
booting, the other is a "modules" disk which contains many hardware
drivers.

<p>While the Guide recommends you create the floppies by copying them
from the CD-ROM, it is better to get newer versions of the disks from
the Caldera web site. The floppy images on some CD-ROMs have errors
that cause problems, especially with installations using SCSI disks
and large partitions.

<p>To get newer versions of the floppy images, download them from
Caldera's FTP site. In directory {\tt pub/col-1.0/updates/Helsinki}, you'll
find a bunch of numbered directories. Check out the directories in
descending order---that will make sure you get the latest versions.

<p>If you find one of these directories has a subdirectory called
<pre>bootdisk</pre>, the contents of that directory
are what you want.

<p>You should find two files:

<pre>install-2.0.25-XXX.img
modules-2.0.25-XXX.img</pre>

<p>The <pre>XXX</pre> is replaced by the version number of the disk images.
At the time of writing, the current images are 034 and located in the
001 directory.

<p>Once you have these images, transfer them onto two floppies using the
methods described on page 4 of the Guide, using RAWRITE from the
Caldera CD-ROM if copying from a DOS/Windows system or
<pre>dd</pre> from a Linux system.

<p>While Caldera's CD-ROM is bootable (if your system's BIOS allows it),
if possible use the downloaded floppies anyway, since they are newer
and will contain bug-fixes that won't be in the CD versions.

<h3>Preparing the hard disks</h3>

<p>This procedure is no different from that of other Linux distributions.
You must use fdisk on your booted hard disk to allocate at least two
Linux partitions, one for the swap area and one for the root
file system. If you are planning to make your system dual-boot COL
with another operating system such as MS Windows or DOS or even OS/2,
it's usually preferable to install COL last; its "fdisk" recognizes
"foreign" OS types better than the disk partitioning tools of most
other operating systems.

<p>To run the Linux fdisk, you'll need to start your system using the
boot (and maybe the modules) floppy mentioned above. That's because
you need to tell COL what kind of disk and disk controller you have;
you can't even get as far as entering <pre>fdisk</pre> if Linux doesn't
recognize your hard disk!

<p>To do this, follow the bootup instructions in the Guide, from step 2
on page 33 to the end of page 36. Don't bother going through the
installation or detection of CDROMs or network cards at this time; all
that matters at this point is Linux sees the booting hard disk so you
can partition it using fdisk. A brief description of the use of the
Linux fdisk is provided on page 28 of the Guide.

<p>Remember that when running fdisk, you need to set up both your root
file system (type 83) and your swap space (type 82) as new partitions.
A brief discussion of how much swap space to allocate is offered on
page 10 of the Guide.

<p>As soon as you have completed this and written the partition table
information to make it permanent, you will need to reboot.
