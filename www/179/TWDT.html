<h3>Image size vs. file size</h3>
<p>
<b><p>

</p>

<p>
I've always been curious about the huge disparity in file sizes between
certain images, especially when they have - oh, more or less similar
content (to my perhaps uneducated eye.) E.g., I've got a large list of
files on a client's site where I have to find some path between a
good average image size (the pic that pops up when you click the
thumbnail) and a reasonable file size (something that won't crash
PHP/GD - a 2MB file brings things right to a halt.)
</p>

<p>
Here's the annoying thing, though:
</p>

<pre>
ben at Jotunheim:/tmp$ ls -l allegro90_1_1.jpg bahama20__1.jpg; identify allegro90_1_1.jpg bahama20__1.jpg 
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ben ben   43004 2010-09-28 19:43 allegro90_1_1.jpg
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ben ben 1725638 2010-09-28 14:37 bahama20__1.jpg
allegro90_1_1.jpg JPEG 784x1702 784x1702+0+0 8-bit DirectClass 42kb 
bahama20__1.jpg[1] JPEG 2240x1680 2240x1680+0+0 8-bit DirectClass 1.646mb 
</pre>

<p>
The first image, which is nearly big enough to cover my entire screen,
is 42k; the second one, while admittedly about 3X bigger in one
dimension, is 1.6MB+, over <strong>40</strong> times the file size. Say *what*?
</p>

<p>
And it's not like the complexity of the content is all that different;
in fact, visually, the first one is more complex than the second
(although I'm sure I'm judging it by the wrong parameters. Obviously.)
Take a look at them, if you want:
</p>

<p>
<a href='http://okopnik.com/images/allegro90_1_1.jpg'>http://okopnik.com/images/allegro90_1_1.jpg</a>
<a href='http://okopnik.com/images/bahama20__1.jpg'>http://okopnik.com/images/bahama20__1.jpg</a>
</p>

<p>
So... what makes an image - seemingly of the same type, according to
what "identify" is reporting - that much bigger? Does anybody here know?
And is there any way to make the file sizes closer without losing a
significant amount of visual content?
</p>

<p>
Hello, Gang -
</p>

<p>
After a number of years of providing hosting services for LG (and a
number of others), our old friend T. R. is, sadly, shutting down his
servers. Whatever his plans for the future may be, he has my best wishes
and the utmost in gratitude for all those great years; if there was such
a thing as a "Best Friends and Supporters of LG" list, he'd be right at
the top.
</p>

<p>
(T.R. - if we happen to be in the same proximity, the beer's on me. Yes,
even the realy good stuff.)
</p>

<p>
I've arranged for space on another host, moved the site over to it, and
have just finished all the configuration and alpha testing. Please check
out LG in its new digs (at the same URL, obviously), and let me know if
you find any problems or anything missing.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Is there a neat way to export and save my GPG/PGP secret key (private
key) on a USB stick ?
</p>

<p>
I have to do this, since I am often changing my machines (most of which
are given on loan by my employers). The secret key goes away with the
machine, and I am obliged to generate a new key pair each time. I did a
Google search and did not succeed.
</p>

<p>
I know I can save/export my public key, but GPG/PGP refuse to let me use
a copy of my secret key.
</p>

<p>
Any hint, or pointers would be gratefully appreciated.
</p>

<p>
Many thanks,
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, people are scared to get a screw driver and check what's
inside the hard drive. Or maybe simply because we're too lazy to read
manuals.
</p>

<p>
So, what's the alternative? How about a simple flash based tutorial?

</p>

<p>
It's geared toward disaster recovery, but in my opinion it's still
valuable for anyone who would like to see how the hardware works.

I don't know why this kind of thing keeps coming up. I never wanted to be
a mathematician, I'm just a simple programmer! <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
(One of these days, I'm going to sail over to an uninhabited island and
stay there for six months or so, studying math. This is just
embarassing; any time a problem like this comes up, I feel so <strong>stupid</strong>.)
</p>

<p>
I've been losing a lot of weight lately, and wanted to plot it on a
chart. However, I've only been keeping very sparse records of the
change, so what I need to do is interpolate it. In other words, given a
list like this:
</p>

<pre>
6/26/2010 334
8/12/2010 311.8
8/19/2010 308.4
9/5/2010 300.0
9/9/2010 298.6
9/14/2010 297.2
9/16/2010 293.6
</pre>

<p>
I need to come up with a "slope" function that will return my weight at
any point between 6/26 and 9/16. The time end of it is no problem - I
just convert the dates into Unix "epoch" values (seconds since
1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC) - but the mechanism that I've got for figuring
out the weight at a given time is hopelessly crude: I split the total
time span into X intervals, then find the data points preceding and
following it, and calculate the "slope" between them, then laboriously
figure out the value for that point. What I'd really, really like to
have is a function that takes the above list and returns the weight
value for any given point in time between Tmin and Tmax; I'm sure that
it's a standard mathematical function, but I don't know how to implement
it.
</p>

<p>
Can any of you smart folks help? I'd appreciate it.

Hi Tag,
</p>

<p>
I am trying to rework a script that currently uses an external file to
keep track of what issue the Linux Gazette is on. I would like to do
this with out relying on an external file (feels cleaner that way) and
just calculate this from within the script using  maybe the month and
year from localtime(time) from within Perl. Using the month and year I
thought this would be an easy task but it turns out its more difficult
than I thought.  I will probably need some  formula to do It to  since I
will be running it from cron. Can you make any suggestions on how I 
might attempt this? I have tried to figure a constant that I could use
to get it to come out correct with no luck. What works for one year
fails when the year changes when you add the month to the year. 
</p>

<p>
# Get Issue
my (@date,$month,$year,$issue);
</p>

<p>
@date = localtime(time);
$month=($date[4])+1;
$year=($date[5])+1900;
</p>

<p>
$issue= $year - 1841 + $month ;
print "Month = $month Year = $year Issue = $issue\n";
</p>

Hi Gang, 
</p>

<p>
I have a question on how to go about installing kernel modules without
going through the entire process of recompiling a new kernel.
In question is the agpgart module which i want to have as a loadable
module. As of now my the agpgart only exists as header files, and dont have
the modules ".ko" file yet. 
Below is the output command from locate agpgart.
</p>

<p>
$ locate agpgart
</p>

<p>
/usr/include/linux/agpgart.h
/usr/src/kernels/2.6.31.5-127.fc12.i686.PAE/include/linux/agpgart.h
</p>

<p>
Thanks in advance.

<p>
On occasion, I need to check my clients' sites for changes against the
backups/mirrors of their content on my machine. For those times, I have
a magic "rsync" incantation:
</p>

<p>
rsync -irn --size-only remote_host: /local/mirror/directory|grep '+'
</p>

<p>
The above itemizes the changes while performing a recursive check but
not copying any files. It also ignores timestamps and compares only file
sizes. Since "rsync" denotes changes with a '+' mark, filtering out
everything else only shows the files that have changed in size - which
includes files that aren't present in your local copy.
</p>

<p>
This can be very useful in identifying break-ins, for example.

<h3>2 cent tip: reading Freelang dictionaries</h3>
<p>
<b><p>
Jimmy O'Regan [joregan at gmail.com]
</p>

<p>

</p>
</b><br />
<b>Sun, 5 Sep 2010 14:58:30 +0100</b>
</p>

<p>
Freelang has a lot of (usually small) dictionaries, for Windows. They
have quite a few languages that aren't easy to find dictionaries for,
so though the coverage and quality are usually quite low, they're
sometimes all that's there.
</p>

<p>
So, an example: <a href='http://www.freelang.net/dictionary/albanian.php'>http://www.freelang.net/dictionary/albanian.php</a>
</p>

<p>
Leads to a file, dic_albanian.exe
</p>

<p>
This runs quite well in Wine (I haven't found any other way of
extracting the contents). On my system, the 'C:\users\jim\Local
Settings\Application Data\Freelang Dictionary' translates to
'~/.wine/drive_c/users/jim/Local\ Settings/Application\ Data/Freelang\
Dictionary/'. The dictionary files are inside the 'language'
directory.
</p>

<p>
Saving this as wb2dict.c:
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
int main (int argc, char** argv)
{
	char src[31];
        char trg[53];
	FILE* f=fopen(argv[1], "r");
	if (f==NULL) {
		fprintf (stderr, "Error reading file: %s\n", argv[1]);
		exit(1);
	}
 
	while (!feof(f)) {
		fread(&amp;src, sizeof(char), 31, f);
		fread(&amp;trg, sizeof(char), 53, f);
		printf ("%s\n   %s\n\n", src, trg);
	}
	
	fclose(f);
	exit(0);
}
</pre>

<p>
The next step depends on the contents... Albanian on Windows uses
Codepage 1250, so in this case:
</p>

<p>
./wb2dict Albanian_English.wb|recode 'windows1250..utf8' |dictfmt -f

<p>
A bunch of the "Thread continues ..." links aren't working in issue #178.

Not sure if it is normal to send a talkback to my own article, but here it
is:
</p>

<p>
I have gotten a couple of comments/notes since my article "Common problems
when trying to install Windows on KVM with vir-manager" came out related to
tip #2 (turning off selinux). Yes, I understand it's recommended that
selinux stay turned on in 'enforcing' mode in Fedora. Yet, if I do this, I
get the following error when trying to startup the virtual machine using a
SDL virtual display.
</p>

<p>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/share/virt-manager/virtManager/engine.py", line 878, in
run_domain
    vm.startup()
  File "/usr/share/virt-manager/virtManager/domain.py", line 1321, in
startup
    self._backend.create()
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/libvirt.py", line 333, in create
    if ret == -1: raise libvirtError ('virDomainCreate() failed', dom=self)
libvirtError: operation failed: failed to retrieve chardev info in qemu with
'info chardev'
</p>

<p>
As a 'somewhat reasonably' <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)"> responsible member of the Fedora community, I
have filed a bug on Red Hat's bugzilla about it (
<a href='https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=635328'>https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=635328</a>). Until that is resolved,
or someone else is able to show me another way to get sound working on such
a VM, I stand by my tip to turn off selinux.
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
</p>

<h2>News in General</h2>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Oracle Supports Java, Solaris but not Developer Community Control</h3>

<p>Technology Titan Oracle just held its Oracle Open World 
mulit-user-group conference and released roadmaps and announcements 
impacting several projects in the Open Source sphere.</p>

<p>These updates include new releases for MySQL, Solaris, and Oracle 
Linux, new Oracle engineered servers and appliances, as well the next 
generation of the SPARC processor architecture with its partner 
Fujitsu.  However, the future relationship between Oracle and 
developer institutions like the Java Community Process and OpenSolaris 
user groups were left uncertain and with hints of an adversarial turn.</p>

<p>Oracle seems to be backing away from OpenSolaris as a developer or 
small shop operating system by no longer sharing development source 
code with OpenSolaris distros.  A panel of Oracle executives, speaking 
to the press, declined to discuss OpenSolaris but did state that new 
Solaris source code would eventually become open-sourced under the 
CDDL.</p>

<p>Oracle is altering Sun's prior relationship with the Open Source 
community while making its Solaris offerings more commercial and more 
like its Linux offerings, which are based on customer support 
contracts.</p>

<p>Back in August, an internal management memo to Solaris engineers was 
leaked to the OpenSolaris email distribution.  While stressing 
Oracle's commitment to make Solaris "...a best-of-breed technology for 
Oracle's enterprise customers" and decision to hire the "top operating 
systems engineers in the industry," the memo described how Oracle 
would no longer share source code and builds on a regular basis, 
except with key partners. Instead, source code would be made available 
only after new version releases of Solaris:</p>

<p>"We will distribute updates to approved CDDL or other open source- 
licensed code following full releases of our enterprise Solaris 
operating system. In this manner, new technology innovations will show 
up in our releases before anywhere else. We will no longer distribute 
source code for the entirety of the Solaris operating system in 
real-time while it is developed, on a nightly basis.</p>

<p>"Anyone who is consuming Solaris code using the CDDL, whether in 
pieces or as a part of the OpenSolaris source distribution or a 
derivative thereof, would therefore be able to consume any updates we 
release at that time, under the terms of the CDDL, LGPL, or whatever 
license applies.</p>

<p>"We will have a technology partner program to permit our industry 
partners full access to the in-development Solaris source code through 
the Oracle Technology Network (OTN). This will include both early 
access to code and binaries, as well as contributions to us where that 
is appropriate."</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Oracle Outlines Core SPARC, Solaris and ZFS Innovations</h3>

<p>During his keynote presentation at Oracle OpenWorld 2010, Oracle 
Executive Vice President John Fowler showcased technology innovations 
and outlined the value of hardware and software engineered to work 
together as in Oracle's high-end ExaData servers.</p>

<p>Reiterating Oracle's commitment to SPARC, Fowler introduced the 
industry's first 16-core processor, the SPARC T3, and SPARC T3 
systems, which deliver optimized system performance for 
mission-critical applications. He unveiled eight world-record 
benchmark results, running the new SPARC T3 server family.</p>

<p>Fowler also unveiled the next-generation Sun ZFS Storage Appliance 
product line that provides unified storage solutions for deploying 
Oracle Database and data protection for Oracle Applications.</p>

<p>"We are focused on providing co-engineered systems - Oracle hardware 
and software engineered to work together - to continually drive better 
performance, availability, security and management, which translates 
into business value for our customers," said Fowler.
</p>

 

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Oracle Outlines Next Major Release of Oracle Solaris</h3>

<p>Besides increasing its investment in the Oracle Solaris operating 
system, Oracle is preparing for Oracle Solaris 11 in 2011 by releasing 
Solaris 11 Express in 2010 to provide customers with access to the 
latest Solaris 11 technology.</p>

<p>Oracle Solaris 11 will contain more than 2,700 projects with more than 
400 inventions. Oracle Solaris 11 is expected to reduce planned 
downtime by being faster and easier to deploy, update and manage, and:</p>

<p>- Nearly eliminate patching and update errors with new 
dependency-aware packaging tools;<br />

- Build a custom stack of Solaris and Oracle Software in a physical or 
virtual image to enforce enterprise quality and policy standards;<br />

- Reduce maintenance windows by eliminating the need for up to 50 
percent of system restarts;<br />

- Recover systems in tens of seconds versus tens of minutes with Fast 
Reboot;<br />

- Receive proactive and preemptive support that reduces service 
outages from known issues via My Oracle Support telemetry integration 
with the Oracle Solaris fault management architecture.</p>

<p>Oracle Solaris 11 is being engineered with new capabilities for 
building, deploying and maintaining Cloud systems. Oracle Solaris 11 
will be optimized for the scale and performance requirements of 
immediate and future Cloud-based deployments, and will scale to tens 
of thousands of hardware threads, hundreds of terabytes of system 
memory, and hundreds of Gigabits of I/O.</p>

<p>The first Oracle Solaris 11 Express release, expected by the end of 
calendar year 2010, will have an optional Oracle support agreement. 
This release is expected to be the path forward for developers, 
end-users and partners using previous generations of Solaris and 
OpenSolaris releases.</p>

<p>Over 1,000 SPARC and x86 systems from other hardware providers have 
been tested and certified by Oracle. Solaris 11 also will be powering 
the newly announced Oracle Exadata X2-2 and X2-8 Database Machines, as 
well as the Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud machine.</p>

 

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Oracle Outlines Plans for Java Platform</h3>

<p>During the opening keynote of JavaOne 2010, Thomas Kurian, executive 
vice president, Oracle Product Development outlined plans for the 
future of the Java platform and showcased product demonstrations 
illustrating the latest Java technology innovations.  Kurian's 
presentation covered four key areas of Java technology:</p>

<p>- Java Standard Edition (Java SE) - optimizing it for new application 
models and hardware; including extended support for running new 
scripting languages, increased developer productivity and lower 
operational costs. Kurian discussed the roadmap for JDK 7 and JDK 8, 
which will be based on OpenJDK, and highlighted some of the key 
OpenJDK projects.</p>

<p>- Java on the Client - Oracle is enhancing the programming model with 
JavaFX, to deliver advanced graphics, high-fidelity media and new HTML 
5, JavaScript and CSS Web capabilities, along with native Java 
platform support.</p>

<p>- Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) - Java EE will become more modular 
and programming more efficient with improvements such as dependency 
injection and reduced configuration requirements. Product 
demonstration highlighted how the Java EE 6 Web Profile reduces the 
size of the Java runtime for light-weight web applications, reducing 
overhead and improving performance.</p>

<p>- Java on Devices - Oracle will modernize the Java mobile platform by 
delivering Java with Web support to consumer devices. Oracle is also 
including new language features, small-footprint CPU-efficient 
capabilities for cards, phones and TVs, and consistent emulation 
across hardware platforms.</p>

<p>While 1.1 billion desktops run Java, 3 billion mobile phones run Java, 
and 1.4 billion Java Cards are manufactured each year.  This is a very 
big market that impacts computing at every level.</p>

<p>"Oracle believes that the Java community expects results. With our 
increased investment in the Java platform, a sharp focus on features 
that deliver value to the community, and a relentless focus on 
performance, the Java language and platform have a bright future," 
said Kurian. "In addition, Oracle remains committed to OpenJDK as the 
the best open source Java implementation and we will continue to 
improve OpenJDK and welcome external contributors."</p>

<p>However, in its presentations, Oracle said very little about the 
well-established Java Community Process (JCP) that has directed the 
evolution of Java.  Although many developers were concerned about this 
apparent diminishment of the JCP, most seemed pleased with the strong 
on-going commitment for Java by Oracle and its support of OpenJDK.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Android Poised to Overtake Blackberry, iPhone Market Share</h3>

<p>The rapid growth of mobile devices running Google's Android operating 
system will continue at the expense of the other leading smartphone 
platforms,  BlackBerry, iPhone, and even Windows Mobile, according to 
market share data compiled by the comScore marketing service.</p>

<p>For the quarter ending in July, comScore found that Android-based 
devices improved their share of the overall smartphone market, growing 
to 17 percent from 12 percent.  comScore researchers found that 
Microsoft lost 2.2 percent of total smartphone market share while RIM 
tumbled 1.8 percent and Apple, despite launching the vaunted iPhone 4 
in June, shed 1.3 percent.</p>

<p>RIM was the leading mobile smartphone platform in the U.S. with 39.3 
percent share of U.S. smartphone subscribers, followed by Apple with 
23.8 percent share. Google saw significant growth during the period, 
rising 5.0 percentage points to capture 17.0 percent of smartphone 
subscribers. Microsoft accounted for 11.8 percent of Smartphone 
subscribers, while Palm rounded out the top five with 4.9 percent</p>

<p>The July report found Samsung to be the top handset manufacturer 
overall with 23.1 percent market share, while RIM led among smartphone 
platforms with 39.9 percent market share.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">DeviceVM Adds MeeGo to Splashtop Instant-on Product</h3>

<p>DeviceVM, a provider of instant-on computing software, previewed the 
next-generation of its Splashtop instant-on platform at the Intel 
Developer's Forum in San Francisco. The flagship Splashtop product has 
already shipped on millions of notebooks and netbooks worldwide from 
leading PC OEMs including Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, LG, Sony and 
others. The company will offer a MeeGo-compliant version of the 
popular companion OS to all existing OEM customers, while enabling 
current users of Splashtop-powered systems to take advantage of a 
seamless upgrade in the first half of 2011.</p>

<p>First introduced in 2007, the flagship Splashtop product is a 
Linux-based instant-on platform that allows users to get online, 
access e-mail, and chat with friends seconds after turning on their 
PCs.  The MeeGo project combines Intel's Moblin and Nokia's Maemo 
projects into one Linux-based, open source software platform for the 
next generation of computing devices.</p>

<p>By embracing MeeGo as the foundation for Splashtop, application 
developers have the possibility to distribute their software to 
millions of potential users leading to greater adoption of the MeeGo 
platform. DeviceVM will also consider pre-bundling popular 
applications along with distribution of the MeeGo-based Splashtop. In 
moving to a MeeGo-based platform, users will now be able to download, 
install and run hundreds of apps currently available from the Intel 
AppUp Center.</p>

<p>"Since the launch of Splashtop in late 2007, we have received 
thousands of requests from application developers to release an SDK," 
said Mark Lee, CEO and co-founder of DeviceVM. "By embracing MeeGo and 
moving Splashtop to be fully compliant with the specifications 
shepherded by the Linux Foundation, we will effectively open up 
Splashtop to allow developers to deliver high-value applications to 
audiences across a range of computing devices."</p>

<p>Demonstrations of the new Meego-based Splashtop product were seen 
during the IDF expo.</p>

<p>DeviceVM is an active Linux proponent, and earlier this year announced 
the election of CEO and co-founder Mark Lee to the Linux Foundation 
Board of Directors.</p>

<p>The MeeGo-based Splashtop is already being made available to leading 
PC OEMs currently shipping Splashtop on a range of device types. 
Consumer and commercial end-users will be able to upgrade to the new 
Splashtop in the first half of 2011.. For more information, visit

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">NetApp and Oracle Agree to Dismiss IP Lawsuits</h3>

<p>NetApp and Oracle have agreed to dismiss their pending mutual patent 
litigation, which began in 2007 between Sun Microsystems and NetApp. 
Oracle and NetApp want to have the lawsuits dismissed without 
prejudice. The terms of the agreement are currently confidential.</p>

<p>Sun released the code to the ZFS or Zettabyte file system used in 
Solaris to its developer community in 2005, but claimed to have 
developed it in-house years earlier.   NetApp sued later, claiming 
that many of the features were similar to the WAFL (Write Anywhere 
File Layout) file system technology used by NetApp.  There were also 
further IP patent suits regarding the Sunscreen technology that NetApp 
acquired in 2008.</p>

<p>No theft of code was alleged by either side.  The conflict was around 
commercial use of similar ideas and design.</p>

<p>"For more than a decade, Oracle and NetApp have shared a common vision 
focused on providing solutions that reduce IT cost and complexity for 
thousands of customers worldwide," said Tom Georgens, president and 
CEO of NetApp. "Moving forward, we will continue to collaborate with 
Oracle to deliver solutions that help our mutual customers gain 
greater flexibility and efficiency in their IT infrastructures."</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Broadcom releases open-source driver for its wireless chipsets</h3>

<p>Broadcom has announced the initial release of a fully-open Linux 
driver for it's latest generation of 11n chipsets.  The driver, while 
still a work in progress, is released as full source and uses the
native mac80211 stack.   It supports multiple current chips (BCM4313, 
BCM43224, BCM43225) as well as providing a framework for supporting 
additional chips in the future, including mac80211-aware embedded 
chips.</p>

<p>This is a major shift in policy by a dominant networking vendor.</p>

<p>In a blog entry on Linux.com, Linux Foundation Executive Director Jim 
Zemlin wrote:</p>

<p>"We are extremely happy to see this change for multiple reasons. One: 
it's obviously good to have more technology available to use; we want 
technology to "just work" with Linux and since Broadcom is a major 
technology supplier their absence from the mainline kernel was 
significant. Two: we have been working with our Technical Advisory 
Board on this issue for the last few years to educate vendors on 
Linux' model and why it's in their interest to open source their 
drivers."</p>

<p>The README and TODO files included with the sources provide more 
details about the current feature set, known issues, and plans for 
improving the driver.</p>

<p>The driver is currently available in staging-next git tree, available

<h2>Distro News</h2>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">WeTab tablet first with MeeGo open operating system</h3>

<p>In September, WeTab GmbH announced its tablet computer, the WeTab, 
developed in cooperation with Intel, just preceeding the IFA 
international trade fair for consumer electronics in Berlin and IDF in 
San Francisco.  The WeTab, which went on to the German market in 
September, is the first tablet worldwide based on MeeGo.</p>

<p>WeTab OS, the WeTab operating system, is based on the free Linux 
distribution MeeGo and integrates runtime environments for various 
other technologies. In addition to native Linux apps, many other 
applications can run on the WeTab, including Android apps, Adobe Air 
applications and MeeGo apps. Several apps that may be interesting for 
the user have been compiled and are available on the WeTab Market, 
from where they can be loaded directly onto the WeTab. This means that 
developers can program in the languages they are familiar with and 
users can choose from an abundance of very different applications.</p>

<p>The Web-browser plays a special role here and is based on the free 
HTML rendering engine WebKit, enabling fast surfing and including 
suport for HTML5, Adobe Flash and Java.</p>

<p>"Working intensively with Intel, we have developed the WeTab OS with 
MeeGo to meet the requirements of a tablet user in the best way 
possible. The tablet runs extremely fast and, in addition to native 
apps, also provides direct access to countless Web-based apps", says 
Stephan Od&ouml;rfer, Managing Director of 4tiitoo AG, which is are also 
involved in this joint venture with WeTab GmbH.</p>

<p>Wolfgang Petersen, Director of Intel Software and Services Group at 
Intel Deutschland GmbH, says: "The WeTab is the first tablet based on 
MeeGo and the Intel Atom processor. MeeGo is designed for a broad 
range of devices. Implementing MeeGo on the WeTab shows just how the 
operating system can be adapted for use on a tablet."</p>

<p>WeTab GmbH is a joint venture between 4tiitoo AG and Neofonie GmbH.</p>

<p>You can find more information at <a href="http://www.wetab.mobi">http://www.wetab.mobi</a>, <a href="http://www.intel.com">http://www.intel.com</a> and

including the Intel full series graphics and  most of NVIDIA and ATI;<br />
- Input method - multi-language input method and international 
keyboard support through iBus;<br />
- File Manager - a Windows-like experience means that the partitions 
of USB drives are now alphabetically labeled.</p>
       
<p>Linpus (<a href="http://www.linpus.com">http://www.linpus.com</a>) has worked on open source solutions across 
numerous platforms and products, garnering a reputation for 
engineering excellence as well as highly intuitive user interfaces.

<p>Building on its leadership in the enterprise operating system market, 
Oracle today announced Oracle Solaris 10 9/10, Oracle Solaris Cluster 
3.3 and Oracle Solaris Studio12.2.  10 of the top 10 
Telecommunications Companies, Utilities and Banks use Oracle Solaris.</p>

<p>Oracle Solaris is now developed, tested and supported as an integrated 
component of Oracle's "applications-to-disk" technology stack, which 
includes continuous major platform testing, in addition to the Oracle 
Certification Environment, representing over 50,000 test use cases for 
every Oracle Solaris patch and platform released.</p>

<p>Oracle Solaris 10 9/10 provides networking and performance

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">New Release of Oracle Secure Global Desktop</h3>

<p>Further enhancing its comprehensive portfolio of desktop 
virtualization solutions, Oracle released Oracle Secure Global Desktop 
4.6 in September.  Secure Global Desktop is an access solution that 
delivers server-hosted applications and desktops to nearly any client 
device, with higher security, decreased operational costs, and 
increased mobility.</p>

<p>With a highly secure architecture, Oracle Secure Global Desktop helps 
keep sensitive data in the datacenter behind the corporate firewall, 
and not on end user systems or in the vulnerable demilitarized zone 
(DMZ), and can only be accessed by authenticated users with 
appropriate privileges.</p>

<p>Oracle Secure Global Desktop enables an additional layer of security 
for accessing sensitive enterprise applications, beyond using a web 
browser alone, by providing a highly secure Java-based Web client that 
does not retain cookies or utilize Web page cache files that could be 
exploited.</p>

<p>The new release lowers administration overhead by delivering secure 
access to server-hosted applications and desktops from a wide variety 
of popular client devices. Applications and desktops that run on 
Windows, Oracle Solaris, Oracle Enterprise Linux, and other UNIX and 
Linux versions are supported.</p>

<p>Oracle Secure Global Desktop 4.6 is part of "Oracle Virtualization," a 
comprehensive desktop-to-datacenter virtualization portfolio, enabling 
customers to virtualize and manage their full hardware and software 
stack from applications to disk.</p>

<p>Oracle Secure Global Desktop 4.6 enhances the security and centralized 
management of applications in the datacenter by delivering: <br />
- Greater browser flexibility: The Secure Global Desktop client has 
the flexibility to be used with nearly any Java-enabled browser to 
access server-hosted browser instances where the server-hosted 
application requires a different browser, plug-ins, or settings;<br />
- Enhanced availability: The Array Resilience feature automatically 
re-establishes connections to the server array after a primary server 
or network failure to provide higher levels of availability;<br />
- Enhanced application launch control for users: Dynamic Launch 
reduces administration overhead by giving end users greater control 
over launching applications;<br />
- Easier integration with third party infrastructure: Integration 
with third party virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) connection 
brokers, in addition to the existing integration with Oracle Virtual 
Desktop Infrastructure;<br />
- Dynamic Drive Mapping allows users to "hot-plug" hard disk drives 
and USB drives on their PCs and utilize them in Oracle Secure Global 
Desktop sessions;<br />
- Configurable directory services and password management: 
Administrators can configure individual settings for multiple 
directory services, such as Oracle Internet Directory, Microsoft 
Active Directory and other LDAP servers.</p>


<p>"The new capabilities delivered in Oracle Secure Global Desktop 4.6 
underscore our focus on making applications easier to deploy, manage 
and support in virtualized datacenter environments," said Wim 
Coekaerts, senior vice president, Linux and Virtualization 
Engineering, Oracle. "Oracle Secure Global Desktop 4.6 is the latest 
of many new desktop virtualization products and capabilities recently 
announced including new releases of Oracle VM VirtualBox, Sun Ray 
Software and Oracle Virtual Desktop Infrastructure. This demonstrates 
Oracle's continued commitment to providing a comprehensive desktop to 
datacenter portfolio."</p>

<p>
"I've bought us a new potato peeler. Doesn't it look fantastic!"
</p>

<p>
My wife's enthusiasm was boundless. Meanwhile I struggled with the
nuances of her declaration.
</p>

<p>
Why <i>us</i>? I wondered uncharitably. I was perfectly happy with the
three other potato peelers we already had. Why did <i>we</i> need a new
one? And why would I care what it looked like?
</p>

<p>
A few days later, I complained, "It doesn't do a good job."
</p>

<p>
"You're such a curmudgeon. It's beautiful. That's all that matters."
</p>

<p>
This is our endless debate. For her, style is all. I, on the other
hand, believe that, without function, form is irrelevant.
</p>

<p>
Sadly (for me), my wife is in the majority. And nowhere is this
demonstrated better than on websites.
</p>

<p>
I see many jobs for web designers, but I can't get my head around what
people mean. If all these websites are designed, how come they are so
dreadful at what they do?
</p>

<p>
Perhaps I'm begging the question. Maybe the purpose of each website
is to be a monument to its designer, an item for her folio, a notch on
his belt.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps, in the vein of "your call is important to us" (<em>newsflash</em>: it
isn't), these websites do indeed reflect the desires of their owners.
These desires start with a complete disdain for their users, whom they
treat with contempt. They seem to want their websites to be vehicles
to push other products.
</p>

<h3>In the Beginning</h3>

<p>
Take my bank, Citibank. When I first started using their website for
banking (over 3 years ago), I was extremely impressed. It seemed that
they had found a balance between security and usability. (Of course,
I'm talking about my experience in Australia. I have no knowledge of
how Citibank's websites work anywhere else in the world. I'm guessing
it's the same throughout Australia, but I can't even guarantee that.)
</p>

<p>
What impressed me the most was their out-of-band confirmation. Before
I transfer money to any party, I must first set that party up as an
account in my profile. I use normal browser procedures to create the
account, but before the account can be activated (ie used), I have to
ratify it. In the past, I could do that in one of 2 ways: ring
Citibank (a not particularly convenient mechanism - but it is only
once per account); or respond to an email.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, they have replaced both of these with another
mechanism: they SMS a code which I must manually enter. I think most
banks do that now.
</p>

<p>
Using SMS rather than email is likely to be more secure. In theory, if
your PC is compromised, the hacker has access to your bank account and
your email. To rip you off now, the hacker would also have to be in
possession of your phone.
</p>


<p>
That's all basically good news. Now for the not-so-good news.
</p>

<p>
In the first incarnation of Internet banking, I had to provide my ATM
card number and PIN (pretty much the same as when I went to an ATM).
That seemed to me to be secure enough. If it was adequate protection
for me at the ATM, why was it less than adequate for Internet banking?
</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>
I am not an authority on security, but neither am I a complete
stranger. 
</p>

<p>
The theory is that security is about <i>something you have</i> and
<i>something you know</i>. (Technically, there's a lot more to it than
that. There's also <i>something you are</i>. But that doesn't apply
here, so let's move on.) So, when I go to the ATM, what I <i>have</i>
is my bank's card. And what I <i>know</i> is my PIN.
</p>

<p>
One way that fraud is perpetrated on such a system is that the baddies
capture (usually photograph or film) the details of your card
(basically its number) and use the captured data to create a clone
card. Capturing someone's PIN is often not difficult. There are video
cameras everywhere these days; and most people are almost reckless in
their failure to even try to conceal their activity when they enter
their PIN. Just look around the next time you are in the queue at a
store's checkout.
</p>

<p>
You should take the view that if your eyes can see what you are keying
when you enter your PIN, then it is susceptible to capture. Ideally,
you should cover your keying hand as you key.
</p>

<p>
When you pay your bill at the restaurant, the something you have is
your credit card. There really isn't anything that you know. Arguably,
you <i>know</i> how to produce your signature; but then so does any
respectable forger. Once she has obtained your card, she has all the
time in the world to practice forgery. Even better, if a baddy gets
hold of a copy of your card's imprint, he can produce a clone and sign
the clone in his handwriting (with your name).
</p>

<p>
I guess the weakness in Citibank's first incarnation, is that it
converts <i>something you have</i> (the card) into <i>something you
know</i> (the card's number). When it comes to things you know, two
are not better than one. (Perhaps marginally better.)
</p>

<p>
There are techniques that achieve a de facto <i>something you
have</i>. "RSA SecurID is a mechanism developed by RSA Security for
performing two-factor authentication for a user to a network
resource." (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SecurID">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SecurID</a>) In essence, it's a
gizmo that displays a number (at least 6 digits). The number changes
every minute. Every gizmo has its own unique sequence of numbers. So,
in theory, unless you are holding the gizmo, you cannot know which
number is correct at any time. Put another way, knowledge of the
correct number is de facto proof that you have that special <i>something
you have</i>.
</p>

<p>
These techniques are probably expensive. Perhaps the bank thought that
its customers are too stupid to be able to use such a gizmo.
</p>

<h3>Changes</h3>

<p>
After some time, Citibank changed the access mechanism. I was invited
(read <i>ordered</i>):
</p>

<pre>
	You will be guided to create your own User ID, Password and
	three "Security Questions". You will be asked to choose from a
	range of questions. Each time you sign on you will be asked
	one question.
</pre>

<p>
My guess is that most users access their accounts from a PC running
Microsoft, um, products (I cannot bring myself to write <i>software</i> in
the same sentence as <i>Microsoft</i>). And I guess there was a concern
that many of these machines could be (or had been) compromised. I
generally don't use Microsoft platforms to access the Internet; I run
Linux on my desktop (as any sensible person would). And I NEVER use
Microsoft platforms to access anything to do with dollars.
</p>

<p>
So I wonder why I have to suffer. Why can't I choose the mechanism
with which I access Citibank's facilities?
</p>

<p>
Ostensibly, Citibank's brave new world of banking was better than the
previous world. Here's how it worked (and still works at time of
writing).
</p>

<pre>
	Disclaimer

	By now, the reader must have realised that I have no personal
	inside knowledge of Citibank or any of its personnel. This
	entire piece is speculation on my part, together with my actual
	personal experience. As they say, YMMV. So I'm going to drop
	the "my guesses" and "I supposes"; it's all getting too
	clunky.
</pre>

<p>
I go to the login screen (affectionately called a "sign on" so as not
spook the cattle). I enter my User ID. I click on the field where I
would normally expect to enter my Password. Up pops a virtual
keyboard. This is supposed to defeat keyboard sniffers. Even if
a sniffer has captured a session during which I entred my User ID and
Password, the only bit that is usable is the User ID (and maybe part
of the Password). The virtual keyboard consists of 3 parts. The
letters of the alphabet are pretty standard; there's a numeric pad to
the right; but there are no numbers on the top row of the keyboard,
only the characters produced when these keys are shifted:

<pre>
	!@#$%^&amp;*()_+
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The special characters and digits are not in fixed positions; each
time the virtual keyboard pops up, the order of these keys changes. So
even if a keyboard sniffer detects <i>where</i> you clicked, it does
not establish <i>what</i> you clicked.
</p>

<p>
The perpetrators of this approach had better be really really sure
that this last assertion is true. Because the virtual keyboard with
the changing keycaps comes at the expense of reducing my password
strength. They have decreased the size of the symbol set. There are 94
ASCII printable characters available to a random password generator.
Citibank's keyboard is case insensitive; there are only 46 characters
to choose from.
</p>

<p>
Further, I'm not certain it defeats <i>all</i> hacks. If your PC is
compromised, perhaps it is also possible that your browser has been
hijacked. If the baddies present you with <i>their</i> virtual keyboard,
would you notice?
</p>

<p>
There are other hacks that are theoretically possible.
</p>

<p>
My suspicion is that the virtual keyboard came from the same school as
many of the security "enhancements" inflicted on people in the US
after 9/11. These "enhancements" are more about creating the
<i>illusion</i> of security than being effective. 
</p>

<p>
It's horrendous to use. For me, when my eyesight was bad, the
characters were almost unreadable. On a normal keyboard, I don't
have to see the characters clearly; it's enough that I know where
they are. But on the virtual keyboard they are never in the same place
twice. I changed my password to use characters that I could more
readily distinguish.
</p>

<p class="editorial">[ ...thus decreasing the password strength even
further (it's not that hard to guess which characters are more
distinguishable with poor eyesight.) This reinforces Henry's point: the Law
of Unintended Consequences is alive, well, and hyperactive, particularly 
in the area of UI/security interactions. -- Ben ]</p>

<p>
Because my eyesight was so poor, I was in the habit of using my
browser's feature for increasing text size. That should solve the
problem with the virtual keyboard, I hear you say. Missed it by
<em>that</em>
much. When I increased text size in the browser window, each character
in the virtual keyboard was no longer aligned with the box with which it
was associated. In some cases it became even harder to read, even
though it was bigger.
</p>

<p>
My personal biggest gripe with this mechanism is that it takes me much
longer to enter my password. Instead of a simple swipe-paste, I must
click each character.
</p>

<p>
My other bank (Commonwealth Bank) has a simple Client Number and
Password. As far as I'm concerned, that's perfectly acceptable and
vastly preferable. Commonwealth Bank also uses SMS for ratification.
</p>

<h3>Makeover</h3>

<p>
That brings us to yesterday (March 2010). The folk (web designers?) at
Citibank have given their website a makeover. It has a completely
different look. What's really galling is that the functionality is not
better than it was. However, it is vastly different; so now I have to
learn how to use the new user interface.
</p>

<p>
Imagine you've bought yourself a shiny new car. (Obviously it wouldn't
happen like this.) You drive it for six months. And then one day you
jump behind the wheel - <i>er, wait! where is the steering wheel? Oh,
they've moved it to the other side of the car. I have to get in the
passenger side to drive. I wonder which one of these pedals is the
brake? Ok, I'm starting to get used to it. Now, indicator? Hmm, where
would they have put the indicator?</i>
</p>

<p>
I think you get my drift.
</p>

<p>
And it's not any better than the previous user interface! - which
wasn't great and could have done with some improvement.
</p>

<p>
But we're back to the potato peeler. If it doesn't peel potatoes, who
cares what it looks like? In my opinion (obviously not worth much),
Citibank's new look is really terrible.
</p>

<p>
But here we've come full circle also. The one noticeable difference is
that there are many more references to and come-ons for Citibank's other
products. Once again, the customer is treated with contempt - unless
he's about to buy something.

<h1>Away Mission - PayPal Innovate</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<p>
PayPal's Innovate developer conference comes the San Francisco on October
26-27.  Here's a chance to learn how the web collects its money.
</p>

<p>
This year, they move from the  arguably lower-rent San Francisco Concourse,
an augmented warehouse with skylights and carpeting, to the tech conference
standard of the Moscone Center.  The first event in 2009 was was a sell-out
and was bursting at the seams.   The step up is partly necessitated by the
fact the rooms were not big enough for most of the 2009 sessions.
</p>

<p>
This year, some of the same formula is present:  a 2-day format, ultra-low
price (under $200 if you early-bird it), and major guest speakers like Tim
O'Reilly, founder and CEO of O'Reilly Media,   and  Marc Andreessen,
co-founder of Netscape Communications.
</p>

<p>
This year has an extra deal:  a conference pass and 2 nights at the Parc 55
Hotel for only $399.  And you can save $50 off that if you register by
October 3rd with code INV810.
</p>

<p>
The food and caffeine was plentiful in 2009,  even though it was
mostly  sandwiches, chips,  and pizza - but really good pizza.  They did
not take away the coffee/tea/soda between sessions and that is most
appreciated.   	 At the Moscone Center, catering staff take away food and
drink after the allotted time has passed.  Let's see if the coffee urns
stay out this year.
</p>

<p>
But why PayPal?    Because of their PayPal X community which developed when
they opened up their APIs and also because  PayPal is  empowering the
global micro-payments industry and is experimenting with mobile phone
micro-payments to support aid and development projects in the 3rd world -
bringing hi-tech into lo-tech places.  The event is in part about "crafting
the future of money, literally changing the way the world pays." That's a
very ambitious goal.
</p>


<p>
More specifically, PayPal X is an open global payments platform which
includes developer tools and resources. The developer community around
PayPal X  is trying to shape the way the world uses - and thinks about - money.
Those tools can be reviewed and tested at <a href="http://x.com">http://x.com</a>. They include payment
APIs, code samples, in-depth documentation, training modules, and much
more.
</p>

<p>
According to an article in the Economist magazine in 2009, the use of
mobile money via cell phone in the developing world reduces banking and
transportation costs and leads to family wealth increasing by 5-30%.
Transactions are faster, safer, and have better transaction logging. Mobile
payments are becoming the default banking system of those without banks and
credit, accelerating the movement away from cash.
</p>  


<p>
There will be over 50 technical sessions for an expected 2000-2500
attendees.  And at these sessions you can learn strategies for monetizing
businesses or see how others are using the PayPal APIs.  Last year there
also were chalk talk sessions but they were mostly under-attended.
</p>

<p>
This link take you to the Innovate 2009 Keynotes and Breakout Sessions:  
<a href="https://www.x.com/docs/DOC-1584">https://www.x.com/docs/DOC-1584</a>
</p>

<p>
To get a better sense of the ad-hoc and dynamic nature of the sessions,
check out these 3 session links:
</p>

<p>
<li> PayPal 101: Payments for Developers:  <a href="https://www.x.com/videos/1036">https://www.x.com/videos/1036</a> 
<li> The Intersection of Mind and Money: <a href="https://www.x.com/videos/1034">https://www.x.com/videos/1034</a> 
<li> Banking the Unbanked: <a href="https://www.x.com/videos/1077">https://www.x.com/videos/1077</a> 
</p> 

<p>
There were lots of giveaways: free PayPal Dev accounts, source code
giveaways (the shopping cart PayPal developed for Facebook), T-shirts, etc.
But the most outstanding perk for PayPal Innovate attendees was the 10 inch
ASUS 'eee-pc' netbook given to all who were at the keynote on the first
day.  They did run out and gave receipts to the late claimants to get an
eee shipped to them - the luggage tag in the conference bag had a time code
which determined if you were an early bird or a late one.  The netbook came
preloaded with PayPal X materials and had a PayPal sticker on the cover.  I
suspect that the perks this year will be smaller as Moscone  Convention
Center rates must be 2x-3x of the 2009 site.  In fact, you might say the
2009 PayPal conference was free and $200-300 fee went into the perks...
no guarantees for 2010, however.

<h1>A Nightmare on Tape Drive</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/grebler.html">Henry Grebler</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<p>
And in the fourth month of my new job, I encountered numerous problems
all related to backup.
</p>

<p>
Backup! My eyes glaze over. I suppose some people can get enthusiastic
about backup, but not me. Oh, sure, I understand the point of backup.
And I try very hard in my own endeavours to keep lots of backup. (What
would happen to my writing if I lost it all! Oh, the horror.)
</p>

<p>
Currently, I seem to spend about a third of my time on backup. There
are many aspects to this, and several reasons. Nonetheless, there are
many activities that are not a particularly good match for my
skill-set: operating a Dymo labelmaker; searching for tapes; opening
new tape boxes; removing shrink-wrapping; loading and unloading
magazines; searching for tape cases; loading tape cases; removing
tapes from their covers; inserting tapes into their covers; delivering
tape cases to, and retrieving them from, a nearby site.
</p>

<p>
I yearn to throw the whole lot out and start again. But, of course,
that is unthinkable.
</p>

<p>
We have 3 jukeboxes which feed 5 tape drives. About a month ago, the
PX502 started to misbehave. I started scouring documentation,
searching around in the logs and trying various commands. Somewhere I
came across this helpful message:
</p>


<pre>
	The drive is not ready - it requires an initialization command
</pre>

<p>
Oh, really? Well, if you are so smart, send the appropriate
initialization command. Or tell me what the initialization command
looks like and ask me to issue it.
</p>

<p>
Don't you just hate that? It's on a par with those stupid messages
that compilers sometimes produce, something like:
</p>

<pre>
	Fatal error: extraneous comma
</pre>

<p>
!! I mean, I wouldn't mind,
</p>

<pre>
	Warning: extraneous comma. Ignored.
</pre>

<p>
But "<tt>Fatal error</tt>"?! Give me a break. That's just punitive.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to me that the aberrant behaviour was hardware-related. I
chased around to see if the unit was under maintenance. There was some
difficulty in locating the relevant paperwork, but I was given a phone
number and assured it would be OK. It wasn't really OK, but David came
out nonetheless and poked around.
</p>

<p>
It was one of those visits like when you take your car to the
mechanic - or your kids to their friends. The car and the kids are
suddenly on their best behaviour. The mechanic cannot hear any of
those ominous noises that caused so much consternation. And the other
parents report what sweet children you have.
</p>

<p>
As you drive away in frustration, the car starts its strange noises
and the kids are attempting to kill each other in the back seat.
</p>

<p>
Two days later I was back on the phone to David. He assured me that
our support was not with him but with some other crowd, but since he
had started down this path, he would continue and work out some
cross-charging with the other crowd. He told me to run some program
and send him the output.
</p>

<p>
Apparently, he sent the output on to the US and was informed that one
of the drives needed replacement. They shipped a replacement drive to
David, who came out again a few days later.
</p> 

<p>
And that should have been the end of it.
</p>

<p>
But no. This is the story of a nightmare; don't look for happy
endings. The happiest part of a nightmare is when you wake up.
</p>

<p>
The software which coordinates all the backup tasks is Sun's
StorageTek EBS which is really  Legato NetWorker under the covers.
After the drive swapout, the StorageTek software showed only a single
drive on the PX502.
</p>

<p>
I struggled with this for a while, believing it ought to be fairly
straightforward to solve this problem. And this is where I demonstrate
why I earn the big bucks. <img src='smile.png' alt=":-)" />
</p>

<p>
When you encounter a problem like this you have the analogue of the
manufacturer's make/buy dilemma. Do you try to fix it yourself? Or do
you call in support? Before you can think about calling for support
you have to answer a few questions.
</p>

<p>
First, have you investigated the problem? If your opening gambit is,
"It doesn't work," you may find it hard to get useful help. Support
may suggest politely that you try reading the manual.
</p>

<p>
Second, is the problem hardware or software? In many cases, my answer
is that if I knew that I wouldn't be calling for support.
Nevertheless, you need to be able to engage support, get them
interested enough to want to help you. Otherwise, they'll just give
you a lot of dopey menial tasks.
</p>

<p>
Finally, do you even have support?
</p>

<p>
First, I tried the Microsoft approach: if things don't work, try
restarting them; or power cycling. I'm not proud to take this route,
but I figure support is going to suggest it, so I may as well clear
the decks. Unsurprisingly, nothing was gained.
</p>

<p>
I started trying to break things down. Does the machine see the
hardware?
</p>

<p>
Before the problems, the PX502 controlled 2 tape drives:
</p>

<pre>
	/dev/rmt/0cbn
	/dev/rmt/1cbn
</pre>

<p>
The first of these was the faulty one. When it was swapped out, the
new tape drive came up as /dev/rmt/2cbn. I don't understand why. As I
write this, it occurs to me that another approach to this problem may
have been to persuade Solaris at the lowest level that this tape drive
was /dev/rmt/0cbn.
</p>

<p>
I also thought it might not be a bad idea to reboot the Sun to which
the tape drive is attached, but this is the organisation's file
server; rebooting it is not a task to be taken lightly. Fortuitously,
it rebooted itself one night when one of its SAN disks had a hiccup.
Even the reboot did not improve matters.
</p>

<p>
I was able to go to the front panel of the PX502, press some buttons
and load a tape into the "invisible" drive. So, at least as far as the
PX502 is concerned, the tape drive is present.
</p>

<p>
I then went to the Sun to which the tape drive is attached and issued:
</p>

<pre>
	mt -f /dev/rmt/2cbn status
	Quantum DLT-S4 tape drive:
	   sense key(0x6)= Unit Attention   residual= 0   retries= 0
	   file no= 0   block no= 0
</pre>

<p>
That's promising. It looks like the Sun knows about the tape drive.
</p>

<p>
Since the tape was one of the backup tapes, it had a label. I don't
know exactly what a label looks like, but I expect it to be at the
beginning of the tape. I did:
</p>

<pre>
	dd if=/dev/rmt/2cbn ibs=1000000 count=1 | od -Cx | less
</pre>

<p>
This reads the first MB off the tape and pipes it into a dump format.
Lots of the dump were incomprehensible to me, but about 16 lines down
I found a string that corresponded to the label (tapeBSA.3472).
</p>

<pre>
0000360  \0  \0  \0  \f   t   a   p   e   B   S   A   .   3   4   7   2
</pre>

<p>
At the lowest level, the drive is present and works fine.
</p>

<p>
When David had come out, he had shown me how to connect to the PX502
web interface. From the web interface one can control the PX502 more
conveniently than from its front panel. I navigated from one screen to
another, satisfying myself that it could see two tape drives, could
move a tape from a magazine to a drive; and move it the other way as
well. So it seemed fair to conclude that the PX502 was OK.
</p>

<p>
That left the interface between the PX502 and the Sun, or the
StorageTek software. The StorageTek software claimed it could see the
PX502 and one of the drives, so my money was on a problem with the
StorageTek software. Time to find out if we have support (we do) and
then get in touch with Sun.
</p>

<p>
After only a little bit of palaver over my inability to locate the
correct paperwork, Sun routed my call to someone who took down the
details. He was reasonably patient with my uncertainty as to whether
this was hardware or software. After some discussion, he agreed with
my view that it was probably the StorageTek software that merited
attention. I was given a Tracking Number.
</p>

<p>
I didn't expect anything much to happen right way, especially as I'd
called about 4:30 pm on a Friday. I began thinking about packing up
and going home, expecting that I'd pick up the matter on Monday, so I
was somewhat startled when the phone rang only a few minutes later.
</p>

<p>
"I'm ringing about your Sev 1."
</p>

<p>
<em>Sev 1?!</em> A Severity One error means something catastrophic like the
entire business has ground to a halt! I freaked. Typically, to get an
organisation like Sun to even allow you to call in a Sev 1, you have
to be paying big bikkies. Normally you get "best effort" or maybe
"response within one business day". Sev 1?! Maybe defence departments
get to call Sev Ones, not me.
</p>

<p>
I hastened to assure the caller that I had never mentioned that the
problem was critical. Far from it - I was in no great rush to get the
problem solved. He took this with good grace, and we agreed to leave
it until Monday.
</p>

<p>
I guess Sun runs some sort of tag-team problem-solving that follows
the, um, sun. On Monday morning, my inbox had a couple of emails with
the Tracking Number in the subject, which had arrived Friday after I
had left.
</p>

<p>
The first email seemed to be on the ball. It asked me to provide
details of the software I was using; the output of several
commands; and the contents of several logs. This approach suits me
well. I get to find out which instructions the experts use, so in the
future I can help myself.
</p> 

<p>
The second email came from the same sender. I'm guessing he's based in
India. He had tried to call me and wanted to confirm that the number
he had was correct. Since his email included a bit that went "... as I
did not get a response @ 61-3 ...", I concluded that he had tried to
make an international call. (I usually expect to see a plus (+) for
international access, but "61" is the country code for Australia and
"3" is my area code.) He also asked for a few more details.
</p>

<p>
I spent the rest of Monday fighting fires. It was Tuesday before I
could gather the various responses. I was still a bit antsy about the
Sev 1, so I prefaced my responses with:
</p>


<pre><em>
	I've said this before, but I'll repeat it just in case. The
	unit is usable (even though it seems to complain that it can't
	see the changer). We are doing backups with the one tape drive
	it can see. However, it had 2 tape drives and we want it to be
	able to use both tape drives.
</em></pre>

<p>
I included in my email a summary of the situation to date, pretty much
what I have written above.
</p> 

<p>
When it came to sending the logs, I had a bit of a problem. One of the
log files was 12 MB, the other 544 MB. It seems that these log files
are never rolled over. I sent the last part of the log file, containing 
entries for the last few months.
</p>

<p>
I had been asked to "kindly provide the screenshot that shows the
errors from console."
</p> 

<p>
I had two methods for monitoring the backup: a java GUI; and nsrwatch,
a curses-based application. The GUI proved unhelpful, but nsrwatch
displayed several messages.
</p>

<p>
The main error message was:
</p>

<pre>
	media warning: The /dev/rmt/0cbn is either skipped as
	requested (due to hardware problem) or no longer connected to
	the storage node.

	media warning: Please remove /dev/rmt/0cbn from NetWorker if
	it is permanently disconnected.
</pre>

<p>
Well, that's probably correct. The old drive was zero; for some reason
the new one is two. There was also an analogous message for the
changer. And yet, the software can drive the changer!
</p>

<p>
I wrote back:
</p>

<pre><em>
I've attached a screenshot, but there are no error messages as such.

Perhaps the following might be more useful:

# jbedit -j 'Quantum PX502' -a -f /dev/rmt/2cbn -E 81
Using 'unix33.alpha.wehi.edu.au' as NetWorker server host.
39078:jbedit: RAP error: The device '/dev/rmt/2cbn' is already part of jukebox 'Quantum PX502'.

# jbedit -j 'Quantum PX502' -d -f /dev/rmt/2cbn -E 81
Using 'unix33.alpha.wehi.edu.au' as NetWorker server host.
39077:jbedit: error, Cannot find device `/dev/rmt/2cbn' in jukebox `Quantum PX502'.
</em></pre>

<p>
I included this to underline the point that the software had become
very confused. I can't add the tape drive because it's already there.
But I can't delete it because it isn't there.
</p>

<p>
Late the next afternoon a reply came summarising their understanding
of the problem; then this:
</p>


<pre><em>
	Please Select the jukebox PX502 from GUI and do a scan for
	drives. I am sure this will show the missing drive into the
	configration.

	If this fails we need to delete this Jukebox and recreate it
	once again. It is suggested to do this when there is a
	downtime available.
</em></pre>

<p>
There was an interesting bit that followed. Here's a fragment of my
reply:
</p>

<p>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<em>--&gt;please let me know how did you get the element number "81". Kindly</em>
</p>

<p>
I honestly don't remember.
</p>

<p>
<em>--&gt;confirm the correct element number using the sjisn command.</em>
</p>

<pre>
        sjisn 3.7.0
Serial Number data for 3.7.0 (QUANTUM  PX500           ):
        Library:
                Serial Number: QP0714BDC00025
                SCSI-3 Device Identifiers:
                        ATNN=QUANTUM PX500           QP0714BDC00025
                        IENN=00E09EFFFF0B61FE
                        WWNN=100000E09E0B61FE
        Drive at element address 128:
                SCSI-3 Device Identifiers:
                        ATNN=QUANTUM DLT-S4          QP0713AMD00014 
        Drive at element address 129:
                SCSI-3 Device Identifiers:
                        ATNN=QUANTUM DLT-S4          QP0734AMD00102
</pre> 



<p>
I guess 81 (hex) = 129 (decimal).<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p>

<p>
And here we have an encapsulation of some of the many ways that things
can go wrong. This is so easy in hindsight. I have a PhD in hindsight.
Rear vision is always 20/20.
</p>

<p>
Why <strong>had</strong> I used element number "81"? Because I am too
clever by half! In the man page for jbedit(1m), I had seen an example which
ended with "-E 82". When one is a Brilliant Expert, one gets a "feel" for
the "shape" of numbers. A number like 81 or 82 in the context of devices is
so obviously hexadecimal only a fool would imagine any other possibility.
(Would the fool typing please put his hand up?) When I saw "129" it was
obvious that I was meant to translate it to hex, so I did. Wrong!
</p>

<p>
Strangely, the support guys never corrected me. That's the next
lesson. I had spent much time trying to establish how to determine the
element number. I should never have responded the way I did.
</p>

<p>
I ought to know better. I have worked for many years in support. I am
reluctant to let my customers tell me what they think is wrong. I am
only interested in what they were trying to do, what they saw, and
what they expected or wanted to see. Very often, if I let them tell me
what they think is wrong, I get sucked in to their view of the
problem. Had that view been helpful, they would have solved the
problem already. They are coming to me for a fresh perspective.
</p>

<p>
In researching for this article, I came across this in the man page:
</p>

<pre>
	The data element address is the "decimal number" that the
	jukebox assigns to each of its drives.
</pre>

<p>
This underlines another valuable lesson. Most people, most of the
time, operate as if they subscribe to the theory "don't confuse me
with facts, my mind's made up". Of course, if you try to say that to
people out loud, they respond that it's ridiculous.
</p>

<p>
I may have read that part of the man page when I was trying to solve
the problem. But, if I did, I never connected "decimal number" with
the value associated with "-E". (I wonder why the man page has
"decimal number" in quotes.)
</p>

<p>
The next day I received another email suggesting that the GUI
"database is corrupted"; that I pkgrm (uninstall) the GUI part of the
software; delete the database components; and then pkgadd
((re)install) it. I'd seen a similar suggestion in posts on the Net.
</p>

<p>
Be careful what you wish for. And, once again, I justify my wage.
</p>

<p>
I am always reluctant to delete. Except in extremis, I always rename.
Or take a copy and then pkgrm. Fortunately, that's what I did.
</p>


<p>
And when he got there the cupboard was ...
</p>

<p>
... not exactly bare. However, when I had pkgrmed the software, I then
tried the pkgadd
</p>

<pre>
	pkgadd: ERROR: no packages were found in &lt;/var/spool/pkg&gt;
</pre>

<p>
<em>Oops.</em>
</p>

<p>
I started rooting around the file system. However, there were some
problems. I guess I should have said "more problems"; I seem to have
them in spades.
</p>

<p>
This is a Sun running Solaris 10. Unlike sensible systems (Linux,
FreeBSD), Sun does not offer "locate" by default. As I read somewhere,
if ever a system needed "locate", it's Solaris. Further, this system is
the file server: it serves over 20 TB. It's also extremely overloaded.
I'm not going to be popular if I start doing a find across 20TB; and
I'm not going to get an answer any time soon. So, although I know what
the package is called, I'm going to have a hard time finding it.
</p>

<p>
I eventually found the package and installed it. Um, not quite. I
installed 7.3 and we were running 7.4. So although I can use the GUI,
it doesn't have all the features which used to be present.
</p>

<p>
Some problems can be solved in one sitting. It should be clear that
this saga continued over the course of a month, maybe more.
Concurrently, I was doing other parts of my regular job, including the
limping backups. Every now and then I would find the time to mount
another assault on my problem du jour.
</p>

<p>
Time is a great healer in all sorts of activities. However, a balance
must be struck. If all you do is monomaniacally try to solve the
problem to the exclusion of other activities, firstly you will neglect
important duties; but more importantly, you may get too close to the
problem - you start going round in circles, stumbling blindly, getting
confused, making mistakes.
</p>

<p>
I reckon I've solved more tough problems on the drive/walk/tram/train
home, or in the shower, than I have at the keyboard.
</p>

<p>
One day, I tried a minor variation on an earlier command and had
success.
</p>

<pre>
	jbedit -j 'Quantum PX502' -a -f /dev/rmt/2cbn -E 129
</pre>

<p>
If you've persevered to here, you will recognise this as similar to a
command listed earlier, but now I'm using 129 instead of the alleged
hex 81.
</p>

<p>
Now 2 tape drives show up in the GUI. My original problem has been
solved.
</p>

<p>
If only I hadn't uninstalled the console software!
</p>

<p>
Where was I going to find the version we used to have?
</p>

<p>
When you read job ads, you'll often see specifications that the
prospective employer requires or desires. In my experience, these are
rarely relevant. Sure, you want someone with a computer background,
not a ballerina or a chef. You probably want someone with a Unix
background if you run a Unix shop.
</p>

<p>
But getting more detailed than that seems to me pointless. If your
looking for a mechanic, you want someone who has worked on cars, but
do you really need someone who has worked on 1975 Dodge Darts?
</p>

<p>
I'm looking for some software. Which part of my CV is going to
demonstrate my ability to find it? The question is not going to be
asked. But this is exactly the sort of real-world problem that must be
solved.
</p>

<p>
And that's my point. Most organisations are sufficiently idiosyncratic
that the way they do things contributes to the steepest part of the
learning curve. In-depth knowledge of a particular release of a
distribution, or a specific rev of some software package is only
transiently helpful.
</p>

<p>
The real requirement is to be able to get answers and solve problems;
to perform the necessary research.
</p>

<p>
Before this job, I had used Legato, but I had not been in charge of
the backup. I had no familiarity with managing the backup. But that
task has not been difficult to pick up. It's just like getting behind
the wheel of an unfamiliar car.
</p>

<p>
Finding where the software might be is a horse of a different colour.
</p>

<p>
I decided I needed a locate database. Not a genuine, complete,
standard locate database; but something simple and workable. I didn't
need to update it regularly, because I was only interested in files
which were already there. A df showed that the root directory and /var
were on separate filesystems. All the other filesystems, the 20TB,
were out of my area of interest. I went with
</p>

<pre>
	nice find / /var -mount &gt;&gt; ~/tmp/locate.output
</pre>

<p>
Now I can grep for what I need. It's not brilliant, but it will do.
</p>

<p>
It enabled me to find files which were helpful in other ways, but in
creating my little ersatz locate I managed to overlook /usr/local. A
colleague pointed me to an obscure subdirectory of /usr/local where I
found rev 7.4 of the Legato software.
</p>

<p>
It was close to what we'd had before, but even that wasn't the end of
the story. I found something dated later than the other candidates in
a patch directory. So once more I went through the cycle of uninstall
of the old version and reinstall of the new. But the latest item was
in a patch directory. It complained that it could only be installed
over an existing installation of the Legato software.
</p>

<p>
Patches have come to mean so many different things. When I was just
starting out in computers, a patch was an analogue of what I use to
repair my bike tubes. Typically it consisted of instructions to
overwrite the contents of a file at a small number of locations with
binary data; patching was done by hand. Over time, patching also came
to mean a form of automated editing of source code. And patching is
also used to describe the selective replacement of some files in a
package. In fact, in the Solaris world, patches are packaged in a very
similar way to software. There is not a lot of difference between
pkgadd and patchadd. My guess is that they share an awful lot of
codebase.
</p>

<p>
I have seen so-called jumbo patches from Sun which run to nearly a
gigabyte. From humble beginnings...
</p>

<p>
I reinstalled 7.4 and then installed the patch and finally I was back
to our original GUI console. Finally, after nearly a month, all the
problems had been resolved.
</p>

<p>
A day or two later, another jukebox, attached to another machine,
started to play up. As I write, it looks like I am looking at
repeating the exercise above. I hope that my experience will allow me
to get out the the other side with less drama.

<h1>Making Your Network Transparent</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/okopnik.html">Ben Okopnik</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
Some months ago, I set up a anti-spam system on my laptop which I wrote up
back in <a href="../176/okopnik.html">issue #176</a>. Having it based on
my local machine, however, produces a significant amount of SMTP traffic.
Since I wanted to minimize that load, I copied my .procmailrc, my
whitelist, and my blacklist files to my home directory on the mail server.
As a result, my mail traffic dropped from about 1k messages per day, plus
the round trips to GMail for any emails in the "doubtful" category, to
about 25 (valid) messages per day. This is especially wonderful since I
often have a slow or fragile connection to the Net, depending on where I
happen to be at the moment.
</p>

<p>
However, there's still a slight catch: the two list files mentioned above
get updated on a regular basis. That is, if I get an email from someone and
I decide that I'm going to correspond with that person regularly, I
white-list them by hitting 'Ctrl-W' in Mutt (this, of course, requires
setting up a keystroke alias in '~/.muttrc'.) Conversely, black-listing
someone just takes hitting 'Ctrl-B'. Both of these actions, obviously,
update their relevant list file - but they do so <em>locally</em>, and
that's not where my (primary) spam filter is anymore. What to do? Logging
into the mailserver on a regular basis and copying the files would be a
hassle and an additional task that I'd have to remember - and that's
precisely the kind of load that I don't want to add to my routine.
Fortunately, automating it is easy.
</p>

<h3>SSH Authorization</h3>

<p>
Needless to say, your network transactions need to be secure. Fortunately,
the standard tool for these, 'ssh', is perfectly suited to the task - and
it even allows for secure connections without using a password. All you
need to do is configure the two machines to perform authorization via
<em>public key exchange</em>, essentially by copying your public key from
one to the other. Here's the procedure:
</p>

<ol type='roman'>
<li> Ensure that you have a .ssh directory in your home directory on your
local machine. Create it if it doesn't exist.

<li> Assuming that you don't already have one, generate a 1024-bit SSH key;
each system from which you'll want to connect in this way will need one.
If the key already exists (i.e., you already have an 'id_dsa.pub' or an
'id_rsa.pub' file in your ~/.ssh directory), then you can skip this step.

<pre>ssh-keygen -tdsa</pre>


<li> Append your <em>local</em> public key to your <em>remote</em> host's
'~/.ssh/authorized_keys' file:
<pre>ssh user@remote_host 'cat&gt;&gt;~/.ssh/authorized_keys'&lt;~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub</pre>
Enter your password when prompted, and take pleasure in knowing that this
is the last time you'll need to do so. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=':-)' />
</ol>

<p>
You should now be able to simply type 'ssh user@remote_host' and be logged
in - no password required. In fact, you can make this exchange even simpler
by giving your remote system a short alias; just add an entry in your
local ~/.ssh/config file (create it if it doesn't exist) similar to this one:
</p>

<pre class='code'>
Host sfs
Hostname smithfamilyserver.com
	Protocol 2
	User joe
	Compression yes
</pre>

<p>
Once that's done, you'll be able to log into the above server simply by
typing 'ssh sfs'. Nice, short, and simple.
</p>

<h3>Configuring rsync</h3>

<p>
At this point, I could simply copy the files that I want to the server by
issuing an 'scp' command ('secure copy', part of the SSH suite); however,
as a matter of good general practice, I like to only update the files if
it's necessary - i.e., if they either don't exist or if the local files are
different from the remote ones - and skip the update otherwise. The 'rsync'
command can do exactly that - and I can even tell it to use SSH as the
transport mechanism. All that takes is a couple of simple steps:
</p>

<ol type='roman'>
<li> Define the 'rsync' transport by adding the appropriate line to your
login configuration file:

<pre>echo 'export RSYNC_RSH=/usr/bin/ssh -l remote_username' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile</pre>

<strong><em>Note:</em></strong> depending on your distro and on how you use
your system, you may also need to add it to your ~/.xprofile ; in fact, you
might as well do it just to make sure, since it won't do any harm. If you
use a shell other than Bash, then presumably you'll know what to do to set
and export that variable in that shell.

<li> Tell the shell to re-read that file (e.g., 'source ~/.bash_profile'),
or simply log out and log back in.
</ol>

<p>
Now that both SSH and rsync are configured, updating the remote files is
simply a matter of issuing the following command:
<p>

<pre>rsync ~/.mail-* sfs:</pre>

<p>
The colon, of course, tells 'rsync' (just as it would for the 'ssh'
command) that we're copying the files to a remote host. The default remote
location is your home directory on the remote machine; obviously, you can
specify any directory you want there - assuming you have the right system
permissions for it - by adding it immediately after the colon.
</p>

<p>
Automating it is just as easy: just create a line in your 'crontab' file
that will run the above command on your desired schedule. For example, if I
want these two files updated once an hour, I'll set up a cron job by typing
'crontab -e' and editing my crontab to look like this:
</p>

<pre>
# m     h   	dom     mon 	dow     command
05      *   	*       *   	*   	/usr/bin/rsync /home/ben/.mail-{accept,deny}-list sfs:
</pre>

<p>
Following the comment line, this means "on the 5th minute of every hour of
every day of every month on every day of the week, execute this command."
That task will now be executed for you, regular as clockwork - and without
you having to think about it ever again.
</p>

<h3>Wrap-up</h3>

<p>
Obviously, this isn't something that you'd go through just to copy a couple
of files; that's easy enough without any special configuration. However,
once you've set this up, it can serve you in many different ways - and SSH
and rsync are both great tools to have in your toolbox. For me, they come
in handy many times a day - and since I have them correctly configured, my
network actions are just as simple as the ones involving files on my local
machine. Here are a few examples:
</p>

<pre>
ssh lg							# Log into the Linux Gazette machine
rsync file.html www:okopnik.com/misc			# Copy or update 'file.html' to the 'misc/' directory of my website
ssh 203k 'tail /var/log/messages'			# See the last 10 entries in the log on a client's server
rsync -a ~/devel rb:backup/`date +%%FT%%T`/		# Back up my 'devel' dir in a time-stamped subdir on my remote server
</pre>

<p>
Enjoy, and <a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net">let us know</a>
about any interesting uses you find for your newly-transparent network!

<h1>Time Management for System Administrators</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/pfeiffer.html">Ren&eacute; Pfeiffer</a></b></p>

</p>

<p>
<h3>
Time Management?
</h3>

<p>
Once upon a while ago I got a Christmas present from my fianc&eacute;e. It was a book. Its title
was "Time Management for System Administrators". So technically it was both a present and a message
for me, because I am a professional system administrator working as a freelancer. In turn this article is both
a book review and a collection of thoughts from the other end of the terminal. Many of you work as
sysadmins, developers, project coordinators, or similar jobs. The problems of time and task management
are very similar.
</p>

<h3>
What's bothering you?
</h3>

<p>
Do you have a hard time focusing your thoughts? Do you forget to deal with tasks, or do some tasks
slip through your mind? Do you get cranky when people ask questions or report problems by phone (or at all)? Are
you afraid of deadlines? Are you late for appointments? Trouble getting out of bed?<br>
The chances of getting a <em>yes</em> from IT staff are quite high. I won't try to find a reason,
but I noticed that getting overloaded is very easy if you don't track issues before they turn into
major problems. The first step is to periodically review what you are doing and to make it a habit.
Developers call it refactoring, sysadmins call it maintenance, you can call it whatever you want, but
make it a habit to review what you are doing. First you need to know, then you can think of solutions
or improvement. It's very similar to diagnosing server problems or finding bugs in software.
</p>

<h3>
Tools of the Trade
</h3>

<p>
The list of tools you use for work may be very long. Of all tools you use two are the most important ones:
a calendar and a TODO list. These don't have to be digital. Analogue calendars and lists will do just fine -
but make sure you can <em>use</em> them on a daily basis! Did you get the <em>daily</em> in the last sentence?
<em>Daily!</em>
</p>

<p>
It means that you will use your calendar and TODO list for work <em>every day</em>. This implies that these tools must not
be inoperable as soon as you buy a new cell phone, play with the server setup of your CalDAV installation, fiddle
with firmware, buy a new notebook (the ones with the paper or the electronics inside) or run out of ink.<br>
Your calendar allows for a basic planning of resources and your future. The TODO or task lists allows for tracking
what you still have to do and what you've already done. The latter is especially useful when figuring out days where you
were busy but have no idea of what you really did. In this case just look it up in your task list and you're done!
</p>

<p>
A remark about notes: do take notes! Do not try to remember anything - you will fail sooner or later! The act of writing
down has a psychological side effect. You can forget immediately what you wrote down, because you can look it up later (when
you browse through your task list to see open tasks). I never make phone calls without having my notes ready (and I tell
people on the phone if I have notes or not; if not I ask them to call back later).
This is a useful habit. It is also a good advice in case you cannot sleep. Whenever my mind is busy racing
through the tasks I have still do to, I write everything down. Usually I'm calmer after that and can relax.
You should try it some time.
</p>

<p>
Since I am a freelancer I suggest adding a time recording tool to the basic toolbox. Most companies
use time recording tools for determining how much work was spent on which task. Ostensibly these records
are needed for generating invoices after the tasks are finished, but tracking time is always a good idea.
You should track time for all tasks. This helps in answering questions like "How long does it take to set up a
LAMP server and deploy it in the DMZ?" or "Can you add a new backup client on server XY before the next
backup run is activated?" A lot of time is spent on these estimates, so keep a list of frequent tasks or
small projects and use it for reference.
</p>

<p>
I omitted a list of software on purpose, because finding the right tools is different for every one of us.
Invest some time, try different tools, code the tools for yourself - do whatever you must, but do it. It's
well worth the effort.
</p>

<h3>
Communication and Interrupts
</h3>

<p>
Well-designed communication protocols and a lower rate of interrupts are a benefit to every server
hardware and software application. The same is true for human beings. Computers can do multitasking
a lot better than most humans can. Ringing telephones (and other symmetric communication lines)
are the bane of focused work. What can you do?<br>
In case you work as a team (i.e. you have co-workers) you can try to shield each other. Divide the
time where one of you is reachable, so that the others can work uninterrupted when not "on duty".
If you work alone, try defining and communicating "office hours". This doesn't mean that you should
turn down anyone calling you "out of line". It just means that you can try and control the interrupts
to some extent. Emergencies stay emergencies, of course.
</p>
<p>
As for instant messaging tools, e-mail clients and similar applications: Try to turn them off once in
a while. For example if you are writing an article for the Linux Gazette, you most probably don't need
to be notified of incoming e-mails. The same is true for instant messaging. Just before starting to
write this article I set my Jabber status to "Do not disturb". Mailing lists are a welcome distraction, too.
Do you have unread e-mails piling up in the folders of your favourite lists? If so try at least to
automatically filter your incoming e-mails. It's also a good idea to unsubscribe from one mailing list per
week or month (actually you can unsubscribe from RSS feeds and other sources of distraction, too). You don't need
to get all the information, you just need to get the right information. Find your personal balance on a
weekly or monthly basis.
</p>
<p>
As for the dreaded phone: In case you have no shield, you can nevertheless politely tell the caller that
you cannot deal with her/his problem in the moment and that you will call back. Make a note in your calendar
or in your task list, then proceed with what you were doing. If it's urgent, the caller will tell you so.
Keep in mind that others might not realise
that you are occupied with other tasks. Cell phone numbers do not have presence information.<br>
I cannot stress this too much: always be polite! Most people really understand when you are busy. Most of the
time you just have to acknowledge their call and postpone the conversation.
</p>

<h3>
Random Collections of Methods
</h3>

<h4>
The Dreaded Meetings
</h4>

<p>
Meetings are fun! After a day filled with meetings most of us feel like having wasted their time. If this
is the case then something went clearly wrong. Meetings are necessary, but you have to be aware of their
purpose.
<ul>
    <li> Coordination Meetings<br>
    The purpose of this meeting is to give all participants a status report. In theory, some people report,
    the others listen, and everyone then goes to work. You might not even have to sit down for this kind
    of meeting (standing during a meeting is a perfect measure to shorten the duration).</li>
    <li> Work meetings<br>
    These meetings are usually longer and involve a lot of participation from the, well, participants.
    The goal of a work meeting is to produce something that can be published, implemented, printed, or otherwise
    used sensibly (yes, I know, you can print anything, but you get my point).</li>
</ul>
If you are planning a meeting, make sure you consider the following points:
<ul>
    <li> Purpose<br>
    You must have a clear idea about the purpose and the expected results of the meeting. If you can't think of anything,
    don't arrange a meeting.</li>
    <li> Agenda<br>
    Write down the issues that need to be addressed.</li>
    <li> Participants<br>
    Who needs to attend? Who does not need to attend? If the individual points of the agenda only address
    two participants at once, consider splitting the meeting into more meetings. You don't want to bore
    people.</li>
    <li> Preparation<br>
    What needs to be prepared? Do the participants need to know something in advance? If so, inform them!
    There's no point to sitting around a table and reading papers for half an hour before the meeting can even start!</li>
</ul>
All tasks that are distributed during a meeting must have deadlines. Use your calendar and set a date!
This is the only way to get things done. And don't tell everyone that deadlines can be moved if there's a reason
to do so.
</p>
<p>
What if someone is late for a meeting? Easy: try hard not to care. Don't start any meeting a second later than
announced! We live in a world where reliable time sources are abundant (think NTP clients). Everyone has a chance
to synchronise and everyone has sufficient means of communication (think cell phones and wireless gadgets). If not, then there's the summary. Every meeting
has a summary which should be distributed to all participants. So you don't have to wait if you lead the meeting,
and you don't have to hurry if you're late. You can catch up later.<br>
What about decisions? No problem there, either. If you're late for a meeting, you've already claimed that you do not care.
If you care, inform about being delayed or be on time.
</p>

<h4>
Cycles and Automated Tasks
</h4>

<p>
Every company and every individual has cycles. Every day, I go to sleep and I get up. Once every month, I write
invoices and pay my rent. Every winter semester, I teach a class. Every night, the backup server executes the
backup schedule, and every Saturday the backups are copied to the archive server.<br>
You have to identify cycles in your job and incorporate them into your schedule. As soon as you have done that,
the amount of "sudden surprises" will decrease. Knowing what happens next is also a good way of disttributing your
workload more evenly. Remember, I am only talking about periodical events here.
</p>
<p>
Once you know your cycles, try to automate tasks. Technically this isn't coupled to cycles; you should always
automate your tasks. Servers have automatic upgrades, garbage collections, backups, scripted actions; you need
to catch up! My fianc&eacute;e persuaded me to find or implement a time recording system that automatically
generates the invoices for all tasks of a month. It took me some weeks to implement it (and it's not "ready" yet, but
it's working). This means I record my tasks daily, and at the beginning of every month I browse through the
automatically generated PDFs on the fileserver, check the invoices and send them to customers. Before that,
I spent hours of wading through the notes on my desk and through the entries in my calendar, cursing, copying
task descriptions, and remembering all (?) the things I hadn't recorded. So this one day of bad mood has been effectively
programmed away.<br>
It's just an example, but I am sure that you will find a lot of tasks in your day that can be automated.
Do it! It frees your mind and you can concentrate on more important issues. If you don't believe this, ask your
local sysadmin. These people usually write scripts for everything, too. It really works.
</p>
<p>
There are other cycles tied to your biology as well. Some people like to get up early, some like to work into the
night. There's no problem with that as long as you a) know your personal circadian rhythm and b) are nevertheless
able to interact with society.
</p>

<h4>
A Word on Schedules
</h4>

<p>
There will be periods where you will definitely be unable to do concentrated work. For example our office
will be cleaned every Tuesday (also a perfect example for a cycle). This is a pretty regular event. Since
there will be a lot of cleaning around my desk and in the rooms, I always try to get the things done that don't
need a lot of concentration: paperwork, phone calls, light correspondence, sorting stuff, maybe even cleaning
my desk, too. Plan your schedule according to these events. Try to combine the right task with the right moment.
</p>

<h4>
Deadlines
</h4>

<p>
Deadlines are the driving force behind everything. Actually they're quite old and most of them are not
negotiable. <em>Gather enough food for the Winter.</em> <em>Give a talk at the conference about cluster filesystems.</em>
<em>Write and submit an article for the Linux Gazette before the 20th of every month.</em> The list is long.
So what about deadlines? Nothing. They just are. Of course they can cause a lot of trouble, but having deadlines
is the only way of really getting things done. They force you to assign priorities to your tasks.
Make sure you use them for requests and all of your tasks.
</p>

<h4>
Delegate!
</h4>

<p>
Believe it or not, you cannot do everything on your own. It's impossible, even if you got <tt>root</tt>.
It can't be done. So first thing you should do is to stop trying to do everyting yourself! Now!<br>
Learn to trust others. Learn to ask them for help and to accept what they are doing. The hardest part is
accepting that others deal with tasks a little differently. That's why we can talk to each other and set
guidelines. This can be done with politeness and cooperation. And it works - provided you give it a try.
</p>

<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>

<p>
So I guessed right, this isn't a book review at all. I left out most of the stuff that Thomas A. Limoncelli
describes in his book. It's also not rocket science. Most of the hints and best pratices are known to anyone
who's ever worked in a company or as a freelancer. You just need a wake up call to improve your habits from time
to time. I suggest taking a look at "Time Management for System Administrators". There's a second link
to a Wikipedia article about "verbal self defense". Check it out, too. It's about being polite even in the
worst of all situations you can imagine. If you work in sales you know what I am talking about, but system
administrators have "difficult" customers, too. Difficult is not the right word. If someone has lost data or
is frustrated by the behaviour of applications he/she has all the right in the world to be "difficult".
Bear that in mind and skip the luser joke, people turn to you for help, not because they want to make
your life "difficult".

<p>
Ren&eacute; was born in the year of Atari's founding and the release of the game Pong.
Since his early youth he started taking things apart to see how they work. He
couldn't even pass construction sites without looking for electrical wires that
might seem interesting. The interest in computing began when his grandfather
bought him a 4-bit microcontroller with 256 byte RAM and a 4096 byte operating
system, forcing him to learn assembler before any other language.
</p>

<p>
After finishing school he went to university in order to study physics. He then
collected experiences with a C64, a C128, two Amigas, DEC's Ultrix, OpenVMS and
finally GNU/Linux on a PC in 1997. He is using Linux since this day and still
likes to take things apart und put them together again. Freedom of tinkering
brought him close to the Free Software movement, where he puts some effort into
the right to understand how things work. He is also involved with civil liberty
groups focusing on digital rights.
</p>

<p>
Since 1999 he is offering his skills as a freelancer. His main activities
include system/network administration, scripting and consulting. In 2001 he
started to give lectures on computer security at the Technikum Wien. Apart from
staring into computer monitors, inspecting hardware and talking to network
equipment he is fond of scuba diving, writing, or photographing with his digital
camera. He would like to have a go at storytelling and roleplaying again as soon
as he finds some more spare time on his backup devices.

<h1>Controlling DC Motors from your Linux Box</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/radcliffe.html">P. J. Radcliffe</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<h3>Linux and Hardware</h3>

<p>
 Linux is the best general purpose operating system for controlling
hardware. It allows fast and well-controlled access to Input/Output ports
such as the parallel port and serial port as well as plug in cards. The
Linux Gazette has two good articles on how to achieve this, see <A
href="../112/radcliffe.html">[1]</A> and <A
href="../118/chong.html">[2]</A>. If you need real time response, consider
the RTAI extension of Linux, again Linux Gazette has some very useful
articles that use RTAI to achieve motor control <A
href="../118/sreejith.html">[3]</A>, make a stroboscope <A
href="http://linuxgazette.net/114/pramode.html">[4]</A>, and use a
joy-stick to control servo motors <A href="../101/pramode.html">[5]</A>
.
</p>

<p>
 Many of these approaches rely on direct access to ports such as the
parallel port, but this is becoming increasingly difficult as laptops and
newer desktops rely on USB as the sole input-output (IO) mechanism.
Hardware access via USB requires a plug-in USB module that translates USB
to basic digital IO, and if possible analogue IO. These boards are
relatively cheap, starting from about US$35. It's also possible to build
your own USB interface based on Open Source designs such as VUSB <A
href="http://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/index.html">[6]</A>
.  
</p>

<p>
 In this article we will show you how to use a very flexible USB interface
board called Open-USB-IO <A
href="http://www.pjradcliffe.wordpress.com">[7]</A>
 to achieve speed control of a DC motor without any form of shaft encoder.
Open-USB-IO provides a lot of options for a very reasonable price. Notable
hardware interfaces include digital IO with switches and LEDs, analogue
inputs, three channels of PWM (Pulse Width Modulation), a serial port, and
seven open collector drivers for motors. The USB stack is written in C that
runs on an ATMEGA32 microprocessor; remarkably, you can add your own code
to the USB code and then use a symbolic debugger to debug that code.
Open-USB-IO hardware can thus be controlled from code running on the Linux
box as we will do in this article, or from code that runs on the ATMEGA32
microprocessor (if we get enough requests to the editor I will write an
article showing how to write and debug code on the microprocessor from the
Linux environment). The web site also has an extensive manual with many
examples, and the full circuit of the board.
</p>

<h3>DC Motor Basics</h3>

<p>
<IMG src="misc/radcliffe/dc_motor_model.png" width="236" height="282" align="right" border="0" hspace="20" />
There is a wide variety of DC motors; see Wikipedia <A
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushed_DC_electric_motor">[8]</A>
 for a good overview. We will be dealing with the permanent magnet type
which is the most common DC motor for small applications. The model of a DC
motor at stable speed is shown in Figure 1. It's quite simple - if you can
remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohms_Law">Ohms Law</a>, then
you can understand it. The voltage across the motor must match the battery
voltage and at a steady speed this is made up out of two parts: the first
is the resistance losses through the motor equal to
<tt>I<sub>m</sub>*R<sub>m</sub></tt>. The second part is caused by the
spinning rotor acting as a generator which creates a voltage that opposes
the battery. This voltage is often called the back-EMF
(<tt>V<sub>bemf</sub></tt>) of the motor and is directly proportion to
speed.
</p>

<pre>
  Vbatt = Im * Rm + Vbemf  (1)     Vbatt= battery voltage
  Vbemf = k * motor_speed  (2)     Rm = motor resistance
  Motor Torque = c * Im    (3)     Vbemf = back emf of motor
                                   Im = motor current
                                   k,c = constants
</pre>

<p>
When the motor starts it will speed up until the <tt>V<sub>bemf</sub></tt>
rises and together with <tt>I<sub>m</sub>*R<sub>m</sub></tt> balances
<tt>V<sub>batt</sub></tt>. If the motor has a mechanical load applied then
it will slow down until a new balance is reached, the current must increase
so the back-EMF drop is matched by a rise in the Im*Rm voltage drop. The
increased current will increase the torque of the motor to cope with the
new mechanical load.
</p>

<p>
Given the formulas above it's possible to work out the speed of the DC
motor using just electrical measurement, thus no shaft encoder is required.
There are two basic approaches -
</p>

<pre>
  motor_speed = ( Vbatt - Im*Rm) / k  (4)
  motor_speed = Vbemf/k               (5)
</pre>

<p>
Formula 4 requires measurement of the motor current, formula 5 requires
measurement of the back-EMF of the motor. On first inspection measuring
motor current looks easiest, simply add a very small resistor
<tt>R<sub>s</sub></tt> in series with the motor and measure the voltage
drop Vs across that resistor. The motor current is simply
<tt>V<sub>s</sub>/I<sub>s</sub></tt>. However, this has the disadvantage of
wasting energy, requiring amplification and measurement of very small
voltages, and requires a high current, low value resistor.  Measuring the
back-EMF of the motor would not have these problems - but there is no point
where back-EMF can be directly measured when the motor is driven with a
steady voltage. Fortunately, the back-EMF can be measured when a motor is
driven with PWM (Pulse Width Modulation).
</p>

<p>
To see a more complete treatment of a DC motor and a good <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPICE">SPICE</a> model, see
<a href="http://www.ecircuitcenter.com/circuits/dc_motor_model/dcmotor_model.htm">http://www.ecircuitcenter.com/circuits/dc_motor_model/dcmotor_model.htm</a>.
</p>

<h3>Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)</h3>

<p>
<IMG border="0" align="right" height="179" width="334"
src="misc/radcliffe/basic_pwm.png" hspace="20" /> Pulse Width Modulation, usually
abbreviated to just PWM, is a clever way to create a low voltage from a
high voltage without any losses. Figure 2 shows a simple PWM waveform where
a battery is driving a heater element, with an active duty cycle of
<tt>T<sub>on</sub> / T<sub>period</sub></tt>. The heater has a thermal
inertia, so the heat output will not vary in response to the fast on and
off pulses. This inertia averages the out the pulses to give an effective
voltage of <tt>V<sub>batt</sub> * T<sub>on</sub> / T<sub>period</sub></tt>.
A load like a heater or a motor can be given a variable voltage just by
using a switch opening and closing at high speed. This approach is much
better than using a voltage regulator or series resistor, as there is no
energy loss.
</p>

<p>
<IMG src="misc/radcliffe/motor_pwm.png" width="478" height="203"
align="right" border="0" hspace="20" /> Figure 3 shows the waveform of a
motor driven by a PWM. When the switch disconnects the motor, the voltage
measured at <tt>V<sub>x</sub></tt> is not <tt>V<sub>batt</sub></tt>, it is
reduced by the back-EMF of the motor. PWM not only allows a variable
voltage to be fed to the motor, it gives the opportunity to directly
measure the motor back-EMF for the purposes of speed control. The waveform
at Vx is far from perfect for our needs. When the switch first turns off
the motor's stray inductance gives a voltage kick, typically 0.5
milliseconds for a small motor. After the inductive kick has finished, the
back-EMF is not smooth and has considerable noise. This waveform needs to
be smoothed out in some way to give a single measurement for
<tt>V<sub>bemf</sub></tt> over one cycle. When the switch is turned on,
again the result is not perfect: <tt>V<sub>x</sub></tt> is not zero volts
because all real switches have a finite resistance. For a mechanical switch
this is very low but for electronic switches this will be noticeable and
must be taken into account.
</p>

<p>
  Why is there a diode across the motor?  A motor is a an inductor, and
inductors can generate a huge voltage spike if the current through them is
suddenly turned off.  This spike can be hundreds of volts and destroy the
switching device.  The diode allows the current to continue to flow in a
loop through the inductor while the switch is turned off.  This is shown in
figure 3 as <tt>V<sub>x</sub></tt> rises above Vbatt by the voltage drop
across the diode. 
</p>

<p>
  Motor speed can be estimated as follows-
</p>

<pre>
    Average_Vm = (Vbatt-Vbemf) * Poff + Von * Pon  (6)
    Poff = proportion of time switch is off = Toff/Tperiod,  0-1.
    Pon  = proportion of time switch is on  = Ton/Tperiod, 0-1.
    Von = voltage across switch when turned on, caused by internal switch resistance. 
  Vbemf = Vbatt - (Average_Vm - Von*Pon)/Poff   (7)
</pre>

<p>
The back-EMF, <tt>V<sub>bemf</sub></tt>, can be taken as a proxy for speed
as the speed is directly proportional to this value. The
<tt>Average_V<sub>m</sub></tt> can be created by continually sampling
<tt>V<sub>m</sub></tt> at high speed and taking an average, or by using a
low pass filter to create a stable voltage. We will use the second approach
as shown in Figure 5 because USB interfaces generally work at low speed,
around 250 commands a second at best and its not possible to sample fast
enough to be certain of getting a reliable value.
</p>
 
<h3>Open-USB-IO and PWM</h3>
<p>
<IMG src="misc/radcliffe/open-usb-io_2.jpg" width="300" height="227"
align="right" border="0" hspace="20" /> The Open-USB-IO board, shown in
Figure 4 opposite, comes with a command line program that allows you to
control all the hardware features of the board from the comfort of your
Linux computer. Common features such as PWM are very easy to use. Download
the "ousb" program from <a href="http://www.pjradcliffe.wordpress.com">this
website</a> and place it in your path; /usr/local/bin is convenient if you
have root privileges.
</p>

<p>
   To demonstrate the PWM function, we will use PWM 1 which lights LED 3 at
various light intensities. In the commands below note that the # and beyond
are comments, and do not need to be typed in.
</p>
<pre> 
  ousb pwm-freq 1 45   # set PWM 1 frequency to 45 Hz.
  ousb pwm 1 2         # set PWM duty cycle to 2% on.
  ousb pwm 1 100       # PWM 1 is 100%, always on.
  ousb pwm 1 0         # PWM is 0%, always off.
</pre>

<p>
  Note that the pwm-freq command must be used first to set frequency but
after that any number of pwm commands can be used to change the duty cycle.
</p>

<p>
The Open-USB-IO board has many useful features, one of which is seven open
collector drivers that can cope with up to 50 volts, and carry up to 500
milliamps, enough for most small DC motors. Open collector drivers act as a
switch connected on one side to zero volts, just as in the circuits above.
One of these is controlled by PWM 1 and can be used to drive a small motor.
There are eight ADC (Analogue to Digital Converter) inputs and one of
these, ADC0, will be used to sense the motor voltage. The USB link to the
computer supplies 5 volts, and can in theory be used to drive a small
motor. In practice the motor injects a lot of electrical noise to the
power supply and this can crash the microprocessor, so it's best to use an
external plug-pack that plugs into the external socket (top right of Figure
4). The plug pack can be either unregulated or regulated, as long as it is
rated at up to about 1.5 times the motor voltage. If you're an electronics
experimenter, there is a good chance that you have one of these in your
junk box.
</p>

<p>
<IMG src="misc/radcliffe/smoothing_circuit.png" width="274" height="218"
align="right" border="0" hspace="20" /> One thing that Open-USB-IO lacks is
a low pass filter to smooth out the noisy motor voltage as shown in Figure
3. Luckily, the board has a prototype area that can easily fit the
necessary components. Figure 5 shows the circuit of a simple smoothing
filter and figure 6 shows how it can be wired into the prototype area. The
smoothing filter drops the observed voltage by about 1/3, which allows the
motor to be driven by up to 15 volts without overloading the 5 volt powered
microprocessor and ADC input. The 47k&#8486; resistor also gives some
protection to the ADC input in case of voltage spikes when the switch turns
off and the inductive kick occurs. The <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corner_frequency">corner frequency</a>
is about 1 Hertz, so it will smooth out the 45 Hertz PWM waveform to a
reasonably stable voltage. The capacitor will need to be an electrolytic
which is polarized, and its plus side must be connected to the resistor
joint and not zero volts. 
</p>

<p>
<IMG src="misc/radcliffe/dc_motor_connections_2.jpg" width="400" height="300" align="right" border="0" hspace="20" />
Figure 6, opposite, shows a small motor bolted onto the Open-USB-IO board for
convenience. The connections needed for the circuitry are all on J5, the 20
by 2 IDC pin array at the top of the board. All even pins, the left hand
row, are connected to zero volts and all the right hand row have useful
connections. Each of the right hand row pins is also connected to a solder
pad right next to the pin. This makes it easy to solder in your own
circuitry. The motor leads are soldered to 2-pin headers which can be
pushed onto J5. The zero volt connection is at the top of the board and is
connected to the 22k&#8486; resistor and 10&micro;F capacitor. The 47k&#8486;
resistor connects to the other end of the resistor and capacitor just
mentioned and on to pin 27 of J5. The joint of all three components has a
wire running down to pin 1 of J5 which is ADC0. This photo has a 1 k&#8486;
resistor between pins 37 and 27, which is not needed for this application.
</p>

<p>
    Be careful with the connections as pin 27 and 37 will have the plug
pack voltages which are probably well over 5 volts. If these pins are
accidentally connected to the wrong place then damage may be done to the 5
volt powered devices on the board.
</p>

<h3>Linux Code</h3>

<p>
 The complete C++ code to implement motor control can be found <A
href="misc/radcliffe/dc_motor_advanced_control.cpp.txt">here</A>. Below,
key elements of the code will be discussed.
</p>

<p>
   The code in Figure 7 allows any C++ program to directly access the
Open-USB-IO board by calling the ousb program. If you prefer C, then please
see the extensive Open-USB-IO manual at <A
href="www.pjradcliffe.wordpress.com">www.pjradcliffe.wordpress.com</A> .
The function opens a pipe to a newly created ousb process and sends it the
text string of commands passed in with str. The ousb process then finishes
and returns a result, which is converted into an integer and returned to
the calling code. The extra "-r" in the ousb command tells ousb to just
return the numerical result and omit any useful text description.  This is
ideal when ousb is called from other programs and not a human using the
command line.
</p>

<p>
<b>Figure 7: C++ Function to Control USB Hardware</b>
</p>

<pre class="code">
int cpp_do_ousb_command(string *str) 
{ FILE *fpipe ;
  if ( !(fpipe = (FILE*)popen(str-&gt;c_str(),"r")))
   { cout &lt;&lt; "pipe error" &lt;&lt; endl ;
     exit(0) ;
   }
  char line[100] ;
  fgets( line, sizeof line, fpipe) ;
  pclose(fpipe) ;
  *str = line ; // Caller can see whole returned string.
  return( atoi(str-&gt;c_str())) ; // try returning string as integer.
}
...
  new_adc0_read = cpp_do_ousb_command("ousb -r adc 0") ;
... </pre>

<p>
Before the motor can be controlled, two constants must be determined,
<tt>V<sub>on</sub></tt> (switch on voltage drop) and
<tt>V<sub>batt</sub></tt> (power supply voltage). One could measure these
voltages and put them into the program as a constants - but it's handier to
write a little code to automatically find these values. There is one
disadvantage: the motor will run at full speed for a second when the
program starts up. If a period of full speed is unacceptable, then the
<tt>V<sub>on</sub></tt> value must be turned into a constant.
</p>

<p>
<b>Figure 8:  Automatic Determination of Motor Constants</b>
</p>

<pre class="code">
 //--- set PWM frequency.
   str = "ousb pwm-freq 1 45" ;
   cpp_do_ousb_command(&amp;str) ;
 	
 //--- calculate Vext using pwm of zero.
   str = "ousb pwm 1 0" ;
   cpp_do_ousb_command(&amp;str) ;
   sleep(2) ; // allow motor to stop if going.
   str = "ousb -r adc 0" ;
   float Vext = cpp_do_ousb_command(&amp;str) ;

 //--- calculate ADC for motor full on,  Vsat
   str = "ousb pwm 1 100" ;
   cpp_do_ousb_command(&amp;str) ;
   sleep(1) ; // allow motor to get up to speed.
   str = "ousb -r adc 0" ;
   float Vsat = cpp_do_ousb_command(&amp;str) ;
   cout &lt;&lt; "  Calibration:   Vsat= " &lt;&lt; Vsat &lt;&lt; ",  Vext= " &lt;&lt; Vext &lt;&lt; endl ; 
</pre>

<p>
Figure 9, below, shows the control loop which attempts to keep the motor
speed constant. The loop tries to ensure that the motor back-EMF
(<tt>V<sub>gen</sub></tt> below) matches the target back-EMF
(<tt>V<sub>gen_goal</sub></tt>). On line 6, <tt>V<sub>gen</sub></tt> is
calculated using Equation 7; on line 7, a change to the pwm duty cycle is
calculated using "gain" times the difference between
<tt>V<sub>gen</sub></tt> measured and <sub>V<sub>gen_goal</sub></sub>. Line
8 accounts for maths errors and resets the pwm to zero if any errors have
occurred. Similarly, lines 8 and 9 keep the PWM value within allowable
limits. Finally, lines 13 to 16 are responsible for sending the next PWM
value to the Open-USB-IO board.
</p>

<p>
<b>Figure 9:  Motor Control Loop</b>
</p>

<pre class="code">
 1   float Vavg, Vgen ;
 2   while(1)
 3    {//--- read ADC input and calculate next PWM value.
 4      str = "ousb -r adc 0" ;
 5      Vavg = cpp_do_ousb_command(&amp;str) ;
 6      Vgen = Vext - (Vavg - Vsat*pwm/100) / ( 1 - pwm/100) ;
 7      pwm += gain*(Vgen_goal - Vgen) ;
 8      if (!isnormal(pwm))  pwm = 0 ; // if maths error set motor to stop.
 9      if (pwm&gt;100) pwm = 100 ;
10      if (pwm&lt;0)   pwm = 0 ;
11      cout &lt;&lt; "  pwm%= " &lt;&lt; (int)pwm &lt;&lt; ",  ADC0= " &lt;&lt; Vavg 
           &lt;&lt; ",  Vgen= " &lt;&lt; (int)Vgen &lt;&lt; ",  Vgoal= " &lt;&lt; Vgen_goal &lt;&lt; endl ;
12     //--- form PWM command and send to board.
13      stst.str("") ;
14      stst &lt;&lt; pwm ;
15      str = "ousb pwm 1 " + stst.str() ;
16      cpp_do_ousb_command(&amp;str) ;
17    }
</pre>

<p>
The gain is a constant that can dramatically affect performance. 
Consider putting a mechanical load on the motor: a small gain will mean the
motor slows down and then slowly creeps back up to speed as the PWM value
is slowly moved up. A higher gain will get a quicker response but there
may be overshoot (going above the desired speed) or limit cycles (small
oscillations around the desired speed). You may well need to change the
gain to suit your motor and power supply voltage.
</p>

<h3>Thoughts and Extensions</h3>

<p>
The basic plot of this article can be extended in many ways to get better
control of motor speed or drive larger motors.
</p>

<p>
The code to control the motor could be moved into the microprocessor so the
Linux computer need only send down the desired speed; this is probably best
done with the live-DVD of development tools that can be found at <A
href="http://www.interestingbytes.wordpress.com">http://www.interestingbytes.wordpress.com</A>.
See the /home/user/projects/Co-USB folder for a very simple way to add your
own code to the USB interface code. The microprocessor code you write can
be debugged using a symbolic debugger which also include breakpoints. The
manual and examples on how to achieve this are quite clear and helpful.
</p>

<p>
Control code in the microprocessor can work much faster than commands
sent via a USB connection. The ousb program can be called at most about 25 times a
second. By using pipes carefully the ousb program can stay in memory and
can cope with 250 commands per second (see the live-DVD mentioned above).
Code in the microprocessor can read the ADC at about 30,000 times per
second and so get much finer grained control. For example, referring to
Figure 3, the inductive kick pollutes the estimate of the motor back-EMF
during the PWM off period. A microprocessor could do away with the
smoothing capacitor and sample the waveform just through the resistors. It
could then average the voltage during the PWM off period but exclude the
inductive kick and so get a more accurate estimate of the back-EMF and
hence the speed. The code in this article does not exclude the inductive
kick and this can lead to problems when the PWM off cycle is very small:
the control loop "believes" the back-EMF is negative and so gets totally
confused. The simplest solution is to limit the PWM duty cycle to something
less than 100% so as to get a reasonable estimate for the back-EMF.
</p>

<p>
The motor control circuit assumes that the on-board open collector drivers
can handle up to 500 milliamps which is adequate for many small motors. If
a higher current motor is to be used then it may be best to use a power
MOSFET such as the BUZ71 or IRF520. These can be driven with 0 or +5v and
drive up to 3 amps given a reasonable heat sink, and the microprocessor
pins on Open-USB-IO can be directly used for this. Currents over 3 amps
need a higher gate drive voltage and the on-board open collector driver may
be used to achieve this.
</p>

<p>
  The frequency chosen for the PWM is only 45 Hz and this can be changed. 
Higher frequencies start to have more problems with the inductive kick
period distorting the estimate of back-EMF.  Frequencies above about 70
Hertz and below 20 KHz can be heard as an annoying buzz and so are usually
avoided. The Open-USB-IO PWM 2 can provide much finer grained frequency
control and can be used to investigate frequency issues.  This PWM comes
out on pin 23 of J5 and does not have its own LED.  Interestingly, a PWM
frequency of 45 kHz can provide some speed control using the algorithms
above: this works because the inductive kick rise time also depends on
motor speed and so a smoothed version of the motor voltage gives some
information about motor speed. However, the 45 Hz PWM is much better at
keeping motor speed to a constant value.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
This article sheds light on several important issues for anyone who wishes
to control real hardware from their Linux computer. First of all, Linux is
the best general purpose operating system for controlling hardware. Next,
given that USB is becoming the only way that many computers will interface
with external hardware means that some form of USB interface board is
necessary. We found the Open-USB-IO to be particularly useful but many
other boards would do.
</p>

<p>
The core of this article showed how speed control of a DC motor can be
achieved using only electrical means without any need for a shaft encoder. 
The Open-USB-IO board can in theory control up to seven motors this way. 
You can use the code and circuitry directly, or extend it to suit your own
needs.That's one of the great joys of Linux: since so much of it is Open
Source, you can look at it, understand it, and extend it for your own
purposes.

<h1>Collaboration Tools for Linux</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/silva.html">Anderson Silva</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
<em>Collaboration</em>. It's a buzzword, like 'innovative' and 'cloud
computing', and like most words, it can be used or misused. It reminds
me of the words <tt>openness</tt> and <tt>community</tt>. It reminds me of
open source. Rivals and allies such as Microsoft, Google, Red Hat, Oracle,
HP, and so many others working on code in the Linux kernel is arguably one
of the greatest examples of collaboration in the technology world.
</p>

<p>
Another great example of collaboration across the globe is Wikipedia, and I 
thought it would be appropriate to use its definition of 'Collaboration' as 
part of the introduction to my article. Per Wikipedia 
[<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration title=1>1</a>]:
</p>

<pre>
Collaboration is a recursive process where two or more people or 
organizations work together in an intersection of common goals - for example, 
an intellectual endeavor that is creative in nature - by sharing knowledge, 
learning and building consensus.
</pre>

<p>
It is with that definition in mind that I decided to share with you five 
specific tools for Linux that I either currently use or have used 
in the past to improve collaboration among individuals and departmental teams. 
I will point out that, for each of the tools I will mention, there most likely 
exist several other alternatives that may or may not do as good as a job as 
the ones I have decided to write about - after all, that is the beauty of the 
open source world.
</p>

<h3>Desktop sharing with Vino VNC server</h3>

<p>
Vncserver has been around for years as desktop sharing in multiple Operating
Systems. Starting with Gnome 2.8, the Vino VNC server started being shipped by 
default. Vino allows a user to share the desktop with other remote users 
while granting them fine-grained access.
</p>

<p>
<img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_100w78nq6hc_b.png" alt="vino" height="701" width="648">
</p>

<p>
If enabled, the vino server only starts up once the user logs into their Gnome
session. When the remote user tries to connect to the local desktop a pop-up 
window will show up on the local desktop and the remote user will only be able 
to access the desktop if the local user accepts the connection request.
</p>

<p>
  To start up the connection with the desktop, all the remote user needs is a 
VNC client like <em>vinagre</em>. Some other possible clients are <em>tigervnc</em> for 
Fedora, <em>tightvnc</em>, or <em>realvnc</em> for Ubuntu.
</p>

<p>
<img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_101d8skvvgn_b.png" alt="vino 2" height="520" width="570">
<p>
A few things to be mindful of when enabling remote desktop under Gnome:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you have the appropriate iptables rule to allow the remote 
connection.</li>
<li>Like other 'standard' VNC servers, the communication between the client and 
vino is cleartext, so be aware of your security requirements.</li>
<li>Don't forget to log out or lock your workstation if you must leave your 
computer unattended while remote users are connected to it.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Simple wiki installation with Doku</h3>
<p>
It is almost impossible nowadays to talk about collaboration in a technical 
environment without talking about a Wiki. I will even assume that virtually 
every person with some sort of networked device has either gained or contributed
some wiki-based knowledge, even if they were not aware they were using a
wiki.
</p>

<p>
With that said, installing a wiki on a Linux server has become simpler and 
simpler over the years. For this article, I picked PHP based wiki DokuWiki, 
which can be easily installed by running:
</p>

<p>
On Fedora:
</p>

<pre class="code">yum install dokuwiki</pre>
<p>
On Ubuntu:
</p>

<pre class="code">apt-get install dokuwiki</pre>
</p>

<img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_102hcvcx4gx_b.png" alt="dokuwiki" height="292" width="648">
<p>
You will then have to make sure Apache is running, and should be able to access 
your newly installed wiki at: http://yourhost.com/dokuwiki/
</p>

<p>
Some other wikis available 'out of the box' for your installation on both Fedora and 
Ubuntu are <em>mediawiki</em>, <em>trac</em>, <em>kwiki</em> 
(<em>perl-kwiki</em> in Fedora), and <em>moin</em> (<em>python-moin</em> in Ubuntu).
</p>

<h3>Team programming with Gobby</h3>
<p>A couple of years ago, I was invited to a meeting at work to discuss a 
project a couple of the developers were working on. What I thought was going
 to happen was that someone would hook up a projector to their laptop, and
 all eight of us would stare at the wall and every once in a while give a 
suggestion about some excessive 'if' statement or a poorly-designed method. 
Well, I was wrong. The lead developer popped Gobby on the screen, created a 
session, and asked the rest of us to install it and join the session.
</p>

<p>
From there, we started writing pseudo and real code, creating a 'to do' list, and 
updating documentation in the source code. Gobby is that cool!</p>

<img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_103c4rzfgfg_b.png" alt="gobby" height="540" width="694">
<p>
Once you create a session, all other gobby instances in the network will 
automatically detect the created session. If you want a private session, add a 
password to your session. Each user is requested to pick a name 
and a color and as they modify the document, their picked color highlights the 
text they contribute.</p>

<img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_104wtn7mf3z_b.png" alt="gobby 2" height="542" width="680">
<p>
To install gobby on Fedora:
</p>

<pre class="code">yum install gobby</pre>
<p>
On Ubuntu:
</p>

<pre class="code">apt-get install gobby</pre>

<h3>Creating screencasts with Istanbul</h3>
<p>
Have you ever tried walking someone through steps on how to accomplish a 
task on the desktop? And then they forget what they did, and ask you again six 
months later, and you have to walk through it all over again?
</p>

<p>
I have had this problem before, and it didn't take long until I decided to start
 using a screencast application on GNOME to record any tutorials I might end up 
working on.

<p>
I started using <em>istanbul</em>, a little python application that will place a 
'record' button on your GNOME panel, and allow you to record what's going on 
your screen. It also let's you change the resolution of the screen and capture 
sound as you go through your motions.

<h3>Version Control with Git</h3>
<p>
Along with a compiler or interpreter, a version control system is arguably one 
of the most important tools a developer will use from day to day. 
As you probably already know, it allows one or more developers to store, 
retrieve, log, identify, and merge revisions of a file through time.</p>

<p>
A few version control systems available under Linux are <em>cvs</em>, 
<em>subversion</em>, <em>mercurial</em>, <em>bzr</em> (bazaar), and 
<em>git</em>.
</p>

<p>
At work, as an organization, we've migrated from subversion and cvs to git, and 
that's mostly the reason why I decided to mention it in this article. If you 
have never tried git, I highly suggest you check it out. Git was originally 
written by Linus Torvalds for the Linux kernel development, and over the past 
few years has become more and more popular around the open source community. 
Just take a 
<a href=https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitProjects title="look at this list">look at this list</a>
of current projects that are using Git as their version control system.
</p>

<p>
I also recommend you take a look at the 
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29 title="wikipedia page">wikipedia page</a>
 about <em>git</em> and its <a href=http://git-scm.com/ title="official home">official home</a> 
to find out a bit more of its history, design and implementation.
</p>

<p>Installing <em>git</em> on Fedora:
</p>

<pre class="code">yum install git</pre>
<p>on Ubuntu:
</p>

<pre class="code">apt-get install git</pre>
<p>
Creating a repo is as simple as 
[<a href=http://git-scm.com/ title=2>2</a>]:
</p>

<pre code="class">
$ cd (project-directory)
$ git init
$ (add some files)
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Initial commit'
</pre>

<p>And checking out some files from a repo and creating a patch
[<a href=http://git-scm.com/ id=rark title=2>2</a>]:</p>

<pre code="class">
$ git clone git://github.com/git/hello-world.git
$ cd hello-world
$ (edit files)
$ git add (files)
$ git commit -m 'Explain what I changed'
$ git format-patch origin/master
</pre>

<p>Once you start creating branches, and squash merges with git,
 you may find keeping track of diffs, logs and different branches a bit 
overwhelming at times. A great little tool a friend of mine introduced me to 
is called: <em>tig</em>, which is "a repository browser for the git 
revision control system that additionally can act as a pager for output from 
various git commands." 
[<a href=http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig/ title=3>3</a>]
</p>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Because some of the tools discussed above are client-server based, you should always
check your firewall rules. Also, these tools are just the tip of the 
iceberg; technologies like microblogging, social networking, email, chatting, 
and so many others could easily be adapted into our day-to-day collaboration 
requirements. As you work through them with your organization, always take 
into consideration your infrastructure and security requirements before 
implementing any of these tools or services.
</p>

<p>
Unless you have a commitment from your organization or your team mates to work 
together in sharing knowledge and keeping this knowledge up-to-date, all of these
 collaboration tools at the end of the day sum up to just that: tools.

<em>
<p>
Born September 22, 1969, in Gardena, California, "Penguin" Pete Trbovich
 today resides in Iowa with his wife and children. Having worked various
 jobs in engineering-related fields, he has since "retired" from
 corporate life to start his second career. Currently he works as a
 freelance writer, graphics artist, and coder over the Internet. He
 describes this work as, "I sit at home and type, and checks mysteriously
 arrive in the mail."
</p>

<p>
He discovered Linux in 1998 - his first distro was Red Hat 5.0 - and has
 had very little time for other operating systems since. Starting out
 with his freelance business, he toyed with other blogs and websites
 until finally getting his own domain penguinpetes.com started in March
 of 2006, with a blog whose first post stated his motto: "If it isn't fun
 for me to write, it won't be fun to read."
</p>

<p>
The webcomic <em>Doomed to Obscurity</em> was launched New Year's Day,
 2009, as a "New Year's surprise". He has since rigorously stuck to a
 posting schedule of "every odd-numbered calendar day", which allows him
 to keep a steady pace without tiring. The tagline for the webcomic
 states that it "gives the geek culture just what it deserves." But is it
 skewering everybody but the geek culture, or lampooning geek culture
 itself, or doing both by turns?

<p>
Ben is the Editor-in-Chief for Linux Gazette and a member of The Answer Gang.
</p>

<p>
<em>
Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became interested in electricity
at the tender age of six, promptly demonstrated it by sticking a fork into
a socket and starting a fire, and has been falling down technological
mineshafts ever since. He has been working with computers since the Elder
Days, when they had to be built by soldering parts onto printed circuit
boards and programs had to fit into 4k of memory (the recurring nightmares
have almost faded, actually.)
</p>

<p>
His subsequent experiences include creating software in more than two dozen
languages, network and database maintenance during the approach of a
hurricane, writing articles for publications ranging from sailing magazines
to technological journals, and teaching on a variety of topics ranging from
Soviet weaponry and IBM hardware repair to Solaris and Linux
administration, engineering, and programming. He also has the distinction
of setting up the first Linux-based public access network in St. Georges,
Bermuda as well as one of the first large-scale Linux-based mail servers in
St. Thomas, USVI.
</p>

<p>
After a seven-year Atlantic/Caribbean cruise under sail and passages up and
down the East coast of the US, he is currently anchored in northern
Florida. His consulting business presents him with a variety of challenges,
and his <strike>second brain</strike> Palm Pilot is crammed full of alarms,
many of which contain exclamation points.
</p>

<p>
He has been working with Linux since 1997, and credits it with his complete
loss of interest in waging nuclear warfare on parts of the Pacific Northwest.

"several pieces of meteorites - thunderbolt iron, you see - highly
magical, you've got to chuck that stuff in whether you believe in it

'He said: "It annoys me that knights aren't allowed to carry their
swords. That would be knife crime."'
