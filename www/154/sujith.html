<h1>Hacking a Canon A720IS digital camera with CHDK on GNU/Linux</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/sujith.html">Sujith H</a></b></p>


<p>
This all started with a <a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/hardware/08/05/06/2032216.shtml">Slashdot</a>
article which described the amazing features of CHDK (Canon Hacking
Development Kit). The article re-ignited my ambition to buy a camera and
explore its full potential. I decided to go for the Canon A720IS, which
supports CHDK. In this article I would like to share the work that I did to
compile CHDK in GNU/Linux, install it, and explore its scripting
capabilities.
</p>

<h3>Installation procedure</h3>
<p>
I downloaded the latest CHDK source from its Subversion repository
to a 'chdk' subdirectory in my home directory:
</p>

<pre>
	cd
    svn co <a href="https://tools.assembla.com/svn/chdk/trunk">https://tools.assembla.com/svn/chdk/trunk</a> 
</pre>

<p>
Since CHDK runs on a platform that's different from the one we're compiling
it on, we need a <em>cross compiler</em>. For that, I downloaded binutils
(version 2.17) and the GCC compiler (version 3.4.6); I then created a
directory called 'arm-elf' and one called 'chdk_cross_compiler' in my home
directory, and untarred 'binutils' and GCC inside the latter.
</p>

<p>
Building 'binutils' required the following steps:
</p>

<pre>
   1) cd ~/chdk_cross_compiler/binutils-2.17
   2) ./configure --srcdir=../binutils-2.17 --target=arm-elf --prefix=${HOME}/arm-elf
   3) make
   4) make install
</pre>

<p>
Next, I added ~/arm-elf/bin to my PATH:
</p>

<pre>
   export PATH=${HOME}/arm-elf/bin:$PATH
</pre>

<p>
Now, to compile GCC:
</p>

<pre>
   cd ~/chdk_cross_compiler/gcc-3.4.6
</pre>

<p>
Next, I applied a patch from 'chdk' which was at
~/chdk/trunk/tools/patches/gcc-3.4-arm.diff.
</p>

<pre>
   patch -p0 &lt; ~/chdk/trunk/tools/patches/gcc-3.4-arm.diff
</pre>

<p>
Now I created a directory named gcc-3.4.6-arm-elf in ~/chdk_cross_compiler
and built GCC so that it compiles for the ARM processor as the default
target:
</p>

<pre>
   cd /home/sujith/chdk_cross_compiler/gcc-3.4.6-arm-elf
   ../gcc-3.4.6/configure --srcdir=../gcc-3.4.6 --target=arm-elf \
     --enable-multilib --enable-languages=c --enable-clocale=gnu \
     --disable-libm --disable-libc --disable-threads \
     --disable-nls --disable-libssp --disable-intl --disable-libiberty \
     --with-cpu=arm9 --with-newlib --prefix=${HOME}/arm-elf
   unset LIBRARY_PATH 
   unset CFLAGS
   make
   make install
</pre>

<p>
Now that the cross compiler is ready, it's time to compile the CHDK.
</p>

<pre>
   cd ~/chdk/trunk
</pre>

<p>
Since my camera is a Canon A720 IS, I uncommented these two lines of
makefile.inc:
</p>

<pre>
   PLATFORM=a720
   PLATFORMSUB=100c
</pre>

<p>
and compiled it using
</p>

<pre>
   make fir
</pre>
<p>
This created a file called DISKBOOT.BIN in my ~/chdk/trunk/bin directory,
which I needed to copy to the memory card of the camera. For that, I
needed to format the SD-Card to FAT-16, which I achieved in the following
step:
</p>

<pre>
   mkdosfs -F 16
</pre>

<p>
As a final step, I needed to make the card bootable by editing its FAT
partition. I did this by using hexedit (make sure that the SD card is not
mounted while issuing this command). Before we do that, however, we need
to find out which device was mounted by using the 'mount' command; for me,
it was /dev/sda1.
</p>

<pre>
umount /dev/sda1
hexedit /dev/sda1
</pre>

<p>
In hexedit, I toggled ASCII mode and wrote "BOOTDISK" (without double
quotes) at offset 0x40; I then mounted the SD Card again and copied the
DISKBOOT.BIN file to the root directory of the SD card, set the SD card
write lock (this is a small lock button on the SD Card itself), and
inserted the card into camera. The camera booted with the CHDK and
displayed a message showing the CHDK firmware. I was now the proud owner of a
CHDK-powered camera! I do find it interesting, by the way, that the SD card is
write-locked in the camera, but the photos are still written to the card.
</p>

<p>
Now, switching the camera into the alt mode and pressing the menu button
(my camera has a menu button, for other models it might be different)
displays the CHDK options: play a game, load a file, Raw image, Histograms,
etc.
</p>

<h3>Scripting</h3>
<p>
There is a small interpreter in CHDK named UBasic. Let's begin with a
'hello world' script. The filenames will have a .bas extension (i.e.,
file1.bas).
</p>

<pre>
   @title Hello World
   print "Hello World" 
</pre>

<p>
Here '@title' refers to the title of the program; if it's not given, the
filename will be created by CHDK. Copy the program to the chdk/scripts
directory on the SD card and load it. On my camera, I had to press the
shoot button to run the script. You can see the output on the screen:
</p>

<p>
<img src="misc/sujith/helloworld.jpg" alt="Hello World" width="500" height="373">
</p>

<p>
   In order to blink the orange LED of my camera I wrote the following code:
</p>

<pre>
   for n=1 to 5
     print "Led blink ",n
     gosub "ledblink"
   next n
   
   :ledblink
     set_led 7 1 60
     sleep 1000
     set_led 7 0
     set_led 8 1 60
     sleep 1000
     set_led 8 0
     return 
</pre>

<p>
'gosub' is used to go to a subroutine; here the subroutine is 'ledblink'.
'set_led' is the command used to turn the LED on and off, and '7' is the
'set_led' argument which means the orange LED.  Similarly, '8' represents
the blue LED.
</p>

<p>
Blue LED is set on:
</p>

<pre>
<img src="misc/sujith/blueled.jpg" alt="Blue LED is set on" width="500" height="373">
</pre>

<p>
In order to shoot the photos with a regular interval of 5 seconds, I wrote
this small peice of code.
</p>

<pre>
     for n=1 to 6
         sleep 5000
         print "shoot ",n, "of ",6
         shoot
     next n
</pre>

<p>
To put the camera in 'raw' mode, the 'set_raw' command is used. The
following code could be used to set the raw mode in the camera and then
take a shot.
</p>

<pre>
     set_raw 1
     sleep 1000
     shoot
     sleep 1000
     set_raw 0
</pre>

<p>
You could check the battery voltage using the following code; the
voltage is displayed in millivolts.
</p>

<pre>
     for n=1 to 10
         a=get_vbatt
         print "The V is ",a/1000, "V"
         print "The V is ",a, "mV"
         sleep 9000
         a=0
     next n
</pre>

<pre>
<img src="misc/sujith/volt.jpg" alt="Voltage" width="500" height="373">
</pre>

<p>
These are some of the hacks that I've done using GNU/Linux and my Canon
camera. If you are ready to experiment with your CHDK-compatible camera, this
is the right time to do it. A friendly warning - these hacks are not for
faint-hearted!!!
