    You've made it to the weekend and things have finally slowed down.  You
    crawl outa bed, bag the shave 'n shower 'cause it's Saturday, grab that
    much needed cup of caffeine (your favorite alkaloid), and shuffle down
    the hall to the den.  It's time to fire up the Linux box, break out the
    trusty 'ol Snap-On's, pop the hood, jack 'er up, and do a bit of
    overhauling!

Welcome to the December Weekend Mechanic!</A></H2>

<P>
Well, I'm afraid that the 'ol Weekend Mechanic is going to be a short one this
month.  I've got six classes this fall and have finally reached the point in
the semester where I guess they think we're smart enough to start actually
<EM>doing things!</EM>  And so, we're all doing things... LOTS of things, as a
matter of fact.  That hallowed barometer of academic industriousness,
<B>Euclid's Little Known &quot;Shave-To-Face&quot; Ratio</B>, is falling
predictably and the No-Doze blood titers are reaching therapeutic levels.
As they say in Tennessee, we're all starting to look like a bunch of rugs...

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>
    &quot;...walked all over, drug outside, and beat with a stick!&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Anyway, we're all surviving.  All of you out there in <B>Academia Land</B>
know what I'm talking about; all of you who've run the gauntlet already and
have achieved &quot;A Real Life&quot; will smile knowingly.  (And will smile
to yourselves, knowing that there is no such thing as &quot;A Real Life&quot;)

<P>
I've been eating a generous portion of <B>Humble Pie</B> here recently after
last month's Tar Tricks and Find <I>faux pas</I>.  I sincerely apologize for
any mis-information and want to gratefully thank all of you who took the time
to drop a note and provide more accurate information.  I've gotten permission
from a number of writers to include their letters which can be read below.
They add a good deal more light to the subject!

<P>
Thanks guys!

<P>
Also, I did manage to eke out a bit of &quot;recreational programming&quot;
time and hacked together a prototype <B>tar archive viewer</B>.  This is still
pretty alpha stuff, but it appears to be relatively stable and I've actually
been using it.  Any of you who are interested in <B>Tcl/Tk</B> might enjoy
hacking away at this.  I'll continue to tinker around with this and, by
January or so, just might have a reasonably working version for all of you to
play around with.  If you're interested, have a look at it below.

<P>
Anyway, hope you enjoy!

As I mentioned above, I've been eating a good deal of Humble Pie in the past

everyone who wrote was very gracious AND took the time to provide more

Hi John,

<P>
Just reading Linux gazette for the first time, and stumbled
upon your Weekend Mechanic page.  I'm sure you're going to get more
mail about this, but I read with some astonishment your &quot;More tar
tricks&quot; section.

<P>
My Linux box is currently about 1000kms away, but I believe that
the &quot;tar -tvzf file.tar.gz |tr -s ' ' |cut -d ' ' -f8 |less&quot; can be
replaced with &quot;tar tzf file.tar.gz |less&quot;.

<P>
I liked it though.  If you want a useful pipes example, how about a
&quot;Oops! I untarred in the wrong place and I want to clean up!&quot;
example:

<PRE>
tar tzf file.tar.gz | xargs rm -f 2&gt;/dev/null
tar tzf file.tar.gz | sed 's:[^/]*$::' | sort -ru | xargs rmdir 2&gt;/dev/null
</PRE>

<P>
Analysis and improvement is left as an exercise for the reader. 8-)

<P>
Enjoy,<BR>

	Well it sure showed off some neat features of some utilities, but what
you did with that first line can be solved by omitting one character from

(Just a quick note about this:  James is right, 'which' works as he wrote
above if you're using tcsh [because it is a shell built-in??].  Those of you
running BASH and using the 'which' executable will find that the executable
does not return information on aliases, shell functions, and shell built-in's.
I wrote James back after trying this and he concurred.)

To: fiskjm@ctrvax.Vanderbilt.Edu<BR>
Subject: More on locate and update<BR>
</B>

<P>
Saw your note on locate/find in LJ #11.  According to my manual page,
&quot;locate lynx&quot; is equivalent to &quot;locate '*lynx*'&quot;, locate does automatic
insertion of leading and trailing '*' if the pattern contains no
metacharacters.  &quot;locate 'lynx*'&quot; will only find files that start with
lynx (i.e. no leading directory or /).

<P>
I find the locate command and its associated updatedb command to be very
useful for indexing ftp lists and cdroms.  Most sites and cdroms have a
list of the files in one form or another but they are not easily
searched.  Some are in find format (directory included in file name),
others in ls -lR (directory is separate).  I created updatedb.gen (from
updatedb) to read a file list and build a locate style database,
locate.gen then searches that database.

<P>
For example, go to sunsite, /pub/Linux, download 00-find.Linux.gz, then
run

<PRE>
updatedb.gen sunsite 00-find.Linux.gz
</PRE>

<P>
which builds /var/spool/locate/locatedb.sunsite.  &quot;locate.gen sunsite
file&quot; does an instant search of sunsite for the file, obviously you have
to fetch a fresh copy of the listing occasionally.

<P>
Instead of searching several InfoMagic cdroms for a file, mount the
first one and 

<PRE>
updatedb.gen im /cdrom/00-find
</PRE>

<P>
&quot;locate.gen im file&quot; then does a very fast search of the entire set of
InfoMagic cdroms and can be done without mounting any cdroms.

<P>
updatedb.gen and locate.gen are attached.  updatedb.gen works out which
format the input file is in and selects the field(s) containing the
filename.

(The idea of using 'locate' on a CD collection sounds like a GREAT idea.  I've

<P>
In your column, Weekend Mechanic, in the &quot;Linux Gazette&quot; (Oct
1996 issue) on your Web page at:

<A HREF="../issue11/wkndmech.html">../issue11/wkndmech.html</A>

<P>
You say:

<P>
&gt;  The way that it should work is that you give locate a filename pattern<BR>
&gt;  which it searches for. Such as: <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt;         locate lynx*<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt;  However, when I tried this on my system, it simply returned nothing.<BR>
&gt;  Using locate lynx worked like a charm. <BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;  Got me.<BR>

<P>
Whenever you use any command with arguments that need to contain wild
card characters, don't forget to quote those wild card characters from the
shell.  I teach this to my students in my introductory UNIX class.
Remember the shell gets first crack at the wild card.  So the
shell will try to match &quot;lynx*&quot; with any file names in your local
directory.  

<P>
Use the echo command to see what the shell expands your command line to for the buggy command:

<PRE>
	echo locate lynx*
</PRE>

<P>
This will give you an idea of what the &quot;locate&quot; command is really
searching for.

<P>
Any one of the three commands below will prevent the shell
from processing your wild card pattern.

<PRE>
	locate &quot;lynx*&quot;
	locate 'lynx*'
	locate lynx\*
</PRE>

<P>
The same is true for your other example with find:

<PRE>
	find / -name &quot;lynx*&quot; -print
	find / -name 'lynx*' -print
	find / -name lynx\* -print
</PRE>

<P>

Subject: why locate didn't work as expected...<BR>
</B>

<P>
Hi John,

<P>
Why didn't 'locate lynx*' work for you ?  Well, here's what happens when
you issue that command: first, bash (or any standard shell) attempts to
match the pattern 'lynx*' against names of files present in the
_current_ directory. If it finds any that match, they are _all_
substituted into the command line and passed on as arguments to locate.
This sure isn't what you want...  If (as was apparently the case) none
are found, the pattern is left unexpanded... so why didn't it work?
Well, to quote the man page:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
       If a pattern is a plain string -- it contains no metachar-
       acters  --  locate displays all file names in the database
       that contain that string anywhere.  If a pattern does con-
       tain  metacharacters, locate only displays file names that
       match the pattern exactly.  As  a  result,  patterns  that
       contain  metacharacters  should  usually begin with a `*',
       and will most often end with one as well.  The  exceptions
       are  patterns  that  are  intended to explicitly match the
       beginning or end of a file name.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
So, there's your answer! 'Match the pattern exactly' means here that
the fully qualified pathname (starting with a /) must match.
The other lesson here may be summarized with another quote from 
the locate(1) man page:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
			 Patterns  that   contain   metacharacters
       should  be  quoted  to  protect them from expansion by the
       shell.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This applies as well to patterns passed to 'find', i.e.

<PRE>
	$ find /usr/local -name 'lynx*' -print
</PRE>

<P>
is the 'politically correct' command line to use.

<P>
Merry Linuxing!

</B>

<P>
Hello John,

<P>
Glad to see you've not abandoned the Gazette totally. One thing though
on your article about 'find'. I've noticed in the past when using the
find command, it has not found all the files when using wild card
characters such as '*' (as in your example find /usr/local -name lynx*
-print). I discovered from one of the linux newsgroups, that the shell
tries to expand lynx* first, and it is possible that find will not
search all the directories. To stop bash from expanding the filename
enclose it in single quotes, as below:

<PRE>
     find /usr/local -name 'lynx*' -print
</PRE>

<P>
Bet you I'm not the first to point his out :)

<!--  TAR ARTICLE ====================================================== -->
<H2><A NAME="tclvu"><IMG SRC="../gx/fisk/toolchest.gif" WIDTH=122 HEIGHT=97
ALIGN=BOTTOM>A Tcl/Tk Tar Viewer</A></H2>

<P>
I'm going to apologize at the outset -- it's Saturday and I've still got a
small mountain of work to do for the upcoming week and so I just don't have
the time to write an awful lot about this.  I'll try to summarize the
highlights of what I was attempting to do and what actually worked.

<P>
To recap from last month, I'd been trying to find a way to get a simple
listing of all the files in a tar archive.  As was pointed out, this can be
done using:

<PRE>
    tar -tf file.tar
    tar -tzf file.tar.gz
</PRE>

depending on whether the file is a tar or tar+gzip file.  (I'm assuming that
you're using GNU tar, BTW, not all implementations of tar support the '-z'
option which uses 'gzip' to either compress or uncompress an archive.)

<P>
The purpose for doing this was to allow you to get a tar listing and then use
this as an argument to tar to print that file to standard output.  For
example, if your tar archive looked like:

<PRE>
xtoolwait-1.0/
xtoolwait-1.0/xtoolwait.c
xtoolwait-1.0/Imakefile
xtoolwait-1.0/COPYING-2.0
xtoolwait-1.0/xtoolplaces.diff
xtoolwait-1.0/CHANGES
xtoolwait-1.0/README
xtoolwait-1.0/xtoolwait.man
xtoolwait-1.0/xtoolwait-1.0.lsm
</PRE>

<P>
then using a command like:

<PRE>
    tar -tzOf xtoolwait-1.0.tar.gz xtoolwait-1.0/README |less
                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</PRE>

<P>
would allow you to view the file 'README' by piping it to 'less'.  That was
the reason for needing to get a listing of just the filenames in the archive
-- to be able to invoke tar with the '-O' option so that it would output the
results to standard output.

<P>
Now, the thing is that tcl/tk will allow you to capture the output of a file
using 'open'.  Coupled with 'fileevent', this allows you to direct the output
of a command to a text widget for viewing and editing.  So this was the
direction I was going.

<P>
I've actually got this working now.  It's definitely NOT a showpiece of tcl/tk
coding:  this 'ol thing wouldn't win any programming contests.  Still, as a
quick prototype (I hacked it out in two days...), it gave me some ideas about
how to put together something a bit more sturdy.  Basically, as it stand right
now, its features include:

<UL>
    <LI>a <B>directory browser</B> that allows you to select files and navigate
        around your file system easily
    <LI>a <B>tar archive viewer</B> which lists the files contained within the
        archive
    <LI>a <B>File Viewer</B> which can be invoked by double-clicking on a
        file;  it allows you to edit, save, and print the file
    <LI>a <B>Save As</B> dialog box which allows you to save (or append) a
        file in the tar archive to disk
    <LI>a small <B>Print Dialog</B> which prompts you to input a file print
        command (defaults to 'lpr') and print the file
</UL>

<P>
As I said, it is actually working right now and I've used it several times
over the past couple weeks.

<P>
Parenthetically, I've been using <B>Tcl 7.5 and Tk 4.1</B> for development.  I
don't know if any of you have tried compiling this from sources.  Using the
supplied makefile, I was unable to get the shared libraries to compile.  It's
been a while since I did this but, if memory serves me correctly, it fails on
some system test and thus refuses to compile the shared libs.  I did find,
however, that by adding '-fPIC' to the CFLAGS, copying the *.o files to a
separate directory, and then using something like:

<PRE>
    gcc -shared -Wl,-soname,libtcl.so.0.7 -o libtcl.so.0.7.5 *.o
</PRE>

that I was able to compile a working shared library.  I'd be interested in
hearing from anyone else who's tried to compile tcl or tk from sources.  I'll
quickly admit that I'm still a neophyte when it come to C and UNIX/Linux
programming.  The above works, but if it is &quot;Not The Right Way&quot; then
please drop a note.

<P>
That said, let's take the penny tour...

<P>
<IMG SRC="./gx/fisk/tarvu-DirBrowser.gif" ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="Directory Browser"
WIDTH=693 HEIGHT=359>

<P>
To begin, when you start the <B>tarvu</B> program, it displays this directory
browser.  The path is displayed at the top along with the name of the file (if
any) which has been selected.  You navigate to a new directory by either:

<UL>
    <LI>clicking on the 'Up..' button to go to the parent directory
    <LI>double clicking on a directory within the listbox
    <LI>entering a valid directory name in the 'Path:' entry box
</UL>

<P>
If you single click on a file, then its name is displayed after the 'File:'
label.  Single clicking on a directory has no effect.  If you click on a tar
or tar+gzip file, then you can use the 'View/Edit...' button to view a listing
of the contents of the file.  Double clicking on the file has the same effect.

<P>
<IMG SRC="./gx/fisk/tarvu-TarBrowser.gif" ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="Tar Listing
Browser" WIDTH=693 HEIGHT=359>

<P>
After a tar or tar+gzip file has been selected, the 'Tar Browser' allows you
view the contents of the tar archive.  Now, you can use the full set of
operation buttons to either view/edit, save, or print a specific file within
the tar archive.  Single click on a file within the listing and then click on
any of the operation buttons.  If you double-click on a file, then it defaults
to the file viewer:

<P>
<IMG SRC="./gx/fisk/tarvu-TarView.gif" ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="Directory Browser"
WIDTH=771 HEIGHT=485>

<P>
The viewer allows you to view, edit, save, or print the contents of a file
within the archive.  The name of the file is displayed in the upper left hand
corner.  To either widen or lengthen the edit window, click on 'Widen Window'
or 'Lengthen Window'.  Now, you can manually resize the window, but doing so
does not automatically resize the text widget.  I've not been successful in
figuring out how to do this, although I suspect that it can be done.  Until
then, use the buttons... :-)

<P>
If you edit the file and want to save it to disk (NOT back to the archive),
then click on the 'Save As...' button.  This brings up a directory browser
which allows you to save the contents of the editing buffer:

<P>
<IMG SRC="./gx/fisk/tarvu-SaveBuf.gif" ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="Directory Browser"
WIDTH=690 HEIGHT=398>

<P>
This allows you to save or append the contents of the editing buffer to a
file.  The directory browser features work in a fashion similar to what was
previously described.  Because this was a quick hack, I simply coded another
proc to provide the save/append feature for a FILE within the archive.  So, if
you go back to the tar archive list, select a file, and then click on the
'Save...' button, you'll see a directory browser which looks similar to the
one above.

<P>
Finally, if you click on the 'Print...' button, a small dialog box is
displayed:

<P>
<IMG SRC="./gx/fisk/tarvu-printdlg.gif" ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="Directory Browser"
WIDTH=338 HEIGHT=120>

<P>
You simply input the command to print to your printer and click on the 'Print'
button.

<P>
Pretty simple, eh?

<P>
As I mentioned before, this is no paragon of programming brilliance.  This was
a rather quick hack, but it does show what can be VERY EASILY done with even
the basic tools of Tcl/Tk.  If anyone is interested in this, you can get the
tcl script here:

<A NAME="tclvu-src">
<H3><A HREF="./misc/tclvu.tcl">Tcl Tar Archive Viewer Source</A></H3>

<P>
For those of you using Netscape, hold down the Shift button and single click
with the left mouse button on this link to save the file to disk.  Call it
whatever you'd like, and then set the permissions to something like:

<PRE>
    % chmod 755 tclvu.tcl
</PRE>

<P>
I've got mine symlinked to 'tclvu' to make it easier to remember.

<P>
In all honesty, there are LOTS of things that could be done to make this more
useful or efficient.  Just a couple TODO's that come to mind include:

The thing is, there are all kinds of fun things that can be done.  This simple
tcl/tk wrapper for tar just lets you view, edit, and print files at the
moment.  The tar manual page can give you further ideas about what could be
done.

<P>
For those of you needing a &quot;real&quot; tar utility, I'd strongly suggest
using <B>Miguel de Icaza's</B> GREAT program <B>Midnight Commander</B>.  You
can pick up the sources at any ftp site which mirrors the GNU utilities such
as:

<H3><A HREF="ftp://ftp.cc.gatech.edu/pub/gnu/">GA Tech's FTP server</A></H3>

<P>
Also, there's a program called <B>xtar</B> which is found at the
<B>ftp.x.org</B> ftp site.  I've honestly not seen this mentioned anywhere and
yet it's a VERY handy little program that allows you to browse and view the
contents of a tar archive.  You'll need the Motif development libraries to
compile this, however.

<P>
Well, as I said, this was a pretty quick tour.  Please feel free to hack away
at this and enjoy it.  I tried to comment the code, so you should have some
idea about my mental state when the thing was written.

<P>
Hope you enjoy!

Well, I'd hoped to include a lot more stuff in this month's WM column, but
time has completely gotten away from me and it's already almost dinner time
(and no homework done yet... :-).  I must admit that I enjoy doing this a LOT
more than Linear Algebra (...sorry Dr. Powell, it's still a GREAT course :-)

<P>
So, what are the rest of you guys working on <I>out there...?</I>

<P>
I upgraded my home system over this past summer to a Cyrix P-166+ machine with
a Triton II MB, 32 MB EDO RAM, Diamond Stealth Video VRAM graphics card,
Toshiba 8X CDROM, and CTX 1765GME monitor.  I dropped in the old Maxtor 1.6
Gig drive from my previous machine and have just gotten a second Maxtor 2.0
drive (so Linux can finally have its own drive!).  I'll be installing this and
reinstalling much of the system over Christmas Break.  If this sounds like a
brewing &quot;mail brown-out&quot;, you're probably right... :-)

<P>
I've also gotten pretty enamoured with Tcl/Tk as you might have noticed.  This
is a seriously fun programming environment.  Now, I know that this isn't for
everyone and there are folks who've tried tcl that just frankly didn't like
the language.  Still, there are a growing number of truly impressive add on's
including <B>tclX, BLT, Tix, and [incr tcl]</B> that add a lot of nice
features.  I'd especially commend to the <B>Tix</B> extension.  It provides a
set of <I>meta-widgets</I> such as directory browsers, tabbed windows, and the
like.  It precludes your having to code these types of windows and gives you
a higher level widget to work with.  If you're interested in this, then
definitely run the demo program as it give you a IMPRESSIVE tour of the widget
set.

<P>
Finally, I've just gotten a microphone for my sound card (SB Vibra 16 PnP) and
have been messing around with creating sound files.

<P>
Pretty cool :-)

<P>
I'm still not completely facile with all the basics, but I've gotten a few
snippets recorded, including a &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; rendition (my wife
and me) to our sister-in-law.  It'd curl 'ol Lawrence Welk's toes, I suspect,
but it was fun to send this rascal out via email.  You know... &quot;reach out
and touch someone...&quot;

<P>
Well, here's wishing you Happy Linux'ing!

<P>
Since I didn't have time this month do to a &quot;Christmas Shopping
List&quot; of Linux goodies, I'll try to get this in next month so that after
you return all those bottles of aftershave and the argyle socks, you'll know
what to do with the money... :-)

<P>
From our household to yours,

<CENTER>
<P><I>Wishing you a Merry and Joyous Christmas Season!</I>
