<h1>Away Mission - Upcoming in May: Citrix Synergy and Google IO</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>

<p>
This year, Synergy plays in San Francisco, in the neighborhood of Silicon
Valley and both VMware and Oracle (and also formerly independent Sun
Microsystems.) Last year it was in Vegas, with keynotes available via Web
streaming.
</p>

<p>
Synergy has become a new Virtualization destination since Citrix acquired
the primary sponsorship of the Xen virtuallization platform from XenSource,
Inc, in October 2007.  It is also slowly developing Open Source tendrils.
</p>

<p>
It was only last year, a few months after Synergy 2009, that Simon Crosby,
Citrix's CTO of Virtualization and Management, said, "XenServer is 100%
free, and also shortly fully open sourced. There is no revenue from it at
all." A further shift in the direction of Open Source is expected at
May's event.
</p>

<p>
Synergy will also offer sessions on VDI - virtual desktop infrastructure.
This seems follow along with Cloud Computing and the new internet-based
terminal devices: smart phones and netbooks. We may be seeing the
re-invention of the Mainframe.
</p>   

<p>
If you’ve attended a previous Synergy conference, you’re entitled to a
discount of $600 off the regular registration price. That would be only
$1,295 and there is no deadline on that price. Other discounts are based on
early registration.
</p>

<p>
At the Synergy Testing Center you can take a Citrix exam of your choice for
free.  This can help you pursue a Citrix Certification, including the CCEE
and CCIA for Virtualization. The A15 and A16 beta exams are now available
exclusively to Synergy San Francisco attendees.
</p> 

<p>
Citrix Synergy-SF May 12-14, 2010. San Francisco, CA<br>
<a href="http://www.citrix.com/lang/English/events.asp">http://www.citrix.com/lang/English/events.asp</a>
</p>

<p>
I would also recommend Google I/O 2010; unfortunately, it is closed to
new registrations. It filled up within 2 or 3 weeks of registration
opening.
</p> 

<p>
The 2010 web developer conference has expanded to include a BootCamp day
before the main event, but you have to be already registered for Google IO
to gain entrance to the BootCamp.  These sessions assume you have no
experience working with Google technologies and will be lead by Google
developers.
</p>

<p>
Google I/O features 80 sessions, more than 3,000 developers, and over 100
demonstrations from developers showcasing their technologies.
</p>

<p>
The word must have gotten out that, besides a well organized conference and
great grub, Google bestowed unlocked G-phones on all developer attendees
last year. That's a big perk and some of these showed on eBay for over
$500 each. Which meant several attendees got their fees covered
because...
</p>

<p>
The cost last year and this year was fairly amazing.  Early bird
registration fees was $400 USD through April 16th, 2010. If there were
space available after April 16th they would have been $500 USD. The
Academia (students, professors, faculty/staff) registration fee was $100
USD.  Such a bargain!
</p>

<p>
Of course, with the Iceland eruptions, some Euro guests may have to cancel.

Google IO Developer Conference (now closed): May 19 - 20, Moscone Center, San Francisco, CA<br>
