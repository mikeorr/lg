<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Open Source Persistence Framework to provide JPA 2.0</h3>

<p>
The Eclipse Foundation and Sun Microsystems have selected the EclipseLink
project as the reference implementation for Java's JPA 2.0. Sun is the
project lead for the Java Persistence API (JPA) and the JSR 317
standard. This is another example of how the Eclipse community has been
leading the implementation of JSRs under the Java Community Process
(JCP). The Eclipse Persistence Services Project (EclipseLink), led by
Oracle, delivers an open source runtime framework supporting major
persistence standards.
</p>
 

<p>
The EclipseLink project provides a rich set of services addressing
complex mapping, performance, and scalability issues required for
enterprise Java applications. JSR 317, the Java Persistence API, is the
Java API for the management of persistence and object/relational mapping
for the Java Platform. As the reference implementation, EclipseLink will
provide a commercial quality persistence solution that can be used in
both Java SE and Java EE applications.
</p>

<p>
The EclipseLink project was initiated with Oracle's contribution of the
full source code and test suite for Oracle TopLink. The project builds
on the success of TopLink Essentials which is featured in Sun's
GlassFish Open Source Application Server, the JPA 1.0 reference
implementation, which was also based on Oracle TopLink.
</p>

<p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Other News from EclipseCon 2008</h3>
<h4>New Eclipse Runtime Initiative around Equinox</h4>

<p>
At EclipseCon 2008 in March, the Eclipse Foundation announced a new
initiative to develop and promote open source runtime technology based
on Equinox, a lightweight and OSGi-compliant runtime for applications.
While Eclipse is well known for its widely used development tools, this
initiative establishes a community of Eclipse open source projects
focused on runtime technology that provides a more flexible approach to
building and deploying software on mobile, desktop, and server
environments.
</p>

<p>
The move to create a community around Equinox is a logical progression
for Eclipse. Equinox, the core runtime platform for Eclipse, has been
deployed on millions of software developers' desktops, has enabled an
ecosystem of thousands of Eclipse plug-ins, and is the base of hundreds
of Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP)-based applications. Recently, the
community has also used Equinox as the server platform for Ajax
applications, SOA, enterprise client/server applications and others. So,
this new initiative promotes Equinox as a platform for building and
deploying general purpose software products and applications.
</p>

<p>
More details about the Equinox community can be found at
<a href="http://eclipse.org/equinox-portal">http://eclipse.org/equinox-portal</a>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Eclipse Higgins 1.0 Released</h3>

<p>
Eclipse Foundation announced the availability of Eclipse Higgins 1.0, a
freely downloadable identity framework designed to integrate identity,
profile, and social relationship information across multiple sites,
applications, and devices.
</p>

<p>
Web 2.0, mashups, social networking, and the general rise of networked
applications have made Web-based identity management complex for both
end-users and developers. The Eclipse Higgins project has been working
to address these issues. Multiple identity protocols have been developed
to address different needs, including WS-Trust, OpenID, SAML, XDI, and
LDAP.
</p>

<p>
Eclipse Higgins 1.0 is now available at
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/higgins/downloads.php">http://www.eclipse.org/higgins/downloads.php</a>. More information about the project is available at <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/higgins">http://www.eclipse.org/higgins</a>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />NSA, Sun to enhance OpenSolaris Security</h3>

<p>
Sun and the United States' National Security Agency (NSA) announced an
agreement to jointly work within the OpenSolaris Community to research
and to develop security enhancements to complement existing OpenSolaris
security mechanisms. Both Sun and the NSA will work with the OpenSolaris
community to integrate an additional form of mandatory access control
(MAC), based on the Flux Advanced Security Kernel (Flask) architecture.
</p>

<p>
The joint research project is intended to complement the security
benefits of the mandatory access controls provided by the Solaris(TM)
Trusted Extensions feature and will be evaluated by the OpenSolaris
community. The Flask architecture supports a wide range of security
policies, enabling integration of different policy engines and 
configuration of the security policy to meet the specific security goals
for a wide range of computing environments.
</p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Intel describes Future Multicore Architecture</h3>

<p>
In March, Intel Corporation raised the curtain on upcoming
microprocessors and technologies. Intel discussed future products with
45nm high-k metal gate manufacturing technology that will be used in
4-, 6-, 8-, and multi-cores coming to the market.
</p>

<p>
Pat Gelsinger, Intel Senior Vice-President and General Manager,

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Plat'Home launches Linux-based Eco-Friendly Servers</h3>

<p>
Part of the first ecology-friendly line of Linux servers ever shipped in
the United States, Plat'Home's OpenBlockS server has been built and tested
to provide enterprise-grade reliability in its RISC-based hardware, and has
eliminated moving parts including a hard disk drive and cooling fan. It is
also RoHS certified, a European Union directive meaning that it's free of lead,
mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium and other damaging materials.
</p>

<p>
The OpenBlockS server line is a breakthrough in size and power consumption
for a Linux server. One standard configuration Dell, HP or IBM server
consumes the same amount of power as 76 of these devices.  The
OpenBlockS266 during operation sips a miniscule 4.5 watts or less.  In
standby mode, it is 4.0 watts or less.  This compares, for example, to the
Dell Poweredge R200 that chews up 345 watts.
</p>

<p>
OpenBlockS runs a broad range of applications - even in hazardous
environments. It can also be used to manage network problems and
troubleshoot errors such as packet loss, delay, fluctuation, duplication
and order switching, and it provides a cost-effective solution to monitor a
local network or to ensure line quality for a critical server or terminal
where it is necessary to maintain an appropriate line speed.
</p>

<p>
Key features of the Plat'Home OpenBlockS include:
</p> 

<ul>
<li>-       
Size:
4.5'' x 3.2'' x 1.5'', rubber feet 0.02&#8221;</li>
<li>-        Power Consumption during
operation at 4.5W or less; During standby at 4.0W or less</li>
<li>-        Preinstalled with
SSD/Linux; also supports Debian and NetBSD</li>
<li>-        266MHz IBM&reg;
PowerPC&reg; 405GPr RISC processor</li>
<li>-        2 10/100BaseTX Ports, 1
RJ-45 Serial port</li>
<li>-        Stable long-term
operation even under 41&deg;C/104&deg;F</li>
<li>-        Internal Storage:
Compact Flash or IDE 2.5" HDD (not included)</li>
</ul>

<p>
OpenBlockS servers can be fully administered over the network. For more

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />VMware VMsafe protects VMs</h3>

<p>
VMware has a new security technology called VMware VMsafe,
<a href="http://www.vmware.com/go/vmsafe">http://www.vmware.com/go/vmsafe</a>
, that protects applications running in virtual machines in ways
previously not possible in physical environments. The VMsafe APIs allow
vendors to develop advanced security products that combat the latest
generation of malware. VMsafe technology integrates into the VMware ESX
hypervisor and provides the transparency to prevent threats and attacks
such as viruses, trojans, and keyloggers from ever reaching a virtual
machine.
</p> 

<p>
Twenty security vendors have embraced VMsafe technology, and are building
products that will further enhance the security of virtual machines,
making the virtual environment unmatched in the level of security and
protection it provides compared to physical systems.
</p>

<p>
VMsafe technology integrates at the hypervisor layer of virtualization
to detect and eliminate the latest generation of malware. The VMware
hypervisor is an ultra-thin layer of software that runs directly on
server hardware independently of the operating system, enabling users to
create virtual machines on the server in which to run applications.
VMsafe technology provides transparency into the memory, CPU, disk, and
I/O systems of the virtual machine, and monitors every aspect of the
execution of the system. Security products built on VMsafe technology
are able to stop malware before it harms a machine or steals data,
including the latest generation of rootkits, trojans, and viruses, which
are undetectable on physical machines.

Kat likes to tell people she's one of the youngest people to have learned
to program using punchcards on a mainframe (back in '83); but the truth is
that since then, despite many hours in front of various computer screens,
she's a computer user rather than a computer programmer.
</p>
<p>
Her transition away from other OSes started with the design of a
massively multilingual wedding invitation.
<p>
When away from the keyboard, her hands have been found wielding of knitting
needles, various pens, henna, red-hot welding tools, upholsterer's shears,
and a pneumatic scaler. More often these days, she's occupied with managing
her <a href="okopnik1.html">latest project</a>.
