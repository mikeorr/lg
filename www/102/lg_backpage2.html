My bad.

<P>
<STRONG>[Thomas Adam]</STRONG> 
I keep hearing that phrase... WHAT DOES IT MEAN???
Your 'bad' what? Foot, ankle, knee, head, eye???? Damn slang.

<P>
<STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
Ooh, Thomas is getting frustrated with American slang.
It's a weird phrase.  I have no idea where it came from.  It just
appeared maybe three years ago.  I don't like it.

<P>
<STRONG>[Thomas]</STRONG> 
Three years ago? Good God, where have I been all that time? I only started
to hear it maybe within the last six months; and that's with my friends
using it.

<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy O'Regan]</STRONG> 
It's ebonics. It's been around a lot longer than that. It means "my 
fault" or "my mistake". Just wait until you get up to "fo shizzle
dizzle". <IMG ALT=":)" SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="24">

<P>
<STRONG>[Ben Okopnik]</STRONG> 
&lt;laugh&gt; That's almost Cockney slang! Except... the thought of that
accent makes my brain hurt.

<P>
<STRONG>[Thomas]</STRONG> 
Cos, that's just like so typical of Americans.

<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
So you have no problem deciphering all of the many regional variants of 
English in England? The trend started before the Americans...

<P>
<STRONG>[Thomas]</STRONG> 
What makes me laugh though is that there is now a distinction between
English(US) and English(UK). You guys definitely have tainted? No..wrong
word to use, altered/destroyed the English language.

<H3>Thomas's assertion split into several different subthreads...</H3>

<P>
<STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
<EM>NOW???</EM>  It's been happening ever since Noah Webster (1758-1843)
started writing 'color', 'draft', 'encyclopedia', and 'center' just to be
different.
 But the language my parents and schools taught me was called 'English',
not 'American'.  Deal with it.

<P>
<STRONG>[Rick Moen]</STRONG> 
Without us Yanks, you POMmies would still be struggling for words to
describe oregano, papaya, mesquite, barbecues, pecan, stampedes, calumet,
cafeterias, and poinsettias.  Not to mention jazz and the blues.  What
could you possibly have done without those?

<P>
<STRONG>[Ben]</STRONG> 
&lt;cough&gt; About half of the above are Spanish or American Indian.
"barbacoa" is bastardized island French, I believe. My favorite example
of that last being "buccaneer" - a "boucanier" was someone who used a
"boucan" (Arawak/Caribe word), a smoker, to preserve meat (make jerky)
for shipbord use, one of the standard things that pirates in the
Caribbean did during the slow season.

<P>
<STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
Is that the pirate you bought the slingshot from?

<P>
<STRONG>[Rick]</STRONG> 
Stem-winder, cowcatcher, rubberneck, bunkum, has-been, roughhouse --
these are all gifts that enrich our tongue.  They're not just useful;
the have attitude.  

<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
A lot of American spellings have been adopted; gaol is archaic, for example. 
There are a few pages on Wikip[a]edia devoted to the topic. (And the 
talk pages are fairly lively; a lot of Americans have trouble accepting 
that "fanny" doesn't mean ass in British English).

How about "arse"? It's a great general purpose word:
<UL>
<LI> "Arse!" - Expression of dissatisfaction
<LI> "Stop arsing about" - stop playing around/wasting time
<LI> "You've made a real arse of that" - you've made a complete mess of that
as well as fulfilling the role of "ass":
<LI> "You're making an arse of yourself", "Stop being such an arse" etc
</UL>

    The problem with defending the purity of the English language is that
    English is about as pure as a cribhouse whore. We don't just borrow words;
    on occasion, English has pursued other languages down alleyways to beat
    them unconscious and rifle their pockets for new vocabulary.

Hmm. The version I saw looks like this:

    Not only does the English language borrow from other languages, it

And to think it only took two words to start this thread!

<H3>Jimmy whinges about American terms creeping into Irish English</H3>

<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
It annoys me sometimes, because I don't watch soap operas, and words 
creep into usage here.... I'm waiting for the day that Scouse is 
declared an official language. <IMG ALT=":)" SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="24"> (Why not... Scots is)

<P>
<STRONG>[Thomas]</STRONG> 
LOL, if *that* happens, I'll emigrate to somewhere like Bolivia. Mind you,
Ireland isn't without its own set of interesting little phrases. Of
course, it's nothing compared to the Welsh...

    <BLOCKQUOTE><!-- begin Welsh -->

    <STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
    In Ireland, "village" = city center.
    "I'm going to the village to get the messages" = I'm going to the pub for
    a drink (and maybe I'll stop at the post office too).

    <P> <STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
    I've never heard any Welsh phrases.

    <P> <STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
    I haven't heard any Welsh phrases, but written Welsh is a trip.
    See attached.  Misuse is "gamddefnydd"???

    Heh. I used to know how to say 
    Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch, back in 
    secondary school when I used to do table quizes. I can't be arsed now.

    </BLOCKQUOTE><!-- end Welsh -->

<P>
<STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
What's Scouse?  Is that what they speak in <I>Trainspotting</I>?  I thought
that was Scots.

<P>
<STRONG>[Thomas]</STRONG> 
'Tis those people from Liverpool.  Scots is a completely different dialect.

<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
... Pejorative for Liverpudlians. Scots is recognised as being a separate 
language.  (Which is just as well, really.)

<P>
<STRONG>[Rick]</STRONG> 
A lot of people, especially 'Merkins, don't realise what the term
"Scots" refers to in the area of languages.  It's a collateral
descendent of Old English that the arriving Scottish tribes from Ireland 
picked up starting in the seventh century from the northern English 
already present in the lowlands -- picking up Anglo-Norman and
Scandinavian loan-words (brae, graith, lowp, nieve) starting a few
centuries later.  Even later, it picked up French vocabulary (fash,
ashet, leal, aumrie) and Dutch (loon, pinkie, golf, scone) through
trading and political alliances.  The poetry of Robert Henryson, William
Dunbar, and Gavin Douglas was from this era, and is easier than Chaucer
for modern readers, but still sometimes tough sledding:
<PRE>
  Ane cok sum tyme with feddram fresch and gay,
  Richt cant and crous, albeit he was bot pure,
  Fleu furth upon ane dunghill sone be day;
  To get his dennar set was al his cure.
  Scraipand amang the as be aventure
  He fand ane jolie jasp, richt precious,
  Wes castin furth in sweping of the hous.
</PRE>

<P> Starting around the Act of Union (1603), Scots became much more
anglicised, mostly through government and church efforts to weld the two
countries together.  Bobby Burns hails from that period:
<PRE>
   Poor Tammy Gage within a cage
   Was kept at Boston-ha', man;
   Till Willie Howe took o'er the knowe
   For Philadelphia, man;
   Wi' sword an' gun he thought a sin
   Guid Christian bluid to draw, man;
   But at New York, wi' knife an' fork,
   Sir-Loin he hacked sma', man. 
</PRE>
It also isn't the same as Scots Gaelic, a quite different third tongue.

<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
From what I'd read, there was a separate group of tribes from around 
Denmark who settled around Scotland, bringing a language which was 
similar to Anglo-Saxon, but different enough. After that, both languages 
followed a similar path. I think there was a slight influence of Pictish 
in there too.

<P> Yeah, Scots Gaelic is descended from Old Irish, and is supposed to be 
closer to Old Irish than modern Irish is.

<P>
<STRONG>[Rick]</STRONG> 
I still can't think of any Irish phrases though.  Peculiar usages, yes; 
words, yes; phrases, no.

<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
I suppose there's the old Oirish favourite "Go n&eacute;irí an b&oacute;thair
leat" (May the road rise with you).

<H3>Things take a turn toward the subjunctive</H3>

<P>
<STRONG>[Ben]</STRONG> 
Pshaw. Thomas, if anything, it's _you_ people that have introduced the
changes; language generally stop evolving once away from their source.
See "got-&gt;gotten" in current American usage, which I understand the Brits
dropped a couple of centuries back.

<P>
<STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
Or the lingering traces of subjunctive in English(Am):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   She turned up the radio in order that he hear it better.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Which I understand English(Br) changes to:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   She turned up the radio in order that he should hear it better.

         <BLOCKQUOTE>[What?  He "should" hear it?  Since when does he have a 
     moral obligation to hear it?]</BLOCKQUOTE>

   She turned up the radio in order that he hears it.

     <BLOCKQUOTE>[Possible if he does hear it, but technically incorrect
     because it's a goal, not a matter-of-fact statement.]</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
In Hiberno-English [Irish English], it'd be:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Why did she turn up the radio, you ask? Well, 'tis funny you should 
ask, and I'll tell you why...." etc. The story would include details on 
how the radio came to be purchased, what sort of weather they were 
having (including the inevitable complaints about the rain), why it was 
that she turned up the radio....
</BLOCKQUOTE>
    

<P>
<STRONG>[Ben]</STRONG> 
&lt;*blink*&gt; I'm astounded, Jimmy. You mean it actually gets to that last
part at some point?

<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
That gets mentioned in passing; why she did it, instead of him turning 
it up himself. All Irish stories have an end; it may not be the same 
ending as the last time you heard it, but they do have an end.

<H3>Sluggo tries to convince Thomas of the advantages of American spelling</H3>

<P>
<STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
I know a Canadian who spells 'color' coz it's shorter.  Try it.  It's
not that difficult to write 'draft', 'plow', 'gram' and 'check'.  

<P>
<STRONG>[Thomas]</STRONG> 
Hehehe... *That* is lazy.
'Draught' (as in beer), 'Plough' (Horse and Cart mechanism), 'Gramme',
'Cheque'. 

<P> Of course the use of these words depends upon the context in
which you are using them.
One "drafts" an idea, but one does not drink a "draft", but rather a
"draught".
One writes a "cheque", but "checks" to make sure he has completed it.

<P>
<STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
Once
you get used to it, you'll never look back.  The Brits should be
thanking us for getting rid of those cumbersome spellings.

<P>
<STRONG>[Thomas]</STRONG> 
LOL. Not at all.

<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
But thanks anyway, I think I'll stick to "colour", "draught", "plough", 
"gramme" and "cheque".  I find it comforting to know that I can trace the 
origin of a word through its spelling, or use it to make a reasonable 
guess.  If you have an idea of what "exchequer" means, and don't know 
what a "cheque" is, you have a better chance of making a reasonable 
guess with British spellings.

<BLOCKQUOTE><!-- begin DRAUGHT -->
    <P>
    <STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
    Every time I see draught (as in beer), I pronounce it 'drot'.

    <P>
    <STRONG>[Thomas]</STRONG> 
    No, that is incorrect. It is pronounced "dra-aft". The fact that you're
    trying to pronounce it as "drot" suggests that your natural way of
    pronounciation is:
    "aught" == "rot". Hmm, *most* interesting.


    <P>
    <STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
    Yes, aught is rot.  But normally I don't pronounce it at all.
    There was a curious article after the Millenium about what to call the
    2000-09 decade.  We still don't have a word for it, although I call it
    the "oh-OHs".  But these reporters asked several grandparents what they called
    1900-09, and without hesitation they said "the noughts".  But "nought"
    is another word we don't use, preferring "none" or "nothing" instead.

    <P>
    <STRONG>[Thomas]</STRONG> 
    Oh, excellent. I would say "naught" (pron: noor-t, stress on the first
    syllable), and I do indeed say the naught-naughts. "Oh-Ohs" to most people
    would either mean the letter or, umm, something associated with a sexual
    act, but it depends on the mind of the person to whom you are speaking to.
</BLOCKQUOTE><!-- end DRAUGHT -->

<P>
<STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
Too bad we didn't get rid of "ph" too like Spanish and Italian did.

<H3>Thomas is, like, sick of 'like'</H3>

<P>
<STRONG>[Thomas]</STRONG> 
Golly, I am amazed by the response this thread has generated thus far. I
was *only* joking about you ruining the 'English' language, I assure you.
But, the response has been both interesting and enlightening. I've read
each and every one of them...

<P> But my original concept was the use of what I term 'American Slang'
filtering into the 'English' language. For instance, many people now use
the word 'like' as a noun:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    "I was like walking, and there was like this huge like truck, with like
    this big flashing light....". 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
This is very American to me.

<P>
<STRONG>[Ben]</STRONG> 
Valley-girl-speak had its 15 minutes in the spotlight and died out here
(leaving, or course, an inevitable residue - mainly as linguistic
in-jokes, such as "fer-sure" and my own use of "yeeeew". It implies
something like "here's the blonde way of saying it".)

<P>
<STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
What you call American slang we call Californa slang.  "like" was
popularized by Moon Zappa in the song "Valley Girl" although its use
goes farther back.  Like, totally, it's like SO bitchin', gag me with a
spoon.  That's how the high-school girls in the early 80s talked, those whose
major pastime consisted of shopping in the mall (Sherman Oaks Galleria)
in the San Fernando Valley north of Los Angeles.  Extreme use of 'like'
is Valley Girl style, but moderate use of 'like' goes all over the
country.  'totally' is more associated with San Francisco (cf. Amistead
Maupin's <I>Tales of the City</I>) but is also used everywhere.

<P> 'like' is an adverb, not a noun.  Many people hate it, but I think it
has a genuine use.  It softens things.  Sometimes it's too stark or
impolite to say something IS something, but if you say it LIKE IS
something, it sounds softer.  It also provides that needed touch of
uncertainty sometimes, like "about" or "approximately".

<P> 'totally' means "really, really yes", or "I understand" in the sense of
"I'm with you, brother", but sometimes it's just a substitute for "yes".
It also makes the speaker sound like a surfer boy or... I don't know
how to describe it, but the type of person who has a goatee and maybe
was a skater in the 90s.  But lots of other people say "totally" too.

<P>
When Heather was writing curdgemonly (sp?) to a clueless querent a
few years ago, she 
<A HREF="../issue64/lg_mail64.html#mailbag">said</A>, "Dude, get a new 'tude."
I said, "That must be a California expression."  She said, "Yes, <EM>very</EM>
California."

<P>
<STRONG>[Thomas]</STRONG> 
Mike, you miss the point, not to mention the fact that saying something
"like is" something else goes against my idea of grammar. First, I was
complaining about how the word: 'like' is being used as a connective between
everyother word. However, what you have just done is to try and rationalise its
existance....  Tut tut.

<P>
<STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
Don't you "tut tut" me.  Overuse makes it a meaningless filler word, but
some people do use it carefully in the sense I described.

<P>
<STRONG>[Rick]</STRONG> 
It seems appropriate to cue William Safire's advice to authors:
<UL>
<LI> Don't use no double negatives.
<LI> Proofread carefully to see if you any words out.
<LI> Take the bull by the hand and avoid mixed metaphors.
<LI> If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times, resist
  hyperbole.
<LI> "Avoid over use of 'quotation "marks."'"
<LI> Avoid commas, that are not necessary.
<LI> If you reread your work, you will find on rereading that a great deal
  of repetition can be avoided by rereading and editing.
<LI> Avoid cliches like the plague.
<LI> Never use a long word when a diminutive one will do.
<LI> Avoid colloquial stuff. 
</UL>

It reminds me of a story:  There's supposed to have been a college English
class where the professor was holding forth on grammatical structure.
He cited and discussed examples in English of double negatives -- and
then claimed _no_ similar examples exist of a corresponding
double-positive, whose meaning equates to a negative.

<P>
A voice rang out from the back row:  "Yeah right."

<P>
<STRONG>[Ben]</STRONG> 
Sure, whatever you say.
