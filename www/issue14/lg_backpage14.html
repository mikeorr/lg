to complete a graduate degree in Computer Science before
entering a Medical Informatics Fellowship. In his dwindling
free time he and his wife Faith enjoy hiking and camping in
Tennessee's beautiful Great Smoky Mountains. He has been an avid Linux fan,

<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/rose.gif">Phil Hughes</a></H4>

<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/rose.gif">R. Frank Louden </H4>
Frank Louden has a degree in Computer Science from Purdue.
While working on his degree, he also worked in the Medical center first as a
Computer Clerk then as the Systems Manager. 
He currently works as a Programmer, which &quot;is all the fun and a lot
fewer headaches (read: It sounds like a hardware problem to me.)&quot;
He first installed Linux last March, so he knows the challenge a convert
faces. 
On the personal side, he lives in a small town in north central Indiana and
would love to organize a LUG but thinks it'd be difficult to find
any other Linux users out here in the boonies. He has two cats, Mac and
Catalina who he says &quot;both know more about Linux than I do...but they never
reveal their secrets!&quot;

<P>

working with computers. James wrote the article <I>Connecting Computers via 
PLIP</I> which appeared in issue #6 of the Linux Gazette. He has been an avid 
reader of the Linux Gazette ever since it was just starting out. And wishes

and tries to convert every MacOS/MS Windows/AMIGA user he comes into

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT ALT="" SRC="./gx/roses.gif">
Thanks to all our authors, not just the ones above, but also those who wrote
giving us their tips and tricks and making suggestions. Thanks also to our
new mirror sites. We get new ones every month. I was very excited to have
both one in Russia and the new Italian translation site go up this month.
(See the <A HREF="../mirrors.html">Mirror Page</A>.)

<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="" SRC="./gx/valheart.gif">
My two favorite holidays are Valentine's Day and Halloween. Not sure I want
to know what that little fact may have to say about my psyche. At any rate I hope
the animated heart wasn't too annoying. I thought it was quite cute. Thanks
to Michael, our web guy, for finding it and the roses to present to our authors.
<P> 
Two days after Valentine's on February 16, Riley and I will be celebrating
our 5th wedding anniversary. In fact, we're celebrating all weekend --
a long one with the holiday -- by leaving town and telling no one where we
are going. Riley is a very special guy, and we've had a great 5 years. I
look forward to many more with him.
<P> 
February 16 is also the birthday of my nephew Alex Carter. He's 14 and
working on his Black Belt in Tae Kwon Do. He's a smart kid and loves
playing on his computer. I need to find the time to introduce him to Linux.
<P> 
On a professional note, I am now Managing Editor of Linux Journal as well
as Linux Gazette. Gary Moore and I have switched jobs--keeps things from
getting boring. However, I refused to give up custody of Linux Gazette,
it's just too much fun.
<P> 
Have fun!
