<BR>From: Matthew Willis &lt;<A HREF="mailto:matt@optimus.cee.cornell.edu">matt@optimus.cee.cornell.edu&gt;</A>

<P> I like putting my monitor to sleep when I leave the computer. It uses
DPMS time out after 15 minutes, but sometimes doing it manually is
nice. The problem with doing it manually is that you can easily
"un-trigger" DPMS by accidentally hitting the mouse. In an xterm I
use this trick

<P>               sleep 1; xset dpms force standby

<P> For a fancier setup I have an icon on my KDE desktop that runs 
&lt;A HREF=misc/tips/standby.tcl.txt&gt;this tcl/tk script&lt;/A&gt; that counts down 
from 5 and then enters dpms standby mode.

<BR>From: Warren Young &lt;<A HREF="mailto:tangent@cyberport.com">tangent@cyberport.com&gt;</A>

<P> Another section in the Linux driver gap just got filled: until recently,
the only film scanners Linux supported (via SANE) were two of Nikon's
units: one is low-powered and expensive, and the other is
top-of-the-line and *extremely* expensive.  :)  So, I chose an
affordable Mintolta scanner, and had to run it under Windows.

<P> I was unimpressed with the scanning software that came with the unit. 
As it happens, Hamrick Software (www.hamrick.com) makes a shareware
package called VueScan that does a much better job than Minolta's
software.  I bought it, and then sent Ed Hamrick an email saying how
easy I thought it would be to port the package to Linux.  He didn't seem
interested, but then a month later, I happened back by his site, and
there the Linux version was!  I've been playing with it for the last few
months, and it works every bit as beautifully as the Windows version.

<P> VueScan is a bit like 4Front's OSS sound drivers: closed source, and
payware ($40 for all versions), but high-quality and indispensible if
you can't find equivalent free drivers.  The $40 actually buys you a
different package, called VuePrint, which I guess is an image catalog
and printing program, but I've never actually used it.  VueScan sort of
comes along for the price, almost like an extra, but that's the only
piece I'm interested in.  VuePrint hasn't been ported to Linux anyway.

<P> The package is also noteworthy in that Ed Hamrick really cranks out the
code: new versions sometimes appear weekly!

<P> Please give this guy some publicity.  He really deserves it.

<FONT COLOR="navy">2 cent tip: Automagic updating of RPMs
</FONT> </H3>
Thu, 16 Dec 1999 15:00:06 +0100 (CET)
<BR>From: Ove Gram Nipen &lt;<A HREF="mailto:oven@oven.dhs.org">oven@oven.dhs.org&gt;</A>

<P> If you have a permanent connection to the Internet, and are running a
linux system based on RPM packages, here's a tip on how to make sure these
are always updated. The following presumes that you run RedHat, but it can
be easily adapted to suit other RPM based distributions.

<P> USE AT OWN RISK! This tip will impose changes on your system, and if
anything goes wrong, don't say I didn't warn you. I will not be
responsible. 


<P> The following commands are to be issued as superuser (root). Change to
superuser mode by running
 	
<P> 	su -
	
<P> and entering the superuser password. 

<P> First, you find an nfs server that exports the redhat-updates directory. I
use ftp.nvg.ntnu.no, which is stationed in Norway. Mount up this server on
your local file system, by adding this (or something similar) to
/etc/fstab:

<P>         ftp.nvg.ntnu.no:/pub/ftp/pub/linux/redhat-updates /mnt/updates nfs
        defaults 0 0

<P> (all in one line). Then, make sure that the directory exists by issuing
the command

<P>  	mkdir /mnt/updates

<P> and mount it up with

<P> 	mount /mnt/updates

<P> which should yield no error messages. Hopefully. 

<P> Now we should be well connected. Check this by changing to the appropriate
directory for your system upgrades, e.g.:

<P> 	cd /mnt/updates/6.1/i386<BR>
	ls

<P> You ought to see a lot of .rpm files. The rpm program has one nifty
parameter, namely --freshen. Let's try it out.

<P> 	rpm --freshen *.rpm

<P> After a bit of waiting, your system should now be updated to the very
latest security patches and soforth. 

<P> Next, you want to schedule some sort of automagic running of the above
line. Let's try crontab. Say you want to run this update once a day,
perhaps in the middle of the night. updatedb usually runs at 4 am, so why
not run this command at 3 am? run crontab -e, and insert the following
line: (not the one starting with #, that's just a comment).

<PRE>
# Min Hr Day Month Wday Command 
  0   3  *   *     *    rpm --freshen /mnt/updates/6.1/i386/*.rpm 
</PRE>

<P> Save the file, and exit. Crontab will now be updated. 

<P> That oughta be it. Please don't mail me with questions like
"Where is the nearest nfs server carrying redhat in &lt;insert your home
country here&gt;". I really don't know. Actually, I only know of
ftp.nvg.ntnu.no. 

<P> Good luck.

<BR>From: Steven G. Johnson &lt;<A HREF="mailto:stevenj@alum.mit.edu">stevenj@alum.mit.edu&gt;</A>

<P> &gt;I usually log into my machine with SSH from home (no concole access)
&gt;and I was wondering if there is a way to have processes still running
&gt;after I log out. For instance an ftp-session loading an ISO, etc..

<P> You'll probably get a bucketful of responses, but the general way to do
this (from the shell) is:

<P> 	nohup command &gt;&amp; command.out &amp;

<P> ("nohup" means "no hang-up" and is what allows the process to keep running
after you log out, and the "&amp;" puts it in the background.)   Here,
"command" should be whatever command you want to leave running.  I've
redirected all of its output to the file "command.out"; you can omit this
and any output will be redirected by default to "nohup.out", or use
"/dev/null" to discard the output.

<P> You can't (directly) use this for something like ftp that requires
interaction.  One option would be to write an "expect" script (man expect)
to script an ftp session.  A better way, however, would be to download
something like the GNU wget program (http://sunsite.auc.dk/wget/) which
lets you fetch a URL directly from the command-line without any extra
interaction, and is useful both for scripting and for use with nohup.  (I
hope that wget will become a standard part of Linux distros.)

<P> Cordially,

I have 6-7 pcs in the office on LAN. I am on RH6.0 and the rest on W98.
I am trying to configure my pc as the email server
for this small LAN. 

I have managed to correctly setup DNS. A remote PC can resolve the DNS
server correctly. Then I went into Linuxconf and
setup the Email server portion. My Linux PC by the way is named svr and
the domain is cma.com 

We are using Netscape as the email client. I entered svr.cma.com as the
Incoming and Outgoing mail servers. Netscape
client can sent email but were unable to receive (email) with the
message: "Netscape's network connection was refused by
the server svr.cma.com The server may not be accepting connections or
may be busy. Try connecting again later." 

I did a telnet svr.cma.com 110 with a "Unable to connect to remote host"
message. But a telnet svr.cma.com 25 is
ok. That explaint why sending is OK but not receiving rite? 

How do I fix this? 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> The problem you're having is a system lacking a POP3 server. You can
easily fix this by downloading a POP3 server and install it.

I am a new Linux Red Hat 6.0 user. 

I cannot connect to the Internet (still using Winows 98). My LT Win
Modem connected to com3 is not working under Linux.
(Someone wrote that trying to config Win modems for Linux is waste of
time, is it true?) 

Connection: 8, parity - none, stopbit - 1. I told the 'modemtool' to use
to use the serial port to which my modem is
connected. I removed the word 'lock' in /etc/ppp/options file. 

I get 'modem is busy' in kppp configuration program or 'mode is locked'
errors in other programs. 

I also have a problem with SB 16 sound blaster. 'sndconfig' program
doesn't help! 

I am looking for anybody who can help me to make my modem and sound
blaster working with Linux. 

Please help!!! 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> It's true; Winmodems don't work under Linux. Winmodems are specially
designed to work with Microsoft Windows and are not supported in Linux.
The only way to get a modem to work is to buy a non-winmodem.

<P> Sir,

<P> I've seen a spurt of letters in "The Answer Guy" and elsewhere about
telnet not working with recent versions of RedHat and Mandrake.  I would
like to point out that the rpm packages have been split into two, one
for the telnet client and one for the server. When I installed Mandrake
6.1 the client package was installed but the server package wasn't.  I
guess this was done to improve security.  When someone has problems with
telneting into a 6.x RH/Mandrake linux box, they should make sure the
server package is installed! I also would like to point out that you
cannot telnet into a stock RedHat/Mandrake box as root.

<BR>From: Gerard Beekmans &lt;<A HREF="mailto:glb@dds.nl">glb@dds.nl&gt;</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 I have encountered two problems with linux (Mandrake 6.1) that I haven't
 figured out how to overcome. 
 
 The first problem is the logon speed for ftp. I have 3 desktops and a
 laptop that I have networked with 100 Mbps ethernet. 2
 of the 3 desktops are dual booted with OS/2 and linux, the remaining
 desktop and the laptop are linux only. If I try to connect
 to ftpd on linux with an ftp client on either OS/2 or linux, there is an
 approximately 3-5 minute wait before a logon prompt is
 returned. This is clearly not running properly! I can use a linux client
 to an OS/2 ftpd, and promptly get the logon prompt. I've
 tried "renice" at both -20 and +20 using KDE's task manager. What do I
 need to do to speed this up? 
 
 The second problem is: I have one machine with an 8 Gb drive partitioned
 into a 2Gb,6Gb, and 128k swap. Mandrake 6.1 is
 installed on the 2Gb partition, hda1. The 6Gb partition, hda3, is an
 ext2 partition. After linux boots, the 6Gb partition is
 mounted to /mnt/hda3. The problem that I've encountered is that when
 copying files to /mnt/hda3, it is the first partition that
 fills up, not the second. What's happening here? I was using kdisk to
 monitor the disk size when mirroring another site to
 /mnt/hda3, and it wasn't the correct partition that enlarged. After this
 occurred, totally filling the smaller partition, I could no
 longer umount the partition, either, getting a message "device is busy." 
 
 Any help to solve either of these problems?? 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Your first problem; do you get the long waits on a particulair linux box
or on all?

<P> For the second; are you sure that the 6GB partition is mounted to
/mnt/hda3 ? if not and you copy files to /mnt/hda3, it just copies
files to the 2GB partition since /mnt/hda3 is just a directory on the
2GB disk.

<P> if you run 'mount' you get a list with currently mounted file systems
(that is; if the mandrake bootscripts are proper so that mtab gets
updated as soon as the root partition is mounted in read-write mode.
Every time something gets mounted, /etc/mtab is updated, but that wont'
happen on a read-only system. So /etc/mtab could contain old
information).

<P> To make sure that the partition is actually mounted, try this command:
mount -o remount,rw /dev/hda3 /mnt/hda3

<P> Try to copy the files again and see if things go ok this time. If so,
then something goes wrong when your system tries to mount the partition
to /mnt/hda3. If so, contact me again and we'll walk through your
bootscripts to find the problem.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Hi, I've just installed Red Hat 6.0 and it's not detecting all of my
 memory. I tried typing linux memdM at the LILO prompt as
 recommended but then the boot-up fails. As it is it only detects 14M or
 so of my 64M. 
 
 I had a look in my bios, and I noticed a line saying that there is a
 memory hole at 15M. I'm guessing that this is causing Linux
 to not see memory above this, but I don't know why this "hole" is there.
 I had a look in my motherboard manual (PC Chips
 M577) but it didn't mention anything useful. This hole doesn't seem to
 upset Windows; is there anything I can do to get Linux
 to work too? 
 
 I also tried swapping my DIMMs around, thinking that if the hole was due
 to a bad DIMM it might move up to 47M (?) but it
 doesn't. 
 
 I've been searching about the web for some insight but I've had no luck
 so far. 
 
 Can you help? 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Did you disable the memory hole in your BIOS? This memory hole option is
*only* meant for PC's with 16 MB of *less* memory. If you have more than
16MB, you should disable this option. If you use the memory hole option,
the BIOS gives 15MB to your system available and reserves the memory
between 15 and 16MB for other purposes (I forgot what it was for since
it's a long time ago I've used it). Also Windows will only see 15 MB (or
14MB after you substracted the 640MB conventional memory and a little
bit that's reserved for other purposes).

<P> So do disable it and try Linux again. Trust me, you don't need the
memory option at all in your system.

 I hope this is the right address to right to with a Linux question. 
 
 I have a lot of Joliet format CD's made with DirectCD in Windows. Linux
 can read the CD's, but on files with long names
 (Over 20 characters or so) the filesize is dramatically misreported. 6-7
 meg files are listed as 2-3 meg files. Linux can't see it
 all, and this of course means the file is pretty much corrupt and of no
 use in Linux. The CD's are readable fine in Windows,
 but not Linux. I've searched high and low and can find no answer to this
 problem. I hope you can help. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Perhaps upgrading your kernel might work. The kernel contains drivers
for reading file systems like the Joliet format. You can find new kernel
sources at ftp://ftp.kernel.org/

<P> Since that above site is very busy most of the times, try
ftp://ftp.&lt;country&gt;.kernel.org/ (like ftp.ca.kernel.org in my case for
Canada).

 fsck /usr: What does this command do? What is its NT equivalent. 

 What is this command: cat /etc/passwd; and what is it's NT equivalent? 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> fsck /usr checks the file system that is mounted under the /usr
directory. The MS DOS/Windows equivalent to fsck is scandisk

<P> cat /etc/passwd writes the contents of the /etc/passwd file to standard
output. You don't *have* to specify /etc/passwd, you can use any text
file you wish (you can 'cat' binary files too but that doesn't has much
use).

<P> The MS DOS equivalent to cat is uhm there is no standard program
that does this. The closest thing in DOS is 'edit' which is a text
editor, so that is more a very very light equivalent to programs like
Vim, Emacs, Pico, Ed, etc.

<P> Anatoli,

<P> Winmodems are not supported by the Linux kernel.  Think of them as dumb modems
- Windows does all of the processing for them, unlike a normal modem which
understands Haynes commands.

<P> Fortunately, all is not lost!  Check out:

<P> They are working on a "Linmodem" driver that may eventually help solve your
problem!  By far the best solution however is to buy a proper modem!

<P> As for your sound card... a SB16 should work under Linux fine.  Have you
checked out the Sound-HOWTO (I think you'll find in in /usr/doc/HOWTO on your
RedHat box, if you installed the documentation).

<P> The "memory hole" does not mean there is anything wrong with your
physical memory. It is a BIOS setting that reserves the memory between
15 and 16 MB for use by some (especially ISA) expansion cards. Since
this is a relic from the 80286 era, you probably don't need it if your
hardware is not too old. Try disabling it in the BIOS.

<P> Booting with the "mem=..." parameter is necessary only if you have
*more* than 64 MB. The first 64 MB should always be found automatically.

Read the documentation on the CD that comes with the card (It's a PDF
file). Check if the card is set to manual configuration an then try
sndconfig again.

<P> I'm not familiar with sndconfig, but you can always recompile the
kernel so that the sound driver has the right address, IRQ and DMA
channels, or use the appropriate values as arguments to the insmod(1)
command.

 I am trying to install RH 6.0 on a Thinkpad 760ED, unfortunately the cdrom
 (Teac 44E) does not appear on the supported cdrom drives, does anyone have
 any ideas other than buying an external (supported) cdrom drive.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Is the CD-ROM not on a "supported" list, or have you tried to install
and it doesn't work?

<P> In the first case, don't worry. Most CD-ROM's are ATAPI devices these
days, and should work without a problem.

<P> In the second case, does the laptop have a network card? in that case
you can try installing over a network.

<P> More information about Linux on laptops can be found at he web-page:
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop/

<P> There are even pages specifically for the Thinkpad 760:
http://www.muc.de/~hm/linux/thinkpad.html

<P> Or for Thinkpad's in general:

 I have RedHat 6.1 installed, but need to figure out how to use the network
 printer. The network printer is shared on a NT domain which is
 available to use if I login in NT. Any tip is welcome.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Basically, you need the smbclient program, and the smbprint
shell-script. This is all covered in the SMB-HOWTO.
(/usr/doc/HOWTO/SMB-HOWTO.gz, if you've installed the HOWTO's)
