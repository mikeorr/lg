Hello, Clement!
</p>

<p>
Sorry for the late reply, but our office got redecorated with Gigabit
wiring and our backup mail servers ate some mails.

&gt; Nice article, Rene.
</pre>

<p>
Thank you!
</p>


<pre>
&gt;     I also saw apache_mod_proxy can do the reverse-proxy function. How
&gt;     is the performance  comparing  to squid proxy?  any  benchmarking
&gt;     on  this proxy  performance between these two?
</pre>

<p>
To be honest I didn't do any benchmarking in order to compare both
proxies. I usually stick to Squid because I use it for many years now
and it has a very rich configuration file with options that can do
(almost) anything you want. In my personal opinion Squid does a better
job handling memory and disk cache than Apache's mod_proxy. You can tune
the amount of memory it uses, define maximum object sizes, configure
fetching of aborted requests and the like. This is often more important
than having an extra couple of hits per second.

&gt; I'm just curious after reading your article to know which tool you used to
&gt; generate the traffic.
</pre>

<p>
We used thousands of web browser and a lot of volunteers. ;)
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Jmeter ?

<p>
No, the graphs you see in the article was actually from a production
server right in the middle of an advertising campaign (meaning lots of
images and PDFs being served). Every once in a while I look at the tools
for HTTP stress testing and benchmarking, but so far I don't like most
of the tools I investigated. I like to set up automated test scripts. I
usually do this by using Perl hacks. For a while I used Siege as a test
tool (available at <a href="http://www.joedog.org/">http://www.joedog.org/</a>). The problem is to create or
to gather suitable URLs for testing. Siege used to have a "scouting
tool" that collected "all" URLs from a site so that you could use this
data for random HTTP requests. I use my own spider and my Perl scripts
to do this. Another program I noticed is Apache's own testing tool
(<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/ab.html">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/ab.html</a>). I didn't use it yet
mainly because I lack the time to setup a test environment.
