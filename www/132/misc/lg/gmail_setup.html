<p>
Hi All,
</p>

<p>
I'm getting lots of bounce notices regarding incoming mail from gmail.
I'm baffled.  Would this be generated by <em>my</em> host?
</p>

<p>
1) I'm popping with fetchmail.
</p>

<p>
2) Due to postfix (yuck) sending mail to the bit-bucket, I've tried
bypassing it and specifying procmail as the mda in .fetchmailrc.
</p>

<p>
I don't understand why it cites failure to establish an smtp connection
with jkarns at localhost:
</p>

<p>
   TEMP_FAILURE: Could not initiate SMTP conversation with any hosts:
   [localhost (1): Connection refused]
</p>

<p>
It would make a little more sense to me to see msgs like this being
generated by postfix on my host, but don't see what POPping from gmail
should be related in any way to an smtp connection.
</p>

<p>
Any suggestions / help much appreciated.
</p>

<p>
Here's an example:

... just made a correction to .fetchmailrc's user var "smtphost".  Was
set to localhost, and it should agree with the myhostname var in
/etc/postfix/main.cf; then redirected fetchmail to postfix.
</p>

<p>
Maybe that will address the problem.

<p>
It looks like it's trying to establish a connection to a local MTA, instead of 
calling out to procmail. The .fetchmailrc (minus passwords) would be an 
important source of clues.

<p>
Right. See second comment below.
</p>

<p>
Ok, here it is
<pre>
  1  # Configuration originally created by fetchmailconf
  2  #
  3  #                            Global options
  4  set syslog
  5  set postmaster "jkarns"
  6  set no bouncemail
  7  # set no spambounce
  8  set properties ""
  9 
 10  #                            Server options
 11  skip pop.gmail.com with proto POP3 and options timeout 8
 12  #                             User options
 13        user 'johnkarns' there with password 'pw' is 'jkarns' here options fetchall
 14       ssl sslfingerprint "59:51:61:89:CD:DD:B2:35:94:BB:44:97:A0:39:D5:B4"
 15       smtphost localhost
 16       mda '/usr/bin/procmail -d %T'
</pre>
Notes:
<pre>
    - Changed line 15 to now have the same pseudo FQDN as "myhostname" in
      /etc/postfix/main.cf (since the 1st post):
 
          smtphost jkInsp8100.fakedomain.net
 
    - It ocurrs to me that lines 15 and 16 perhaps(?) should be
      mutually exclusive; i.e., smtphost should not be used when directing
      mail directly to procmail.
 
    - Current revision has line 16 commented out

Yes, I reverted to putting postfix back in the loop to try to eliminate 
the error, since the error in the bounce notices was a complaining about 
not finding an smtp connection.  I think I'll wait until after I get a 
functional &amp; stable configuration before I do any more experimenting. 
The bounce notices seem to have gone away - for the time being at least. 
The next step may be to try it without the smtphost line and reinstate 
procmail.
</p>

<p>
Since all this is on a mobile host, I'd prefer to have it set up to queue
the outgoing mail when I send mail. like back in the days when my mail was
cfg'd for a dial-up connection.  The queue was flushed after the
connection came up.  Can a nullmailer handle that scenario?  If so, that
be the preferred way to go.

Many nullmailers can; the problem, however, is defining what
"connection" means. Is it "every time you dial up"? Then your mail will
still be sitting in the queue after you've been on a high-speed Ethernet
connection for a week. Is it "once eth0 is up"? Then you'll be trying to
toss your mail into the void when you've connected to an isolated LAN,
or just peered with another machine.
</p>

<p>
Truth to tell, I don't know of a good solution to this problem; my
nullmailer, "bssmtp", simply queues the mail when I'm off-line, and I
just run 'bssmtp -q' when I connect. This is, however, a solution with
lots of problems in it. I've considered trying to flush the queue
whenever any email is sent, and I've thought about writing a script that
looks for any non-local IP (with local ones being defined by the user)
in 'netstat -nt' and running it every few minutes via 'cron'. Meanwhile,
I'm still doing it manually.

Oops, I meant to say I'd prefer to have it set up to flush the queue for

Yes, the number of factors to consider are not diminishing in our

The main problem I think might be forgetting to do the flush.  Or perhaps
being connected via a LAN / gateway which would block port 25.

<p>
Ok, that sounds interesting.  How does that nullmailer handle handshaking
problems / failure to send?  I've found that postfix, as it's installed on
my host, can be somewhat less than informative than what I had been
accustomed to via sendmail on SuSE, where problems were usually logged
<em>and</em> mailed to postmaster rather than just logged, with the mail being
sent to the bit bucket.  Although to be fair, it could have been more a
problem with fetchmail.  So failure to check the mail log frequently can
have dire consequences when using postfix, at least in it's Ubuntu stock
cfg.

&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Since all this is on a mobile host, I'd prefer to have it set up to queue
&gt; &gt;&gt; the outgoing mail when I send mail. like back in the days when my mail was
&gt; &gt;&gt; cfg'd for a dial-up connection.  The queue was flushed after the
&gt; &gt;&gt; connection came up.  Can a nullmailer handle that scenario?  If so, that
&gt; &gt;&gt; be the preferred way to go.
&gt; 
&gt; Oops, I meant to say I'd prefer to have it set up to flush the queue for 
&gt; the outgoing mail when I <strong>receive</strong> new mail, like back in the days when my 
&gt; mail was cfg'd for a dial-up connection.

Hmm, that would be interesting. Some sort of a "biff" function, perhaps?
One that's smart enough to distinguish local mail from remote?

&gt; &gt; This is, however, a solution with lots of problems in it.
&gt; 
&gt; The main problem I think might be forgetting to do the flush.  Or perhaps
&gt; being connected via a LAN / gateway which would block port 25.
</pre>
 
Actually, since one of the options of 'bssmtp' (the one that I use by
default, and the reason that I went with it instead of other
nullmailers) is to run a 'preconnect' program before attempting
delivery, the port I'm interested in - which is rarely if ever blocked -
is 22 (ssh). 25 (smtp) is rapidly becoming unavailable to
dynamic-IP/NATted hosts - arguably a good thing - and I've given up
relying on it.

Yes, the main problem is forgetting to flush the queue. I haven't yet
come up with an algorithm/heuristic for a good automatic trigger.

<pre>
&gt; &gt; I've considered trying to flush the queue
&gt; &gt; whenever any email is sent, and I've thought about writing a script that
&gt; &gt; looks for any non-local IP (with local ones being defined by the user)
&gt; &gt; in 'netstat -nt' and running it every few minutes via 'cron'. Meanwhile,
&gt; &gt; I'm still doing it manually.
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, that sounds interesting.  How does that nullmailer handle handshaking
&gt; problems / failure to send?
</pre>
</p>

<p>
All the mail is queued as soon as 'bssmtp' receives it; whatever doesn't
get successfully passed on stays in the queue. In fact, this is the only
part of 'bssmtp' that I still have to write: the "retry" section that
will warn the sender when the mail in the queue has exceeded a defined
period. Other than that, it's still a little less polished than I wish
it was, but it works just fine - I've been using it (and tweaking it)
for about a year without any problems.
