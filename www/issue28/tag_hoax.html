<h4>E-mail and Internet Hoaxes Exposed</h4>


<p><strong>From steve wornham on Mon, 30 Mar 1998 on the 
	[linuxprog] 
	<a href="http://linux-list.home.ml.org/">mailing list</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>I am not sure if this will help anyone but I recently came across 
	it.</strong> (forwarded message <a href="#below">below</a>)</p>

<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" width="50" height="28" alt="(!)"
	align="left" border="0">I hope that I'll be the only one to 
 respond to this and I hope that 
 no one, on any Linux mailing list, will forward this drivel anywhere!

<br><br>
 This appears to be yet another variation of the "Good Times" virus
 hoax.  Hopefully my response will help everyone.  Please do NOT forward
 this message (or any message) to "everyone in your address book."  
 Any mail that you receive that makes this plea should be viewed with
 extreme suspicion --- they are almost always hoaxes, spams, scams, or
 Ponzi schemes.  

<br><br>
 Most are illegal in <em>many</em> jurisdictions (internationally and 
 domestically).  Even the cases that aren't illegal are obvious abuses
 of our shared networking resources (bandwidth).

<br><br>
 I won't dignify this particular hoax with an analysis.  Suffice it 
 to say that it doesn't specify platform, agent, mechanism, or effect
 (symptoms nor "payload").

<br><br>
 For the record it <em>is</em> possible for e-mail to carry some forms of
 computer virus to <em>some</em> users.  Any WinWord .DOC file can contain
 macro virus code --- and can be attached to any e-mail (via MIME).
 However, this "virus" is only "data" to the vast majority of Linux
 users.  Even most Windows users won't be affected most of the time
 --- and all can protect themselves (simply configure your mail user
 agent to disable any "automatic document viewing" features, <em>and</em>
 disable the "auto-executing macros" of all your MS Office packages).

<br><br>
 Lest you think that MS Windows is the only platform affected by
 malicious macros that can be embedded in documents --- consider that
 some versions of the venerable '<tt>vi</tt>' and '<tt>emacs</tt>' editors 
for Unix have
 historically contained similar features (modern implementations 
 either lack them or have them disabled by default).

<br><br>
 In any event some of us in the professional virus fighting community (*)
 consider these "Good Times" messages to <em>be</em> a "social virus" 
--- one 
 that is transmitted via the gullibility and lapses in judgement by the 
 human recipients.  If you have ever forwarded copies of any such 
 warning to anyone else then <em>you</em> have been a carrier of that virus.

<br><ul>
<li>(I used to be a senior QA analyst at McAfee, before I was 
	   their senior Unix sysadmin --- one of my former roommates 
	   is still the head of their virus research department --- 
	   and I've been on the support team at Norton/Symantec where 
	   I was their lead online support rep and BBS SysOp).

</ul><br>
 Innoculate yourself!  Don't perpetuate these hoaxes!  When in doubt
 ask! (Ask <em>one</em> or <em>two</em> <strong>trusted</strong> associates).  
Don't do forward
 any message to "everyone in your address book."  Most importantly,
 don't delete unread mail simply because you think it might contain
 such a virus. (*)

<br><ul>
<li>(If you're really worried, use a simple, text viewer to 
	   look through the suspect message, or switch to an old
	   fashioned mail reader that just <em>reads mail</em> (without 
	   all the auto-execution, dynamic content flim flam)).

</ul><br>
 Incidentally, document macro content isn't the only risk of running 
 some of the modern mail user agents.  A number of GUI, MIME enhanced, 
 HTML extended MUA's will default to running JavaScript, or fetching 
 and executing byte-compiled Java code.  These should be disabled
 or limited to "trusted" domains and hosts wherever possible.  When that's
 not possible --- use a different mail reader.  Another, risk involves
 the automated fetching of HTML images.  While there is no known mechanism
 for this to execute hostile code --- it is possible for the server 
 containing such images to perform traffic analysis (finding out what
 IP address your mail gets forwarded to, and that sort of thing).  This is
 a subtle risk which is more related to privacy than to "virus.'"

<br><br>
 As a final note regarding the "Good Times" class of hoaxes --- if
 a virulent, cross-platform, e-mail transmitted, <em>computer</em> virus
 ever is created --- it is very unlikely that it would always relay with
 the same subject.  If such a virus were created it almost certainly 
 could not be detected by any feature of the message headers (there is no
 concievable reason to write such a program with any such constraint).

&gt;&gt;======== Original Message ======
&gt;&gt;     
&gt;&gt; Please be careful!!
&gt;&gt; If you receive an e-mail titled "WIN A Holiday"  Do Not open it, it 
&gt;&gt; will erase everything on your hard drive.  Forward this letter out 
&gt;&gt; to as many people as you can.  This is a new, very malicious virus 
&gt;&gt; and not many people know about it.  This information was 
&gt;&gt; announced yesterday morning from Microsoft, please share it with 
&gt;&gt; everyone in your address book.  Also, do not open or even look at 
&gt;&gt; any mail that says "Returned or unable to Deliver" this virus will 
&gt;&gt; attach itself to your computer components and render them useless.  
&gt;&gt; AOL has said that this is a very dangerous virus and that there is 
&gt;&gt; NO remedy for it at this time.
</PRE>
