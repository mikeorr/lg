<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;Each process has some form of associated Process
Identifier, (PID) through which it may be manipulated. The process also
carries the User Identifier (UID) of the person who initiated the process
and will also have group identifier (GID).</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;The UID is used to decide privilege to perform operations
on resources such as files. Processes will normally belong to one or more
process groups. A group identifier (GID) is used by the kernel to identify
privileges allocated to a group of users and hence their created processes.
Groups allow subsets of the available privileged operations (such as granting
of access to files, printers, ability to create directories) to be restricted
to members of a particular group only, with non members of the group being
excluded from performing those operations.</FONT>

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="48%"><FONT SIZE=+1>On Unix processes maintain a parent-child
relationship where the process that initiates a sub process becomes a parent
to it?s child via a fork and optional exec operation to first clone the
parent process and then replace it with a new executable process image.
Due to this relationship it is possible to terminate all child processes
by sending a KILL signal to the parent. All of the processes in the system
are accessed via a doubly linked list whose root is the init process?s
task_struct data structure.</FONT>&nbsp;

will have read and execute permissions, with other users being prevented
