<h1>Dissecting the ACPI Button Driver in Kernel 2.6</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/pramode.html">Pramode C.E.</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>
A student came and told me that his Linux system was not shutting
down automatically when the power button was pressed. It was a 
problem with ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) not 
being set up properly on his machine.  This was an opportunity to 
learn a bit about  power management and its implementation under
Linux. I was not particularly interested in the topic, but reading
a few files under drivers/acpi convinced me that I could turn this
into an interesting demonstration of how to go about reading and
deciphering kernel code.

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>
Power management is a serious issue in modern systems -
the Operating System should be able to determine things
like battery charge level, CPU temperature, etc. and take
intelligent actions. ACPI  is designed
with the objective of giving the OS as much flexibility as
possible in dealing with power management issues. This much
I was able to understand by doing a quick Google search. 
When one article mentioned that the complete ACPI spec was
well over 500 pages, I concluded that this was not my cup
of tea. I just wanted to know what the OS does to shut down
and power off my system cleanly when I press the power
button; no way I am going to read 500 pages of a 
manual to understand that.

<h2>Some Experiments</h2>
<p>
The first thing was to find out whether my kernel 
had ACPI code compiled into it. A quick
<pre>

dmesg | grep ACPI

</pre>
solved the problem - it is. As with all things
complex (say USB), it's a worthwhile guess that the
kernel might contain some `core' code to handle all
the really tough things like communicating with the
ACPI BIOS and finding out what all `events' had taken
place (pressing the power switch is one event). The
code which `reacts' to these events should be much
simpler and would mostly be written as a module. Keeping
in mind the basic Unix philosophy of pushing `policy'
as much towards the user as possible, you will guess
that this `reaction' would be mostly letting a user level
process know that something has happened. Now, how does
a device driver let a user space process know that 
something has happened? Two of the simplest ways are
using a proc file entry and using a device file - proc
file entry being the better bet. Sure enough, looking under
/proc, I saw a directory called `acpi'. 
<p>
The last link in the chain would be a user level program
which reads some file under /proc/acpi and performs some
actions based on the event information it gets from the
kernel - let's say, a program called `acpid'. A `ps ax'
showed me that such a program was running. Running an
<pre>

strace -p &lt;pid&gt;

</pre>
showed the program doing a `select' on two file descriptors
3 and 4. Killing acpid and running it once again like this:
<pre>

strace acpid

</pre>
displayed the following line as part of the output:
<pre>

open("/proc/acpi/event", O_RDONLY);

</pre>
So, that's it! Just read from /proc/acpi/event and
you will know what all power management `events'
had occurred. I killed acpid and did a
<pre>

cat /proc/acpi/event

</pre>
The process expectedly blocked. Pressing the power
button resulted in the following line getting printed:
<pre>

button/power PWRF 00000080 00000001

</pre>

The chain is almost complete. How does the core ACPI
code know that the button has been pressed? The kernel
can't keep on doing some kind of busy loop - interrupts
are the only way out. Sure enough, a `cat /proc/interrupts'
showed:
<pre>

           CPU0       CPU1       
  0:   11676819   11663518    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:       8998       7247    IO-APIC-edge  i8042
  2:          0          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  8:          1          0    IO-APIC-edge  rtc
  9:          3          1   IO-APIC-level  acpi
 12:         84          0    IO-APIC-edge  i8042
(other stuff deleted)

</pre>
Look at IRQ 9 - that's what we are interested in. Pressing
the button resulted in the interrupt count getting
incremented. 
<p>
Here is the complete chain:

<pre>

              Power Button
                   |
                   |
                 IRQ 9
                   |
                   |
             Core ACPI Code
                   |
                   |
              Button Driver
                   |
                   |
    User Program Reading /proc/acpi/event

</pre> 
               

<h2>Reading the code</h2>
<p>
A quick look under /usr/src/linux-2.6.5/drivers showed
a directory called `acpi' which has a file called
`button.c' - surely this must be the `plug-in' driver code which 
responded to button events. Another file called `event.c'
has  routines which respond to open/read requests from
user space.
<p>
A `read' request from userspace on the file /proc/acpi/events results 
in `acpi_system_read_event' getting invoked. This function in turn
invokes `acpi_bus_receive_event' which blocks if no event has been
posted by the button driver code. Events are posted by a function called
`acpi_bus_generate_event' defined in the file bus.c. 

<h2>Understanding button.c</h2>
<p>
Getting a `high-level' idea of the working of the button driver code is fairly
simple. When trying to get a grip on driver code like this, it might 
be good if you can strip off some lines so that you can better concentrate on
the essentials. The functions acpi_button_info_seq_show, acpi_button_info_open_fs,
acpi_button_state_seq_show, acpi_button_state_open_fs, acpi_button_add_fs and
acpi_button_remove_fs can be safely taken off. A few simple printk's at the
beginning of the functions which we find interesting will give us some idea
of the flow of control. Here is the first cut-down version of button.c:
<p>
<a href="misc/pramode/button1.c.txt">Listing 1</a>
<p>
Here are the things which I noticed when the module was compiled separately
and loaded into the kernel (2.6.5).
<ul>
<li>acpi_button_add was invoked twice at module load time
<li>Each time the power button was pressed, acpi_button_notify was called once
<li>acpi_button_remove was called twice at module unload time
</ul>
It's once again time to do a bit of guesswork. The acpi_button_init function
is calling acpi_bus_register_driver with the address of an object of type
`struct acpi_driver':
<pre>

static struct acpi_driver acpi_button_driver = {
	.name =		ACPI_BUTTON_DRIVER_NAME,
	.class =	ACPI_BUTTON_CLASS,
	.ids =		"ACPI_FPB,ACPI_FSB,PNP0C0D,PNP0C0C,PNP0C0E",
	.ops =		{
				.add =		acpi_button_add,
				.remove =	acpi_button_remove,
			},
};

</pre>

The guess is that acpi_button_add would be talking with the lower level
`core' code and arranging for some handler functions to be invoked when
events like  a power or sleep button activation are detected (well - lots
of vagueness here - the source code talks of a POWER and POWERF button as
well as a SLEEP and SLEEPF button. Can somebody who knows the code better
enlighten me as to what POWERF and SLEEPF are for?). As handlers are to
be invoked for multiple button types, the acpi_bus_register_driver
function would be examining the .ids field of the structure and parsing the
names in it one by one, invoking the acpi_button_add function each 
time it encounters another name (this might be a dumb guess - I haven't really looked into 
scan.c which implements the acpi_bus_register_driver function. Trouble is,
I don't understand why `add' is getting called only twice).

<p>
The next revision of button.c, I keep only one name, ACPI_FPB in the .ids
field and trim down acpi_button_add/acpi_button_remove to handle the case of only the power
button. The most important line to look for in this function is the 
invocation of acpi_install_fixed_event_handler which registers the function
acpi_button_notify_fixed as a handler to be invoked when the ACPI system
detects button activity.

<p>
<a href="misc/pramode/button2.c.txt">Listing 2</a>
<p>

The handler (acpi_button_notify_fixed) calls acpi_button_notify which in
turn calls acpi_bus_generate_event. Remember, a read on /proc/acpi/events
was blocked by acpi_bus_receive_event. The read (and the user level process)
comes out of the block when acpi_bus_generate_event is invoked!


<h2>Adding a char driver interface </h2>
<p>
Let's modify the driver so that it uses a different interface for 
communicating with userland - a simple char driver (well, this is
a rather stupid idea - but we have to make some change!). The `read'
method of the driver goes to sleep by calling `interruptible_sleep_on'
while the acpi_button_notify_fixed function wakes it up. 
<p>
<a href="misc/pramode/button3.c.txt">Listing 3</a>
<p>
Let's say the driver is allotted a major number of 254. We make a 
device file:
<pre>

mknod button c 254 0

</pre>
and try `cat button'. The reading process goes to sleep. Now, we press
the power switch and it immediately comes out of the block!

<h2>Winding up</h2>
<p>
A simple shell script (lets call it `silly_acpid')

<pre>

#!/bin/sh
cat /home/pce/button
poweroff

</pre>

Run this in the background and press the power switch - voila, the
system gets shut down and powered off automagically!

<p>
The October 2003 issue of <a href="http://www.acmqueue.com">ACM Queue</a>
 has an introductory article 
on ACPI meant for newbies; it is a good read. The Linux ACPI
project has its home page <a href="http://acpi.sourceforge.net">here</a>. The
source code of the simple `acpi daemon' program can be downloaded
from <a href="http://acpid.sourceforge.net">here</a>. The module compilation process
for the 2.6 series kernel is different from that for the 2.4
series. More information is available under 
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/kbuild/.
