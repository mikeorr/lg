  <p><strong>From Juhan Leemet </strong></p>
  <p><strong>I guess you have probably got some feedback on it already?
  </strong></p>
  <p><strong>You have a "busted link": the page refers to
"things-amplify.ogg" but the file
is actually called "things-amplified.ogg" in the directory. Minor, but
"oops!" I don't know if you can correct it on-line? What's policy on
that? </strong></p>

You know, I'll have to ask about that, but I'm pretty sure it'd be OK
to
ask for it to be fixed. Thanks for pointing it out. </blockquote>
  <blockquote>Do you mind if I forward this for possible inclusion in
our mailbag?
You've brought up quite a few interesting points, and I'm too lazy to

  <p><strong><img src="../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" alt="(?)" height="28"
 width="50" border="0">FWIW, I'm also interested in music and
recording, and have been off and on
(minus computer career interruptions!) for a long time. I used to play
rhythm
guitar, hack around on some other instruments, and got reasonably
proficient
(pickup bands, jams) on bass guitar. Now, after decades, I am
(re)learning
guitar, in a number of styles: mostly blues/rock, but I'm also
interested in
fingerstyle picking (folk, old country), but a bit intimidated of
(light)
jazz. I <em> love </em> the way those guys can "comp" and even do
solos with partial
chords. Come to think of it good rock guitarists do that, too! I found
myself
a great local guitar slinger who took me on as a student (blues/rock).
Great!
BTW, I agree with your comment on recording yourself, as a learning
aid. </strong></p>
  <blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)" height="28"

Chord fragments are an essential tool! I didn't really get any guitar
lessons -- my uncle showed me 5 chords, and how to tune the guitar, a
friend showed how to hammer on, pull off, and play a power chord, and a
trainee teacher at school showed me the minor pentatonic, and
encouraged
me to throw in chord fragments from it at will <img

 align="middle"> </blockquote>
  <blockquote>I also find recording to be useful when writing -- I've
lost count of
the amount of times a 'mistake' I didn't notice while playing became
part of the riff. </blockquote>
  <p><strong><img src="../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" alt="(?)" height="28"
 width="50" border="0">Comments on your clips: they are all really low
level: at about 1/5 scale on
my M-Audio Audiophile-24/96. I suppose I would have tried to get it up
to
about 1/2 scale myself. I compared it to a cut from my guitar teachers
CD and
that went pretty well full scale... of course, that is what mastering
(post
processing) is all about. I would have thought that you could get a bit
higher signal level, though. Depending on your sound card resolution,
you
might lose signal quality. Bits you lose, you will never get back.
OTOH, if
you clip, you can never get the original back again, either. Balancing
act. </strong></p>
  <blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)" height="28"

I thought I said this in the article, but I could be wrong -- I had an
unusually difficult time concentrating last month, and it affected the
outcome of that article. </blockquote>
  <blockquote>I was aiming mostly at the absolute beginner to recording
while writing,
which is why I included so many beginner's tips. The person I had in
mind was the person who would try to connect a cable straight from the
guitar to the sound card, and who would wonder why they were getting so
much gain when trying to record a clean sound. </blockquote>
  <blockquote>I'm writing this on my way out the door to work, but I do
remember
recommending the use of an amplifier or pre-amp. In my own tests, I was
able to record at roughly 80% input volume before getting any noticable
gain. I could (and should) have mentioned this, but as I said,
my concentration wasn't what it could be. </blockquote>
  <p><strong><img src="../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" alt="(?)" height="28"
 width="50" border="0">One "funny" thing about your examples: it seems
that the compressed clip has a
lower level than the amplified one. I'm not sure I understand why, I
thought
compression was used (with amplification?) to boost the signal and get
a more
"powerful" sound? With those really short clips it is hard for me to
tell
much difference. I cannot say I have a trained ear. I'll have to listen
more. </strong></p>
  <blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)" height="28"
 width="50" border="0"> [Jimmy]
Well, gain is usually added with compression, but the two are actually
separate. That's something else I could have been a lot more clear
about: I meant to make the point that it's a lot better to get the
recording to sound as well as possible at the time of recording, rather
than trying to rely on being able to fix it afterwards. </blockquote>
  <p><strong><img src="../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" alt="(?)" height="28"
 width="50" border="0">Headroom is one reason I chose the Audiophile
card, based on an envy-1712
chip, which can use 24-bit samples. Lots of headroom! With such a card,
one
could actually master a relatively low level signal such as yours, and
lose a
few bits from the top, but get them back when you boost up the signal,
since
you need to trim some lower bits for 16-bit CD quality anyway. I'm
happy with
that new card, even though I already had a SoundBlaster AWE64 before. </strong></p>
  <p><strong>I scanned your 2 articles again, and I see no mention of
the gear you are
using. I guess you are trying to keep the articles generic, and avoid
mentioning (pitching?) specific vendors. Good plan. However, some
details of
the kind of equipment might be useful to others, while not directly
relevant
to audacity (but I suppose it is, if you're trying to record with it?).
  </strong></p>
  <p><strong>I guess that is an acoustic guitar you are using?
Is it electric-acoustic (plugged in?) or plain (mic'ed?)?
Do you use an outboard mixer or preamp?
Most seem to like an outboard mixer/preamp (better quality, less
noise)?
Some of those questions would be particularly important for electric
guitar.
You might also mention something about headroom and sound quality. </strong></p>
  <blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)" height="28"

I was using a Washburn Dime333: electric, with a floating bridge (which
is why I had the paragraph about tuning -- that was cut down from a
lengthy rant about the pains of trying to tune a guitar with a floating
bridge <img src="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" alt=":)" height="24"
 width="20" align="middle">. I did mention that I had plugged the
guitar straight into the
sound card, and that it would be much better to use an amp or pre-amp.
In future, that's what I'll be doing, and I'll be sure to mention what
I'm using. </blockquote>
  <blockquote>I have no idea what my sound card is though -- all I know
is that it's
cheap and nasty. I'm looking at getting a proper sound card some time
in
the near future, but for the time being I'll just be recording using a
dedicated recorder, and using Audacity to reassemble and mix the
tracks. </blockquote>
  <p><strong><img src="../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" alt="(?)" height="28"
 width="50" border="0">This might fall outside the scope of your
articles, but a problem I have seen
bounced around in various newsgroups and mailing lists is how to add
drums/percussion to a recording after the fact, i.e. sync them up. That
appears to be a tough problem, and we may not yet have the tools to do
it,
with Audacity at least. I have played with Hydrogen, the programmable
software drum machine. I am very impressed with its capabilities, and
I'm
only learning how to use it (not a drummer). However, I don't know how
to get
timing information out of Audacity (I don't think you can yet?) and use
it to
drive hydrogen "in step" with other prerecorded stuff. I imagine that
trying
to match the start and beat manually would be almost impossible?
Putting the
drum track down first would work, but (unless you are a drummer?) that
would
be really hard to do. I don't think I could. Studios use click tracks? </strong></p>
  <blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)" height="28"
 width="50" border="0"> [Jimmy]
That does fall outside the scope of my articles, but into the scope of
a
future article. </blockquote>
  <blockquote>A click track is just a simple drum track -- snare only
-- to be used in
place of a metronome. It'd be boring if every song kept to the same
tempo the whole way through, but for tempo changes a metronome is
useless, so you create a click track instead. Audacity is able to use
MIDI files, so the best approach is to create a click track in advance,
then use that as the basis for the drum track on the drum
machine/synthesiser program -- it cuts out all of the problems (I was
going to recommend the use of the metronome in Audacity, but couldn't
in
good conscience do so, because a) I've never used a metronome, and b)
Audacity's metronome annoys me <img src="../gx/dennis/smily.gif"

  <p><strong><img src="../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" alt="(?)" height="28"
 width="50" border="0">FWIW, one of the things I have wanted to do, to
really learn some songs
(thoroughly) is to use the original as a "backing track" (apologies to
Ashlee
Simpson who might have it "patented", ha! just poking fun!). Then layer
on my
own interpretations of different parts, until I have enough for my own
reference tracks, and then drop out the original, and continue
layering.
Audacity can do the layering OK, but how to get that drum machine
synced up
and recorded in there? I've heard rumours that Ardour can do it. True? </strong></p>
  <blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)" height="28"
 width="50" border="0"> [Jimmy]
Audacity isn't able to do it yet (at least, not in the version I have
installed), but it's something the developers are looking at. Ardour,
AFAICT, can do it, but it's overkill for my current needs, so I haven't
looked at it in depth. </blockquote>
  <p><strong><img src="../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" alt="(?)" height="28"

  <p><strong><img src="../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" alt="(?)" height="28"
 width="50" border="0">BTW, is there a good Linux guitar tablature
editor, like PowerTab on Windows?
Haven't experimented much with lilypond or noteedit, but my impression
was
that they were mainly/mostly for (orchestral?) scores. Can they do tab?
  </strong></p>
  <blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)" height="28"
 width="50" border="0"> [Jimmy]
I like Songwrite, and my first two 'Songs in the Key of Tux' articles
were written about it. It's not as powerful as PowerTab, but I haven't
seen any other tablature programs on Windows that are as powerful as
it,
either. One particular feature that I've never seen elsewhere is the
ability to represent harmonics other than the 'standard harmonics'
(over
the 5th, 7th, and 12th frets) or tapped harmonics. </blockquote>
  <blockquote>Lilypond can do tab, and, in fact, Songwrite uses it as a
print backend.
I recall seeing that noteedit took code from KGuitar to represent
chords, but your assumption is correct, both of these programs are
primarily intended for creating staff notation, and neither are
particularly good at representing tab. </blockquote>
  <blockquote>Tablature is something I think I'll have to revisit,
because recently I
went through an acoustic phase (I don't understand it, really, because
I
listen to and play mostly metal) and found I had to use two different
programs to represent my tablature: Songwrite, to get the correct note
durations with it's MIDI playback; GTablature
(<a href="http://www.solutionm.com/gnometab/gnometab.html">http://www.solutionm.com/gnometab/gnometab.html</a>)
to get a nicer print
version. </blockquote>
  <blockquote>BTW, there's a set of tools for converting PowerTab files
to Linux
friendly formats: <a href="http://jelmer.vernstok.nl/oss/ptabtools">http://jelmer.vernstok.nl/oss/ptabtools</a>
(which I see now supports GuitarPro files). </blockquote>
  <p><strong><img src="../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" alt="(?)" height="28"
 width="50" border="0">Also, I recently heard "the amazing SlowDowner"
on my guitar teachers PC
running Windows. It seems to have much better sound quality than the
SndStretch sound stretcher plugin for XMMS. That XMMS plugin seems to
create
a lot of artificial echo/reverberation, which gets worse as you slow
down
more. Must be something to do with the (resampling?) technique? Do you
know
of any other/better playback software that can slow down the recording,
without changing the pitch, obviously? Any advice (article?)
appreciated. </strong></p>
  <blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)" height="28"

Damn. I had something I was pretty happy with, but hadn't used it in
quite a while (<a href="http://mysongbook.com">http://mysongbook.com</a>
has some very high quality tabs in
GuitarPro format, which (for the most part) render well in Songwrite)
and forgot about it when I switched to Gentoo a few weeks ago. I'll
make
sure to let you know what it is if/when I find it again. </blockquote>
