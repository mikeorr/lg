<h3><a NAME="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
PostgreSQL has come a long way with version 7.1. I have been waiting
for better handling of large objects. In earlier versions, there was the
size limit of 32k for a field in a table. Otherwise, you had to use
a cumbersome way of manipulating large objects. 
<p>
I finally decided to get Perl installed into PostgreSQL because PostgreSQL
has all the features I like : 
<ol>
<li> A real language for stored procedures (PL/pgSQL). </li>
<li> Nice handling of large objects.</li>
<li> Embedded Perl commands.</li>
<li> Is similar to Oracle in many ways, thus making the transition from Oracle
  to PostgreSQL or vice versa reasonable. 
<li> Has many advanced features that I desire with a database server. 
<li> Has a free web book. I am big on free documentation.</li>
</ol> 

<p>
The overall process was a pain because of slight adjustments here and
there. 
. Here are the basic steps:
<ol>
<li> Install Perl 5.6.1. Use all the default options except for two changes.
</li>
<li> Install PostgreSQL after you install Perl. </li>
<li> Install Perl into PostgreSQL, and make one fix. </li>
</ol>


<h3><a NAME="perl"></a>Downloading and installing Perl.</h3>
Make sure you install Perl before you install PostgreSQL. 
I don't know if the latest versions of RedHat 7.1 or Debian
have libperl as a shared module. 
<pre>
cd /usr/local/src
lynx --source http://www.tcu-inc.com/perl5.6.1.tgz &gt; perl-5.6.1.tgz
tar -zxvf perl-5.6.1.tgz
cd perl-5.6.1
rm -f config.sh Policy.sh
sh Configure
</pre>

Change the default prefix to "/usr" instead of "/usr/local". 
Also, when it asks the question "Build a shared libperl.so (y/n) [n] ", 
answer y. Press enter for any other question.

<pre>
make
make install
</pre>

<h3><a name="pg">Downloading and Installing PostgreSQL with Perl.</h3>
When I downloaded PostgreSQL, I also tried to install interfaces for 
tcl, c, python, and
obdc. I haven't tried JAVA, but it is an option. Also, if you are
going to use Perl with PostgreSQL, I recommend downloading 
and installing DBI and DBD:Pg from
cpan.perl.com.
<p>
Tcl and Perl are options in the procedural languages. You can actually execute
Perl and Tcl inside sql commands. Also, you get the standard PL/pgSQL
procedural language (which is similar to pl/sql). 

Here are the steps I used to install PostgreSQL with Perl. 
Here is a 
<a href="misc/nielsen/Compile.bat.txt">
text file with the same information</a>.

<pre>

### First of all, you have to compile Perl as a dynamic module. 
### If you haven't done this, you should be able to install postgresql,
### but it won't have the plperl interface. 

cd /usr/local/src
lynx --source ftp://postgresql.readysetnet.com/pub/postgresql/v7.1.1/postgresql-7.1.1.tar.gz &gt; postgresql-7.1.1.tar.gz
tar -zxvf postgresql-7.1.1.tar.gz
cd postgresql-7.1.1

### We need to set some environment variables -- which should be put
#### into ~/.profile for the user postgres for the future. 

PATH=/usr/local/pg711/bin:$PATH
export PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/pg711/lib
export PGDATA=/usr/local/pg711/data
export PGLIB=/usr/local/pg711/lib
export POSTGRES_HOME=/usr/local/pg711

  ### This script is setup to delete any previous installation. 
  ### I did this so that I could debug it if it didn't work the first time.

  #### Ignore any error message saying the database server is not running. You 
  ### probably don't have one running.
su -c '/usr/local/pg711/bin/initdb -D /usr/local/pg711/data -l logfile stop' postgres
  ### Ignore any error message saying this user exists.
adduser postgres
rm -rvf /usr/local/pg711

  ### Now let us make the destination directory have postgres own it. 
mkdir /usr/local/pg711 
chown postgres /usr/local/pg711

  ### Ignore any make clean errors here. 
make clean
  ### Compile and install postgresql.
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/pg711 --with-perl --with-tcl --with-CXX --with-python --enable-odbc 
make
make install

  ### Now we need to install the perl interface for postgresql.
gmake -C src/interfaces/perl5 install
cd /usr/local/src/postgresql-7.1.1/src/interfaces/perl5
perl Makefile.PL
make 
  ### Uncomment the next line if you want to test it. 
##  su -c 'make test' postgres
make install

  ### Change ownership of all files to the user postgres.
chown -R postgres /usr/local/pg711

  ### Initialize the database. 
su -c '/usr/local/pg711/bin/initdb -D /usr/local/pg711/data' postgres

  ### Start the database server. 
su -c '/usr/local/pg711/bin/pg_ctl -D /usr/local/pg711/data -l logfile start' postgres

  ### The interfaces for perl, tcl, and pl/pgsql should have been created. 
  ### Now add them. 
  
su -c 'createlang plpgsql template1' postgres
su -c 'createlang pltcl template1' postgres

### Now assuming you have perl 5.6.1 installed correctly.
rm -f /usr/local/pg711/lib/libperl.so
ln -s /usr/lib/perl5/5.6.1/i686-linux/CORE/libperl.so \
  /usr/local/pg711/lib/libperl.so
su -c 'createlang plperl template1' postgres

  ### If it worked out correctly, any new database will copy itself from 
  ### template1 and have perl, tcl, and pl/pgsql. 

  ### Now additional stuff.
su -c 'createdb postgres' postgres

</pre>

In the home directory of the user postgres, make a file called ".profile" and put this in it. 
<pre>
#!/usr/bin

PATH=/usr/local/pg711/bin:$PATH
export PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/pg711/lib
export PGDATA=/usr/local/pg711/data
export PGLIB=/usr/local/pg711/lib
export POSTGRES_HOME=/usr/local/pg711
</pre>

Then, execute this command, 
<pre>
chmod 755 .profile
</pre>

<h3><a NAME="example"></a>Example perl/sql commands.</h3>
Execute the commands at, 
<a href="http://www.ca.postgresql.org/users-lounge/docs/7.1/programmer/plperl-use.html">
http://www.ca.postgresql.org/users-lounge/docs/7.1/programmer/plperl-use.html
</a>
<p>
Since I had you create the database "postgres", all you have to do is enter
these two commands starting as the user "root" to get into the psql interface. 
<pre>
su -l postgres
psql
</pre>
This assumes you also
correctly setup .profile for the user postgres. If you didn't, then follow
these commands:
<pre>
su -l postgres
PATH=/usr/local/pg711/bin:$PATH
export PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/pg711/lib
export PGDATA=/usr/local/pg711/data
export PGLIB=/usr/local/pg711/lib
export POSTGRES_HOME=/usr/local/pg711
psql
</pre>

<p>

The following function lets you search the data and return a copy of 
the name if the name contains the text you search for with a case
insensitive option.

<pre>
drop function search_name(employee,text,integer);
CREATE FUNCTION search_name(employee,text,integer) RETURNS text AS '
    my $emp = shift;
    my $Text = shift;
    my $Case = shift;

    if (($Case > 0) && ($emp->{''name''} =~ /\\Q$Text\\E/i)) 
      { return $emp->{''name''}; }
    elsif ($Case > 0) {return "";}
    elsif ($emp->{''name''} =~ /\\Q$Text\\E/) 
       {    return $emp->{''name''}; }
    else { return "";}
' LANGUAGE 'plperl';

insert into EMPLOYEE values ('John Doe',10000,1);
insert into EMPLOYEE values ('Jane Doe',10000,1);
insert into EMPLOYEE values ('Giny Majiny',10000,1);

select name,search_name(employee,'j',0) from employee;
select name,search_name(employee,'j',1) from employee;

select name from employee where search_name(employee,'j',1) = name;
select name from employee where search_name(employee,'j',0) = name;
</pre>

Obviously, the function is a little ridiculous. It should just return
0 for false or 1 for true. But for visual reasons, I have it return
a copy of name. 

<h3><a NAME="set"></a>Setting up the tables and pl/perl procedures
for the Insert, Update, and Delete pl/pgsql procedures</h3>
You can get a copy of the SQL commands for this section here:
<a href="misc/nielsen/SQL_setup.txt">SQL_setup.txt</a>.

There are several things I want to accomplish:
<ol>
<li> Create insert, update, and delete stored procedures that will
  backup all changes to a history table or backup table. This will record
  everything that happens. Reasonable error checking is required. We could
  do more error checking, but the stored procedures I created would just
  get too big. 
<li>To use a Perl procedures to clean out input being put into the tables. 
  Granted, we could use sql commands, but the perl commands are so much
  easier for me to read. 
</ol>

I do not believe it is possible to get the perl procedures to execute
insert, update, delete, or select commands. The only thing that I have
gotten Perl to do is accept values and to output a single value. You should
never need Perl to execute sql anyways. You aren't using Perl to execute 
commands, but to modify data, act as a filter, or check for errors. Use 
pl/pgsql to handle all the sql commands. Just use Perl to manipulate
data and not directly do anything to the database. 
<p>
Below, I have three tables: jobs, jobs_backup, and contact. I will
only create stored procedures for the table 'jobs'.
The two perl procedures are only meant to verify that we have valid
data to input, and to filter out non-printable characters, and get rid of
whitespace. We use pl/pgsql to perform the actual insert, update, and
delete commands. 
<p>
Using this basic method of handling data, you can replicate it for any
other table you have.  
<p>
Some things I have to watch out for is the fact I want unique names for 
the jobs. I don't want two jobs to have the same name from one recruiter. 
This gets a little tricky, but it works fine.  
<p>
Also, I could use a foriegn key restraint so that you cannot have a contact_id
in 'jobs' without it existing in 'contact'. The only problem is, 
we may at some point accidentally delete contact_ids from contact and then
things are messed up anyways. The best solution is to add a "active" column
to the "jobs" and "contact" tables in which you turn off and on objects. 
In this way, you never delete unique ids ever. 
<pre>
 --- Create the jobs table. 
 --- a good suggestion would be to have a foriegn key constraint
 --- with the table contact.
create sequence Job_Sequence;
drop table jobs;
create table jobs (
job_id int4 unique DEFAULT nextval('Job_Sequence'),
contact_id int4,
job_no int4,
job_name  text,
job_location text 
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX job_index ON jobs (job_name, contact_id);

-- This is a real backup table. 
-- Everytime a changes occur, insert it into this table. 
-- This isn't just for deletes, but for inserts and updates. 
-- This becomes a history table, not just a backup.
-- We even record the final output. 
create sequence Backup_Job_Sequence;
drop table jobs_backup;
create table jobs_backup (
backup_id int4 unique DEFAULT nextval('Backup_Job_Sequence'),
action text CHECK (action in ('insert','update','delete','')),
error_code int4,
job_id int4,
contact_id int4,
job_no int4,
job_name  text,
job_location text
);

create sequence Contact_Sequence;
drop table contact;
create table contact (
contact_id int4  UNIQUE DEFAULT nextval('Contact_Sequence'),
name text unique,
phone text,
website text
);

 --- Insert two values for contacts.
 --- I am not making stored procedures for this table, just jobs. 
insert into contact (name,phone,website) 
  values ('Mark Nielsen','(408) 891-6485','http://www.gnujobs.com');
insert into contact (name,phone,website)
  values ('Joe Shmoe','(1234) 111-1111','http://www.gnujobs.net');
insert into contact (name,phone,website)
  values ('Lolix.org','(12345) 111-1111','http://www.lolix.org');


 --- Select info from contact to see if it is there.
select * from contact;

 --- Let use create perl function (which is probably not needed)
 --- which will verify if inputted data in not blank. 

drop function job_values_verify (int4,text,text);
CREATE FUNCTION  job_values_verify (int4,text,text) RETURNS int4 AS '
    my $Contact_Id = shift;
    my $Job_Name = shift;

    if (!($Job_Description =~ /[a-z0-9]/i)) {$Error = -102;}
  return $Error;
' LANGUAGE 'plperl';

drop function clean_text (text);

    # Get rid of whitespace at end.

Installing perl 5.6.1 may break modules you were previously using with
a different version of Perl. I don't know, but be careful. You may have
to recompile modules. 
<p>
Here is a summary of the things you should consider:
<ol>
<li> Create a foriegn key constraint so that the contact_id of the jobs
  has to exist in the contact table. 
<li> Never delete a row in the tables 'contact' and 'job'.
 Instead, add a column to just inactivate them. Set the name of the
 column to be 'active' where 0 means inactive and 1 means active. 
<li> You can combine insert/update procedures into one procedure. 
  If your data is always 100% accurate, then always issue the update
  procedure, and if the update procedure doesn't find the job, it just
  inserts it for you. Under some conditions, this can be useful. 
<li> Anytime you can ad a check for an error, do it. Although my error
   checks are reasonable, more can be done. 
<li> Forget using Perl procedures to execute direct sql commands. Just use
  them to manipulate data. 
<li> Use pl/pgsql to combine perl procedures with sql commands. 
<li> You should setup the procedures to rollback in case an insert, update, 
  or delete couldn't work for some unknown reason.   
<li> I don't know how much memory is used up with perl procedures and I 
don't know how memory gets freed up when a perl procedure is done
executing. Also, I don't know the overhead of executing perl procedures. 
For my purposes, pl/pgsql procedures are always going to be faster than
manually executing sql commands using Perl scripts on the webserver side. 
Since I am headed in the right direction anyways, I am willing to live
with any overhead there is with the perl procedures. Besides, I can probably
take very complex sql commands and shrink them down into a few lines of Perl
code. If I balance out the proper use of pl/pgsql, standard sql, and
pl/perl, I see significant power gain and little drawbacks. 
</ol>

<h3><a NAME="stupid"></a>Freeing up permissions in Perl</h3>
What I am about do to is very bad. It relaxes some of the security
issues in Perl so that you can do more stuff. 
<p>
First, of all, add this method right below the "permit" method in Safe.pm. 
My Safe.pm was at /usr/local/src/perl-5.6.1/lib/Safe.pm. Changing
a module that you did not create means that if you ever update this module,
the changes will get wiped. Once more, you MIGHT MESS UP THE PROGRAMMING
FROM ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS WHO IS PROGRAMMING ON THAT COMPUTER AS WELL. Again,
I am doing some naughty things you should not do. 

<pre>
sub permit_all {
    my $obj = shift;
    $obj->{Mask} = invert_opset full_opset;
}
</pre>
Second, shut down your database server. 
<p>
Third, recompile plperl with some changes. 
<p>
Make these changes in the file plperl.c.
From this
<pre>

                "require Safe; SPI::bootstrap();"
                "sub ::mksafefunc { my $x = new Safe; $x-&gt;permit_only(':default');$x-&gt;permit(':base_math');"
                "$x-&gt;share(qw[&amp;elog &amp;DEBUG &amp;NOTICE &amp;NOIND &amp;ERROR]);"
                " return $x-&gt;reval(qq[sub { $_[0] }]); }"

</pre>
To This (which you can get from this file <a href="misc/nielsen/New_plperl.txt">
New_plperl.txt</a>)
<pre>

                "require Safe; SPI::bootstrap();"
                "sub ::mksafefunc { my $x = new Safe; $x-&gt;permit_only(':default');$x-&gt;permit(':base_math');"
 "$x-&gt;permit_all('');"
                "$x-&gt;share(qw[&amp;elog &amp;DEBUG &amp;NOTICE &amp;NOIND &amp;ERROR]);"
                " return $x-&gt;reval(qq[sub { $_[0] }]); }"

</pre>

Now recompile plperl and install it. 
<pre>
cd /usr/local/src/postgresql-7.1.1/src/pl/plperl
rm -f *.o
make 
make install
</pre>

Fourth, restart the postgresql database server. 
<p>

<p>
See if you can escape to a shell,
<pre>
drop function ls_bad ();
CREATE FUNCTION  ls_bad () RETURNS text AS '
my @Temp = `ls /tmp`;
my $List = "@Temp";
$List =~ s/\n/ /g;
  return $List;
' LANGUAGE 'plperl';
select ls_bad();
</pre>

If you get the contents of your "/tmp" directory, then you can escape to a shell just fine. This is very dangerous. 
<p>
For a whole day, I was trying to figure out how to get DynaLoader to work
in pl/perl. Basically, I read documentation about how to embed Perl in C,
and it isn't that hard to do. There is even a manpage about it. I kept on
running into problems. Lastly, I tried to not use the Safe.pm module 
altogether, but I didn't get very far. I was so close to compiling Dynaloader
into plperl, but I gave up. After blowing off a day, I want someone else to
give it a try. 
<p>
If you can get DynaLoader to work properly with plperl, or more accurately,
you find a way to make it so I can load any module I want with plperl, then
please let me know. I got to the point where I could load pure pm modules, but
not modules which had c components. I would like to be able to load any module
whatsoever. I believe we have to stop using Safe.pm to make it easier. Please
send email to <a href="mailto:articles@gnujobs.com">articles@gnujobs.com</a>.
I would be very interested if you succeed!

<p>
Please don't do this. I only wanted to show you how you can get
around security issues if you really wanted to.

<h3><a NAME="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3>
Combining Perl with PL/PGSQL is a REALLY REALLY COOL thing. Why?
<ol>
<li> I like use Perl (or any other language -- should someone make a 
 Python interface?) to manipulate the data because SQL is such a pain
 the in butt sometimes (in manipulating data). 
<li> The combination of Perl and PL/PGSQL can make it so most of the
  work is done on the database end, which means, you can do less
  programming on the client end. For example, let us say you have a
  webserver that connects to a database server. If the database server
  is handling a lot of the perl work, your perl scripts on the webserver
  won't be as big. This is true for stored procedures in general 
  anyways. Is isn't a lot nicer to execute one stored procedure than to
  have Perl scripts on the webserver side executing all those steps (that the
  procedure does for you)?
<li> If you can do all the fancy perl programming on the database end, 
 then you will have less work with any language
  that you choose to connect to your database server. Thus, your stored
  procedures become objects that your web programmers just have to 
understand how to use, but not understand how they were made. This is
very nice.  
<li> I am going to slowly use more perl procedures (where appropriate)
and test the stability of pl/perl.  
<li> I would like to be able to load any module into plperl just for giggles.
If you find out how to do with, please send me email at
<a href="mailto:articles@gnujobs.com">articles@gnujobs.com</a>.

PostgreSQL is by far the coolest database server I have ever worked with. 
MySQL comes a close second. I never really enjoyed working on any
commercial database server. I see so much more potential with
PostgreSQL, that I actually see commercial database servers following
some of the things PostgreSQL will do. I am very eager to see if someone
would develop a Python interface to create Python procedures. Chapter 20
of the latest "Programming Python" book (ISBN: 0-596-00085-5) 
talks about embedding Python into C. When I have the spare time, like next
year, I might give it a try, unless someone beats me to the punch!  
I believe the ability to have procedures written in different programming
languages will become very valuable 
in the future. I am also eager to see if we can get procedures to return
more than just one value. It is very annoying that we can only return
one value. 
I tried to define a function with more than one return value, and it didn't
work. 
I tried to get a procedure to return a RECORD, but I didn't get
very far.
