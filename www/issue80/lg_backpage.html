<P> I installed <A HREF="http://www.spamassassin.org/">SpamAssassin</A> (SA)
and instantly developed a new pastime.  Even funnier than reading spam is
reading what SA has to say about it.  SA is a filter daemon (or standalone
program) that reads an e-mail message and analyzes it for spam, adding a 
couple headers to give its verdict.  If it thinks the message is spam, it also
puts a "***SPAM***" prefix in the Subject: and adds some structured comments to
the body saying what's suspicious about the message.  Those comments in the
body are where the funny parts are.  SA is so amusing that I've given up my
two other recent pastimes: collecting Klez worms and Nigeria scams.  I just
/dev/null the Klez worms now.

Subject: Request Review for Advanced PDF Password Recovery Pro 2.0

Dear Webmaster

Our company, ElcomSoft Co. Ltd., would like to announce the release of Advanced 
PDF Password Recovery Pro 2.0 for Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP. We hope you will 
consider reviewing Advanced PDF Password Recovery Pro (APDFPR) for Linux Gazette. 
Should you need a full version for review, please contact me at info@elcomsoft.com. 
Please find the press release of Advanced PDF Password Recovery Pro below for 
your information.

Warmest Regards,

Dmitry Harchenko 
Marketing Manager 
ElcomSoft Co. Ltd.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - May 17, 2002 
   
ElcomSoft Releases Advanced PDF Password Recovery Pro 2.0 for Windows 9x/ME/NT/2000/XP 
Gain Control of PDF Files 

Moscow, Russia - ElcomSoft Co. Ltd. has released Advanced PDF Password Recovery 
(Professional) 2.0 for Windows ME/98/95/NT4/2000/XP. This program makes it easy 
to remove both password encryption and usage restrictions from Adobe Acrobat 
PDF files. APDFPR now comes with multiprocessor support, guaranteed recovery 
and state-of-the-art optimization for modern processors.

With the increasing popularity of PDF formatted file, comes increasing number 
of problems which occur when authors forget the passwords to their source documents. 
ElcomSoft has revised version 2.0 of its Advanced PDF Password Recovery (Professional) 
software to allow the seemingly impossible recovery of password for these documents. 
This software package handles both owner and user passwords used to protect PDF 
documents. The latest addition to ElcomSoft's family of password recovery software 
allows business managers to recover lost and destroyed passwords. It also helps 
in dealing with employees who, intentionally or unintentionally, are unable to 
edit and print password-protected PDF files. 

Finally, APDFPR is also a state-of-the-art computer forensics tool that could 
be used by law enforcement, military and intelligence agencies to open secure 
documents. PDF documents protected with access restrictions password can be decrypted 
instantly, allowing full access to the document. For documents with "user" passwords 
(that could not be opened without that password), the program blazes through 
brute-force password attempts at a rate of a few hundred thousand passwords per 
seconds! The code has been effectively optimized for most CPUs such as Celeron, 
Pentium II, Pentium III, Duron and Athlon. More sophisticated methods are available, 
such as applying all words from a dictionary. ElcomSoft's website has dictionaries 
for more than 20 different languages, from English to African.

Even if the above methods fail because the password is too long and complex, 
the program runs a special key search attack which gives a 100% success rate 
on files with 40-bit encryption (used in all Adobe Acrobat 4 and most Acrobat 
5 files). This may take some time to run, but is well worth the time if your 
document is very important. If you have a dual processor system, APDFPR takes 
advantage of it to double the performance of this software. On modern systems 
with Athlon MP CPUs, the document can be recovered in maximum 4 days, regardless 
of the password length and complexity!


System Requirements 
Win 95/98/Me/NT/2000/XP, 600K free on Hard Disk. 

Price 
Standard Edition costs $30, Professional Edition costs $60; free trial version
