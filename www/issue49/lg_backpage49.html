<P> Gerard is the founder of TTS Solutions. TTS' aim is to provide a wide range
of services to the Linux community, for free. This free help is based on the
philosophy that we know what it feels like to be in need of help and answers
and not able to find them. Or one does find somebody and that person is willing
to help...for a price.

<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Bill Bennet</H4>

<P> Bill, the ComputerHelperGuy, lives in Selkirk, Manitoba, Canada; the
"Catfish Capitol of North America" if not the world. He is on the Internet at
<A HREF=http://www.chguy.net>www.chguy.net</A>. He tells us "I have been a PC
user since 1983 when I got my start as a Radio Shack manager. After five years
in the trenches, I went into business for myself. Now happily divorced from
reality, I live next to my Linux box and sell and support GPL distributions of
all major Linux flavours. I was a beta tester for the PC version of Playmaker
Football and I play `pentium-required' games on the i486. I want to help Linux
become a great success in the gaming world, since that will be how Linux will
take over the desktop from DOS." It is hard to believe that his five years of
university was only good for fostering creative writing skills.

<IMG ALT="[ Penguin reading the Linux Gazette ]"
	SRC=../gx/lg-penguin.gif ALIGN=right>

<P> This was quite an eventful month for me.  It started with the WTO week,
then I got sick, then I started a big web project at work, then I had a
couple personal issues, then Christmas (I made my mom curry).  And now 
(Dec. 28) it's three days to New Year's, when the Millenium Bug will or
will not cause problems, and terrorists will or will not attack, but I will
definitely be out with me mates celebrating.  New Year's festivities at Seattle
Center were cancelled today; no doubt the mayor didn't want to think about
having two disasters in one month.

<P> Meanwhile, the <I>Linux Gazette</I> letter of the month arrived:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I'm very pleased to contact with Red Hat.
I would like to ask you a faver.
Please let me know the e-mail address of the "STOCK MANAGER".
I have several questions for your stock and the business progress state with
Korea.
I'm looking forward to your quick response.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> I wrote back saying, 
"Hi.  The Linux Gazette is not related to Red Hat.  Please contact
Red Hat directly via their web site, www.redhat.com."


<P> -Mike Orr
