Sir,
    I have just read your articles. It is really
interesting and that's why i dare to send you this
email. Sir, can you tell me any way to enter(hack)
into slackware linux (through any program or
shellscript whatever).
Sir, I am eagerly waiting for your reply. Please send
me the reply as quick as possible.

Hi, you've reached the Linux Gazette Answer Gang....
   Linux ::::::::: a modern operating system not much like any of:
               --- DOS -- Windows -- Solaris -- MacOS -- alien starships ---
               ... except occasionally, an ability to run on the same hardware.
   Gazette ::::::: published more regularly than "almanac."  In our case:

<P> On several occasions I've read mention of the unix philosophy where each
program concentrates on doing a few things and doing them well.  Thus
MTA's don't generally handle POP'ing, etc.  The example given of Eudora,
Netscape and Outlook are phenomena of a different OS.  In the case of
Netscape, its roots were closely tied to unix, but most of the development
was targeted for users of the other OS - and its unfortunate that some of
the ISP's are designing their configurations assuming that virtuall all
subscribers will be using that platform.

<P>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

<P> And don't forget how much Netscape Mail changed the landscape.  Prior to
Netscape, most Unix people read mail from shell accounts, and the local
machine had its own sendmail.  Windows users depended on mail gateways
between Internet and their Novell/Windows/Vines/whatever network, so they
as users never had to configure anything.  Of course, there were a few 
POP users here and there, but relatively few.  Then Netscape Mail 
appeared, and suddenly ISPs and LANs were faced with large numbers of
e-mailing users on Windows boxen that didn't have their own mail transport
agent, so they had to rely on an upstream POP/SMTP server.  Nowadays, it's
just assumed that most users will connect this way.  (Well, *most* users
use Hotmail or one of the other webmail services....)

<P> There's a fascinating book <EM>Digitopia</EM> that talks about how
computerization has changed our society a lot more than people realize, because
of the human mind's tendency to adapt to new situations and forget how things
used to be.  The author points out that each time a new Playstation or software
update comes out, people get excited and then bored, but they forget that the
new version is causing the same about of excitement and boredom as the previous
version did.  We think about Netscape 2 now and wonder how people could have
been excited about such a crappy application, but that's because we're
forgetting what the situation was like then.

<STRONG>
Do both sides of a VPN [Virtual Private Network] need special hardware to make
a secure connection or can one side have nothing but an internet connection and
the other side handle all the VPN stuff?

<P> I know this is going to come across as a flame; but I have
to observe that this question is so clueless that I'm truly
befuddled as to what sort of muddled thought process could
lead to this question.

<P> The basic question, "do both sides of a VPN need special hardware?",
is flawed.  Neither side of a VPN needs special *hardware*.  
Both sides of a VPN connection need "special" (and interoperable)
hardware *or* software.

<P> The remainder of the question is the muddled part: "... can one
side have nothing but an internet connection".

<P> That's almost like asking,  "Do both ends of a phone conversation
need to have phones, or can one end do all the phone stuff and
on the other end have nothing but a wire?"

<P> It didn't help that Ricochet went down,
and that my boat was hauled out in an area of Maryland where the hoot owls
trod the chickens and TCP/IP packet routing is done by snails in their
spare time. I've got a Merlin PCMCIA card now (&lt;gag&gt; 19200bps, when
Ricochet was up to 128k...), and this gives me at least <EM>some</EM>
connectivity.  Certainly e-mail access, which is what's needed.
