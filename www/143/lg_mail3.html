<h3>More on the Eben Moglen / Tim O'Reilly argument</h3>
<p>
<b><p>
Rick Moen [rick at linuxmafia.com]
</p>
</b><br />
<b>Tue, 21 Aug 2007 14:01:00 -0700</b>
</p>

<p>
Tim O'Reilly has now written about the ~1/2 hour interview he recently
did with Prof. Eben Moglen on "Software Licensing in the Web 2.0 Era" at
OSCon 2007, in a post entitled "My Tongue-Lashing from Eben Moglen":
<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/08/my_tonguelashin.html">http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/08/my_tonguelashin.html</a>
</p>

<p>
It's interesting and thoughtful -- and also includes an .ogg-format
clip of the interview that will let me finally see it on my Xubuntu G3
iBook.  ;-&gt;
</p>

<p>
Pending my doing so, here's an excerpt from Moglen's remarks, concerning
the much-discussed ASP loophole aka SaaS (Software as a Service)
loophole:
</p>

<p>
   "We've got to conclude that what Google does, they have a right to do
   in freedom. They shouldn't need anyone's permission to run programs.
   Stallman was right about that at the very beginning. If you have to ask
   other people's permission to run a program, you don't have adequate
   freedom. And that means you've got to have the right to run programs for
   someone else. And what's more, you have to have the right to make
   private modifications. Because if you don't have a right to make private
   modifications, and keep them to yourself whenever you want to, then the
   principle of freedom of thought is being rudely disrupted by a required
   responsibility to disclose what you are thinking to someone else... So
   if we take the philosophical responsibility to provide freedom
   seriously, we're going to have to say ... their rights, properly
   protected, may conflict with other people's rights, properly protected.
   The solution isn't to reduce anyone's rights." 
</p>

<p>
As I feared, Prof. Moglen (and impliedly the FSF) is saying that ASP
deployments should be seen as private modification and usage, and that 
private usage must not be encumbered by, say, copyleft obligations tied
to the act of offering codebases up for public usage via network access.
</p>

<p>
This stance, ironically, ends up amounting to a BSD-licensing position.
Advocates of that position, sooner or later, tend to voice the standard
BSD-advocacy mantra:  "So what if it permits creation of proprietary
forks?  If you're any good at what you do, you'll just outcompete them."
</p>

<p>
Which is fine if you are OK with working hard to produce free / open
source software, only to see a competitor take a branch of your work
proprietary.  FSF has always, until now, been the prime examplar of a
group that is <em>not</em> OK with that -- that, in fact, invented the concept
of copyleft as a means by which software authors can, if they wish, 
prevent that dilution of (their portion of) the commons.
</p>

<p>
Matt Asay of former badgeware firm Alfresco has just said pretty much the
same thing, and I think he's right
(<a href="http://news.com.com/8301-10784_3-9763068-7.html):">http://news.com.com/8301-10784_3-9763068-7.html):</a>
</p>

<p>
    GPL is the new BSD in Web 2.0, and why this matters
   
    The Internet turns open-source licensing on its head. Copyleft is
    neither copyright nor copyleft anymore in the Web world. It's just copy,
    because distribution of a service over the Internet doesn't count as
    distribution in the archaic licensing language that plagues most
    open-source licenses.

Cc: license-discuss@opensource.org
From: Rick Moen &lt;rick@linuxmafia.com&gt;
Subject: When will CPAL actually be _used_?
</pre>
Hello, Ross.  I noted with great interest Socialtext's submission of
Common Public Attribution License to OSI, at the beginning of July, and
in fact posted favourable comments on it to the license-discuss mailing
list, at that time.  The OSI Board then, of course, approved it on July
25.
</p>

<p>
Since then, your firm's press releases and numerous bits of news
coverage (The Register, CMS Wire, eWeek, and quite a few others) have
proclaimed your firm's conversion of Socialtext Open to this new
OSI-certified licence.
</p>

<p>
In addition, your firm's Web pages began prominently featuring OSI's
"OSI Certified" regulated certification mark logo, which may be used
only for codebases released under OSI certified open source licences.
</p>

<p>
So, I am obliged to ask:  When will your product actually use CPAL?
To date, it is not.  To wit:
</p>

<p>
o  The SourceForge.net project at
   <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/socialtext/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/socialtext/</a> has, as the latest
   downloadable tarball, Socialtext Open release 2.11.6.1.  It's perhaps
   understandable that <em>that</em> form of access to source code still gets the
   user only code under the "Socialtext Public Licence 1.0" MPL 1.1 +
   Exhibit B badgeware licence -- because that tarball, your latest full
   release, was dated May 22, 2007, prior to your CPAL announcements.
</p>

<p>
o  However, what's a bit more difficult to understand is that following
   hyperlinks for source code access on your coprorate Web site takes you
   to <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/open/index.cgi?socialtext_open_source_code">http://www.socialtext.net/open/index.cgi?socialtext_open_source_code</a>,
   which cites a svn command to check the "head" development codebase out
   of repo.socialtext.net -- and <em>that</em> code, your very latest developer
   code, is <em>likewise</em> under Socialtext Public Licence 1.0.
</p>

<p>
So, when is Socialtext going to actually <em>use</em> the OSI-certified licence
that it's been claiming in public to be using?
</p>

<p>
Also, would you mind please removing the "OSI Certified" logo from your
pages until such time as you are legally entitled to use it?  Thank you.
</p>

<p>
As a reminder, I called your attention here on December 29, 2006 to your
then-advertised wiki page <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/stoss/">http://www.socialtext.net/stoss/</a> claiming in
error that Socialtext had submitted SPL 1.0 to OSI's certification
process, when it had not done so.  You acknowledged the critique, but
Socialtext did not fix the misstatement of fact until I reminded you of
it a second time, here, on January 22, 2007.  I hope that your
firm's correction of its erroneous public licensing information, this
time, will be significantly faster.
</p>

<p>

Subject: SCO v. Novell Decided
</pre>
For all of those who haven't heard yet, there has been a ruling on SCO 
v. Novell this afternoon, and SCO lost massively.
</p>

<p>
(reposted from groklaw.net)
</p>

<p>
CONCLUSION
</p>

<p>
For the reasons stated above, the court concludes that Novell is the 
owner of the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights. Therefore, SCO's First Claim 
for Relief for slander of title and Third Claim for specific performance 
are dismissed, as are the copyright ownership portions of SCO's Fifth 
Claim for Relief for unfair competition and Second Claim for Relief for 
breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The court 
denies SCO's cross-motion for summary judgment on its own slander of 
title, breach of contract, and unfair competition claims, and on 
Novell's slander of title claim. Accordingly, Novell's slander of title 
claim is still at issue.
</p>

<p>
The court also concludes that, to the extent that SCO has a copyright to 
enforce, SCO can simultaneously pursue both a copyright infringement 
claim and a breach of contract claim based on the non-compete 
restrictions in the license back of the Licensed Technology under APA 
and the TLA. The court further concludes that there has not been a 
change of control that released the non-compete restrictions of the 
license, and the non-compete restrictions of the license are not void 
under California law. Accordingly, Novell's motion for summary judgment 
on SCO's non-compete claim in its Second Claim for breach of contract 
and Fifth Claim for unfair competition is granted to the extent that 
SCO's claims require ownership of the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights, and 
denied in all other regards.

&gt; There are alternatives to MS Project, most of them done in Java.
&gt; This one (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openproj/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/openproj/</a>) looks very
&gt; MS-Projectish. It's Open Source....
</pre>

<p>
Sadly, no, it's not.  Quoting my summary at "Project Management" on
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/kb/Apps/:">http://linuxmafia.com/kb/Apps/:</a> 
</p>

<p>
   Licence is deceptively claimed to be open source, but in fact is MPL
   1.1 plus a proprietary "badgeware" addendum that impairs third-party
   commercial usage by requiring that derivative works include mandatory
   advertising of OpenProj publisher Projity's name and trademarked logo on
   "each user interface screen" while specifically denying users a
   trademark licence.

Hi Rick,
</p>

<p>
I came across your Linux Gazette article this weekend. Great write up!
I thought I updated the licensing for domain-check last month, but it
looks like I saved the file with the wrong name. Ooops.<img src="../gx/frown.png" alt=":("> I just moved
the updated file into place, and it's now licensed under the GPL (the
same as Ben's Perl script). This should allow you (and anyone else) to
use it for whatever you want.
</p>

Thanks,

Actually, CPAL does have a network clause (unrelated to the advertising
clause, which does nothing for the SaaS problem):

<p>
"The term ???External Deployment??? means the use, distribution, or

a distribution under section 3.1 and make Source Code available under
Section 3.2."
</p>

This is taken from the Open Software License.

This would seem to require SaaS deployments provide source code to end

I stand corrected!  Thank you.  That's the problem with writing from

<p>
CPAL thus does indeed join GPL w/Affero, OSL 3.0, ASPL 2.0, and Honest
Public License as licences with SaaS-oriented copyleft clauses.

Hi, Aaron.  Thank you for the URL.  Being tied down in a software
upgrade at the moment, I don't have much time to comment, but here are a
few thoughts.  I speak, here, largely as a student of rhetoric.
</p>

<p>
1.  Just so you know, "open letters" have always been non-starters:
They pretty much scream "ignore me", to most people.  This has nothing
to do with the merit of what's said; it's just a reflexive reaction
people tend to develop towards anything described as that. 
</p>

<p>
IMO, if you want to be taken seriously, refactor to avoid that
unfortunate language.  E.g., you could send an <em>actual</em> letter to the
OSI Board and then reproduce on your Web site a copy of it.
</p>

<p>
2.  The paragraph starting with "If you read my personal blog..." 
will tend to give to casual observers the impression of your dwelling on
and boring them with your past complaints.  To be really blunt, it has
the surface flavour of whining (e.g., "been called infantile names"),
and nobody likes a whiner.  Again, this has nothing to do with the
substance of what you're saying.  It's a presentation issue, and
presentation is important, because people filter what they read
mercilessly, and you want to avoid all the obvious reasons (common
heuristics) why people stop reading something and move on.
</p>

<p>
3.  The phrase "I've left lengthy comments at OSI" in this paragraph
is unfortunate for the same reason:  The reader of your current point
doesn't have any use for this information, and it just gives such 
readers another candidate reason for ignoring you.  They may dismiss you
as one of those tireless cranks who deluge online forums with barrages
comments and then complain that nobody takes them seriously.
</p>

<p>
4.  
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I've blogged about SugarCRM and it's CEO John Roberts previously (the
&gt; last bit of this post). 
</pre>

<p>
And your point?  None is evident.  Again, since there's no obvious
<em>reason</em> cited why you mention this, the casual impression this gives is
of someone who simply blogs a great deal, and wants to send readers on a
long chain of links because what you say is so very vital in its full
detail that you couldn't possibly summarise, i.e., like a crank.

</p>

<p>
Lawyer, ex-badgware firm Alfresco executive, and OSI Board member Matt
Asay writes a "NewsBlog" at CNet news.com, in which he comments on open
source.  A couple of days ago, that column published a compendium of
whoppers[1], attempting to accuse open source users of hypocrisy.

<p>
Quoting key parts:
</p>

<p>
  The open-source community's double standard on MySQL
  posted by Matt Asay
  [...]
</p>

<p>
  Remember 2002? That's when Red Hat decided to split its code into Red
  Hat Advanced Server (now Red Hat Enterprise Linux) and Fedora. Howls of
  protest and endless hand-wringing 
  [<a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513-5102282.html">http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513-5102282.html</a>] ensued:
</p>

<p>
  Enter 2007. MySQL decides to comply with the GNU General Public
  License and only give its tested, certified Enterprise code to those who
  pay for the service underlying that code (gasp!). Immediately cries of
  protest are raised [<a href="http://www.linux.com/feature/118489">http://www.linux.com/feature/118489</a>], How dare 
  MySQL not give everything away for free?
</p>

<p>
  Ironically, in this same year of 2007, SugarCRM received universal
  plaudits (from me, as well) for opening up _part of its code base_ 
  under GPLv3. Groklaw crowed
  [<a href="http://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story=20070725161131598">http://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story=20070725161131598</a>], 
  "SugarCRM Goes GPLv3!" People everywhere flooded the streets to wax 
  fecund and celebrate by multiplying and replenishing the earth.
</p>

<p>
  [...] I'm criticizing the open-source community for applying a
  hypocritical double-standard.
</p>

<p>
No, Matt.  Sorry, you lose.
</p>

<p>
First, the ZDNet link you cited simply did <em>not</em> feature even one
member of the Linux community being quoted as criticising Red Hat in any 
way, let alone failing to comply with GPLv2 or any other open source
licence -- for the simple reason that Red Hat didn't violate any 
licence, and in fact has published full source code RPMs for the full
software portions of RHEL, downloadable free of charge and fully
accessible to the public (which is far more than the licences require).
</p>

<p>
(RHEL includes two non-software SRPMS that contain trademark-encumbered
image files.  People who wish to have non-trademark-encumbered RHEL 
can create same by using different image files in their place, or can 
rely on CentOS et alii's ongoing work in doing exactly that.  I've
previously pointed this set of facts out to Matt directly, on an occasion
when he attempted to defend his own firm's then-usage of badgeware
licensing through the tu-quoque fallacy of criticising Red Hat.)
</p>

<p>
Likewise, the linux.com story you cited concerning MySQL AB's cessation of
offering source tarballs to the general public (though public access
to the SCM repository will remain) does <em>not</em> feature even one cry of
protest -- for the simple reason that MySQL AB is still offering a
fully, genuinely open source product.
</p>

<p>
(Accordingly, Matt's assertion about whom MySQL AB will "give its
tested, certified Enterprise code to" is simply false.)

Hi Rick,
</p>

<p>
Found a video of the Eben Moglen/ Tim O'Reilly exchange at OSCon. It
was titled "Licensing in the Web 2.0 Era". Unfornatley, the video
appears to be in a .mov quicktime format, but seems playable on Free
software players(w/ unFree codecs).
<a href="http://www.mefeedia.com/entry/3282956/">http://www.mefeedia.com/entry/3282956/</a>

</p>

<p>
Funny comment about trying to get the O'Reilly OSCon copy of the video/audio:
"Regrettably, we missed the assault. Stories needed to go out, and we
assumed the chat would follow familiar, boring lines. After about ten
people later asked if we caught the spectacular show, The Register
contacted the OSCON audio staff to obtain a recording of the session.
"No problem," they said, "It will just take a couple of minutes, but
you need to get O'Reilly's permission first." O'Reilly corporate
refused to release the audio, saying it would cause a slippery slope.
(We're still trying to understand that one.) They, however, did add
that Moglen appeared to be "off his meds."

hth,

<p>
ps. What was that name of that book that you where discussing at Linux
Picnix about the Renaissance? It was a case study done about Florence
Nightingale, the father of the rugby school, and someone else. TIA.

<p>
I'll be checking this out when I'm next at a computer with the necessary
software.  (My Xubuntu iBook will play many Quicktime .mov files, but, 
since it's a G3 PPC, the unfree codecs are out, even if I wanted them 
present, which I really don't.)
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, there have been a number of text excerpts from Moglen's
commentary.  Here's a typical one, from
