<h1>X Fonts Display Poorly?  Not Anymore</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/adam.html">Thomas Adam</A></b></p>

<p>
<H2 align="left">Introduction</H2>

<FONT COLOR="blue"><P>[ ** Although I am the author of this article, I
really must acknowledge Ben, Jim and Heather for their assistance in
solving this problem. Thanks, guys :) ** -- Thomas Adam ]</P></FONT>

<P>I recently brought a new laptop. A nice new Toshiba T1330 model. OK, so
it's not the best model on the market, I'm sure. But it was all I could
afford given my student budget; and anyone that is a student knows how
little is provided.</P>

<P>So, having got the thing back home and removing something called "XP"
which used some kind of weird filesystem I'd never seen before, I
installed Debian Sarge. Something that a *very* kind fellow named Frank
Rodolf (of TAG) had sent me down...</P>

<P>It installed marvellously and it was much easier and faster than
perhaps SuSE was (my main distro before I switched to Debian). In under an
hour, I had everything installed (including X) and was ready to launch
into doing Linux Things (tm). Or so I thought... until I fired up
FVWM.</P>

<HR WIDTH=25% ALIGN="center">

<H2 align="left">The Problem</H2>

<P>My window manager launched just fine -- no errors. I was able to open
programs as I normally would (via 'update-menus') except that with some
programs (GTK inparticular), I was seeing the fonts being displayed
incorrectly. It was as if the edges of the fonts had been 'eaten'
somehow.</P>

<P>I thought that was odd, and so I decided to see what might be causing
it. Initially I thought it might have been a buggy video module that I had
selected. Just to be sure (I was using VESA -- so there ought not to have
been a problem per se) I changed it to a temporary one:</P>

<PRE>
[n6tadam@laptop n6tadam]$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86
</PRE>

<P>Restarted the X server, logged in..hmmm, still the same. One other
thing I was beginning to notice as well was that; particularly with GTK+
applications that the font rendering was rather too large, very large.
"What was going on?" I wondered.... As I had noticed two things rather odd
with GTK apps (gvim was a classic example), I decided to check that my
$HOME/.gtk* files were 'ok'.</P>

<P>Since I know absolutely nothing about how GTK+ apps use these
configuration files, my safest bet was to see if these files were 
contributing to my large font problem was to simply rename them. Thus:</P>

<PRE>
[n6tadam@laptop n6tadam]$ mv ~/.gtk-rc ~/gtk-rc.THIS_IS_HIDDEN &amp;&amp; gvim &amp;
</PRE>

<P>Guess what....same problem :( I moved the file back again and started
to think what else it could possibly be. I'd ruled out that it couldn't be
a GTK+ specific problem as I had tweaked the damn file to death with still
the same results each time. So, the problem therefore probably had to lie
at a lower level than the configuration one...</P>

<P>At this point, I was getting desparate. What was I going to do? I
couldn't really do any work whatsoever...at least, not the kind of work I
needed to (Lyx stuff) -- none of the fonts worked...So I did what any sane
person would do. I e-mailed The Answer Gang. As usual, I got replies, all
of which were very helpful. It feels odd for me e-mailing TAG -- usually
I am the one answering questions; not asking them :)</P>

<P>One of the replies I got back though got me thinking. What is the job
of X? Well, very loosely put it is a layer that provides protocols for the
Window Manager to use so that various things can be set (position of
window etc.). Is it therefore up to X to provide the fonts? No -- that is
at the programming level.... </P>

<P>... not quite. Some distributions (RH, Mandrake) run a program called
"xfs": "X Font Server". It provides a means of sharing fonts across a
network to which many hosts connect to the server. Great, but is that of
any use to me? No..so why not get rid of it? Indeed, am I even using
one?</P>

<PRE>
[n6tadam@laptop n6tadam]$ /etc/init.d/xfs status
xfs is running.
</PRE>

<P>Bah -- so I *do* have one. Could that be part of my problem? One of
the methods that I have learnt in solving problem is to try and break it
down. Diagnosis of computer problems therefore should be no different,
excpet that I employ a technique I like to call: <B>abstract
de-layering</B>. That is, remove all the non-essential layers so that you
are left with the minimum number of possible conflicting processes.</P>

<P>You may well be thinking though that if I were to kill the xfs that my
X server wouldn't work anymore? Well that is what I thought until I
remembered that actually there is a 'fallback' method -- the X server
configuration file itself...</P>

<HR ALIGN="center" WIDTH=25%>

<H2>The Solution</H2>

<P>So...how did I solve this in the end? Firstly I had to find a way of
killing xfs permenantly -- I just didn't need it. All it was doing was
adding another layer of complexity that I don't need. In debian there's a
really useful script: "update-rc.d". Thus:</P>

<PRE>
[n6tadam@laptop n6tadam]$ sudo update-rc.d -f /etc/init.d/xfs remove
</PRE>

<P>Bye-bye, xfs. Of course there are other ways of doing this. You could
do something like edit the file so that you include the following after
the she-bang line:</P>

<P align="center">----------------------</P>
<PRE>
#!/bin/bash 

NO_XFS = 1

[ $NO_XFS = "1" ] &amp;&amp; {
  #tell syslogd we don't want this anymore...

  logger "Not starting XFS: you said not to...."
  exit 0
} || {
  #rest of script as written follows....
}
</PRE>
<P align="center">----------------------</P>

<P>But the question still remains, how are the fonts displayed if there is
no font server running? By looking at X's configuration file
(/etc/X11/XF86Config-4) I found the following section:</P>

<P align="center">----------------------</P>
<PRE>
Section "Files"
    FontPath	"unix/:7100"			# local font server
    # if the local font server has problems, we can fall back on these
    FontPath	"/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc"
    FontPath	"/usr/lib/X11/fonts/cyrillic"
    FontPath	"/usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi"
    FontPath	"/usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi"
    FontPath	"/usr/lib/X11/fonts/Type1"
    FontPath	"/usr/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo"
    FontPath	"/usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi"
    FontPath	"/usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi"
EndSection
</PRE>
<P align="center">----------------------</P>

<P>Excellent! As there was no font server running then we were using the
font paths listed above. One important thing to note though is that the
ORDER that the fonts are listed, is <B>the order that the fonts are
searched for.</B>. The keyword here though is "dpi" -- dots per square
inch.</P>

<P>All I did was to change the values round in the listing so that 75 came
before 100, hence the list now looked like the following:</P>

<P align="center">----------------------</P>
<PRE>
Section "Files"
    ###FontPath	"unix/:7100"			# local font server
    # if the local font server has problems, we can fall back on these
    FontPath	"/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc"
    FontPath	"/usr/lib/X11/fonts/cyrillic"
    FontPath	"/usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi"
    FontPath	"/usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi"
    FontPath	"/usr/lib/X11/fonts/Type1"
    FontPath	"/usr/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo"
    FontPath	"/usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi"
    FontPath	"/usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi"
EndSection
</PRE>
<P align="center">----------------------</P>


<P>Now when I restarted X, it was normal. Problem solved. One interesting
thing to note though is that commenting out the "unix/:7100" line above
actually makes X start a little faster. I am still a little puzzled as to
why xfs/X didn't talk to eachother -- what it is that caused my weird font
problems in the first place.</P>

<P>The lesson to really be learnt here though is solving a problem such as
this can be done by removing all the layers such that what you are left
with is a non-conflicting layer that you can use to solve your problems
cleanly.</P>

I write the recently-revived series "The Linux Weekend Mechanic", which was
started by John Fisk (the founder of Linux Gazette) in 1996 and continued
until 1998.  I'm also a member of The Answer Gang.

<P> I was born in Hammersmith (London UK) in 1983.  When I was 13, I moved to
the sleepy, thatched roofed, village of East Chaldon in the county of Dorset.
I am very near the coast (at Lulworth Cove) which is where I used to work.

<P> I first got interested in Linux in 1996 having seen a review of it in a
magazine (Slackware 2.0). I was fed up with the instability that the then-new
operating system Win95 had and so I decided to give it a go.
Slackware 2.0 was great. I have been a massive Linux enthusiast ever
since.  I ended up with running SuSE on both my desktop and laptop computers.

<P> While at school (<A HREF="www.purbeck.dorset.sch.uk">The Purbeck
School</A>, Wareham in Dorset), I was actively involved in setting up two
Linux proxy servers (each running Squid and SquidGuard).  I also set up
numerous BASH scripts which allowed web-based filtering to be done via
e-mail, so that when an e-mail was received, the contents of it were added to
the filter file. (Good old BASH -- I love it)

<P> I am now 18 and studying at University (Southampton Institute, UK), on a
course called HND Business Information Technology (BIT). So far, it's great.

<P> Other hobbies include reading. I especially enjoy reading plays (Henrik
Ibsen, Chekhov, George Bernard Shaw), and I also enjoy literature (Edgar Allan
Poe, Charles Dickens, Jane Austin to name but a few).

<P> I enjoy walking, and often go on holiday to the Lake District, to a place
called Keswick. There are numerous "mountains", of which "Great Gable" is my
most favourite.

<P> I am also a keen musician. I play the piano in my spare time. 

<P> I listen to a variety of music. I enjoy listening to
Rock (My favourite band is "Pavement" (lead singer:
Stephen Malkmus). I also have a passion for 1960's
psychedelic music (I hope to purchase a copy of
"Nuggets" reeeeaaall soon).
