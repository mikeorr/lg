<h1>Firewall logging to MySQL - the quick and easy way</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/anonymous.html">Anonymous</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>Security is a journey, not a destination. One good step along
the way is to review and analyze your firewall logs and syslog
messages on a regular basis. Unfortunately, the plain text logs
produced by <code>syslog</code> are not in a form that is easily
analyzed. Also, unless you are using <code>syslog-ng</code>, your
firewall logs are probably scattered all over the various system
message log files.</p>

<p>This article will show you how to move your firewall logs from
<code>syslog</code> text files to a MySQL database in 10 minutes or
so. The following examples were carried out on a SuSE 10.0 system
but you can easily adapt them for other distributions.</p>

<h3>1. Verify kernel settings</h3>

<p>You can skip this step if you are using the default SuSE 10.0
kernel. The stock kernels that come with most distributions should
be fine, but you will need to make sure you have your kernel
compiled with the <code>CONFIG_NETFILTER</code>,
<code>CONFIG_IP_NF_IPTABLES</code>,
<code>CONFIG_IP_NF_FILTER</code>, and
<code>CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_ULOG</code> options. Most firewalls will
also need <code>CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK</code>,
<code>CONFIG_IP_NF_FTP</code>, and
<code>CONFIG_IP_NF_IRC</code>.</p>
If you have a file called <code>/proc/config.gz</code>, it means
your kernel was compiled with the IKCONFIG option.
<code>/proc/config.gz</code> is the compressed version of the
<code>.config</code> file that was used to generate that kernel, so
you can check if you have the necessary options for
<code>netfilter</code> and <code>ulog</code> with this command:

<pre class="code">
gunzip -c /proc/config.gz | grep -E 'CONFIG_(NETFILTER|(IP_NF_(IPTABLE|FILTER|TARGET_ULOG)))'
</pre>

<p>If they are not set as modules or compiled into the kernel you
will need to change them and recompile the kernel. In
<code>menuconfig</code> the following options need to be set:</p>

<pre class="code">
Networking options &gt; Network packet filtering
Networking options &gt; Netfilter Configuration &gt; IP tables support
Networking options &gt; Netfilter Configuration &gt; Packet filtering
Networking options &gt; Netfilter Configuration &gt; ULOG target support
</pre>

<p>You might also want to verify that <code>iptables</code> is
compiled with <code>ulog</code> support.<!--, although usually most
recent kernels do support <code>netfilter</code> and
<code>ulog</code> by default--></p>

<h3>2.1. Install MySQL</h3>
You can go directly to 2.2. if you have MySQL already setup.
Otherwise:

<pre class="code">
apt install mysql
/etc/init.d/mysql restart
chkconfig mysql on
</pre>

<p>If you are using SuSE and do not have <a href=
"http://linux01.gwdg.de/apt4rpm/">apt4rpm</a> installed on your
system, I highly recommend that you do so, as it will greatly
simplify your package management issues.</p>

<p>You also need to set a password for the MySQL root user:</p>

<pre class="code">
mysqladmin -u root password 'yourpassword'
</pre>

<h3>2.2. Initialize the database</h3>
Type in: 
<!--20051124 dsrich - Added  '-u root' to the following as the author
apparently assumes that the user is logged in as root - never a good
idea,-->

<pre class="code">
mysql -p -u root
</pre>
then enter your password at the prompt. Once you have logged into
your MySQL database, enter the following commands to prepare the
database to receive firewall logs from ulog.

<pre class="code">
create database ulogdb;
use ulogdb;
source /path/to/nulog/scripts/ulogd.mysqldump;
grant select,insert,update,drop,delete,create temporary tables, on ulogdb.* to ulog@localhost identified by 'ulogpass';
flush privileges;
quit;
</pre>
So what happened here?

<ul>
<li>We created a database ulogdb to host our logs</li>

<li>We executed the SQL script <code>ulogd.mysqldump</code>,
preparing the database for nulog-php, it allows to store more
information than the MySQL table provided with ulogd, and you can
find it in the scripts directory of nulog-php or <a href=
"misc/anonymous/ulogd.mysqldump">right here</a>.</li>

<li>We created an user &ldquo;ulog&rdquo; (with pass
&ldquo;ulogpass&rdquo;) to have read/write access to that database.
I highly recommend that you enter a different password than this
example uses.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.1. Install <code>ulogd</code></h3>
You will need to install the logging daemon <code>ulogd</code>:

<pre class="code">
apt install ulogd-mysql
</pre>

<h3>3.2. Configure <code>ulogd.conf</code></h3>

<p>Edit /etc/ulogd.conf to match what we set up previously:</p>

<pre class="code">
[MYSQL]
table="ulog"
pass="ulogpass"
user="ulog"
db="ulogdb"
host="localhost"
</pre>

<p>You should change the password &ldquo;ulogpass&rdquo; to the
password you set in the GRANT command in your MySQL database. Now
uncomment the following line to send the data to MySQL:</p>

<pre class="code">
plugin /usr/lib/ulogd/ulogd_MYSQL.so
</pre>

<p>and comment out the following two lines to prevent logging to a
text file:</p>

<pre class="code">
#syslogfile /var/log/ulogd.syslogmenu
#plugin /usr/lib/ulogd/ulogd_LOGEMU.so
</pre>

<p>Now restart the ulogd daemon and set it to be automatically
started at boot time with chkconfig:</p>

<pre class="code">
/etc/init.d/ulogd restart
chkconfig ulogd on
</pre>

<h3>4. Redirect <code>iptables</code> Logging</h3>

<p>The following <code>sed</code> command switches all your
iptables rules to log through ULOG, we will assume that you store
your iptables ruleset in a file called &ldquo;iptables&rdquo;
(usually in /etc/sysconfig/ or /var/lib/)</p>

<pre class="code">
sed 's/LOG/ULOG/'; /etc/sysconfig/iptables &gt; /etc/sysconfig/uiptables
iptables-restore &lt; /etc/sysconfig/uiptables
</pre>

<p>You are now all set up! All the logs from your firewall are now
being logged in your MySQL database. Don't forget to update your
firewall startup script so the new iptables are taken into
account.</p>

<h3>5. Import Your Old Logs</h3>

<p>So far, so good, but you probably would like to have your old
logs in MySQL also. Here is a little <a href=
"misc/anonymous/nf2mysql.pl.txt">perl script</a> to allow you to
import your old text logs to MySQL. Some of the regexps are reused
from <a href="http://adcfw-log.sourceforge.net/">adcfw-log</a>. You
can usually find your netfilter logs in /var/log/firewall-XXXXXX.gz
or /var/log/messages-XXXXXX.gz. To import:</p>

<pre class="code">
gunzip -c /var/log/firewall-XXXXXX.gz | nf2sql.pl
</pre>
Repeat for each of your other log files. To process a current log
file (or other uncompressed log file) such as /var/log/messages or
/var/log/firewall:

<pre class="code">
nf2sql.pl &lt; /var/log/messages
</pre>
That's it!

<h3>6. Analyze the Results</h3>

<p>To analyze your logs in MySQL you can use <a href=
"http://www.inl.fr/Nulog.html">nulog</a> or <a href=
"http://webfwlog.sourceforge.net/">webfwlog</a></p>

MySQL, you can take a look at this <a href=

logging.</p>

A. N. Onymous has been writing for LG since the early days - generally by
sneaking in at night and leaving a variety of articles on the Editor's
desk. A man (woman?) of mystery, claiming no credit and hiding in
darkness... probably something to do with large amounts of treasure in an
ancient Mayan temple and a beautiful dark-eyed woman with a snake tattoo
winding down from her left hip. Or maybe he just treasures his privacy. In
