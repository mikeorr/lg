Most well-written, non-graphics C++ code is portable, but major
problems occur when one tries to write portable applications for
graphical user interfaces. On Linux, the X Window System is used as the major
graphical user interface. GUI code written on Linux will not work
on MS Windows. Even though we all know that Linux is the better of the two,
some Linux developers would like to also support MS Windows
with its large number of users.
<p>
With a portable GUI C++ library, source code developed under Linux and X
can be compiled for other platforms, including MS Windows. Quite
a few GUI C++ libraries are available at this time, including
MFC and OWL for MS Windows. Unfortunately, none of these libraries are
portable to both X and MS Windows.
<p>
Desirable features in a portable GUI library include the following:
<p>
<ul>
  <li> 	Support for a large number of platforms
  <li> 	Easy to use, with good documentation
  <li> 	A good set of widgets (or
controls, in Microsoft-speak) to use in your interface
</ul>
Other desirable features which are not GUI related are portable network
functionality, file I/O capabilities and some good container classes.
<p>
What are some of the problems faced by a portable GUI library?
One is that GUI code on different platforms varies widely. To create
a new window, MS Windows uses a completely different command than X, even
though the code uses the same programming language in both. Another problem is
subtle changes in event handling. All GUI applications are event
driven, but the events are different on different platforms. The
portable GUI library must take all of these differences into
consideration and supply a common interface for all platforms.
<p>
I have reviewed three different GUI C++ libraries which support both
X and MS Windows. All are free of charge with no royalties.
The source code for these libraries is available on the web sites cited in
Resources.
<p>
Since these libraries are written in C++, you have all the
advantages of object-oriented design. To create a new window, you
derive your own window class from the main window class. After adding
the appropriate code to handle events in your window, it is
finished.
<p>
<h3>wxWindows</h3>
<p>
<b>wxWindows</b> is by far the most active of the libraries available.
wxWindows was originally developed by Julian Smart, but has received
contributions from many others. The version of wxWindows reviewed in 
this article is 1.68B. Version 2.0, a major rewrite of the library, is
rumored to be available in ``the near future''.
<p>
<b>wxWindows</b> is a very modular project. The main version is
available on the web site. In addition to the main version, there are
also many subprojects. Some of these subprojects include additional
widgets, an Xlib library port, a Macintosh port and many others. These
subprojects are described on the wxWindows web site (see Resources).
<p>
Note that the main version of wxWindows requires the Motif
toolkit. Motif is not free; therefore, most Linux installations do
not include it. Lesstif, a popular Motif clone, compiles and
works with wxWindows. There is also a side project which uses only
standard Xlib libraries so that wxWindows does not need Motif.
<p>
<b>wxWindows</b> has many features. Figure 1 is a screen capture of
the sample program distributed with wxWindows running on a
Linux system. Notice all of the widgets available to the
programmer. More screen shots are available on the wxWindows web
site.

<p>
One of best features of wxWindows is the on-line documentation. The
documentation comes in HTML, LaTeX and MS Windows help format. There
is also a very active mailing list for wxWindows, where many questions
can be answered. Trying to learn all of these new classes can be
confusing, and wxWindows does a good job of describing them.
<p>
If you don't want to download all of the wxWindows source code,
a distribution on CD is available. See the web site for more details.
<p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>
<b>V</b> is another freely available library, and was developed by Dr. Bruce
E. Wampler. [See ``V--A Free C++ GUI Framework for X'',
<i>Linux Journal</i>, December 1996.] It is able to compile on X and MS Windows.
It is a complete
library, but does not have all of the fancy controls that wxWindows
has. Although not as fancy, in my opinion, V's source code is better 
written and easier to understand than wxWindows.
<p>
V does not require the Motif libraries to build and run. All V source
code uses pure Xlib library calls, so it should be able to compile on
any Linux system with no difficulty.
<p>
V has quite a few widgets available as well. Figure 2 is a screen shot
of an example program distributed with the library. This look
is consistent on all platforms.

<p>
<h3>YACL</h3>
<p>
Another library worth looking at is YACL (Yet
Another Class Library). The author, M. A. Sridhar, reports that YACL
can compile on X, MS Windows and OS/2. Unfortunately, it looks as if 
progress on YACL has been nonexistent since late 1996. The current
version of YACL, 1.60, is close to complete with a good set of classes and
widgets.
<p>

<p>
Figure 3 shows a screen shot of an example program distributed with
the library. This example shows some of the graphics primitives
available with YACL. YACL also has all of your basic widgets,
such as buttons, menus, choices and radio buttons.
<p>
One of YACL's biggest drawbacks is a lack of documentation. There
is a book about YACL: <i>Building Portable C++
Applications with YACL</i>, Addison-Wesley, 1996. I would suspect this book has
more information than the documentation distributed with the
library.
<p>
If you would like more information on any of these libraries, please
see their web page listed in the Resources table.
