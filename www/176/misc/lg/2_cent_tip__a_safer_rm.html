<p>
Hi,
</p>

<p>
[I wrote what follows nearly a month ago. Since I started working
full-time-plus, I have not been able to respond as promptly as I would
prefer. For many, I suspect, the subject has gone cold. Nevertheless,
...] 
</p>


<p>
As often happens, I have not phrased myself well. [sigh]
</p>

<p>
I apologise for trying to respond quickly, when clearly a fuller and
more considered response was indicated.
</p>

<p>
Let me try again.
</p>


<p>
As I understand it, this is the original statement of the problem:
</p>


<p>
	If you've ever tried to delete Emacs backup files with
</p>

<p>
	rm *~
</p>

<p>
	(i.e. remove anything ending with ~), but you
	accidentally hit Enter before the ~ and did "rm *", ...
</p>

<p>
Silas then goes on to suggest a solution.
</p>


<p>
Perhaps I took the problem statement too literally. When I wrote
cleanup.sh, it was aimed exclusively at emacs backup files. When I
talked about it, I was thinking exclusively of emacs backup files. I
am not aware of any other place where tildes are used.
</p>

<p>
If it's a file I've been editing with emacs, I've usually created it.
So I get to choose its name.
</p>

<p>
The message I am trying to convey to TAG's broad readership is this.
If you are happy with Silas's solution, that's fine. If you are happy
with any of the other solutions provided, that's fine too. I myself
have felt the need to deal with this problem. I offer my approach to
dealing with emacs backup files for your consideration.
</p>

<p>
Part of my approach is the cleanup script; this is the technical
outcome, the tangible I can offer to others.
</p>

<p>
More important is a holistic approach to the problem as originally
stated. I took it to mean that certain behaviours are more risky than
others. This is again in the eyes of the beholder. Some people always
alias 'rm' to 'rm -i'. If they do this, they will always be prompted
before deleting any file. If they specify multiple files, there will
be a prompt for each file individually.
</p>

<p>
Such an approach would have saved Silas.
</p>

<p>
Again, if such an approach appeals to you, by all means adopt it.
</p>

<p>
It seems to me ill-advised to adopt a safe behaviour in one
circumstance and a risky behaviour in another. The nett effect will
not be as safe as your safest behaviour, but rather as risky as your
riskiest behaviour. (A chain is no stronger than its weakest link.)
</p>

<p>
So, first of all, according to my philosophy, don't go creating files
with dangerous characters in them. It's really not important to me to
call a file 'a b' when I can just as easily call it 'a_b'. If I
download a file with spaces in the filename AND I plan to edit it with
emacs, it's worth renaming the file, replacing spaces with underscores
(or any other innocuous character).
</p>

<p>
And I am strongly recommending this behaviour of mine to others.
</p>

<p>
If you live largely in a Linux world, you should rarely encounter
filenames containing dangerous characters. If you are creating files,
you can choose to avoid dangerous characters. Or not. It's up to you.
</p>


<p>
Second, according to my philosophy, unusual situations deserve special
handling, and, in the case of file deletion, special names. 'cleanup'
bears no similarity to 'rm' - deliberately not. It did not take me long
to get used to the idea that, if I wanted to get rid of all those
pesky files with tildes at the end of their name, I should use the
'cleanup' command (which may, or may not, be associated with the 'rm'
command - I don't need or want to think about that). YMMV. It may be
easier for me than for others, since I operate in a HAL - Henry
Abstraction Layer.
</p>


<p>
What does that leave? Yes, sometimes you encounter files from alien
OSes with dangerous characters in their names. Then you will need to
be especially cautious. For all other situations, I think 'cleanup' is
ok.
</p>

<p>
Addressing the wider problem of writing resilient scripts which can
handle any characters in filenames, my view is that I cannot write a
script that is so rock solid that I can say, with hand on heart, that it
can handle any character in a filename.
</p>

<p>
For readers who think it is easy, here's a handful of files I was able
to create with just a few minutes of imagination:
</p>


<pre>
-rw-rw----  1 henryg  wheel  0 May 22 15:17 *
-rw-rw----  1 henryg  wheel  0 May 22 15:17 ****
-rw-rw----  1 henryg  wheel  0 May 22 15:18 **\\**
-rw-rw----  1 henryg  wheel  0 May 22 15:17 -rf
-rw-rw----  1 henryg  wheel  0 May 22 15:21 aaa\000bbb
-rw-rw----  1 henryg  wheel  0 May 22 16:07 abc"def"ghi
-rw-rw----  1 henryg  wheel  0 May 22 16:58 abc'def"ghi
-rw-rw----  1 henryg  wheel  0 May 22 16:08 abc'def'ghi
-rw-rw----  1 henryg  wheel  0 May 22 16:08 qqq?rrr
</pre>

<p>
BTW, the last file does NOT have a question mark in its name; that's
just how ls displays it. It's the character ETX (hex 3).
</p>

<p>
One can handle such files individually and manually. In a script it is
more difficult.
</p>

<p>
I think one can be more confident if one writes in a real programming
language (rather than a script). People more familiar with perl might
disagree.

Skipping pretty much all of the preceding bits - which make a lot of
sense in the specified context, with "YMMV" stamped in contrasting
colors all over the outside of the box - I'm going to jump to the
technical issue that Henry has raised here. It's a fun one. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<p>
Solution to removing these one at a time, programmatically:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
#!/bin/bash
# Created by Ben Okopnik on Sun Jun 20 22:47:55 EDT 2010
 
IFS='
'
 
for f in *; do rm "./$f"; done
</pre>

<p>
I've found this approach to be quite robust. You could even do
</p>

<pre>
IFS=$'\n'; for f in *; do rm "./$f"; done
</pre>

<p>
if you wanted to do it as a command-line one-liner.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I think one can be more confident if one writes in a real programming
&gt; language (rather than a script). People more familiar with perl might
&gt; disagree.
</pre>

<p>
I recall speaking to someone who had attended a seminar held by David
Korn (of the Korn shell fame) in which David had convinced the audience
that you can indeed write robust and secure shell scripts. The fellow
had quite the post-epiphany glow on him. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> For myself, I find that
shell scripting is a fairly complete functionality set for handling
literally any user-level operation that can happen in the file system:
any time I think I've found an exception, a little digging usually turns
up a function that handles the specific thing I was looking for. It's
not quite an article of faith with me, but it's pretty close.
</p>

<p>
As for Perl, it's a great tool that makes most things easier... with the
one exception being the exact functionality set I mentioned above.
Almost anything to do with the file system can be done easier and more
simply in the shell. Perl shines when problems get beyond that simple
level.
