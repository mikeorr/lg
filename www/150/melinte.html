<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The dynamic linker allows us to override functions exported by the
shared objects that are used by programs. In this article, we will use this
interposition functionality and build a library that wraps around the
'pthreads' library to diagnose <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutex">mutex</a>-related problems,
including the well-known deadlock.
</p>


<h3>Deadlocks and how to avoid them</h3>

<p>Simply put, a deadlock is a run-time condition where threads are waiting 
for resources in a circular chain. The well-known solution to this is to 
assign a process-wide order to these resources and have each thread acquire 
the resources it needs in that particular order; threads should release the 
taken resources in reverse order. </p>

<p>To keep things simple for our debugging library, let's assume the resources 
that threads are competing for are all mutexes. But the techniques presented 
here can be extended to other type of resources threads would be competing for 
(e.g. semaphores, condition variables). </p>

<p>With pthreads, a thread can also self-deadlock if it attempts to lock a 
mutex it already owns. The ptreads library can help with self-lock: when 
creating the mutex, you can create it: </p>
  <ul>
  <li>As type PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK. A thread attempting to relock this 
  type of mutex without first unlocking it will get an error. A thread 
  attempting to unlock a mutex which another thread has locked will get an
  error. A thread attempting to unlock an unlocked mutex will also get an
  error.  </li>
  <li>As type PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE. A thread attempting to relock this 
  mutex without first unlocking it will succeed in locking the mutex. A 
  thread attempting to unlock a mutex which another thread has locked will 
  get an error. A thread attempting to unlock an unlocked mutex will still 
  get an error.  </li>
  </ul>

<p>One certainly should understand exactly why and whether a particular 
thread needs to multiple lock the mutex before making usage of such 
techniques. </p>

<h3>Library interposition</h3>

<p>The dynamic linker allows users to intercept any function call an 
application makes to any shared library that the application uses. The 
dynamic linker will first load libraries specified in the LD_PRELOAD 
environment variable (the interposition libraries) and the linker will use 
these libraries before any other when it resolves symbols. This functionality 
offered by the linker is used traditionally for debugging purposes, just like 
we will do shortly. </p>

<p>Functions exported by the interposition library will get called instead of 
the functions in the shared objects (here pthreads) that the application 
normally uses. Thus, in the interposition library we can wrap around the 
"real" functions; or replace them outright. </p>


<h3>Hooking pthreads</h3>

<p>We need to know which thread acquires and releases what and when. At a 
minimum, we have to hook pthread_mutex_lock(), pthread_mutex_trylock() and 
pthread_mutex_unlock(). Other candidates might be pthread_mutex_init(), 
pthread_mutex_destroy(), pthread_cond_timedwait(), pthread_cond_wait(). But 
since we decided to tackle only mutexes, the first three might well be enough, 
depending on your strategy to communicate the resources' acquiring order to 
the debug library.  Also, hooking pthread_mutex_destroy() is worthwhile 
because attempting to destroy a locked mutex is undefined behavior according 
to the standard (aside from being a programming error). </p>

<p>Below is the code used to hook our mutex functions, stripped of error 
checking code. We use the dlsym() function to dig out the real function, so 
that we can call it from within our wrapper function. The hooking function in 
the interposition library looks like this:</p>
<pre class="code">
    #define _GNU_SOURCE
    #include &lt;dlfcn.h&gt;

    typedef int (*lp_pthread_mutex_func)(pthread_mutex_t *mutex); 

    int lp_hookfunc(lp_pthread_mutex_func *fptr, const char *fname) 
    {
        char *msg = NULL; 

        *fptr = dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, fname); 
        if ((*fptr == NULL) || ((msg = dlerror()) != NULL)) {
            lp_report("dlsym %s failed : %s\n", fname, msg); 
            return -1; 
        } else {
            return 0; 
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>We'll use it to hook the pthreads-exported functions we need. This will be 
done as soon as the linker loads the debugging library, well before the main() 
function of the application gets called:</p>
<pre class="code">
    static lp_pthread_mutex_func next_pthread_mutex_lock = NULL; 
    static lp_pthread_mutex_func next_pthread_mutex_trylock = NULL; 
    static lp_pthread_mutex_func next_pthread_mutex_unlock = NULL; 

    void _init()
    {
        lp_hookfunc(&amp;next_pthread_mutex_lock,    "pthread_mutex_lock"); 
        lp_hookfunc(&amp;next_pthread_mutex_trylock, "pthread_mutex_trylock"); 
        lp_hookfunc(&amp;next_pthread_mutex_unlock,  "pthread_mutex_unlock"); 
        /*And check for errors.*/
    }
</pre>


<p>Next, we'll compile the code in a shared object: </p>

<pre>
    $ gcc -g -Wall -fPIC -I. -c lp_hooks.c -o lp_hooks.o
    $ ld -o liblockpick.so -shared lp_hooks.c 
</pre>


<p>Finally, we load this diagnostic shared object so that it takes over 
pthreads. At a Bourne shell prompt: </p> 

<pre>
    $ LD_PRELOAD=./liblockpick.so ./deadlock
</pre>

<p>Now, each time the application will call pthreads_mutex_lock(), the 
overriding/wrapping pthreads_mutex_lock() function from the debugging library 
will be called instead of the real one. Having taken control over the locking 
and unlocking functions, we can start keeping track of what is going on. The 
overriding function looks like this: </p>

<pre class="code">
    int pthread_mutex_lock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex)
    {
        int rc = EINVAL;

        if (mutex != NULL) {
            lp_lock_precheck(mutex);

            /* Call the real pthread_mutex_lock() */
            rc = next_pthread_mutex_lock(mutex);

            lp_lock_postcheck(mutex, rc);
        } else {
            lp_report("%s(): mutex* is NULL.\n", __FUNCTION__ );
        }

        return rc;
    }
</pre>

<h3>Resource ordering &amp; bookkeeping</h3>

<p>One important issue to consider is how to pass the resource-ordering 
information down to the debug library. There are various solutions that would 
require making the application aware of the debugging library and thus would 
require modifications of the application itself.  These solutions would 
eventually make the library less generic too.</p>

<p>This resource-ordering information is not needed to diagnose deadlock 
situations, but we need it if we want to check for out-of-order locking 
issues.</p>

<p>The code accompanying this article is strictly application-agnostic: the 
order given to mutexes is the order in which the library finds out about the 
existence of these mutexes. The mutex to be acquired first is the first one it 
finds out about. Practical for exemplifying this article -- we need to hook only 
three functions -- but maybe not so practical for a real application. </p>

<p>For each of the functions hooked, there are two moments when we do
bookkeeping and proceed to check the sanity of the application: before the
real call is made and after the real call returns. Making the most of the
time before the call proceeds is important as the call might block
indefinitely and thus we can detect deadlocks before actually placing the
call. </p>

<p>Before the call, we can check:</p>

<ul>
<li>whether the mutex will be acquired or released out of order; </li>
<li>whether the thread tries to lock a mutex it already acquired; </li>
<li>or whether it tries to unlock a mutex it does not owns; </li>
</ul>

<p>Before the call, we also store the information about which mutex the
thread is trying to acquire. After the call, we keep evidence of which
mutexes have been acquired or released by which thread. </p>

<pre class="code">
    void lp_lock_precheck_diagnose(const pthread_mutex_t *mutex)
    {
        int rc = -1; 
        /*Highest ranking mutex currently acquired by 'me'*/
        int maxmidx = LP_INVALID_IDX; 
        int midx = LP_INVALID_IDX; 
        pthread_t me = pthread_self(); 

        pthread_t             thr = LP_INVALID_THREAD; 
        const pthread_mutex_t *mtx = NULL; 

        /* Thread tries to lock a mutex it has already locked? */
        if ((rc=lp_is_mutex_locked(mutex, me)) != 0) {
            lp_report("Mutex M%lx is already locked by thread.\n", mutex); 
            lp_dump();
        } 

        /* Is mutex order respected? */
        maxmidx = lp_max_idx_mutex_locked(me); 
        midx = lp_mutex_idx(mutex); 
        if (midx &lt; maxmidx) {
            lp_report("Mutex M%lx will be locked out of order (idx=%d, crt max=%d).\n", 
                    mutex, midx, maxmidx); 
            lp_dump();
        }

        /* Will deadlock? Check for a circular chain. */
        lp_report("Checking if it will deadlock...\n");
        thr = me; 
        mtx = mutex; 
        while ((thr=lp_thread_owning(mtx)) != LP_INVALID_THREAD) {
            lp_report("  Mutex M%lx is owned by T%lx.\n", mtx, thr); 
            mtx = lp_mutex_wanted(thr); 
            lp_report("  Thread T%lx waits for M%lx.\n", thr, mtx); 

            if (mtx == LP_INVALID_MUTEX) 
                break; /*no circular dead; */

            if (0 != pthread_equal(thr, me)) {
                lp_report("  Deadlock condition detected.\n");
                lp_dump();
                break; 
            }
        }
    }

    void lp_unlock_precheck_diagnose(const pthread_mutex_t *mutex) 
    {
        int rc = -1; 
        int maxmidx = LP_INVALID_IDX, midx = LP_INVALID_IDX; 

        /* Thread tries to unlock a mutex it does not have? */
        if ((rc=lp_is_mutex_locked(mutex, pthread_self())) == 0) {
            lp_report("Attempt to release M%lx NOT locked by thread.\n", mutex); 
            lp_dump();
        } 

        /* Are mutexes released in reverse order? */
        maxmidx = lp_max_idx_mutex_locked(pthread_self());
        midx = lp_mutex_idx(mutex); 
        if (midx &lt; maxmidx) {
            lp_report("Mutex M%lx will be released out of order (idx=%d, crt max=%d).\n",
                    mutex, midx, maxmidx); 
            lp_dump();
        }
    }

<h3>On Heisenberg's uncertainty principle </h3>

<p>A word of caution: the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, in its general 
form, applies to software! In plain words, Heisenberg stated that observation 
of a system does modify the behavior of the observed system. In our case, the 
debug library affects the behavior of the application in at least two ways:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>First, there is now an extra mutex protecting the data collected by the 
  debug library. This mutex has to be acquired now by the observed threads and 
  thus comes to play into the deadlock game.  </li>
  <li>Secondly, bookkeeping takes time, no matter how fast and smart are the 
  data structures at the core of the library. And these extra times will 
  affect the way threads interact.  </li>
  </ul>
  
<p>Thus, it might happen that the debug library makes it easier to reproduce 
the deadlock. Or, on the contrary, it may make it harder to reproduce. </p>
