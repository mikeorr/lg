<h1>The Backpage</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/okopnik.html">Ben Okopnik</a></b></p>

<p> 
I sometimes wonder if all of life isn't a test; some sort of a game in
which we get a pat and handshake - once we've left the building - and a
hearty "well played, old fellow!" if we've given it our best. Wild guesses
and our common human need to imagine immortality for ourselves aside
(not that it's not a great conversation, but it would take a few bottles of
vodka, Russian-style, and at least a night or two to puzzle it all out), it
would all begin to Make Sense - as if life is supposed to do anything that
pedestrian.
</p>

<p>
To bring it all back down to earth, I'm talking about the fact that
meaningful events - call them "troubles", or call them "peak experiences",
or what have you - rarely come alone; usually, they show up as an entire
kit'o'stuff, and we poor humans have to bear up as best we can. The last
few months, for example, have been full of noise and trouble and craziness
and glory: there have been many upheavals here at LG, when we didn't know
whether it would live or die (the question is still somewhat pertinent, and
much depends on whether we get more people involved and <a
href="../131/lg_backpage.html">participating in the process</a>); my wife
and I took off cruising on our sailboat, something we'd been planning on
for several years; while in the midst of all this, we (just!) had a baby -
and the city of Charleston, South Carolina <a
href="http://www.postandcourier.com/news/2009/jul/25/baby_girl_born_aboard_boat90414/">
made much of the new arrival</a> since she was born right aboard our boat
in a marina owned by the city... it's been an amazing time, but I'm more
than ready for things to slow down, just a little. I really, really am.
There's such a thing as <em>wild fun</em>, and then there's completely bughouse
stark raving mad crazy insane - and lately, I've found myself tapping the
dial of the indicator to make sure that it's not stuck in the latter
position far too often. If anyone has a spare bit of Zen attitude, please
send me an email with that as an attachment...
</p>

<p>
As regards LG-related matters, we're proud to welcome our new volunteers,
writers, and columnists. <a href="../authors/bukoskey.html">Dan
Bukoskey</a> and <a href="../authors/biswas.html">Srijon Biswas</a> have
joined our proofreading and editorial staff; <a
href="../authors/silva.html">Anderson Silva</a> has been cranking out some
great tech material; <a href="../authors/kachold.html">Lisa Kachold</a> has
been doing stellar work with her security-related columns; and <a
href="../authors/trbovich.html">Pete Trbovich</a> joins our humor list with
his terrifically funny "Doomed to Obscurity" cartoons. Thank you, one and
all, for your great contributions to the Linux community!
</p>

<p>
In any case, it's late, and I'm off to seek my bed. I need my rest - there
are probably more adventures coming!

<p>
Ben is the Editor-in-Chief for Linux Gazette and a member of The Answer Gang.
</p>

<p>
<em>
Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became interested in electricity
at the tender age of six, promptly demonstrated it by sticking a fork into
a socket and starting a fire, and has been falling down technological
mineshafts ever since. He has been working with computers since the Elder
Days, when they had to be built by soldering parts onto printed circuit
boards and programs had to fit into 4k of memory (the recurring nightmares
have almost faded, actually.)
</p>

<p>
His subsequent experiences include creating software in more than two dozen
languages, network and database maintenance during the approach of a
hurricane, writing articles for publications ranging from sailing magazines
to technological journals, and teaching on a variety of topics ranging from
Soviet weaponry and IBM hardware repair to Solaris and Linux
administration, engineering, and programming. He also has the distinction
of setting up the first Linux-based public access network in St. Georges,
Bermuda as well as one of the first large-scale Linux-based mail servers in
St. Thomas, USVI.
</p>

<p>
After a seven-year Atlantic/Caribbean cruise under sail and passages up and
down the East coast of the US, he is currently anchored in northern
Florida. His consulting business presents him with a variety of challenges
such as teaching professional advancement courses for Sun Microsystems and
providing Open Source solutions for local companies.
</p>

<p>
His current set of hobbies includes flying, yoga, martial arts,
motorcycles, writing, Roman history, and <strike>mangling</strike> playing
with his Ubuntu-based home network, in which he is ably assisted by his <a
href="tanaka-okopnik.html">wife</a> and <a href="okopnik1.html">son</a>;
his Palm Pilot is crammed full of alarms, many of which contain exclamation
points.
</p>

<p>
He has been working with Linux since 1997, and credits it with his complete
loss of interest in waging nuclear warfare on parts of the Pacific Northwest.
