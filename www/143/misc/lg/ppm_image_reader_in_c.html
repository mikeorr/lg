Hi all,
</p>

<p>
Has anyone got a "ready-made" PPM image reading program in C? I have to meet
a deadline for a project, so it would really be useful if anyone could
provide me with such a program.
</p>

<p>
Thanks
</p>

<p>
Can't you just use display(1) from imagemagick?

<p>
It is not clear what you want/need. What is wrong with "open" (as in
the standard C library function to open a file and read it?
</p>

<p>
Probably you want the image to be read into a different format. So
unless the format is specified the question is not meaningful.

I am using "open", but just that I am getting terribly messed up with the
character encodings, Image header, etc.

<p>
Basically what I want is access to the individual pixels of the image for a
image filtering operation

<p>
Hope that information will enable you to help me!

<p>
Thanks

Sorry to be so obtuse to begin with. Anyway, you are probably look
for the netpbm library which does all these things and more.

<p>
Yeah. I was trying to first flirt with the libraries, but as I told earlier
I am fighting hard to meet a deadline for a publication. So i thought I will
just use the C library for working with Images.
</p>

<p>
Anyways thanks for the info!
