&gt; 
&gt; Sometimes upgrading an Linux distro to a recent version, yields an "No space
&gt; left on device" (usually /var);
&gt; For those not willing to use a tool to create, resize, grow a partition, a
&gt; simple artifice will do the trick:
&gt; 
&gt; CTRL-ALT-F2
</pre>

<p>
Upgrading from within X should be discouraged.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; # mv /var /home/user/? &lt;== or wherever space suffice
&gt; # cd /
&gt; # ls -s /home/user/var .
&gt; CTRL-ALT-F7
</pre>

<p>
I believe that would just be ALT-F7

I feel that you're right on general principles (the less complexity
involved, the better), but do you have a specific reason for saying
that?

Actually, both work.

<p>
Maybe I do, I just upgrade my laptop from Debian 5.06 to Debian 6.0. It
worked like a charm, and I did it in maintenace mode (booting with the
'single' kernel boot option). The main reason for doing this is that
almost no applications run, few files are used/locked and few libraries
are used. The post-install scripts (re)start some processes anyway.
</p>

<p>
Best,
Ren?.

If the upgrade breaks X you could be in real trouble, where the only way
out appears to be a reboot, which could be nasty depending on how
far into the upgrade you are.
</p>

<p>
This is fine if you know what you are doing and don't mind (or even
enjoy) the troubleshooting required to fix it, but if you rely on
mailing lists or forums etc, to get it fixed then it won't be so easy.
</p>

<p>
IOW, it is the people who will be required to help and need error/log
output who should be discouraging upgrading from X.

I suppose that all of that folds back into the "minimize complexity"
principle - especially since, as you say, things can indeed get rather
crunchy if X breaks during the installation (an install that breaks
part-way through can definitely give you lots of cause for unhappiness.)

It's been that way for quite a long time now; I recall discovering it by
accident around 1999 or so.

I'm still under the impression that you need Ctrl-Alt-Fn to get OUT of
a console running X, but it is sufficient to press Alt-Fn to switch
between text-consoles or back TO X. 
</p>

<p>
As a side note: "chvt n" on any console will do the same.

<p>
Almost. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> I remember 'chvt 7' "reliably" switching away from a console
and into some graphical limbo, with no way to get out of it, so I always
ended up rebooting... but that was years and years ago (Debian, as I
recall.) Probably doesn't apply any longer.

Just for those of us that never heard of chvt before (you got me
wondering there what key was chvt - mac maybe? :P)
