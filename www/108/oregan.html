<h1>Outliners and Mind mapping</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/oregan.html">Jimmy O'Regan</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>Outlining and mind mapping are two ways of representing
information. Both are useful for brainstorming and note taking
(among other things), but most importantly, both are excellent ways
of organising information. It should come as little surprise that
organising information is important to programmers, and, because
Linux is the operating system of choice for the discerning
programmer, there is a wealth of software available to assist with
these tasks.</p>

<p>I decided recently to get my life in order. Part of this was
accepting that not all self-help material is rubbish. (For as long
as I can remember, my father has been a devoted reader of self-help
-- reader, not follower -- so I've been soured on the whole concept
since my teenage years). Another part is simply organising
myself.</p>

<p>One of the habits I'm trying to break is the habit of keeping
notes on scraps of paper or in <a href=
"misc/oregan/mindmap.txt">random text files</a> scattered around
the place. Outliners and mind maps are useful in the quest to add
context and relationships to these otherwise random pieces of
information, and have been working out well for me so far.</p>

<h3>Outliners</h3>

<p>Outlining is a useful method for both note-taking and
brainstorming. An outline is a list of ideas, which are grouped by
sub-topic in a hierarchy. When writing an outline, only the key
points are used, which are later expanded upon if writing.</p>

<p>The above paragraph as an outline would look something like
this:</p>

<h4>Outlining</h4>

<ul>
<li>Uses:</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Note taking</li>

<li>Brainstorming</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>What is it?</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>List of ideas</li>

<li>Sub-topics</li>

<li>Hierarchy</li>

<li>Key points first</li>

<li>Expanded later</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Outliners are a type of software that allow the user to write a
document as an outline, to add detail to each point, and to hide
that detail so further points may be added.</p>

<p>Most modern word processors have outline facilities -- the
"Headings" view in OOWriter's "Navigator", for example. Although
there are standalone outliners available, such as <a href=
"http://www.duke.edu/~pat4/think/">Think</a>, the most interesting
outliners around are those for Emacs and Vim.</p>

<h3>Emacs Outline mode</h3>

<img src="misc/oregan/emacs-outline.png" alt=
"XEmacs in Outline mode"> 

<p>Emacs comes with an outline mode. This uses a very simple text
format: headings begin with an asterisk, and any text between
headings is counted as the text belonging to that heading. If the
text of a subheading is folded, this is shown as an ellipsis (...)
after the heading's title. (<a href=
"misc/oregan/emacs-outline.txt">example</a>)</p>

<pre>
* Top Level Heading

** Sub heading

This text will be hidden if the sub-heading is folded.

** Sub heading 2
*** Sub subheading
</pre>

<h3>The Vim Outliner</h3>

<img src="misc/oregan/tvo.png" alt="Vim Outliner"> 

<p><a href="http://bike-nomad.com/vim/vimoutliner.html">The Vim
Outliner</a> is, in my opinion, the best outliner available for
Linux. (However, this is probably because I use Vim as my main
editor: I prefer Emacs, but not after the beating Mandrake gave
it). Like Emacs's outline mode, it uses a simple text format (<a
href="misc/oregan/outlines.otl.txt">example</a>):</p>

<pre>
Top Level
    Sub-heading
    | Text 
    Another sub-heading
        Sub-sub-heading
        | More text
</pre>

<p>Like Emacs's outline mode, TVO allows headings and subheadings
to be folded. (Well, it would have to: otherwise it wouldn't be
much of an outliner). Different heading levels are colour-coded;
it's best to name an outliner file with the extension
<tt>.otl</tt>, so Vim will know to do this.</p>

<p>While reading about outliners on the Net, I found a DOS
outliner, <a href=
"http://www.outliners.com/thinkTank2Pc">ThinkTank</a>, from 1987.
This uses a simple <a href="misc/oregan/thinktank.txt">text
format</a> that is easily <a href=
"misc/oregan/tt2otl.pl.txt">converted</a> for use with Vim
Outliner.</p>

<h3>Mind Mapping</h3>

<p>Mind mapping is a way of representing information developed by
Tony Buzan that takes advantage of several aspects of how the brain
processes information. At its most basic, a mind map is similar to
an outline in tree form -- a tree turned on its side, using roots
as well as branches, but still a tree.</p>

<p>A mind map starts at a central concept. Top-level sub-topics
branch out from that on either side, lower-level branches from
those, and so on. With a paper mind map, when you come to the edge
of the page, you simply glue a new page to that edge and
continue.</p>

<p>So far, not much different to an outline.</p>

<p>An effective mind map makes use of different colours for each
branch: This makes each main sub topic stand out more, and assists
the brain in processing the data. It's also recommended that, where
possible, a mind map should have pictures: "A picture is worth a
thousand words" may be a clich&eacute;, but it's true.</p>

<h3>OPML</h3>

<p>While I'm talking about outliners, I should probably mention <a
href="http://www.opml.org">OPML</a>, which is best known as the
standard format for swapping <a href=
"misc/oregan/feeds.opml.txt">feed subscriptions</a>.</p>

<p>OPML stands for Outline Processor Markup Language. It has a very
simple structure: As with HTML, there are "head" and "body"
sections. Also as with HTML, the head section is used for meta
information -- tags like "title", "dateCreated", "dateModified",
"ownerName", and "ownerEmail" are self-explanatory;
"expansionState" is used to contain a comma-separated list of the
outlines that are expanded by default; "vertScrollState" contains
the number of the line that is to be displayed (after outlines have
been expanded); "windowTop", "windowLeft", "windowBottom", and
"windowRight" are used to set the window state.</p>

<p>In the body section, there is only one tag - "outline", which
can contain other outline tags, for the various levels of headings.
The outline tag can have any attribute, though "text" is common.
Most of these tags are ignored by feed readers, though, because
they mostly look for a link and a title. I've included a <a href=
"misc/oregan/sample.opml.txt">sample</a>.</p>

<p>Vim Outliner comes with a Ruby script that converts OPML to its
own format - I've also included sample output: <a href=
"misc/oregan/feeds.otl.txt">feeds.opml</a>, <a href=
"misc/oregan/sample.otl.txt">sample.opml</a>.</p>

<h3>FreeMind</h3>

<img src="misc/oregan/freemind.png" alt="Freemind"> 

<p><a href=
"http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">FreeMind</a>
is an open-source mind mapping program. It's written in Java, so it
runs fine on Linux. Freemind has several features that those who
are familiar with mind maps would expect; text and branch colours
may be changed, images may be added to nodes, and there are several
stock icons that can be added to branches or nodes as
mnemonics.</p>

<p>Although the developers say that FreeMind does not create mind
maps exactly according to Tony Buzan's original idea, it's close
enough as far as I remember. It does, however, add some extra
features that are not possible with paper-based mind maps: Branches
and their nodes may have hyperlinks attached to them, and mind maps
can be exported as HTML.</p>

<p><img src="misc/oregan/freemind-graphic.png" alt=
"Mindmap with embedded graphics"></p>

<p>FreeMind is easy to use: To add a node to a branch, press the
'Insert' key, and type. To change a node into a branch..., press
the 'Insert' key. Nodes and branches can be cut and pasted;
individual branches can be exported as HTML as well as the entire
mind map; all options for formatting the node/branch are available
by right-clicking on it. As with an outliner, branches can be
collapsed (or expanded) by pressing "Space", and nodes can be
easily navigated with the arrow keys.</p>

<p>Two things worth mentioning are that inserting a graphic (by
choosing <tt>Node-&gt;Set Graphic</tt> from the context menu, or by
typing <tt>Alt-K</tt>) replaces any text that was in the node; the
other is that you can show that two nodes are related, even if they
are in different branches, by holding <tt>Ctrl-Shift</tt> and
dragging and dropping one node on top of the other. This draws a
line between the two, which happily does not cover the text of any
nodes in the way.</p>

<p>I've included some examples which show how I've used FreeMind --
mostly for summarising information, like when I wanted to find out
about <a href="misc/oregan/SNIA_CIFS.mm.txt">CIFS</a>, or about <a
href="misc/oregan/ComedyWritingSecrets.mm.txt">comedy writing</a>
(though that, in turn, was based on an outline I found on the
Internet), though I also used it to represent the decision-making
process behind my <a href="misc/oregan/Hair.mm.txt">haircut</a>, to
represent <a href="misc/oregan/jimregan-orig.mm.txt">my
bookmarks</a> (see below), and to just have a set of <a href=
"misc/oregan/colours.mm.txt">ridiculous-looking bubbles</a>. I've
also added a second version of <a href=
"misc/oregan/ComedyWritingSecrets-links.mm.txt">comedy writing</a>
that shows the difference having links between different nodes
makes.</p>

<h3>Delicious Mind</h3>

<p>Delicious Mind is a Python script, available <a href=
"http://www.brownhen.com/2004_08_01_backhen.shtml#109162377529043354">
here</a> that converts entries in <a href=
"http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> to a FreeMind mind map. (I've
included a <a href="misc/oregan/delicious_mind.py.txt">local
version</a> that follows del.icio.us's request that scripts
identify themselves, as well as <a href=
"misc/oregan/delicious_rdf.py.txt">my own version</a> that
generates <a href="misc/oregan/jimregan.rdf.txt">rdf</a> -- thanks
are due to <a href="http://www.brownhen.com/">Ian Oeschger</a>, who
for allowing me to publsih my version).</p>

<p>For those who don't know, del.icio.us is an online public
bookmarking system that has superceded the browser's built-in
bookmark facilities for many people. Del.icio.us entries are not
filed in folders like traditional bookmarks; instead, each entry is
tagged with keywords, from which delicious generates a list of
folders.</p>

<p>Del.icio.us also allows users to see who else has bookmarked
each entry, as well as providing folders of popular tags, which
contain items from each user who uses that tag. Del.icio.us also
provides feeds, so people can subscribe to each other's bookmarks.
Items may also be sorted by date, for a particular user, or for all
users, and the main page contains a list of the most recently added
bookmarks.</p>

<p>Del.icio.us provides a public API so people can easily access
and manipulate their own bookmarks from scripts. Delicious mind
takes advantage of this; it takes a list of tags, which are then
defined as second level branches, and populates them with nodes of
each bookmark in that category. (XML fans can rejoice: del.icio.us
sends its information as a simple XML format that can easily be
processed with some <a href="../106/oregan2.html#xsl">simple
xsl</a>).</p>

<p>As well as providing a way of visualising your bookmarks, this
can be coupled with FreeMind's HTML export to maintain a local copy
of your del.icio.us bookmarks -- like all popular Web sites,
del.icio.us tends to suffer occasional periods of down time. (Have
a look at the <a href="misc/oregan/jimregan.mm.html">HTML
export</a> of <a href="misc/oregan/jimregan.mm.txt">this file</a>
compared with the <a href=
"misc/oregan/delicious.html">del.icio.us</a> version).</p>
