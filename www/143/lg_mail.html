<p>You may have noticed the absence of Mailbag, Talkback, and other
mail-related features of LG in the previous edition (LG#142) - your Mailbag
Editor was engaged in an urgent project launch (the birth of our son,
Michael Kaishu Okopnik) just as the LG editorial cycle started. I'm
compiling this edition with the "help" of our newest staffer, who waves his
first "Hello, World!" to the LG readership.<br>

<p>
I do not understand how to implement negative arguments as documented in
the following excerpts from the Bash Reference Manual, Chapter 8.
Command Line Editing, Section 8.4 Bindable Readline Commands,
sub-section 8.4.3 Commands for Changing Text:
</p>

<pre>
|upcase-word (M-u)|
    Uppercase the current (or following) word. With a negative argument,
    uppercase the previous word, but do not move the cursor.
 
|downcase-word (M-l)|
    Lowercase the current (or following) word. With a negative argument,
    lowercase the previous word, but do not move the cursor.
 
|capitalize-word (M-c)|
    Capitalize the current (or following) word. With a negative
    argument, capitalize the previous word, but do not move the cursor.
</pre>
Pressing ALT-u, ALT-l, or ALT-c to uppercase, lowercase, or capitalize
the current (or following) word is very straightforward.
</p>

<p>
But for the life of me I'm baffled as to what they mean, "With a
negative argument," to uppercase, lowercase, or capitalize the previous
word.
</p>

<p>
What negative argument? From where? What keystroke(s)? I'm lost as to
how to uppercase, lowercase, or capitalize the previous word.
</p>

<p>
What am I missing in their explanation?
</p>

<p>
Thank you in advance!

<p>
My sound isn't working right.  How do I fix it?
</p>

<p>
Seriously, I upgraded from Kububtu 6.10 to 7.04 in a different root
partition, though they're sharing the same home partition.  Now where
the old system makes a big sound, the new system makes a teensy-weensy
little sound.  I go back and startle the neighbors; I sally ho (or ho
Sally), and I have to wait till the refrigerator shuts off to hear the
sound.
</p>

<p>
The configuration in both appears to be identical.  KInfoCenter says
it's a VIA 8237 device with ALC655, Type 10 ALSA emulation.  KMix has
"Master" and "PCM" unmuted and their volumes near maximum.  In the
Switches tab, all the lights are off except "External Amplifier",
which doesn't do anything either way.
</p>

<p>
The KDE Peripherals dialog has "Enable the sound system", "Run with
the highest possible priority", "sound buffer as large as possible",
"auto-suspend if idle after 60 seconds", "autodetect audio device",
"default quality", "Midi through midi through port-0 - ALSA device".
The test sound is quiet and distorted on the new system, but loud and
clear on the old one.

&gt;Hi , my name is Jimmy,can anyone help me fix the time on my PC.  I
&gt;change the Battery so many time ,I mean the new CMOS Battery ,but my
&gt;time is still not read correct
</pre>

<p>
What hardware are you using? Which operating system do you use on top of
this hardware? What did you try to keep the system clock in sync?
</p>

<p>
Modern PC hardware has several time sources, and not all mainboards
have reliable counters for keeping the time in synchronisation. The CMOS
battery may be one source of problems, but if you use an operating
system with a Linux kernel it will read the time from the nonvolatile
RAM on your board only once when booting. If you correct your time after
that you may have to write it to the nonvolatile RAM on your board. This
can be done with commands such as "hwclock --systohc" or similar.
</p>

<p>
Here is some information on the difficult task of keeping the system
time sufficiently accurate:

&gt; [...]
&gt; I seem to recall a couple of programs in the Debian kit that do
&gt; something like this by feeding random data to apps, but this one seems
&gt; to be a real star. E.g., <a href="http://sam.zoy.org/zzuf/lol-firefox.gif">http://sam.zoy.org/zzuf/lol-firefox.gif</a> crashes
&gt; my Firefox (1.5.0.11) very nicely - one-click functionality. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<p>
It does even crash the latest 2.0.0.6 Iceweasel with the same one-click
functionality. Maybe one of the libraries doesn't like it.=20

<p>
Hello all,
</p>

<p>
GIMP plugins extend GIMP, we know that.
</p>

<p>
Is there any way to make GIMP plugins themselves extensible. My point
here is that, can we make a GIMP plugin which allows itself modifiable
by a end-user to include a new functionality without much of a hassle
on part of the end-user. Does any one know of a method to do this or
any GIMP plugin which already does this?
</p>

<p>
I would appreciate even the slightest of insights.
</p>

<p>
Thanks a lot!

Hi all,
</p>

<p>
Its been a long time since this thread was alive. Well, during this
phase I just completed a project report, completely prepared in LATEX,
my first. I used Kile (kile.sourceforge.net) for my purpose. I was too
dumb probably to either even try the Vim or Emacs extensions as
suggested.
</p>

<p>
oh yes, the report has got such a neat, professional look to it.
Thanks to Latex!
</p>

<p>
Thank you all for all the suggestions.

Hey Gang,
A question about computer "generated" random numbers, in short how
random are they really?
</p>

<p>
I was trying to write this little perl script to play random songs and
I noticed it tends to repeat a certain collection of songs (which
changes everyday, or even every couple of hours). So what's really
happening?
</p>

<p>
Thanks.

Hi,

<p>
I read that you are using the above Shuttle and I am thinking about
getting one myself. I was wondering though what graphics did you use
and whether it is so silent that you do not notice it or that you can
hear it but it is not bothering at all. I am thinking about getting a
8800gts, but am not sure whether it will be too loud for the system..
I would appreciate your info!

hello,

I have been facing a couple of "weird" issues on Debian 4.0

<p>
1. Every time (on a new boot) I have to "listen" to a video song, I
have to run "alsaconf". I can see the video and listen to audio files
but not the video songs until i run "alsaconf"
</p>

<p>
2. GCC reports linker error while using "sin", "cos", etc. However it
is solved when i append a "-lm" during compilation

<p>
Waiting for some insights!

It's not a straight upgrade -- the design of XMMS2 is completley different
to XMMS1.  You can't compare the two.  In many respects, XMMS2 mimicks how
MPD works, in that it's a client/server idea.

The GUi tools for it are all still in development.  It lacks anything like
ncmpc for the console though, alas.  Something I am considering porting,
actually.

Hi all,
</p>

<p>
Has anyone got a "ready-made" PPM image reading program in C? I have to meet
a deadline for a project, so it would really be useful if anyone could
provide me with such a program.
</p>

<p>
Thanks
</p>
