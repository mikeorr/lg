James:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have been going over all the back issues of the Linux gazette (and
many books and articals) looking for info on setting up a Linux(5.1)
machine  as an ISP to serve e-mail to customers.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
In a test sceneraio I hava created new accounts with passwords
and sent them e-mail from an outside( through another ISP), but trying
to find the info on how to retrive the e-mail is very difficult.  My
intent was to use POP3, and aparentaly I have to configure inetd.conf to
run POP3 and  allow others access to ther accounts.
</STRONG></P>

On most distributions POP and various servers are enabled
by default.  Normally it's wise edit <TT>/etc/inetd.conf</TT> to
<EM>disable</EM> POP and other services.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When you created these accounts --- one thing you should
probably do is disable user access to shell (login) services
by setting their shell to <TT>/bin/false.</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Actually there is a problem with that, too.  It gets a bit
complicated by the fact that <TT>/bin/false</TT> on many Linux and
other Unix systems is actually a shell script.  You'd think
that a shell script that does an immediate <EM>exit</EM> would be
safe enough.  However, 'telnetd' and some other services will
propagate certain types of environment variables to the
login shell.    It's possible (using some shell quoting
hackery) to trick <TT>/bin/false</TT> (the shell script) into
executing arbitrary chunks of shell code if they aren't
filtered by the telnet daemon.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, you should compile your own binary equivalent of
false --- actually I wrote my own I call "<tt>denysh</tt>" as
shown here:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
	/* denysh
	 *	by: James T. Dennis,  &lt;jim@starshine.org&gt;
	 *	    Proprietor, Starshine Technical Services
	 *
	 * 	Deny a user shell access.  Intended for use as
	 * 	the "shell" for POP mail, FTP only and other users
	 *	who are supposed to be restricted to non interactive
	 *	use of the system.
	 *
	 * 	Usage:  using vipw you can replace the "shell" field
	 *	of any user's account record in the /etc/passwd with
	 *	the full path to this binary.  You can also add this
	 *	to /etc/shells and (as root) use the chsh command to
	 *	apply this (no need to edit /etc/passwd if that bothers
	 *	you).
         *
         *  compile with:
	 *                   gcc -static -o denysh denysh.c
         *
         *  to prevent any chance for shared library (LD_PRELOAD)
	 *  exploits
	 */

int main () {
  char *message= "Access Denied:  Your account is not"
		" permitted interactive login!\n";
  write (STDERR_FILENO, message, strlen(message));
  exit(1);
}
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... just compile that and read the comments.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I also recommend setting the home directories
of "POP Only" users to some directory that they
<em>don't</em> own, to which they do not have any 
other access, and also denying them FTP access.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course if your customers have special needs
--- for example they intend to run 'procmail'
on your server, etc --- then you'll need to review
your policies and make your own decisions.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course, most sites don't secure their systems
all that well.  So many sites will continue to
use the <TT>/bin/false</TT>, and they'll occasionally see
their "POP Only" users (or people who've sniffed
or stolen the passwords for their users) subvert
the "<TT>/bin/false</TT>" into full interactive shell access.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course if your system is using PAM there are
ways that you can limit specific users and groups
to specific services (particularly using the 'listfile'
module.  PAM is the default authentication model
for <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> Inc's 
distribution --- and it can
be installed on other systems as you like.  It's
also possible to limit access to services based
on where the request is coming from.  Thus it's
pretty easy to institute a policy that allows
'telnet' and other forms of access from your
local LAN while denying it to anyone whose
request is coming from an "outside" system.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If your going to run an ISP system you'll want to
learn quite a bit more about Linux security than
the average sysadmin.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Shamless plug: I'll be giving a tutorial on
the subject at the upcoming LinuxWorld Expo:

any Help that you can give will be much apriciated.

ps. I got handed this job under protest saying I  am willing to learn
( I come from the land of windows and dos where everything is in one
directory not scattered around {what is up with that anyway} ), and I am
reading everything that I can, but there are still many many holes, the
local groups are some help, but the continued refference to read the man
pages  helps little. I hardly under stand what they are saying 1/2 the
time.  just venting i guess

I've never seen an MS-DOS or Windows system where
"everything is in one directory" --- even if you consider
the Win '9x "Registry" --- that is more of a "virtual file
system" than a "single file" (since it has many "sub trees"
and "nodes").
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Indeed, you'd find (if you'd studied any operating systems
beyond MS-DOS, Windows, and Unix) that the similarities
between MS-DOS and Unix are somewhat greater than their
differences.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, the Unix, and consequently the Linux, convention
is to use relatively simple text files for configuration of
almost all services.  System services are almost all
controlled by files under the <TT>/etc</TT> directory tree.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The use of text files allows for easy repair, auditing and
relatively easy automation of changes (since awk, Perl
and other text processing scripts can be written to
modify many settings on systems across a network.  It's also
possible to distribute new configuration files (including
passwd and group files to update user account information)
over the net.  This is facilitated by having separate
files for different services.

Well, one approach would be to just "go with the flow" ---
just enable the POP daemon support in inetd and let the
users access whatever <EM>other</EM> services they like.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Professionally your best bet is to recommend that a
consultant be placed on retainer to help you set up
each new service as requested.  That consultant should
review your needs, show you how to install/configure the
service and give you some pointers on maintaining it.
It would be a good idea to have that consultant --- or
better yet, a different one --- come in to do periodic
systems administration and security audits.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In this way you get the help you need, the services
installed and configured by someone whose done it before,
some training, and a direction to which you can escalate
emergencies.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If your boss expects you to "just do it" and expects it
to all get done right and in a timely fashion, and refuses
to provide you with the additional resources (consultants,
training, time, leeway to mess things up, whatever) then
you should definitely consider your negotiating position.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(Many employers exhibit unreasonable expectations in this
field.  They've fallen victim to the lies of software
company marketeers that have been chanting "ease of use"
for the last two decades.  A lot of software is only
"easy to use" if you want to do it "their way" and accept
whatever limitations and flaws --- particularly security
flaws --- it shipped with.  However, many of these managers
will listen to reason --- and the <EM>really</EM> important part
of a sysadmin's job is to manage the expectations of his or
her users and management).
