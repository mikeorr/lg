I'm very new to Linux but like what I see

The object here is to install a software that will filter all my e-mails and
keep out viruses

Look into Amavis (www.amavis.org) and your favorite anti-virus software
(Sophos, McAffee, etc.). If you're using Postfix as your MTA, drop me a
line and I can help you get the three of them working.

Check out Spam Assassin (www.spamassassin.org).  It rocks!

With any mail filtering answers I encourage you to take a look at its
principles, and decide if you like them, rather than just take someone
else's word on what is or isn't spam.

LWN seem to rate bogofilter, see <A HREF="http://lwn.net/Articles/9186"
	>http://lwn.net/Articles/9186</A>. I haven't
used it myself.

I currently use "bogofilter" and am very happy with it. There are also
alternatives such as "spamoracle" and "spamprobe". All these three
programs implement Paul Graham's suggestions in "A Plan for Spam".
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
As far as I can make out "spamassasin" is a much more general tool that
can easily incorporate the measurements used by Paul Graham.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The neatness of Paul Graham's approach is that it is entirely
"Bayesian" --- spam mails self-select themselves once we have a
sufficiently large database of spam and non-spam messages. Moreover,
this division is entirely in the hands of the end-user.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
On the other hand since this measurement is made <EM>after</EM> the mail enters
the system it is not very useful if you want to reduce bandwidth
consumption.

I have 2 NIC cards, etho1 and
etho2. Both were picked up by my install and both work, I can get out to the
Internet with either one. I need help configuring etho1 to be the incoming
route for my e-mails which my software will then pick up and process and
then I want etho2 to send it out to my users.

I have been all over the Internet and in the book stores, I even had to
break down and buy a Linux book for dummies which was no help at all.

I think what you need is to take a hard look at Firewall-HOWTO.

With Linux, almost anything is possible.

I would be so appreciative and so would my head (because then I can quit
banging it against my desk) for any and all help you could provide.

	> [Heather] On behalf of the Gang, we hope you heal up soon!  You're following good
principles;  make all emails have to follow one path into your site,
then place some guardians upon that path to nail the miscreants as they
come through.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Tune up your firewall to only show services to the outside world which
you really provide, and that needed for your inside people to get to
outside services they use (generally, using IP masquerading will make
this automatic and nearly invisible).  If you've got specific hosts
pestering you with spam, get your MTA to blow them off with a "551
too much spam, site blocked" so your mailbox guardians don't have to
waste CPU time on those bozos.  Best of luck in the battle against spam.
