Spammer Alan Ralsky Finally Indicted
</p>

<p>
[...]
The charges include: "conspiracy, fraud in connection with electronic
mail, computer fraud, mail fraud and wire fraud." That's because Ralsky
wasn't just spamming products for sale, he was using a botnet to run a
pump-and-dump scam on Chinese penny stocks. It's unclear why it took
over two years for the indictment to finally show up, but there are
likely to be quite a few folks in the anti-spam community who are
thrilled that something finally happened to Ralsky.

SWallace, our HUGE judgment could make your life STAY HARD FOREVER
</p>

<p>
Don't look for it to show up on the bottom line, but MySpace has won a
$234 million default judgment against notorious "Spam King" Sanford
Wallace and his associate (Spam Prince?) Walter Rines for bombarding its
members with more than 730,000 pieces of junk mail, often disguised as a
note from a friend. The award is believed to be the largest anti-spam
judgment ever rendered, but it might as well have been $234 bazillion
for all the good it will do MySpace. The reason it was a default
judgment is that Wallace and Rines are nowhere to be found, and when
they are, the News Corp. social site will have to get in line with the
victors in previous cases. [...]
