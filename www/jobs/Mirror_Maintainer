Come up with a plan (appropriate time and method) for checking mirror
synchronization; determine a reasonable number of contact attempts / time
without contact for dropping the sites that are no longer maintaining

Time commitment: 
	Research phase: unknown
	Maintenance phase: less than 1 hour per month
