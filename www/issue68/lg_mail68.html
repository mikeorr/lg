<P>
There is a tool to monitor kernel parameters and to change the limits. I
explain better: I'd like to have a look in some occasions if there is some
kernel parameter which has reached its limit, and have the possibility to
change it. Moreover I'd like to see anyway ALL kernel parameters available
to set them to optimize it. With HP-UX there is a tool (SAM) which makes
this work. Any idea for a Linux box ?
Thanks in advance

Hi:
</P>
<P>
Is there a programming interface through which I can find out type of hard
disk ( SCSI/RAID)? I have Suse Linux 7.1 (x86) with two SCSI hard disks and
one SCSI is connected through AMI megaraid hardware RAID controller. RAID
driver is megarid and lsmod displays it.
</P>
<P>
I need to find out which is RAID/SCSI ? I looked at <TT>/proc/scsi/scsi</TT> but that
didn't tell which is SCSI/RAID.
</P>
<P>
But another <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> 7.1 system  having Mylex h/w RAID controller and DAC driver
has <TT>/proc/rd/c*d*</TT> entry.
</P>
<P>
1. So why not there is an entry <TT>/proc/rd/c*d*</TT> on system which has AMI RAID controller?
</P>
<P>
2. Is there any ioctl through which I can find out which disk is SCSI/RAID, if device name ( <TT>/dev/sda</TT> , <TT>/dev/sdb</TT> etc.) is given.
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">...in a later mail he added...
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
<P>
I looked at scsi generic interface(sg ) but as I understand It cann't be used for all the types of RAID Controllers.( Mylex DAC, Compaq smart array etc.)
A generic interface like sg which works for all the RAID controllers will be very helpful.
</P>
<P>
I looked at looked  <TT>/proc/scsi/scsi</TT> and <TT>/proc/rd/c*</TT> but that may vary , so if I have to use <TT>/proc</TT> then I have to hardcode <TT>/proc</TT> pathname.
</P>
<P>
I will be very thankful if somebody tells me how do I do this.
</P>
<P>
Thanks in advance.

<P>
Can I use <TT>/proc/partitions</TT> which will give all the disks then I can filter out
IDE by looking at <TT>/proc/ide</TT> , SCSI by <TT>/proc/scsi/scsi</TT> and remaining becomes

<BR>James P. Harlos (<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net?cc=harlos@localnet.com">harlos from localnet.com</a>)

<P>
For reasons which seemed good to me at the time I switched distos and
upgraded to RH 7.1.  After some work everything seems to be ok except
for sound.  However, I got a big surprise when I tried to load
WordPerfect 8 from CD.  This is a purchased copy of WP 8 Personal
Edition that worked fine.  The install script would not run!  I went to
<A HREF="http://linux.corel.com/">Corel</A>'s site.  They apparently don't help people who purchased their
product.  In any event they seem to be more concerned with their new
product WP 2000.  On one of their user group boards there was a tread
concerning this, suggesting the problem was in the initial install
script, install.wp.  Well the long and short of it is I made the changes
suggested with no change in behavior.  Do you have any answer?
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">We don't have the script at hand, but someone who does might tell you
haw they forced it to install correctly.  Which needn't be by using
what Corel provided.
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
<P>
I find it unfortunate that Corel takes the path of install scripts
rather than RPM or even tarballs.  I used WP way back under DOS and
liked it.  I liked it even more when the first verions of Word came
out.  Sadly, WP rested on their laurels and their product withered.
When Corel brought out WP for Linux I thought this was good, tried out
the free download, liked it and bought it in version 8.  After this I
will not buy another Linux product from Corel.  Enough soapbox.
</P>

I have a motherboard GA 7ZX with a Creative PCI 128 sound chip. I have
installed RedHat 6.0 (I got the CD from a magazine). First of all I could
not initialize XWindows cause it did not recognize the Rage 128. I
downloaded and instal XFree86 4.02 and it worked.
</P>
<P>
But I have not been able to put the PCI 128 to work, the sistem just did not
find the chip. I have read the Sound How TO but it looked rather criptic to
a newby. Could you give me some advice. Please take into account I am quite
new in Linux.

then you should also copy the author of the HOWTO you're going to be
looking at.  But we'd love to see an article about just getting sound
going so you can play cute "tada" sounds and talk to your computer.

In my previous version of Netscape (4.75) gzip'ed HTML

Thanks SO MUCH for answering! Now I know that my letter  did infact

I hope that my "interesting questions" generate some "food for thought"

programmers to code using the linux kernal (along with the NSA)! I hope that
"far-reaching" programs like the two I have initiated will garner monetary
support somehow!

Read your post at June's Linux Gazette - And, it might be a good thing
to document the long and sometimes frustrating journey from the Windows
to *nix camps.
</P>
<P>
I once heard a teacher put it the best I've yet heard it.
</P>
<P>
Imagine a graph.
</P>
<P>
Windows gets you started and going quickly (line rises sharply) but you
rapidly run into the limitations of the system and Operating System, so
very quickly your productivity levels off.
</P>
<P>
*nix, on the other hand, has a steep learning curve, so steep that at
first your productivity actually DIPS (line drops below the "0" line) at
first, until you start to "get it". Then, as your knowledge accumulates
(took me about a year of using Linux primarily before I really "got
it") the productivity climbs, and just keeps climbing with how much you
learn.
