Hi there,
<br>I have read that Linux has a compiler for fortran but cannot find it in the
OS.  Is it the GNU software that does it and could you please tell me what
extension I would save my file as?  You help would be greatly appreciated.

Part of what is now called the Gnu Compiler Collection, gcc.  Which
includes C, C++, Objective C, Fortran, and others I no doubt fail at
the moment to recall.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Fortran may be invoked as
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
g77
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
on source files with suffix ".f", ".for", or ".FOR".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If g77 is not installed on your machine, check your distribution; it is
quite likely present in the distribution.

A couple of years ago I had a group of rocket scientist (aeronautics
engineers, actually) who asked me to come in and help this with a little
old dual processor Linux box which was only staying up for about a
week at a time.  (That's an abysmal stability record for Linux).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
They were running a 2.0.x kernel with SMP enabled on thing; which was
never a good idea.   I fetched and built a newer kernel and it was
fine (it was a beta/developmental kernel --- but even those usually
give much better uptimes than 1 week; so I didn't consider it to be
much of a risk.  The box was used solely for computation; so no other
services or files were at risk.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Anyway, the manager there explained to me that the engineers in his
group all wanted to use this particular machine instead of their
Sun UltraSPARCs, their HP's and their other RISC boxes --- because
they had found that the best Fortran compiler for them was from NAG
(Numerical Algorithms Group:  <A HREF="http://www.nag.com"
	>http://www.nag.com</A>).  NAG makes a
commercial Fortran compiler and a number of libraries and other
software products.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, yes.  There are fortran compilers for Linux.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is a GNU fortran compiler; which is called g77; this
is a Fortran '77 compiler which produces an intermediate code
and then uses gcc to produce the optimized machine binaries.
(<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/fortran/fortran.html"
	>http://www.gnu.org/software/fortran/fortran.html</A>).  It's apparently
considered to be part of the GCC (GNU compiler collection) at this
point.  I'm not qualified to comment on wether g77 is any good,
or how closely it conforms to the 1977 ANSI specification or anything
like that.  I notice that some of the Fortran '90 enhancements are
supported, so g77 is as archaic as the '77 might imply).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Thanks very much for your help!  I was about to try that to see if it
worked.  I do not believe the g77 is installed on my system.  I still have
to apply the Errata updates, maybe then it will install the g77.
