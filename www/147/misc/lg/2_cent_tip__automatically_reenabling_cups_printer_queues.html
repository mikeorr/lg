<p>
Hello!
</p>

<p>
I have a short shell script fragment for you. It automatically reenables
a printer queue on a CUPS printing server. CUPS takes different actions
when a print job encounters a problem. The print server can be
configured to follow the error policy "abort-job", "retry-job" or
"stop-printer". The default setting is "stop-printer". The reason for
this is not to drop print jobs or to send them to a printer that is not
responding. Beginning with CUPS 1.3.x you can set a server-wide error
policy. CUPS servers with version 1.2.x or 1.1.x cna only have a
per-printer setting.
</p>

<p>
If you have a CUPS server an wish the print queue to resume operation
automatically after they have been stopped, you can use a little shell
script to scan for disabled printers (stopped printing queues) and
reenable them.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh
#
# Check if a printer queue is disabled and reenable it.
 
DISABLED=3D`lpstat -t | grep disabled | awk '{ print $2; }'`
 
for PRINTER in $DISABLED
do
        logger "Printer $PRINTER is stopped"
        cupsenable -h 127.0.0.1:631 $PRINTER &amp;&amp; logger "Printer $PRINTER has been enabled."
done
</pre>
This script can be executed periodically by crontab or by any other
means.
</p>

<p>
Best,
Ren&eacute;.
</p>

What does this return?  I am assuming a tokenised list of printers
separated by whitespace?  (It would have to be since you've not
modified IFS anywhere...)  Note though:

DISABLED="$(lpstat -t | awk '/disabled/ { print $2 }')"

I've always preferred writing such things where one makes -use- of
their tools at hand, especially allowing awk to conditionally do the
matching.  No need for grep here.  I also like $() for command
substituion, and before anyone goes off on portability, I'll
compromise with you:  $() is nestable unlike backticks, and if you
have a shell old enough not to understand $() you don't deserve to be
using it in the first place.  :P

<pre>

</pre>

<p>
Quotes.  Use more quotes:
</p>

<pre>
for PRINTER in "$DISABLED"

<p>
Technically, backticks are nestable, but the nesting is extremely ugly,
especially after 2 levels or so:
</p>

<pre>
echo "`echo \`echo word \\\`echo foo \\\\\\\`echo bar\\\\\\\`\\\`\``"
</pre>

<pre>
&gt; and if you have a shell old enough not to understand $() you don't
&gt; deserve to be using it in the first place.  :P
</pre>

<p>
In other words, $() is defined in POSIX, and, while there are shells that
predate this standard, it is portable to every modern UNIX-like system
(except Solaris, where /bin/sh is still pre-POSIX - I might be wrong,
though).
</p>


<pre>
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; for PRINTER in $DISABLED
&gt; 
&gt; Quotes.  Use more quotes:
&gt; 
&gt; ``
&gt; for PRINTER in "$DISABLED"
&gt; ''
</pre>

<p>
In this case, they are not relevant - word splitting is expected (and
quotes prevent it from happening), because one is trying to iterate over
words in the variable:
</p>

<pre>
karolis@EN6350:~$ var="foo boo moo"
karolis@EN6350:~$ for entry in $var; do echo "$entry"; done
foo
boo
moo
karolis@EN6350:~$ for entry in "$var"; do echo "$entry"; done
foo boo moo
</pre>
As you can see, when one is using quotes, then echo is called just once
on the variable (and $entry is set to the entire contents of $var),
which is not the desired behaviour.

Quite.  I meant to quote PRINTER further down.

<p>
Yes, this was the idea, and it did just that after some tests.

&gt; &gt; DISABLED=3D`lpstat -t | grep disabled | awk '{ print $2; }'`

<p>
That's a good idea. I think you just upgraded the little script to
version 0.2. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)"> CUPS before 1.3.x not having a global error policy
is something that bothers me more.
