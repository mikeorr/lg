<p>
New year greetings to all <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">)
</p>

<p>
This is no new year resolution to switch from current window manager
but wanted to try my hands on coule of them for my home system.
</p>

<p>
Couple of them are : iceWM, fluxbox.
</p>

<p>
But, am finding hard to find the right doc / Google search result to
configure these WMs for FC5.
</p>

<p>
Can somebody help me here ?

<p>
Well, given the two you've mentioned, I immediately think of:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://icewm.org/">http://icewm.org/</a>  (Oddly enough has a documentation section).
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://fluxbox.org/">http://fluxbox.org/</a> (Oddly enough has a documentation section).
</p>

<p>
Of course, there's no accounting for just loading up the WM and messing
about with it.

These are the first set of sites, other than others, I browsed thru
the docs / FAQ pages specifically looking for configuration with
Fedora core 5, but could not find anything relevant to address the
problem in question.
</p>

<p>
Search is still on . . .

<p>
Without trying to be smart: what's the problem in question?
</p>

<p>
"I can run a new WM but don't know how to configure it"?
</p>

<p>
"I can't run a new WM because when I try something, something happens
but I expect something else to happen"?
</p>

<p>
"I start X using 'startx' and don't know what to change to get a new WM"?
</p>

<p>
"I start X using a display manager and don't know what to change to get
a new WM"?
</p>

<p>
"Something else entirely"?
</p>

<p>
I suspect that when you write down the very specific question you want
to ask, the path to the answer will be much clearer to you. Even if it
leads to another very specific question in short order.
</p>

<p>
And using words like "fedora change window manager" in a web search
might also point in a helpful direction.
</p>

<p>
In case it's of any use, I have a file in $PATH with the contents
<pre>
===
#!/bin/sh
startx $(which ${WM:-9wm}) -- :${XSRV:-9} $(which Xnest) -geometry 1024x768 -nolisten tcp
===
</pre>
which allows me play with a window manager in a sort-of-sandbox. Be
aware of the order in which programs see keypresses, though, because
nesting within a "greedy" window manager might cause a head-scratch.
</p>

<p>
Good luck,
</p>

That's not the problem; the problem is the fact that Xnest emulates both
an XServer and an XClient, and its implementation as to how key-bindings
are interpreted/propagated within itself and to the underlying XCient
(Xnest in this case) don't always tally -- the confusion lies solely
with Xnest in this regard.

<p>
That's certainly <strong>a</strong> problem, but wasn't what I was thinking of.
</p>

<p>
I was more considering where the main window manager handles some
keypresses itself, and where some client of the nested X server,
including the window manager, wants to be able to receive those same
keypresses.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully the window managers have a mechanism of sending any keypress
through to an app; my point was that in order to send a keypress through
to, for example, a client of the nested X server, you would need to take
account of the mechanisms of both window managers rather than just the
nested one. So it's not a "clean" window manager environment.
</p>

<p>
And that's because the main window manager gets to handle the keypress
before the nested X server (which then plays its own games before the
nested window manager sees anything).
</p>


<p>
I lied. I don't use Xnest to play with a window manager. I use it to play
with other applications under a window manager other than the one I
normally use.
</p>

<p>
And yes, running under Xnest does add some extra wrinkles. "sometimes
sticky control key" is one that catches me, but that could just be a
feature of how I use it.

I've mentioned this many times:

<p>
That all depends how the window manager handles key-bindings.
</p>

<p>
Not all of them operate on propagation alone.

&gt; "I can run a new WM but don't know how to configure it"?
</pre>
Yes, will be specific with my requirement:
</p>

<p>
1. Installed iceWM &amp; Fluxbox from their sources
</p>

<p>
2. Now, I do configure (Xsessions / xinitrc / some other file) to use
one of them as my new window manager
</p>

<p>
With the current system, I have a graphical login and use KDE.
</p>

<p>
I tried, after referencing various docs, playing around with files in
/etc/X11/xinit, but these changed did not help me in the final
objective.
</p>

<p>
Hence, my posting to TAG.
