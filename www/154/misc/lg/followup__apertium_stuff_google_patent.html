That's patentable?

&lt;spectie&gt; Answer: The problem is that software patents exist in some
ways in the EU. The power of patent governance is split between a
legislature, an executive, and a judiciary.
&lt;spectie&gt; The legislature (the European Patent Convention) says that
software ideas are not patentable.
&lt;spectie&gt; The executive (the European Patent Office) ignores this and
approves software patent applications.
&lt;spectie&gt; The judiciary (the national courts) usually declares the
EPO's software patents to be invalid whenever there is a court case.

<p>
Yes, this is true. Above all, some national patent offices (including
the Austrian one) give hints in workhops how to patent certain things
properly (i.e. how to write the patent application). This leads to tests
in court that require some amount of effort to kill these senseless
patents:

</p>

<p>
Despite the 2005 victory in European parliament software patents in
Europe are not dead yet. This remains an ongoing struggle...
</p>

<p>
...until they discover to abuse the Copyright law:

Me: Here is one apple; here is another apple. How many apples will you
get when we put them together?
Inna: Two.
Me: So, 1+1 is ... ?
Inna: Two.
Me: Good girl.
Inna: How much is 2+2?
Me: Shhh. We can't talk about that.
Inna: Why? Will a big bad wolf come and eat us?
Me: Sort of. It is copyrighted and I do not have enough money for the
private use license.
Inna: Did you spend all your money on a 1+1 license?
Me: No, honey. Google owns the rights and they released it for public
use.
Inna: What about 3+3?

"[0036]According to the MTS, the alternate translation has a low

Looks very similar to the sort of filtering done by
apertium-transfer-tools; the first
description I know of is here:

which predates Google's 'suggestion' stuff:

Descriptions like these are vague on purpose. They try to walk the line
between the minimum amount of information that must be given in order to
get the patent and the phrase that catches most other applications
working in a similar way. Findings wordings like this is the core of the
software/business methods/idea patent industry. While doing the protests
against the software patent directive we thought of implementing a
compiler for patent applications. You describe your idea vaguely in a
kind of programming language and the compiler spits out the whole
application form ready for submission. With the help of some linguists
this should be possible. It is a neat proof of concept why patenting
software is a bad idea.

That's good, because this means the "technology" was known before the
patent was filed. This can be used to invalidate the patent in court (or
to intimidate a "patent opponent" before going to court).
