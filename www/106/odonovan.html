<h1>Intrusion Detection with Tripwire</h1>

<h2>Intrusion Detection with Tripwire</h2>

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

A little over two years ago I was hacked. Someone broke into a web server I
was administrating that had only Apache and OpenSSH running publically, and
all packages were up-to-date. The hacker replaced my <code>ps</code> binary
with his own to hide his processes, added a new service that was executed
from the binary &#034;<code>/bin/crond&nbsp;</code>&#034; (the space is
intentional - it makes it look like a normal and an expected process in
a running-processes listing and a normal binary in a directory listing).
The &#034;<code>crond&nbsp;</code>&#034; process gathered usernames and
passwords and stored them in a text file in the directory
&#034;<code>/dev/pf0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;
/</code>&#034;, (5 and 2 spaces respectively), which also contained a
root shell. The chances of me finding and identifying this intrusion
would have been extremely remote if I had not been running Tripwire.

<p>
Tripwire is a file integrity checker for UNIX/Linux based operating systems
and works as an excellent intrusion detection system. It will not prevent an
intrusion; for this see my previous articles on <a
href="http://linuxgazette.net/103/odonovan.html">setting up firewalls</a> and
<a href="http://linuxgazette.net/105/odonovan.html">securing a Linux
distribution</a> for help. 

<p>
The idea behind Tripwire is quite simple: it first creates a
&#034;baseline&#034; database of the state of the files and directories on
your system and then on subsequent runs it compares the current state of the
files and directories against this baseline identifying any deletions,
additions or changes. The files and directories to be checked are decided by
a &#034;policy&#034; file. This file also defines what attributes to compare;
this can include access, inode and modification timestamps, owner and group
IDs, permissions, file size and type, MD5 and SHA hash values, etc.

<p>
In this article I will guide you through the process of getting and
installing Tripwire, configuring it and setting it up to run on a daily
basis. In the final section I will mention a few additional steps you can
take to ensure the integrity of your Tripwire database and thus your file
system.

<h3>2. Acquiring and Installing Tripwire</h3>

The easiest method of installing Tripwire is to use a vendor supplied
package (I have checked and these are available for RedHat/Fedora Core, SuSE,
Mandrakesoft and Debian). The advantages of using these is that the policy
file will be already created and configured for the system you are using.
Make sure to use official packages for your distribution to ensure they have not
been trojaned. 

<p>
If you cannot locate a precompiled package for your distribution, then you
can download the latest source code from <a 
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tripwire/" 
>http://sourceforge.net/projects/tripwire/</a>. The version available at 
time of going to press was
2.3.1-2. This version is dated March 2001 and when I tried to compile
it on my system I got a myriad of errors. The sources do not use
the autoconf/automake build system and this may be the main cause of
the errors. I have decided to place the resolution of these problems
outside the scope of this article given the availability of precompiled
packages for many distributions.

<h3>3. An Overview of Tripwire's Files</h3>

The operation of Tripwire is controlled by a configuration file and a
policy file; both of these files are encoded and signed before use
for security reasons. These files <em>usually</em> reside in 
<code>/etc/tripwire</code>. The plain text versions are called
<code>twcfg.txt</code> and <code>twpol.txt</code>, and the encoded and
signed versions are called <code>tw.cfg</code> and <code>tw.pol</code>. 
The plain-text version of the configuration file contains key-value pairs 
including the following required variables (default values for my 
distribution shown):
<pre>
POLFILE         = /etc/tripwire/tw.pol
DBFILE          = /var/lib/tripwire/$HOSTNAME.twd
REPORTFILE      = /var/lib/tripwire/report/$HOSTNAME-$DATE.twr
SITEKEYFILE     = /etc/tripwire/site.key
LOCALKEYFILE    = /etc/tripwire/$HOSTNAME-local.key
</pre>

<p>
The <code>POLFILE</code>, <code>DBFILE</code> and
<code>REPORTFILE</code> dictate the locations of the policy file, the
database file and the report file respectively. A report file is 
generated each time Tripwire is used to check the integrity of the
file system and its name is determined by both the hostname and current 
date. The <code>SITEKEYFILE</code> and <code>LOCALKEYFILE</code> variables 
hold the locations of the two key files; site keys are used for signing
files that can be used on multiple systems within an organisation such
as the policy and configuration files, while the local key is used for
files specific to this system such as the database file.

<p>
Ensure that the <code>$HOSTNAME</code> environment variable is correctly
set to your system's hostname before using any of Tripwire's commands. Also, 
the <code>HOSTNAME</code> variable in <code>twpol.txt</code> 
<strong>must</strong> be set correctly so that it matches the system's
hostname. If you are unsure of what the system's hostname is set to, then
execute <code>echo $HOSTNAME</code> on the command line.

<p>
Other configuration file values we will use are shown here followed
by a description of each:
<pre>
EDITOR                 =/bin/vi
MAILNOVIOLATIONS       =true
EMAILREPORTLEVEL       =3
REPORTLEVEL            =3
MAILMETHOD             =SENDMAIL
MAILPROGRAM            =/usr/sbin/sendmail -oi -t
</pre>

<dl>
<dt><code>EDITOR</code>
<dd>When updating the database after files have been added, removed or
altered, a &#034;ballot-box&#034; styled form must be completed by
placing an &#039;x&#039; opposite the files which we have changed and
do not indicate an intrusion; this variable sets the editor to use for
this process.
<dt><code>MAILNOVIOLATIONS</code>
<dd>Tripwire e-mails a report whenever a violation was found. This
option tells Tripwire to always e-mail a report whether a violation was
found or not. This is useful as it shows the system administrator that
Tripwire is running as expected.
<dt><code>EMAILREPORTLEVEL</code> and <code>REPORTLEVEL</code>
<dd>The amount of information Tripwire includes in its report file and
e-mail. Valid values range from 0 to 4 with the default being 3.
<dt><code>MAILMETHOD</code> and <code>MAILPROGRAM</code>
<dd>The mail method can either be <code>SMTP</code> (in which case
additional variables have to be set to indicate the SMTP host and port)
or <code>SENDMAIL</code> (in which case we include the
<code>MAILPROGRAM</code> variable).
</dl>

<p>
There are a number of other options and these are explained in the man
page: <code>TWCONFIG(4)</code>.

<p>
Creating your own policy file is a long and tedious task that is
also outside the scope of this article. If you get a packaged version of
Tripwire for your distribution then the policy file should already be
created. The policy file is essentially a list of rules and
associated files which should be checked by Tripwire; the rules
indicate the severity of a violation. The text version of the file
itself is quite readable and is worth a look to fully understand how
Tripwire works. Also, irrespective of your distribution, you will find
that Tripwire generates a lot of the following errors when checking the
filesystem:
<pre>
File system error.
Filename: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
No such file or directory
</pre>
For each of these errors there is an entry for the named file in the
policy file but this file does not exist on your system. You will
have to edit the policy file and comment out these
lines.

<p>
Tripwire comes with four binary files:
<dl>
<dt><strong><code>tripwire</code></strong>
<dd>The main file; used for initialising the database, checking the
integrity of the file system, updating the database and updating the
policy.
<dt><strong><code>twadmin</code></strong>
<dd>Tripwire's administrative and utility tool; used for creating and
printing configuration files, replacing and printing a policy file,
generating site and local keys and other encryption related functions.
<dt><strong><code>twprint</code></strong>
<dd>Used to print the reports and database in human-readable format.
<dt><strong><code>siggen</code></strong>
<dd>Generates the various hashes that Tripwire supports for checking
the integrity of files.
</dl>

<h3>4. Initialising the Keys and Database</h3>

<p>
In this section we will set Tripwire up so that you can use it on a
daily basis to check your systems integrity. I am assuming that the
current working directory is <code>/etc/tripwire</code> and that the
following files exist in the specified paths:
<table>
<tr>
    <td align="center"><code>/etc/tripwire/twcfg.txt</code>:
</td><td> plain-text version of the configuration file</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td align="center"><code>/etc/tripwire/twpol.txt</code>:
</td><td> plain-text version of the policy file</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The first step is to generate the keys to be used when
signing the database, policy file and configuration file.
You will be asked for a passphrase for each of the local and site keys;
it should be greater than 8 characters and include punctuation symbols
as well as alphanumeric characters.

<pre class="code">
[root@home /etc/tripwire]# twadmin --generate-keys --site-keyfile ./site.key

(When selecting a passphrase, keep in mind that good passphrases typically
have upper and lower case letters, digits and punctuation marks, and are
at least 8 characters in length.)

Enter the site keyfile passphrase: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Verify the site keyfile passphrase: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Generating key (this may take several minutes)...Key generation complete.

[root@home /etc/tripwire]# twadmin --generate-keys --local-keyfile ./$HOSTNAME-local.key

Enter the local keyfile passphrase: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Verify the local keyfile passphrase: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Generating key (this may take several minutes)...Key generation complete.
[root@home /etc/tripwire]#
</pre>

<p>
Now that we have generated our keys, we need to sign the configuration 
and policy files (after editing them as required):

<pre class="code">
[root@home /etc/tripwire]# twadmin --create-cfgfile --cfgfile ./tw.cfg --site-keyfile ./site.key \
    twcfg.txt
Please enter your site passphrase: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Wrote configuration file: /etc/tripwire/tw.cfg

[root@home /etc/tripwire]# twadmin --create-polfile --cfgfile tw.cfg --site-keyfile site.key twpol.txt
Please enter your site passphrase: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Wrote policy file: /etc/tripwire/tw.pol
[root@home /etc/tripwire]# 
</pre>

<strong>Do not leave the plain-text versions of the configuration and 
policy files on your hard drive.</strong> Move them onto a floppy disk or
encrypt them using a utility such as GPG. Also ensure that the permissions of 
the signed files are set such that they are only readable/writable by root:
<pre class="code">
[root@home /etc/tripwire]# chmod 0600 tw.cfg tw.pol
</pre>

<p>
The last job we must do to complete the set-up is create the baseline 
database:

<pre class="code">
[root@home /etc/tripwire]# tripwire --init --cfgfile ./tw.cfg --polfile ./tw.pol \
    --site-keyfile ./site.key --local-keyfile ./home.barryodonovan.com-local.key
Please enter your local passphrase:
Parsing policy file: /etc/tripwire/tw.pol
Generating the database...
*** Processing Unix File System ***
Wrote database file: /var/lib/tripwire/$HOSTNAME.twd
The database was successfully generated.
[root@home /etc/tripwire]#
</pre>

<h3>5. Integrity Checking</h3>

Now that Tripwire is installed, configured and the baseline database has 
been created, we can get on with the business of checking the integrity 
of the file system:

<pre class="code">
[root@home /etc/tripwire]# tripwire --check
Parsing policy file: /etc/tripwire/tw.pol
*** Processing Unix File System ***
Performing integrity check...
Wrote report file: /var/lib/tripwire/report/$HOSTNAME-20040823-210750.twr
... ... ...
Total objects scanned:  52387
Total violations found:  0
</pre>

<p>
Each violation (an addition, removal or change) is reported to 
<code>stdout</code> and written to the report file as indicated. On this
occasion I have assumed the default locations of the configuration and
policy files. I could have specified these explicitly on the command line
as I have been doing with switches such as <code>--cfgfile</code>, etc.

<p>
Your goal should be to set this up to run on a daily basis. This can be 
done as a cron or an Anacron job; Anacron is the better choice when 
the computer is not on 24/7. Using either cron or Anacron, the output 
should be e-mailed to the root user on each run of Tripwire.

<p>
In the case of Anacron, create a file in <code>/etc/cron.daily/</code>
called (for example) <code>tripwire-check</code> containing:

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash

/usr/sbin/tripwire --check
</pre>

<p>
and ensure that it is executable (<code>chmod u+x 
/etc/cron.daily/tripwire-check</code>). If you want to use a cron job, then
add the following line to root's crontab to perform the check every day at 
3am (<code>crontab -e</code>):

<pre class="code">
00 03 * * * /usr/sbin/tripwire --check
</pre>

<h3>6. Updating the Database</h3>

When any file that Tripwire checks changes, you must update the Tripwire 
database so that it reflects the new information for the file. This can 
be done as part of the integrity checking process by using the interactive 
switch (&#039;<code>-I</code>&#039;) or by using the database update mode 
of the <code>tripwire</code> command:

<pre class="code">
[root@home /etc/tripwire]# tripwire --update --twrfile /var/lib/tripwire/report/$HOSTNAME-20040823-210750.twr
    &lt; At this point you will be asked to choose which file records to update in the &gt;    
    &lt; database via the ballot-box mechanism. Unless you specified otherwise, vi     &gt;
    &lt; will be the editor chosen. If you have not used vi before then I suggest you  &gt;
    &lt; change it to a pico, nedit or whatever you prefer. Add/remove the x's from    &gt;
    &lt; the ballot boxes, save and exit                                               &gt;                                                       
Please enter your local passphrase: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Wrote database file: /var/lib/tripwire/home.barryodonovan.com.twd
[root@home /etc/tripwire]#
</pre>

<p>
As you can see from the command line above, you must specify a report 
file to be used when updating the database. Choose the most recently 
generated report file. If you find yourself having to constantly update 
the same non-critical files, then feel free to update the policy so as 
to exclude those files.

<p>
If any changes are found you will be presented with a &#034;ballot-box&#034; 
styled form that must be completed by placing an &#039;x&#039; opposite the 
violations that are safe to be updated in the database (for example you 
updated the Apache web server yesterday and Tripwire is reporting a change in 
the binary <code>/usr/sbin/httpd</code> as would be expected). If anything
has changed that you cannot directly account for then you should check it out
as it may indicate that someone has broken into your system.

<h3>7. Updating the Policy</h3>

The <code>tripwire</code> command has a policy update mode which means that a
change in policy does not require us to reinitialise the database. The policy 
update mode simply synchronises the existing database with the new policy file.
The new policy file expected is the plain-text version - Tripwire will then 
ask for the local and site passphrases, synchronise the database and sign both
the new policy file and the database.

<pre class="code">
tripwire --update-policy --cfgfile ./tw.cfg --polfile ./tw.pol --site-keyfile ./site.key \
    --local-keyfile ./$HOSTNAME-local.key new_policy_file.txt
</pre>

<p>
Again, you <strong>should not</strong> leave the plain-text version of the 
policy file on the system.

<h3>8. Securing Tripwire</h3>

Using Tripwire as an intrusion detection system is only as effective as the 
security of Tripwire itself. There are a number of procedures you can follow
to ensure maximum security:

<ul>
<li> ensure that no plain text copies of the configuration file or the 
policy file exist on the system
<li> ensure the access modes of the Tripwire binaries are 0500 
(i.e. <code>-r-x------</code>); as root execute: <code>chmod 0500 
/usr/sbin/tripwire /usr/sbin/twadmin /usr/sbin/twprint /usr/sbin/siggen</code>
<li> ensure the access modes of the configuration directory and the database 
and report directory are 0700 (i.e. <code>-rwx------</code>) and similarly for 
its contents; as root execute: <code>chmod -R u=rwX,go-rwx /var/lib/tripwire</code> 
- the capital &#039;X&#039; in the permissions sets the execute (or access if 
a directory) bit if the file already has it set or if it is a directory.
</ul>

<p>
The last procedure is something that I would consider a &#039;must&#039; 
rather than a &#039;should&#039;. Tripwire's database must be secure for 
an integrity check to be sufficiently trustworthy. If you are not updating 
the database on a regular occasion (such as on a server, etc) then you can
keep the database on removable media without too much inconvenience. This 
can be as simple as leaving a write-protected floppy cantaining the database
in the floppy drive, or a re-writable CD in a CD-ROM drive (read-only drive).
If the database changes then you can update the database on these mediums by
write-enabling the floppy or erasing and burning the new database to the 
CD-RW; but an attacker will be unable to remove or alter the database in 
anyway.

<p>
A second solution would be to keep the database on another machine and 
download it as required. This could be as simple as using <code>wget</code>
to fetch the database from a web server just prior to running the integrity
check and removing it afterwards. For example, change the Anacron script to:

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash

# switch to the database directory as specified by the Tripwire configuration file
cd /var/lib/tripwire

# download the database from a password protected directory (.htaccess)
wget http://www.someserver.com/private/$HOSTNAME.twd --http-user=username --http-passwd=password

# perform the integrity check
/usr/sbin/tripwire --check

# remove the database
rm -f $HOSTNAME.twd
</pre>

<p>
You can use <code>scp</code>, <code>rsync</code>, etc in a similar fashion.

<h3>9. Further Resources</h3>
