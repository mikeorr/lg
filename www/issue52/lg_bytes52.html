<P> NUREMBERG, Germany, PASADENA, USA and METZ, France - 2/14/2000 - SuSE
Linux AG, MandrakeSoft and Linbox Inc. are joining forces to develop
Linux Network Computing and bring it to the broadest audience. SuSE Linux
AG, MandrakeSoft and Linbox Inc. are partnering to develop and include in
future versions of Linux distributions the key technologies of the Linbox
Network Architecture. All SuSE Linux and MandrakeSoft users will soon be
able to set up efficient diskless Network Computing solutions based on
Linux.


<P> The Linbox Network Architecture is an open approach to Linux Network
Computing based on diskless standard computers on the desktop side, such
as the Linbox Net Station, and full featured servers, such as the Linbox
Net Server. According to Jean Pierre Laisne', CEO of Linbox Inc., "The
Linbox Network Architecture allows users to bring the power of Linux to
the desktop at minimal costs while still preserving the user's investments
in Windows or MacOS software. Diskless Linbox Net Stations can be set up
in a matter of minutes by users with no previous skills in the Linux
environment and require no maintenance."


<P> Under the joint partnership, SuSE Linux AG, MandrakeSoft and Linbox will
form an open project which will publish the specifications of the Linbox
Network Architecture and the required software under open source
licensing. Development will be held by the Linbox R&amp;D center in the
Lorraine region, France's pioneering region for Linux and Free Software.
All Linux users and businesses are welcome to join the LNA open project.

<FONT COLOR="green">A new e-commerce server, and how the company uses Linux
</FONT>
</H3> 
<P> Internet Technologies, Inc. (Inttek (TM)) has developed a highly
effective E-Commerce System with the ability to work directly with
Hell's Kitchen Systems CCVS.

<P> For more information, visit our site: 
<A HREF="http://www.penguincommerce.com">www.penguincommerce.com</A>.  Visit <A
HREF="http://www.megcor.com">www.megcor.com</A> for a working commercial
example.  The megcor.com site sold almost $1000.00 in golf equipment the first
weekend it went live.  More examples will be coming soon.

<P> The System is hosted on a remote Application Server -- The only required
on-site hardware/software is a PC and Web Browser.  No knowledge of HTML is
needed.

<P>  Technical Overview:

<P> Penguin Commerce uses proprietary Software Developed by Internet
Technologies, Inc.

<P> Penguin Commerce is based on the following:

<P> Red Hat Linux (currently running on 5.2)

<P> Red Hat Secure Server -- (based on Red Hat Secure Server with
modification)

<P> Our secure web servers run a customized version of the Red Hat Secure
Server release. We continually upgrade and improve these servers for
maximum security.

<P> MySQL Database Engine

<P> PHP Version 4 (including custom Inttek extensions)

<P> Various types of Open Source Image processing software

<P> PGP Encryption Technology

<P> PGP is used throughout our E-Commerce solutions to provide security for
sensitive data. For example, before customer credit card numbers are
stored in the MySQL database, they are encrypted to ensure privacy in
the event that the data transmission to the MySQL server is compromised.

<P> Hell's Kitchen Systems CCVS (including custom network connection
program)

<P> HKS CCVS software runs on a separate server, connected to the secure web
server via a private Ethernet connection utilizing non-routed IP
addresses. This, plus aggressive packet filtering, guarantees that the
CCVS server is available for connections from the secure server only.
All access to the CCVS server is controlled to prevent unauthorized
access to any credit card numbers stored in plain text form.

<P> Connections to the CCVS software are made through the standard Linux
inetd service, which calls an intermediary program to translate commands
and output between the secure web server and the CCVS software. This
intermediate software, written in C with the CCVS C language API, is
designed as an extra layer of abstraction, insulating the web programmer
from the details of credit card processing, and generalizing the credit
card processing interface.  This will allow us to present a consistent
interface to web designers and programmers, regardless of the details of
our credit card processing implementation. Our intent was to keep the
credit card intelligence on the CCVS server, not the web server.

<P> An overview of the physical layout is as follows:

<PRE>

          |
General Firewall (running RedHat Linux)
          |

</FONT>
</H3> 

<P> Qarbon.com, the originator of Viewlets, and SuSE Inc, a leading
international Linux distribution, announced the launch of Qarbon.com's "The
Linux Viewlet Project." Viewlets are a Web innovation that changes help
files and FAQ's into vivid and dramatic "How To" demonstrations that "show"
rather than "tell" a user how to perform a specific computing task. The
introduction of Viewlets to the Linux community allows Linux developers and
users from around the world to create, use and exchange Viewlets, which
answer thousands of questions. Keeping with the Linux spirit, Viewlets are
free to everyone on the net. Qarbon.com's business model includes a free
Viewlet
development tool, advertising-based revenue sharing for Viewlet authors and
participating web sites,and a Viewlet syndication process designed to
promote the use
of Viewlets across the web.

<P> To see some of the first Viewlets built around SuSE's Linux 6.3 go to
<A HREF="http://www.teach2earn.com/linux/">www.teach2earn.com/linux/</A>.
Viewlets are expected to be a boon to increasing the use of Linux as users and
developers see how Viewlets solve problems, reduces help desk calls and
facilitates installation and use.

</FONT>
</H3> 

<P> 	DENVER -  <A HREF="http://www.linuxmall.com">LinuxMall.com</A>, is
urging the adoption of
certification standards developed by the Linux Professional Institute. The
Linux Professional Institute (LPI) is an international non-profit organization
dedicated to establishing professional vendor-neutral certification for the
Linux Operating System.

<P> 	Mark Bolzern, President of LinuxMall.com, is a member of the LPI
Advisory Council and a sponsor of the organization. LinuxMall.com joins the
company of other industry leaders like IBM, Caldera Systems, and
Hewlett-Packard in supporting LPI's mission to certify the talent and hard work
of Linux professionals throughout the world.

<P> The first exam for LPI certification was launched in January 2000, offering
an incentive program of Linux-related utilities to participants.  LinuxMall.com
has donated over a hundred of incentive items-including t-shirts and Tux the
penguin mascots-to participants who have completed the initial phase of
testing.  In addition, LinuxMall.com provided the fulfillment and distribution
of all prizes donated by other LPI sponsors.  "Because of the neutrality of LPI
certification, businesses will gain a higher level of confidence in the
abilities of the professionals they hire," adds Bolzern. "It's far more
credible than certification standards established by a single company, such as
the MSCE standard."

<FONT COLOR="green">PROGRESS SonicMQ ADDS SUPPORT FOR LINUX
</FONT>
</H3> 

<P> NEW YORK-iEC 2000-February 29, 2000-Progress Software Corporation today
announced the Developer Edition of its award-winning Progress(r)
SonicMQ(tm) Internet messaging server will support the Linux operating system.

<P> "We really wanted to try running SonicMQ on Linux," said Michael
Quattlebaum, director of R&D at ChanneLinx.com, a provider of complete
e-commerce solutions by linking industries into an interoperable digital
marketplace.  "I installed it on my Linux server, had it up and running in no
time and it worked like a dream.  Because SonicMQ is 100% Java, it can run with
little or no configuration changes on any platform with a supported JVM.
SonicMQ has been great to work with -- a clean implementation of the JMS
specification with the added tools needed to make it practical."

<P> SonicMQ is the first-and to date the only-standalone messaging server
available from a major software vendor based on Sun's specification for
Java-based messaging, Java Message Service (JMS).  By providing a
standards-based reliable and scalable messaging infrastructure for Internet
application interoperation, together with key standards beyond the JMS
specification such as eXtensible Markup Language (XML), SonicMQ ensures
business-to-business transactions are successfully completed.
