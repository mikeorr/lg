The last line takes the now-useless Num Lock key and makes it an extra
Escape key. If your favorite accounting software uses one of the F
keys frequently, you might prefer that.

The number to the left of the equals sign is an X "keycode", the key
on the keyboard you pressed, and the number or name to the right is an
X "keysym", the character or function X thinks it is. You don't have
to look these up in some X manual. To find out the keycode and keysym
for any key, run xev in an xterm, move the mouse to the small white
xev window and watch the keycodes and keysyms scroll by in the xterm.

SSH a little too forward, use more keys

If you'd like to do SSH port forwarding with a passphrase, but require
a passphrase to run commands, make a separate key for port forwarding
only.
