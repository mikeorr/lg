Jim:
Thanks for your response

in checking out my system with the command  ps
I find that there is no pop deamon running so I guess i will have to
find that.

in.popd (and most other POP daemons such as qpopper)
wouldn't show up during 'ps' unless someone was accessing
the service concurrently to your running the 'ps' command.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The whole point of '<tt>inetd</tt>' is that it monitors all of
the TCP/UDP ports (on all of your interfaces) and
dynamically launches the services daemons (<tt>in.popd</tt>,
<tt>in.ftpd</tt>, <tt>in.telnetd</tt>, etc) <EM>on demand</EM>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, check your <TT>/etc/inetd.conf</TT> --- and make sure that
inetd is running.  Then try to run a POP client.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Another trick is to use telnet to connect to the POP-3
port (110).  You can then issue USER and PASS commands
-- followed by a QUIT command.  If those work then
your POP daemon is responding.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As with most Unix TCP services, the control messages
in the protocol are implemented as a set of short
commands and standardized responses.  This is the way that
SMTP, FTP, POP, IMAP and several others work.   (There are
also services that use binary and null terminated strings
for their protocol elements --- those generally can't be
"spoofed" or "debugged" using just plain old 'telnet').

as for my comments about the dos\windows directory structures, let me
clarify  in dos\ windows   when you go to a a folder for say Netscape,
you will find all of the files(for the most part) to run that program
under that folder and in directories directly under that folder (
excepting perhaps some common system .dll and autoexec.bat config.sys,
and 3 or 4 other common system files,ignoring the system registry fro a
while) It seems to me that the programs under linux are scattered all
over the place.  I understand that mostly all of the files are text
based (makes sense to me for set up reasons), but why are they
everywhere, and no one has been able to tell me just what the major
directories mean (or represent) just why is stuff where it is?

First of all, "folders" are a completely different
abstraction than "directories."  Folders don't exist in
MS-DOS.  They are a Windows thing.  (Terminology borrowed
from the MacOS paradigm).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I think that you belief that Linux and Unix files are
"scattered all over the place" (a complaint you've repeated
twice now) is largely a matter of your perception.  As you
say, some DLL's, fonts, and other elements of Windows
programs are put outside of the folders and directories that
are associated with them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In any event, Unix (and Linux) provide "mechanisms" --- they
don't set "policy."  So each programmer is free to use
whatever conventions best suit their needs.  Most Unix/Linux
programmers follow a fairly complex set of conventions ---
which have evolved over the course of about 30 years.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
That's ten times longer than Windows '95 has been around,
and twice as long as MS-DOS.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As for what the different directories "mean" --- read the
FHS (filesystem hiearchy standard) which is part of the
Linux Documentation Project.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It sounds like you spending more time fighting the
conventions than understanding or accepting them.  Some
of them are a bit silly (/etc for configuration files, why
isn't it <TT>/conf?)</TT> and some of the file names are historical
(which is why we store user account names, shells, home
directories, and other info in the <TT>/etc/passwd</TT> file ---
and we store password hashes in the <TT>/etc/shadow</TT> file).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>/usr</TT> is the home of "user space" programs and resources,
while <TT>/var</TT> is the tree for <TT>/usr</TT> type files that are expected
to differ between systems (things that used to be in <TT>/usr</TT>
until people started trying to share <TT>/usr</TT> over NFS).  <TT>/home</TT>
is common on Linux and less common on other Unix platforms
--- most of which use a set of fileystems like <TT>/u1</TT>, <TT>/u2</TT>,
etc.  <TT>/proc</TT> is a "virtual" filesystem --- a representation
of the kernel's process status as a tree of nodes.  This
allows programs and shell scripts to access process status
and other kernel data without requiring special interfaces
into the kernel.  The <TT>/dev</TT> directory is for "device nodes"
(filenames through which programs can access and control
devices).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It would take a rather lengthy book to go over all of these
conventions.  You could read "Linux Installation and Getting
Started" for some of this.  Most of it is more of an "oral"
tradition (carried mostly by netnews, over mailing lists,
in user group meetings and at technical conferences like
USENIX, SANS, and the IETF workshops.

there must be a philosophy behind this system I don't understand yet
can you shed a little light on this??
</STRONG></P>

Read Peter Salus' "A Quarter Century of Unix" if you want to
understand the background of Unix (and thereby the heritage
of Linux).  There is also another book whose title escapes
me --- but it's something like:  &quot;the philosophy of Unix&quot;
--- which is more for programmers.
