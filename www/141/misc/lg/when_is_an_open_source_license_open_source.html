<pre>
&gt; Rick, your explanation helped a great. Who are the main culprits of 
&gt; consequence besides Sugar?
</pre>

<p>
SugarCRM started the trend, and the other dozen-odd firms (Socialtext,
Alfresco, Zimbra, Qlusters, Jitterbit, Scalix, MuleSource,
Dimdim, Agnitas AG, Openbravo, Emu Software, Terracotta, Cognizo
Technologies, ValueCard, KnowledgeTree, OpenCountry, 1BizCom, MedSphere,
vTiger) literally copied their so-called "MPL-style" licence, with minor
variations.  MuleSource was for a long time a vocal backer of SugarCRM's
position (but see below).
</p>

<p>
Alfresco <em>used</em> to be a major backer of that position, but then suddenly
decided to shift to GPLv2, which is what they use now.  (They are no
longer a badgeware firm.)   Company spokesman (and OSI Board member, and
attorney) Matt Asay says he tried all along to convince them to do that,
and I do believe him.
</p>

<p>
SocialText (and especially CEO Ross Mayfield) has taken a lead online
role in trying to resolve the impasse -- though I personally find most
of what he says to be almost purely rationalising, and for him to be
mostly unresponsive to (or evasive of) substantive criticism.
</p>

<p>
MuleSource and Medsphere have, within the last few months, improved their 
respective MPL + Exhibit B licences (<a href="http://www.mulesource.com/MSPL/">http://www.mulesource.com/MSPL/</a> 
<a href="http://medsphere.org/license/MSPL.html">http://medsphere.org/license/MSPL.html</a>) <em>very</em> dramatically, in direct
response to criticism on OSI's license-discuss mailing list.  This work
seems to be that of attorney Mitch Radcliffe, and encouraged by
MuleSource and Medsphere Board member Larry Augustin (formerly of VA
Linux Systems).  I have great respect for this work, though I am still
trying to properly assess and analyse it.
</p>

<p>
(Disclaimer:  Larry is a friend of mine, though I see him only rarely,
and I once was employed at one of his firms.)
</p>


<p>
You should be made aware of the role of vTiger (of Chennai) in all of
this:  In August 2004, it forked and since then has offered
independently, under its own name and brand, an early version of the
SugarCRM codebase, plus various changes of their own devising.  It was
in response to that forking event, to which SugarCRM CEO John Roberts
responded very angrily at the time, that SugarCRM adopted the "Exhibit
B" restrictive licensing addendum that then became the hallmark of
badgeware licences generally.  See second post on
<a href="http://www.vtiger.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=22">http://www.vtiger.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=22</a> , and the matching
apologia at <a href="http://www.vtiger.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=22">http://www.vtiger.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=22</a> by
Christiaan Erasmus of badgeware firm ValueCard (South Africa).

<p>
Re-reading my own _Linux Gazette_ articles has served to remind me that 
a firm named Compiere was among those firms until roughly December 2006,
at which point it switched to genuine open source.
</p>

<p>
Intalio, Inc. initially used a minor variant of SugarCRM's licence, but
has more recently dropped it and adopted an outright proprietary licence 
(<a href="http://bpms.intalio.com/content/view/5/37/">http://bpms.intalio.com/content/view/5/37/</a>).
</p>

<p>
Sapienter Billing Software Corporation has also closely copied
SugarCRM's licence (<a href="http://www.jbilling.com/?q=node/7&amp;pl=pr">http://www.jbilling.com/?q=node/7&amp;pl=pr</a>).
Additionally, as I mentioned in my second _Linux Gazette_ article,
Sapienter unlawfully used the "OSI Certified" certification mark logo 
on its Web page for this badgeware licence, until I called OSI's
attention to this misdeed and OSI demanded the logo's removal.

<p>
Correct name is Mark Radcliffe.
</p>

<p>
I picked up the error of referring to the gentleman as "Mark Radcliffe"
by copying the name verbatim from some of SocialText CEO Ross Mayfield's
online writings about the latter's "Generic Attribution Provision" 
proposal to get OSI approval for a generic Exhibit B addendum that he
proposed to be add-able to <em>any</em> OSI-approved licence, and still retain
OSI certification.  That proposal failed.

Quoting Ashlee Vance (ashlee.vance@theregister.co.uk):

<pre>
&gt; Gosh&gt; didn't you give in kinda easy?
&gt; <a href="http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/catalog/productdetail.jspa?productId=1002">http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/catalog/productdetail.jspa?productId=1002</a>
&gt; SugarCRM is the market-leading commercial open source customer relationship
&gt; management (CRM) application.
</pre>

<p>
Well, I had never noticed that, so I didn't comment on it.
</p>

<p>
What originally brought the matter to my attention was attending the
RHEL5 product launch, the first time that RHX was mentioned, seeing
the dozen-odd initial offerings shown on the slide describing RHX as
offering open source applications, and noticing that around half of
those listed offerings were very clearly NOT open source.  I chatted
with Red Hat's CTO, about a half-hour after the presentation, and he
agreed with my assessment that it was inevitable that RHX would offer
proprietary applications, but that the literature needed to be
corrected.  He promised to pass the word along.
</p>

<p>
Time passed, and I started to see press releases -- which repeated and
furthered the misrepresentations I saw on Launch Day.  I checked out the 
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/rhx/">http://www.redhat.com/rhx/</a> entry page and <em>some</em> of the subpages of
<a href="http://rhx.redhat.com/">http://rhx.redhat.com/</a> .  I certainly didn't dig down into <em>all</em> of the
subpages; my focus was on the pages people were most likely to encounter
soonest.
</p>

<p>
So, I never even bothered to visit the product-spepcific page(s) about
SugarCRM.  (I didn't <em>really</em> want to read about SugarCRM, after all;
it's terrible, badly coded bloatware, pitched by a bunch of pushy,
small-time hucksters.)
</p>

<p>
Well, anyway, damn.  I spoke too soon, it seems.  
</p>

<p>
At least the misstatement on the <em>main</em> pages has been removed -- which
was the basis of my comment that RH had done the right thing -- even
though I mistakenly assumed they'd done a clean sweep.  Maybe I should
ask RH to add a "Representation on this page are those of the software
vendor, and not of Red Hat, Inc." disclaimer?  What's your own opinion,
Ashlee?  I'm more than a bit tired and too darned busy with other
things, but can get back to this matter soon.

</p>


<pre>
&gt; What change happened on the front page? I'm still confused by that. Not sure
&gt; I'm seeing it.
&gt; 
&gt; Um, my opinion is that Red Hat isn't doing a heck of a lot here.
</pre>

<p>
(I notice you ignored my question.)
</p>

<p>
You know, it would help if you would provide something like, oh, _a URL_, 
when you use relatively vague expressions like "the front page".  Is
copy and paste really so difficult?
</p>

<p>
It's possible that, by "the front page", you're referring to
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/rhx/">http://www.redhat.com/rhx/</a> .  That page used to say, right near the top,
that the offerings were all open source.  It no longer does.
</p>

<p>
(Whoops, <a href="http://www.redhat.com/products/">http://www.redhat.com/products/</a> still says 
<pre>
  #  Red Hat Exchange
 
   Compare, buy, and manage open source business applications. All in one
   place. All from one trusted source.
</pre>
That very much needs fixing.)
</p>

<p>
That <a href="http://www.redhat.com/rhx/">http://www.redhat.com/rhx/</a> page hyperlinks to
<a href="http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/">http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/</a> , which autoredirects to
<a href="http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/catalog/products.jspa">http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/catalog/products.jspa</a> .  That page used to
say, right near the top, that the offerings were all open source.  It no
longer does.
</p>

<p>
The hyperlink "More about RHX" goes to
<a href="http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/support/article/DOC-1285">http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/support/article/DOC-1285</a>.  That page used to
say, right near the top, that the offerings were all open source.  It no
longer does.
</p>

<p>
Ashlee, I'm missing the part where it's somehow my job to search up and
down all of Red Hat's various Web sites and catalogue everything related
to RHX.  I'm a busy guy, especially right at this moment.  Perhaps you
are, too, accounting for your unavailability for copying and pasting
URLs.  ;-&gt;  But yes, evidently I missed some Web text that they still
need to correct.  I'm sure I'll eventually find time to chase down and
examine all RHX references, but today's not looking promising.

Quoting Ashlee Vance (ashlee.vance@theregister.co.uk):
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Yep, I meant the front page of RHX, since that's what we were talking
&gt; about.  I was digging through the cache images, but can't seem to find
&gt; a shot where they have the old open source claims up. You didn't take
&gt; a screen shot by chance did you?
</pre>

<p>
Nope.  I don't really "do" screen shots.  Sometimes I mirror Web pages
(e.g., when I think them likely to disappear), but not in this case.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Not sure where the rest of your comments are coming from. I was just
&gt; surprised by your pro RHX comments scattered over the site, as it seemed
&gt; like they did very little to me. Just trying to get your perspective. Could
&gt; care less whether you find the time to police Red Hat.
</pre>

<p>
Er, to the best of my recollection, I posted <em>one</em> followup right below
my earlier critical comment[1], to ensure that I credited them for fixing
the problem I had complained about -- because in fact they had fixed 
all of the ones I'd cited.  If one cluebats companies into doing the
right thing, it's only fair to say nice things when they get around to
complying -- and also smart tactics, so that you retain the reputation 
for being fair and not just yet another Internet flamer.
</p>

<p>
The fact that I hadn't noticed some <em>additional</em> Web pages needing
fixing doesn't change that basic logic.
</p>

<p>
[1] It's possible that I posted a followup under both of my two critical
comments on the site -- which, again, is the smart thing to do when
you've asked a company to go out of its way to fix a misstatement, and
it complies.  I'd go chase down how many times I said "thank you for
doing the right thing", if I weren't already excessively busy and likely
to have a very long day.  (I'm also again a bit surprised that you
cannot bother to include URLs when you say things like "your pro RHX
comments scattered over the site".)
