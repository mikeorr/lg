<p>
Hey all,
</p>

<p>
I read with interest the article which explained how FVWM parses its style
lines.  I've been a FVWM user for about two years now, and this article
really inspired me to rearrange parts of my config.  I now have everything
the way i want it, except for some things, which I want to ask the rest of
you:
</p>

<p>
1.  Are any of you using FVWM, and if so, do you have anything useful to
share, such as key-bindings, etc?
2.  Can I somehow get new window to receive focus even though I am using
ClickToFocus?
3.  What's FvwmIconMan and do I really need it to replace FvwmTaskBar?
</p>

<p>
I hope the gang can help with this, and thank you so much for this article.
In klnd regards,
</p>

<p>
David
</p>

&gt; I have read your article discussing swf and possible open-source readers and players.
&gt; My Debian Linux machine (a Mac Quadra running Sarge) is nowhere near adequate to
&gt; your suggestions. Is there a swf to jpeg converter that could run on my system?
&gt; Thanks - Larry in the Ontario deep woods.
</pre>

<p>
Hi, Larry - I know it's taken a while to answer, but I've been tied up
in a lot of other things, all while trying to find an answer - although
it was for reasons different from yours, but a similar problem.
</p>

<p>
As far as I can tell, the solution for reading SWFs on older, slower
machines is to use a viewer other than Adobe's; e.g., 'swf-player', or
Gnash (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnash/">http://www.gnu.org/software/gnash/</a>), or one of the viewers listed
at osFlash '<a href="http://www.osflash.org/">http://www.osflash.org/</a>'. Have you tried any of those yet? I
found that swf-player is pretty easy on the CPU and disk space both.
Please let us know how it goes.
</p>

<p>
Coming at it from the other end, I'm using Ubuntu on a 64-bit AMD laptop
- and as it happens, I have (well, had) the same problem from the other
end: I couldn't view SWFs because there isn't yet a 64-bit Flash viewer
for Linux. Well, some people - including GNU - are working on one,
but... it's all very alpha and experimental and non-usable (at least by
me.) So, after spending a bunch of time on this, I just dropped the
whole idea of doing it in 64-bit and built a 32-bit chroot enviroment
for those apps which haven't quite made the transition yet. Now, when I
type "firefox32", it fires up the chroot, runs the 32-bit version of
Firefox, and - <em>voila</em> - I've got Flash and all.
</p>

<p>
Now, if I could just find similarly easy fixes for my GL and WiFi, I'd
be all set...

&gt; Here is a way to copy a partition which is mounted <strong>without</strong> copying
&gt; all the other partitions that are under it.
&gt; 
&gt; Let /patha be the mountpoint of the partition from which you want to
&gt; copy (it could even be the root path /).
&gt; 
&gt; Let /dev/new be the device to which you want to copy the data.
&gt; 
&gt; 	mkdir /var/tmp/src
&gt; 	# The bind mount is the crucial thing!
&gt; 	mount --bind /patha /var/tmp/src
&gt; 	mkdir /var/tmp/target
&gt; 	mount /dev/new /var/tmp/target
&gt; 	cd /var/tmp/src
&gt; 	# I find this a neat way to copy all files
&gt; 	# and permissions
&gt; 	find . | cpio -pdum /var/tmp/target
&gt; 	umount /dev/new
&gt; 	umount /var/tmp/src
&gt; 	rmdir /var/tmp/{src,target}
</pre>


<p>
Actually it turns out (from current experience!) that
<pre>
 	find . | cpio -pdum /var/tmp/target
</pre>
is the "wrong" way to do this. The correct way is
<pre>
 	find . -depth | cpio -pdum /var/tmp/target
</pre>
This way the files get listed first and then the directory and this
speeds up the task.
</p>

<p>
Another use for this trick is when you want to "re-combine" a
partition. Say you created a separate "/usr" partition and then later
decided that you have enough space in the root partition for
everything.
<pre>
	mount --bind / /mnt
	cd /usr
	find . -depth | cpio -pdum /mnt/usr/
	umount /mnt
</pre>
Then edit fstab appropriately to "noauto" out the /usr mount and
reboot. After the reboot the "/usr" partition is available for
alternate use. (You can avoid a reboot using "init 1" and possibly
"pivot_root" but reboot is probably safer!)

Awesome article, very well written!
This is not only a LinuxMint Review, but a very good tutorial for 
beginners too.
Thanks for your work man, i'll recommend this one to some of my buddies

<p>
Hello, TAG!
</p>

<p>
I threatened to dust off a script that automagically deals with SSH
brute forcing. The Linux Netfilter has a module which can match recently
seen IP addresses. It's called "recent" and it can dynamically create a
list of IP addresses and then match against that list for the purpose of
reacting to network probes for example. Let's take an example from one
of my servers:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m recent --set --name SSH
iptables -N SSH_WHITELIST
iptables -A SSH_WHITELIST -s 10.0.0.253      -m recent --remove --name SSH -j ACCEPT
iptables -A SSH_WHITELIST -s 10.0.0.254      -m recent --remove --name SSH -j ACCEPT
iptables -A SSH_WHITELIST -s 127.0.0.1       -m recent --remove --name SSH -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -j SSH_WHITELIST
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW \
         -m recent --update --seconds 1800 --hitcount 2 \
         --rttl --name SSH -j LOG --log-prefix SSH_brute_force
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW \
         -m recent --update --seconds 1800 --hitcount 2 --rttl --name SSH -j DROP
</pre>
The first rule directs all new inbound packets to port 22/TCP (SSH
usually) to Netfilter's "recent" module. In addition to that the rule
specifies that the list named SSH is to be used. After that I create a
custom chain named SSH_WHITELIST where I collect all IP addresses that
shouldn't trigger the automatic defence. After SSH_WHITELIST is defined
all traffic from the whitelisted IP addresses gets redirected to
SSH_WHITELIST and is allowed to pass unhindered.
</p>

<p>
The last two rules carry all the magic. Notice that the rules were added
to the end of the respective chains which means that everything I
described so far is already dealt with. The next line does a matching
against all new inbound packets to port 22/TCP against. This time we add
the parameters "--update --seconds 1800 --hitcount 2" meaning that every
packet that arrives more than once (i.e. twice) within 1800 seconds will
match our rule. If it matches the IP address will be added to the list
SSH and a log entry with the prefix "SSH_brute_force" will be sent to
syslog. Since we use the LOG action, Netfilter goes on to the next rule.
The last line does the same, but it drops any packets from the IP
address that offended our limit of one connection attempt within 1800
seconds.
</p>

<p>
The lists Netfilter's "recent" module maintains can be inspected in the
directory "/proc/net/ipt_recent/". All the offenders triggering the
rules above can be extracted from /proc/net/ipt_recent/SSH along with
the UNIX timestamps when they tried to contact us. The lists only live
as long as the kernel runs. A shutdown will clear everything. That's why
the rule before the last one writes the blocked IP to syslog.
</p>

<p>
So, TIMTOWTDI is also valid for log parsing in conjunction with the
Linux Netfilter. ;)
</p>

<p>
Happy hunting,<br>
Ren&eacute;.

"getting volume label for CD" at <a href="../issue72/tag/2.html">http://linuxgazette.net/issue72/tag/2.html</a> does not really
have a good answer.  I suggest something like this:
</p>

<p>
To find the volume name of a CD or other device, use the volname utility.
For example:
</p>

<pre>
$ grep hdc /etc/fstab
/dev/hdc /mnt/cdrom auto umask=0022,users,iocharset=utf8,sync,noauto,ro,exec 0 0
$ sudo volname /dev/hdc
46368_546292
</pre>
The volume name of the CD in /dev/hdc is "46368_546292".
