<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Steven Adler</H4>
While not building <a href="http://www.phenix.bnl.gov">detectors</a>
in search of the quark gluon plasma, Steve Adler spends his time either
4 wheeling around the lab grounds or writing articles about the people
behind the open source movement.

<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Eugene Blanchard</H4>
Eugene is an Instructor at the Southern Alberta Institute of
Technology in Calgary, Alberta, Canada where he teaches electronics,
digital, microprocessors, data communications, and operating
systems/networking in the Novell, Windows and Unix worlds. When he is not
spending quality time with his wonderful wife and 18 month old daughter
watching Barney videos, he can be found in front of his Linux box. His
hobbies are hiking, backpacking, bicycling and chess.

<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Eric Fischer</H4>
Eric currently lives in Chicago, Illinois and is employed by RootsWeb, Inc. He
was formerly involved in the development of the Vim text editor.


<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">David Fisher</H4>
Dave has been working as a software consultant for 12 years doing development,
QA, and automation in both military and commercial projects.  He also designs
strategic games and is a published musician.

<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Eoin Lane</H4>
Eoin is the managing director of <a href="http://www.inconn.ie/">InConn
Technologies Ltd</a>., an intranet document management company. After completing
his Ph.D., in chemical physics Eoin saw the potential of using a Linux
server to centrally manage documents, from this he decided to set up the
company InConn Technologies Ltd., to explore this technology commercially.
Eoin specialises in XML solutions for complex document and knowledge management
problems.

<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">JC Pollman and Bill Mote</H4>
JC has been playing with Linux since kernel 1.0.59. He spend way too much
time at the keyboard and even let his day job - the military - interfere once in
a while. His biggest concern about linux is the lack of documentation for the
intermediate user. There is already too much beginner's stuff, and the
professional material is often beyond the new enthusiast.

<P> Bill is the Technical Support Services manager for a multi-billion dollar
publishing company and is responsible for providing 1st and 2nd level
support services to their 500+ road-warrior sales force as well as their
3,500 workstation and laptop users.  He was introduced to Linux by a good
friend in 1996 and thought Slackware was the end-all-be-all of the OS world
... until he found Mandrake in early 1999.  Since then he's used his
documentation skills to help those new to Linux find their way.
<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Bob Reid</H4>
Rob is doing his Ph.D. in Astronomy at the University of Toronto, where he
was a system administrator on the side for a while along with running his own
Linux boxes at home and school since 1995.

<IMG ALT="[ Penguin reading the Linux Gazette ]"

<P>

<P> This issue is short on articles because the Thanksgiving weekend pushed
the deadline too far forward for some of the authors.  Articles by <I>LG</I>
regulars Bill Bennet, Slambo, Sean Lamb and Anderson Silva will be in the
January issue.

<P> Since the <I>Linux Gazette</I> Spam Count has been 
hovering steadily at 26-28%, I decided to look at a new statistic this month:
the <STRONG><I>Linux Gazette</I> Bounce Count</STRONG>.  This is the number
of messages that were undeliverable on the 5500-member <tt>lg-announce</tt>
mailing list.  Bounce count: 1034 messages, creating a wopping 7.5 MB
file of error messages.  Most of these were because of the mail loop created by
the jankog@penatex.si address, which is now unsubscribed.  There are still some
problems which duplicate messages on the list.  We are currently trying to pin
down where these messages are being generated from.

<P> Today is the first day of the World Trade Organization meetings her in
Seattle, and the protesters stated a day earlier than expected, on Sunday.
Nothing unusual to report so far that you won't find in the papers.

<P> Finally, a tongue twister from my boss Dan Wilder.  Say it three times
fast:

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE=arial,helvetica>
	How many nets could a Netwinder wind if a Netwinder could wind nets?
