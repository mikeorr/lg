<h1>Interfacing with the ISA Bus</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/dutta.html">Abhishek Dutta</A></b></p>

<p>
<p><cite>
Abstract: The parallel port is a very popular choice for interfacing.
Although there are 8 data output lines as well as the CONTROL and STATUS
pins of the parallel port, this is often not sufficient for some complex
projects, which require more data I/O lines. This project shows how to get
32 general purpose I/O lines by interfacing with the ISA Bus. Though the
PCI bus can be a candidate for interfacing experiments, its greater speed
and feature-rich nature present great complexity in terms of hardware and
software to beginners. This project can be a stepping stone to those
thinking of ultimately getting to the PCI Bus for interfacing experiments.
It can also be useful for those thinking of making a Digital Oscilloscope
using a PC, A/D and D/A converters, a Microcontroller programmer, etc.
</cite></p>

<p>First, let's get familiar with the ISA connector:</p>

<h3>Pin Description</h3>
<img src="misc/dutta/isa_pins.jpg" alt="isa pin description" width="240" height="600" align="right" hspace="20" border="1">
<p><strong>We have designated as X(n) the side that contains components on
all standard ISA cards. Similarly, Y(n) is the side that contains the
solder. It is very important for you to be clear on the above convention:
you will <em>damage your motherboard</em> if you mistake one for the other.
</strong></p>

<p>The description for most commonly used pins are given below:</p>

<h3>SIDE X</h3>
<dl>
<dt>D0 - D7 (pins X2 to X9)
<dd>These are the 8 data lines representing the 8-bit data bus.</dl>
<dl>
<dt>A0 - A19 (pins X31 to X12)
<dd>These are the 20 address lines that contain the address bits. This bus can address 1MB (2^20=1048576 bytes)</dl>
<dl>
<dt>AEN (pin X11)
<dd>It is used by the DMA controller to take over to data and  address bus during DMA transfer.</dl>

<h3>Side Y</h3>
<dl>
<dt>GND (pins Y1,Y10,Y31)
<dd>They are connected to ground of computer.</dl>
<dl>
<dt>+5V (pin Y3)
<dd>+5 Volt DC output</dl>
<dl>
<dt>-5V (pin Y5)
<dd>-5 Volt DC output</dl>

<dt>+12V (pin Y9)
<dd>+12 Volt DC output</dl>
<dl>
<dt>-12V (pin Y7)
<dd>-12 Volt DC output</dl>

<dt>MEMW(pin Y11)*
<dd>The microprocessor makes this line LOW while doing WRITE TO MEMORY.</dl>
<dl>
<dt>MEMR (pin Y12)*
<dd>The microprocessor makes this line LOW while doing READ FROM MEMORY.</dl>
<dl>
<dt>IOW (pin Y13)
<dd>The microprocessor makes this line LOW while doing WRITE TO PORT. (eg: when you write <I>outportb(ADDRESS,BYTE)</I>, this line becomes LOW)</dl>
<dl>
<dt>IOR (pin Y14)
<dd>The microprocessor makes this line LOW while doing READ FROM PORT. (eg: when you write <I>byte = inportb(ADDRESS)</I>, this line becomes LOW)</dl>
<dl>
<dt>DACK0 - DACK3 (pins Y19,Y17,Y26,Y15)*
<dd>The DMA controller signals on these lines to let devices know that that DMA has the control of buses.</dl>
<dl>
<dt>DRQ1 - DRQ3 (pins Y18,Y6,Y16)*
<dd>These pins allows the peripheral boards to request the use of the buses.</dl>
<dl>
<dt>T/C (pin Y27)*
<dd>The DMA controller sets this signal to let the peripheral know that the programmed number of bytes has been sent.</dl>
<dl>
<dt>IRQ2 - IRQ7 (pins Y4,Y25,Y24,Y23,Y22,Y21)*
<dd>Interrupt Signals. The peripheral devices set these signals to request the attention of the microprocessor.</dl>
<dl>
<dt>ALE (pin Y28)*
<dd>Address Latch Enable. This signal is used by the microprocessor to lock the 16 lower address bus in a latch during a memory or port input/output operation.</dl>
<dl>
<dt>CLOCK (pin Y20)*
<dd>The system clock</dl>
<dl>
<dt>OSC (pin Y30)*
<dd>It is a high frequency clock which can be used for the I/O boards.</dl>

<h3>Getting Four Output lines out of an ISA Bus</h3>
<IMG SRC="misc/dutta/cir_out.jpg" alt="getting four 8-bit output lines" width="620" height="700" align="right" hspace="20" border="1">

<p>Before going into the details of the full project let's examine the part
that handles the four 8-bit output lines. The addresses in the range 0x338
to 0x33B were not in use by any devices for input/output operations in our
computer.</p>

<p>The three 74LS138 ICs handle the address decoding. We configured the
circuit to produce a short pulse on the CLOCK line (represented by green
lines on the schematic) whenever an address in the range 0x338 to 0x33B and
port output (IOW) is requested.</p>

<p>Whenever the 74LS374 gets a CLOCK pulse it latches in the 8-bit data
present in the data bus. 74LS245 is a 3-state Octal Bus Transceiver. It
reduces DC loading by isolating the data bus from external loads.
</p>

<p class="editorial">[ This is true, at least in theory.
<strong>Don't</strong> use the output to power your favorite toaster oven,
and avoid shorting it to Vss or Vcc; anything other than an optocoupler may
not isolate quite as well as the manufacturer promises, and IC shrapnel is
difficult to pick out of the ceiling. -- Ben ] </p>

<p>To figure out which I/O port addresses are available for use in this
project, we examined the contents of <I>ioports</I> in the <I>/proc</I>
directory of our Linux system:</p>

<pre>
[root@thelinuxmaniac~]# cat /proc/ioports
0000-001f: dma1
0020-0021: pic1
0040-0043: timer0
.......................
.......................
01f0-01f7: ide0
0378-037a : parport0
037b-037f : parport0
03c0-03df : vga+
.......................
.......................
</pre>

<p>It is clear from the above output that the addresses 0x238-0x23B and
0x338-0x33B are not being used by any device. This is often the case in
most computers. However, if this address is occupied by some device, then
you have to change the wiring of address lines to the three 74LS138 ICs.
We'll describe the address decoding technique briefly so that you can
set up available addresses for the I/O device you are trying to build.</p>

<h3>Address Decoding</h3>
<p>We used the 74LS138 3-to-8 multiplexer for address decoding. Suppose we
want to assign the addresses 0x338-0x33B for four 8-bit output lines and
0x238-0x23B for four 8-bit input lines.The binary equivalent of these
addresses are:</p>

<p>The only address lines that change for any of the eight addresses are
A<sub>8</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>, and A<sub>0</sub> (the whole process of
connecting wires to 74LS138 IC is like solving a puzzle!) Connect the
remaining wires to the two 74LS138s so that they produce a low output when
these lines have the address bits that partially match our addresses. Now,
connect the above three lines to the third 74LS138. All 8 outputs of
this IC are used to select the 74LS374 latches corresponding to input and
output addresses after it is NORed with IOR and IOW; we used the 74LS02 to
distinguish between memory IO and port IO addressing.</p>

<H2>The Real Stuff</H2>
<p>Now, finally, we are ready to describe the functioning of the complete circuit.</p>

<IMG SRC="misc/dutta/cir_io.jpg" alt="the complete circuit diagram" width="620" height="700" align="center" border="1">
<br clear="all">
<h3>Description of the ICs used in this project</h3>
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://focus.ti.com/general/docs/lit/getliterature.tsp?genericPartNumber=sn74ls138">74LS138 and 74LS139</a>
	<dd>Decoders/de-multiplexers; used for address decoding</dl>
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://focus.ti.com/general/docs/lit/getliterature.tsp?genericPartNumber=sn74ls245">74LS245</a>
	<dd>Octal 3-state Buffer/Line Driver/Line Receiver</dl>
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://focus.ti.com/general/docs/lit/getliterature.tsp?genericPartNumber=sn74ls374">74LS374</a>
	<dd>Octal Transparent Latch with 3-state outputs; octal D-type flip-flop with 3-state output</dl>
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://focus.ti.com/general/docs/lit/getliterature.tsp?genericPartNumber=sn74ls02">74LS02</a>
	<dd>Quad 2-input NOR gate</dl>

<p>The three 74LS138 IC are used for address decoding along with the two
74LS02s (2-input NOR gate.) Whenever a match is found in the address lines,
the respective output line, Y(x) of the third 74LS138 IC (connected to the
two 74LS02 IC), goes LOW. These lines along with IOW (and IOR) are
connected to the NOR gates (74LS02), which produces a HIGH only when the two
inputs go LOW simultaneously.</p>

<p>Hence, the output is high only when:</p>

<OL>
	<LI>a match is found in the address lines</LI>
	<LI>the	IOW or IOR lines go LOW, representing the PORT IO operation.</LI>
</OL>

<p>Remember, if we do not consider the second case, our device will
conflict with the memory IO operations in the addresses 0x238-0x23B and
0x338-0x33B.</p>

<p> We can see in the circuit diagram that the output lines of NOR gates
are connected to the CLOCK pins of the 74LS374 latch.  So, whenever the
above two cases match simultaneously, the CLOCK pulse is sent to the
respective latch and the data that is present on the data bus at that
moment is latched in.  </p>

<h3>Coding - controlling the I/O lines using C</h3>

<p><a href="misc/dutta/isa.c.txt">isa.c</a> illustrates the some simple
coding methods to control and test the I/O lines of the device created in
this project.</p>

<pre class="code">
if(ioperm(OUTPUT_PORT,LENGTH+1,1))
{
	...
}
if(ioperm(INPUT_PORT,LENGTH+1,1))
{
	...
}

outb(data,port);
data = inb(port);
</pre>

<p>ioperm() gets the permission to access the specified ports from the
kernel; outb() and inb() functions (defined in sys/io.h) read from and
write to the specified port.</p>

<h3>Some Debugging Techniques</h3>

<p>It is not easy to get a complex project to work just by reading an
article like this. At some point you will need to debug your hardware.
Hopefully, these debugging techniques will help you (as they have helped us
- a lot!) to find the problem in your work. You will need a multimeter and
some LEDs. What we learned while debugging is that LEDs are the best way to
debug hardware of this nature when you don't have sophisticated debugging
instruments.  Some important techniques we discovered:
</p>

<img alt="Using simple multimeter for debugging" width="300" height="225" src="misc/dutta/phot0035.jpg">
<img alt="Using LEDs for debugging" width="300" height="225" src="misc/dutta/phot0020.jpg">
<img alt="Using simple multimeter for debugging" width="300" height="225" src="misc/dutta/phot0008.jpg">

<dl>
<dt>Use of Multimeter
<dd>A multimeter will be very useful to check the zeros and ones coming
across ICs. Verify that expected output is coming at every IC. ZERO will be
measured as 0.8V and ONE will be measured as 3.8V (this will vary with
computer). This can be used if the address decoding does not work, or when
unexpected data is seen on the output lines. <strong>DO NOT CONNECT THE
MULTIMETER PROBES DIRECTLY TO DATA BUS OR THE ADDRESS LINES. ALWAYS CONNECT
IT TO THE OUTPUT OF THE RESPECTIVE ICS!</strong>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Use of LEDs
<dd>LEDs can be very useful to verify the data bits coming from the output
lines; the lighting up of LED will be visible across latches. To check
whether the clock pulse is going to the right latch, connect an LED to
the CLK pin and send data to that port in a continuous loop, like this:

<pre>
while(1){
outb(0x80,0x338);
}
</pre>
</dl>

<p>There are lots of other debugging techniques which you will probably
discover by yourself when you run into problems. Try to ensure that the
wiring at the connector that goes into the ISA slot is correct. We checked
every part of the device (every IC, all those jumper wires, etc.) and after
debugging for about a week we found that IOW and IOR wires were connected
to the wrong pins in the ISA slot. So, recheck the wiring. Fortunately, we
did not mistake the 12V pin for a 5V pin! ;)</p>
