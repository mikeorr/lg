I recently read a tip you submitted to linuxgazette.net back in December
of 2003:
</p>

<p>
<a href="../100/lg_tips.html#tips.14">http://linuxgazette.net/100/lg_tips.html#tips.14</a> 
</p>


<p>
I'm using scponly for one of my users and recently he asked for the
public key to bypass password prompt. Did you create the user as normal
and then add them to scponly? Or did you add them using scponly's script
(setup_chroot.sh) first?

Hi,
</p>

<p>
I've written the article:
<a href="../116/herrmann.html">http://linuxgazette.net/116/herrmann.html</a>
</p>

<p>
and was contacted by a reader a little while back, telling me it's not
working for him. I could verify that with the current version of the
perl module OpenOffice::OODoc  the script indeed fails to create the
slides in the odp file. It includes the pics -- you can extract them,
but they are not shown on any slides, and there is only the one default
slide. 
</p>

<p>
I've no way of telling at what exact version my script breaks. The one
its working with is version 1.309, currently CPAN  is at 2.028 -- major
revision 1 -&gt; 2 is likely. 
</p>

<p>
A rather simple change to the script fixes the problem:
</p>

<p>
just change:
  my $test=  $document-&gt;appendElement
    ('//office:body',0,'draw:page');
</p>

<p>
into:
</p>

<p>
  my $test=  $document-&gt;appendElement
    ('//office:presentation',0,'draw:page');
</p>


<p>
and the script works again. A small caveat: I've sometimes problem with
the slides beeing in the correct order (i.e. not the order in the
inputfile), but I can't say under what conditions this can happen yet. 
</p>

<p>

Hello Ben,
</p>

<p>
I have been trying to modify your script to work with latest Knoppix
with no luck at all. File called 'linux' is too big to fit to floppy
and besides, it seems that latest Knoppix cannot boot from diskette.
</p>

<p>
Please tell me, what is the latest Knoppix version that can work with
your script?
Could you please make a boot.img that would work with Knoppix V5.0.1 and
put it online somewhere?
</p>

<p>

<pre>
&gt;   In the LG#127 article "With Knoppix at a HotSpot", you made the
&gt;   comment:
&gt; 
&gt;      [ I do a lot of travelling, and connect to a wide variety of
&gt;        strange WLANs. In my experience, at least, connecting to a
&gt;        wireless LAN with Linux is usually just as simple as Edgar
&gt;        describes. -- Ben ]
&gt; 
&gt;   Well, I have a very different experience.  I have no trouble at all
&gt;   connecting to a managed wifi network; at home or work, I just set
&gt;   the ESSID and WEP key in /etc/network/interfaces, and "netscheme
&gt;   work" does the rest.  But this same machine has never managed to
&gt;   connect to an <em>open</em> wifi network.
&gt; 
&gt;   Today, I visited my municipal wifi and tried to connect.  I ran
&gt;   Kismet to see that the ESSID was "OldTownWifi" and that wep and
&gt;   encryption were both off.  So I used iwconfig to set the essid and
&gt;   managed mode, then ran dhclient.  Nothing.  No response from their
&gt;   server at all.
&gt; 
&gt;   So how about this: you help me understand why I can see an open
&gt;   hotspot with Kismet but can't seem to give the right incantation to
&gt;   connect, and I'll write up a "dummy's guide" for LG.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Well, that sounds like a fair sort of deal... but I don't know that I
can answer the question as posed. In my mind, at least, it comes down to
"why doesn't dhcpclient work as it should?" - and I can't really tell
you, since I don't use it. I suppose you could always take a look at
your '/var/log/{daemon,kern}.log' or '/var/log/messages' and figure out
where it's failing.
</p>

<p>
To be a bit more specific, I've tried using 'dhcpclient' in the past - I
don't recall why - but it simply didn't work no matter what I tried, on
a "known good" Ethernet connection which worked fine with 'pump' on a
different machine. I pounded on the config file for a while, tried
everything in the manpage - then gave up and installed 'pump'... and
everything instantly started working - and if I recall correctly, it
required no configuration on my part.
</p>

<p>
I've been using 'pump' ever since.
</p>

<p>
These days, I usually use the 'ifup/ifdown' front ends instead of using
it directly (although sometimes I forget and use it directly; it works
fine either way.) I never have to set the ESSID unless I'm trying to get
onto a private network; the one time that I ended up wrestling with it
turned out to be a case of solving the wrong problem - the responsible
bit was a broken kernel module for my ipw2200, and not the client at
all. As I've said, It Just Works.

Hi there,
</p>

<p>
I'm Thai from Vietnam. I just want to introduce you
Kiosk Appliance (<a href="http://kiosk.rpath.org">http://kiosk.rpath.org</a>) which is a
distro focusing on user's security and privacy
inspired by your article "Creating a Rudimentary Kiosk
System using FVWM". Using rPath technology, I provide
3 versions of Kiosk Appliance: a VMWare image, a
LiveCD and an installable CD.  Included is just enough
rPath Linux and FVWM to run a locked down version of
Firefox. Firefox is also pre-configured to
automatically reset after each used so that personal
information is never stored permanently. The current
stable version is 0.2 which features:
</p>

<p>
1) Clear all personal data on exit;
</p>

<p>
2) Reset after a period of inactivity;
</p>

<p>
3) Disable form history;
</p>

<p>
4) Disable page caching;
</p>

<p>
...and much more, you can view more details at
<a href="http://www.rpath.org/rbuilder/project/kiosk/release?id=5096">http://www.rpath.org/rbuilder/project/kiosk/release?id=5096</a>
</p>

<p>
I've been working on Kiosk Appliance 0.3 which has
many more features such as the ability to disable
access to Firefox's internal URLs or dialogs, i.e
about:* URL, the Firefox Preferences dialog...I hope
K.A 0.3 to be released on the next few days. Many
thanks to Thomas Adam for helping me to configure
fvwm.
</p>

<p>
Any thought or suggestion? I'm really anxious to hear
from you.
</p>

<p>
Best regards,
</p>

<p>
Thai Duong.

Hi,
Just want to shout out that the puzzle is great!
I'd been a long time reader of linuxgazette (since 2001 I guess)
although I lost interest in linuxgazette for a while (maybe because
I'm no longer a linux newbie). Now I'm really looking for the next
issue :D
I noticed that the september's puzzle is harder than the august's. But
I won't complain just because I couldn't complete the puzzle myself. I
think puzzles are good for newbies too to examine what they learned
and find some fun of it. For that, we need easier puzzles with common
acronyms such as gnome, kde, and other common commands. So if you have
enough manpower, two puzzles in an issue would be great (one for geeks
and one for newbies).
Cheers,
<pre>-- 
Duy

<p>
Harring Figueiredo suggested:
</p>

<p>
Shouldn't the tests be if(buffer_... = NULL)? Probably a typo
</p>

<p>
You agreed.
</p>

<p>
In fact, shouldn't it be if(buffer_... == NULL)? (Comparison, not assignment).

I have a similar Zaurus 3100. I checked out both Openzaurus' OPIE &amp; GPE. They 
were nice, but felt too similar to a palm pilot or a "plain" old PDA.
</p>

<p>
If you really want your Zaurus to be just like a "regular" PC running a full 
blown OS, OpenBSD on the Zaurus is great. It's the full OS installation with 
gcc, X windows, etc. Basically, if it compiles on OpenBSD it'll work on the 
Zaurus. Completely self-hosted development--no need for cross compilers on 
other boxes. Combined with a lightweight desktop such as blackbox it's amazing. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Just to clarify, Groups of Linux Users Everywhere (GLUE) was never
related to Linux Gazette. Linux Gazette was hosted at SSC
(linuxgazette.com) for a period of time. GLUE was a separate project
(I think it was created by SSC but I don't know its origins). Because
they were on the same server, SSC may have put it under the
linuxgazette.com domain at some point, but it was never a part of our
ezine.  I made one version of GLUE and I thought it was under the
linuxjournal.com domain, but that was so many years ago that I don't
remember for sure.

Kat likes to tell people she's one of the youngest people to have learned
to program using punchcards on a mainframe (back in '83); but the truth is
that since then, despite many hours in front of various computer screens,
she's a computer user rather than a computer programmer.

When away from the keyboard, her hands have been found full of knitting
needles, various pens, henna, red-hot welding tools, upholsterer's shears,
and a pneumatic scaler.
