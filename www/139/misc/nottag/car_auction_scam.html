Anybody who knows me knows how inappropriate this is.  What would I do
with a car, put it in my living room?  Note the terms: you pay a fee
and $10,000 deposit, we "promise" to return the deposit if your car(s)
don't win the auction.  "We cannot put prospective business partner
funds in our bank account,that's why we will be using e-gold payment
only."
</p>

<p>
This does count as the first time I've heard of anybody actually using
e-gold for anything.

<p>
Mike, this is <em>spam.</em> It's a broadcast. They don't care about you; the
easiest way for them to hit their targets without investing any time,
effort, or money in research is just to spray everyone they can reach.
They don't care if they annoy or outrage you; spammers never have, and
I'm not sure why you'd think they'd change now. The only thing they care
about is getting money out of suckers by using a variety of old scams -
although they're using a relatively new method of "roping them in", the
scam itself is as old as The Spanish Prisoner con (which itself was an
update of an older con.)
</p>


<pre>
&gt; What would I do
&gt; with a car, put it in my living room?  
</pre>

<p>
They're not selling cars; they're "offering an opportunity" for the
sucker to sell <em>them</em> a big batch of cars. Judged on its probable
effectiveness (and ignoring the ethical issues connected with it), it's
actually one of the better scams I've seen: it's aimed at car dealers -
that is, people who have to use computers but do not have a particular
reason to be savvy about them - and it sounds like a more-or-less
credible business proposal. The possibility of selling a bunch of cars
<strong>and</strong> establishing a business relationship with a rental agency is a
very attractive one; a hungry car dealer, especially one who is new to
the biz and not as cynical/savvy as he should be might very well jump at
it.
</p>

<p>
Although 10k is a nice little chunk, and I suspect that even those who
would have gone for it will balk at the figure. They'd probably have
been more successful with, say, $500 or $1000 as the tip.

Anybody whose alarms don't trip on that bit deserves to be bilked.

I've seen it before - eBay laptop scams were pretty big on it a while
back.
 
Just for the fun of it, I'm going to point out the "alarm trip points"
in this thing.

And, as the old joke about anonymous sex goes, "it was the equivalent of
a formal introduction."
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Our company is a car rental company in its embryo stage.

<p>
To the point that they can't even hire anyone to edit out the
kindergarten-level grammatical/stylistic mistakes in their big business

but not enough for a website.

[laugh] "some 5star hotels around new york" - isn't that precious?
Five-star hotels in NYC wouldn't let anyone but companies with the
highest, long-established reputation operate from their premises - no

Erm... is that vehicles <em>with</em> AVLs? or vehicles <em>and</em> AVLs? Or AVLs
<em>for</em> vehicles? And what the hell does a cell phone protocol (GPRS) have
to do with the Global Positioning System, which is how the cops know
where the car is?

Maybe they want a GPS which communicates via GPRS. [ObRef] Gosh - I

Whaddaya know; they've roped an intermediary sucker. The Russian
scammers have been doing a lot of this kind of thing, but at least
they've set up some very fancy-looking web sites ("selling" luxury goods
at high discounts with the intermediaries as phone operators.) Of
course, no one gets any goods, and the operators never get paid...

"Unserious callers" calling to disturb a company without a name that no

It <em>is</em> sorta fascinating in its own way, isn't it? Sorta like a

<strong>Nice</strong> touch - and of course he doesn't trust his patsy to pass the cash

<p>
Wonder why they "cannot put", etc., in a bank account? Could it be those
dang pesky federal sentencing guidelines for bank fraud, I wonder?

Not "Fred Zibblegrabnitz, CEO Zenith Luxury Cars"? Not even "Fred F.

they'll let anybody start a car rental company these days.

Nope; can't say I have. In fact, looking around the Web results in this:
</p>

<p>
(From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-gold">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-gold</a>)
</p>

<pre>
On 27 April 2007, a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C. indicted
e-Gold Ltd and its owners on charges of money laundering,
conspiracy, and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.^[1]
e-gold, however, considers the charges completely
groundless, and has responded to the allegations in their own press
release.

Probably not what you're looking for in a safe, reliable financial
institution. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
