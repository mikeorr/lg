<H4> Plans </H4>
<P> 
Now that <i>Linux Journal</i> has taken over the <i>Linux Gazette</i>
from John Fisk,
I plan to post a new issue of the <i>Gazette</i> sometime during the
first week of each month -- preferably on the first.
Whether or not I can make this happens will 
depend on writers getting articles to me each month, AND on time
constraints due to my other projects for <i>Linux Journal</i> and SSC. 
<P> 
I wish to keep the Gazette both helpful and fun as John has over the past
year. And, of course, it will also remain free. Any ideas and suggestions,
as well as criticisms that you might have, for improvements to the Gazette
will be welcome. Most of all, I will welcome your contributions -- after
all, without you <i>Linux Gazette</i> would disappear.
<P> 
I'd also like to thank our webmaster, Michael Montoure, for his invaluable
help in checking the HTML and designing neat graphics.

In the hopes that everyone had a nice Labor Day weekend, I thought I'd tell
you about mine. I went camping in Northern Washington and Canada with
my husband, Riley, our son, Keith, and Keith's dog Lucky. We had a grand
time exploring the Okanagan Lake area of British Columbia. In driving to a
campground
on Pennask Lake, we traversed what must be one of the worst roads in Canada
-- thank goodness for high clearance vehicles! Keith was ahead of us in his
4 wheel drive truck, and was really bouncing through the ditches and holes
in the road. Our camper was bouncing and swaying enough to make me worry
that it might cause us to tip over -- Riley assured me it would not. At any
rate, after
30 minutes of hard driving, we reached the beautiful lake only to find the
campground full of fishermen. So we headed back out that wonderful road,
looking for side roads, and anyplace that we might camp. We found a place
down a side road that had only two huge ditches across it, and set up camp.
No bears showed up to spoil the fun, so we had a very
good time playing in an isolated spot away from other campers. 
Canada is certainly
a very beautiful country, and the British Columbians very friendly. This
jaunt was not our first trip to Canada nor will it be the last.

If you would like some personal information about me, clicking on my
name below will take you to my home page. It's not very jazzy at the moment,
but I'm looking for the time to fix it up.
