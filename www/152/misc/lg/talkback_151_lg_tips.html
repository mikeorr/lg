&gt;&gt; Here is a 2 cent tip which is a  little Perl script for looping through

&gt;
&gt; Why not just use 'File::Find'? It's included in the default Perl

&gt;
&gt; For more info, see 'perldoc File::Find'.

<p>
Perl File::Find didn't have everything that I want to be able to do this 
function. I was not just trying to find files with this but also  was 
try to find items that was in different directory's.
</p>

<p>
When looking around on the internet for that I want to do everything 
thing that I was able to find said not to use file::find because it 
wasn't powerful enough for that I was doing so I just create that 
function to do some different things along the way.

This is why 'find()' takes an array as the second argument.

<p>
Which illustrates the point: Read The Fine Manual before you search the
Net. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> File::Find is one of the modules that are installed with Perl by
default for a very, very good reason - and it's not because it's "not
powerful enough". In fact, being aware of what's included by default
(via 'perldoc perlmodlib') is an excellent idea for anyone who uses
Perl; these modules have been selected as the "crucially necessary" kit
by the folks who write Perl and determine Perl policy, which is one hell
of a good recommendation.

<p>
Because File::Find can do everything that 'find' can - and do it faster
and with a lot more flexibility (try asking 'find' to give you just the
current filename - or just the name of the directory that it's
traversing.) Because File::Find can be used on multiple platforms -
including Solaris and MacOS, where 'find' is Stone-Age primitive.  Also,
because Perl is <strong>much</strong> smarter about regexes (yes, I know about the
'-regextype' option; even the 'posix-extended' argument isn't anywhere
nearly as smart as Perl's regexen) - and because Thomas wanted to search
multiple directories, which 'find' doesn't do, TTBOMK.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and because it doesn't need 'xargs' or any equivalent of it - since
the files (or directories) are processed one at a time rather than being
spit out as a (possibly) huge list.
</p>

<p>
That's just a few reasons, off the top of my head. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

It isn't clear that one needs libpcre. For example "grep" supports
perl-style regexes but doesn't seem to depend on libpcre.

You have a point - but PCRE would be an easy way to implement it instead of
hacking the whole thing. Although given what's already in there, that
probably wouldn't be such a big task.

<p>
Not taking offence, but, just in case anyone doesn't know, and lest they
misread the above:  My family <em>doesn't</em> pronounce "Moen" as a one-syllable
word rhyming with moan, but rather as a two-syllable word rhyming with
Bowen or Owen.   
</p>

<p>
In Norway &amp; Denmark (whence comes the surname), they pronounce it
differently, but, hey, that's the sort thing that happens when people
emigrate and adopt an entirely different language with at best
overlapping phonemes.
</p>

<p>
I believe that, there, it's a one-syllable word with a diphthong /oeu/
sound in the middle, like the Faroese word 
n&oslash;vn ("name") or the
Norwegian 
&oslash;y ("island").  In Norwegian and Danish, a "moen" is a rolling
field, e.g., a glacier-shaped pasture.
</p>

<p>
Some Norwegians ending up being called "Moen" because they happened to
live in the "Moen" rural district[1] at the time the tax-collectors came
through and said "OK, stop changing surnames every time you move to a
new rural district.  It's confusing the records.  You say you recently
use to be named Arne Karlsson Hovland, because you then lived in the
Hovland 
gr&aring;d (rural district) and your father's name is Karl?  Well,
you're now Arne Karlsson Moen.  Remember that.  Stick with it, even if
you move again."

Thomas, perhaps you shouldn't just scream "I'M A BAD PROGRAMMER!!!" so
loudly where people can hear you. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
I suppose that 'use strict' <strong>can</strong> be described as 'a glorified
spell-checker' - after all, you just have - but not by anyone who has
read the documentation or actually knows what it does. On the other
hand, if you class it with other 'spell checkers' such as, say, 'lint',
'valgrind', 'ddd' and so on, then perhaps you're right; it definitely
belongs in that list.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, and because it doesn't need 'xargs' or any equivalent of it - since
&gt; &gt; &gt; the files (or directories) are processed one at a time rather than being
&gt; &gt; &gt; spit out as a (possibly) huge list.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And what do I do when I just want this huge list (or a couple of
&gt; &gt; slightly smaller huge lists)? Push the results to a global array?

That's one of the reasons for using 'strict' and 'warnings'. You don't
have to read anything - they'll just scream at you if you do it wrong.

If I understand what you're saying, that would be something like

$gid = getgrnam($group_A);
$uid = getpwnam($user_B);
 
# Get the perms, owner, and group of the file
($mode, $owner, $group) = (stat($File::Find::name))[2, 4, 5]
	or die "Stat failed: $!\n";
# Mask off the filetype/convert to octal
$mode = sprintf "%04o", $mode &amp; 07777;

Hopefully, the rest is obvious.

Yes, it is, thanks. The problem I had yesterday was to make the code
that find2perl spits out get to work. "find2perl /tmp -perm 0220 -user
lynx" produces code where a hash of all uid/user mappings is created
first.
</p>

<pre>
my (%uid, %user);
while (my ($name, $pw, $uid) = getpwent) {
        $uid{$name} = $uid{$uid} = $uid;
}
</pre>

<p>
And believe it or not, this wasn't working as expected yesterday (or I
was really tired). The "($uid == $uid{'lynx'})" part failed. Too bad the
code I fiddled with is on my machine at home. I'll try again now with a
different code, let's see.

Best,

If you tell Perl to 'use diagnostics;', it will too - in a very
grandmotherly fashion. "Look, I know it's not your fault; you weren't
<strong>really</strong> trying to do anything bad - but this awful thing just
happened..." Unlike 'use warnings' and 'use strict', though, 'use
diagnostics' should be removed before putting the code into production:
it slows things down. For me, the easiest way to use it is from the
command line; that way, there's nothing to remove.
</p>

<pre>
perl -Mdiagnostics scriptname

<p>
I just tried it with '0600' as perms - some of the files I had in '/tmp'
had those - and it worked fine. Try stripping out some of the conditions
in the 'wanted' block and see what happens.
