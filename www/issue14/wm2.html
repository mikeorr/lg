<H2>What is this amazing program?</H2>

<P>
wm2 is a window manager for X.  Using wm2, you can:

<UL>

<LI> move windows around the screen;

<LI> resize windows, both horizontally and vertically;

<LI> hide windows;

<LI> restore hidden windows; and

<LI> delete windows.

</UL>

<P>
wm2 also adds a stylish frame to each managed window.

<P>
wm2 does <em>not</em> provide:

<UL>

<LI> icons;

<LI> configurability;

<LI> a virtual desktop;

<LI> extendible root menus;

<LI> tool bars, button panels, docking areas, &c.

</UL>

wm2 is therefore the ideal window manager for today's elegant and
ascetic programmer.

<H2>
Gasp.  But how?  And why?
</H2>

<P>The briefest contemplation of the modern window manager makes five
points immediately obvious:

<P> <EM> 1. Icons are crap, because no existing window manager manages
them at all well. </EM>

<P> <EM> 2. Configurability is crap, because it takes up so much time
and can never truly compensate for using the wrong design. </EM>

<P> <EM> 3. Long lists of `useful' applications on the root menu are
crap, because however much care you take to add all the applications
you think you'll use, you never actually get it right. </EM>

<P> <EM> 4. The `click-to-focus' versus `focus-follows-pointer' war
doesn't really matter, because most people can get used to
either. </EM>

<P> <EM> 5. Appearance is important. </EM>

<P> Armed with these certainties, therefore, I embarked upon a
spiritualistic quest to write the perfect window manager.  It has a lot
of faults -- more faults than features, probably -- but  the
faults are perfect too.

<H2>What does it look like, and where can I get it?</H2>

<P>
It looks like <A HREF="./gx/ayers/wm2-pic.gif">this</A>, and you can get it
<A HREF= "http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~cannam/wm2.html">here</A>.
The distribution is a gzipped tar file of sources only.  No binaries are
available; you'll have to compile it yourself.  (Binaries would be pretty
useless anyway, as configuration options such as fonts need to be specified
when compiling the program.)  You'll need Unix, X11R4 or newer with the Shape
extension, and a C++ compiler such as gcc.  If you want to put soothing
colored pixmaps into the window frame background, then you'll also need the
Xpm library.

<P>
This distribution is the third release of wm2, which differs in some
ways from the second release.  (A new delayed-auto-raise focus policy
is available; you can now exit from the window manager without having
to kill it from the command-line; and you can choose to have colored
textured backgrounds on the window frames, if you have any backgrounds
you want to use.)

<P>
Note that wm2, even in this third release, does not support
multi-headed displays.  Also, ironically, wm2 does not support
programs that run in shaped windows.

<H2>
Who concocted this evil monstrosity?
</H2>

<P> Chris Cannam, <A
HREF="mailto:cannam@zands.demon.co.uk">cannam@zands.demon.co.uk</A>.
wm2 is partly based on the very minimal window manager <A
HREF="http://www.cs.su.oz.au/~dhog/9wm.html">9wm</A>, which I recommend to
anyone who finds wm2 too gaudy.
