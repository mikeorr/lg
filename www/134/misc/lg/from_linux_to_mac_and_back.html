In November I said I'd gotten a Mac laptop and switched from Linux.
<a href="../../../132/misc/lg/Nokia_tablet_article.html">http://linuxgazette.net/132/misc/lg/Nokia_tablet_article.html</a>
Well, a funny thing happened on the way to MacWorld.  After being
pleased as punch that I had a working webcam and could see my buddies
in Europe on yahoo messenger, and could plug in multimedia devices and
CDs and printers and have them just work immediately, and not have all
these "plugin not available" messages in my web browser, other things
started getting to me.  My non-programmer friend who went from Windows
to Mac and just raves about it does not understand any of this, but I
miss being able to ...
</p>

<p>
- right-click windows and make them go to the back
- hide the maximize button or make it maximize only vertically
- change the window decorations or have the entire window border be a
resize control
- cut &amp; paste by drag-move-click instead of drag, cmd-X, move, click, cmd-V
- install the Gimp by just clicking an entry in the system package manager
- find cool free software, which used to exist by the ton for the Mac
but now all the worthwhile programs seem to be written for Unix, and
you have to use third-party package managers (Fink or DarwinPorts) to
install them -- which may or may not work.
- compile a program that depends on Tk, even though I have Tk
installed.  (./configure doesn't recognize it even though it's in the
default Mac location)
- switch to a second desktop. (Multiple desktops are coming to the
next version of Mac OS X, with much fanfare.)
- have X apps that are first-class citizens.  (Mac X11 is an
application, and X apps are subapplications.  Focus-follows-mouse
works between X applications, but you have to click on an X window to
raise it before using it if you're coming from a Mac application.)
</p>

<p>
Finally I thought, why am I knocking myself out trying to accommodate
myself to the Mac when it's so easy on Linux.  So I switched to my
desktop computer again and installed Kubuntu (from Gentoo).  Ahh, nice
look-and-feel comes back!  Configurability again!  Thousands of
software titles can be downloaded and installed and removed in a few
easy steps!
</p>

<p>
As I've explored more of KDE as it's preconfigured on Kubuntu, I found
that this version it does automatically start a player when you put a
CD on, and opens a image directory when you plug a camera in.
(Actually, you get a choice of several programs to open these in.)
The new Yahoo Messenger for Linux has webcam options, so maybe if I
get a USB webcam it will actually work on Linux now  (I have a bunch
of friends in Europe that I see only every 2-3 years.  Hi bro's!) You
can even drag n drop from one application (GQview image browser) to
another (Firefox upload file dialog) and it pastes the absolute path
of the file.  That pretty much covers everything I wanted from the
Mac.
</p>

<p>
I was kind of bummed I'd spent $1500 on this laptop I wasn't using.
But I'm gonna lend it to my mom because she needs a computer, and her
memory isn't what it was so she forgets how to do things (reading
Thunderbird email) the day after I show her.  She'll find the
well-written manual and free classes helpful.  The Mac comes with the
best user's manual I've ever seen.  It explains things from the
standpoint of what non-tekkies want to do.  One of the things my
friend raves about is the friendly non-condescending attitude of the
staff at the Apple store (no "you're stupid because you don't
understand this" attitude like every other computer salesman he's
encountered), and how they have free classes covering the kinds of
things he wants to know about using his computer.  You can't get a PC
laptop with that kind of support.  That got me thinking.  If somebody
opened a Linux storefront and staffed it with people who can talk
non-tekkie, and wrote a really good users' manual, and offered free
classes on how to use your computer, they'd sell a lot of systems.
I've seen laptops with Linux preinstalled and I've always passed them
up as being too expensive, but now I think my next PC laptop will be
one of those.  Why not let a company go through the hassle of getting
Linux to work with the proprietary video card and hardware, and tell
you definitively whether the built-in modem or wi-fi works with Linux
before you buy it?  That's worth another $500 to me compared to a
generic laptop.
</p>

<p>
Two pieces of trivia to finish with...
</p>

<p>
1) It was funny reading the six-page EULA that came with the Mac.  I
knew I was going to accept it, but it reminded me I hadn't used
commercial software for seven years. (Except a little bit of MS Office
or custom Windows programs at work.)
</p>

<p>
2) The funniest thing about the Mac was seeing the "DVD player"
application in the
Applications folder.  It was a shock to realize I could legally play a
DVD on this computer. (!)  I'd gotten so used to not being able to do
this on Linux that I'd forgotten that other people do watch DVDs on
their computers.  But the funny thing is, I still haven't used it.
Why would I want to watch a DVD on my computer when I can watch it on
my TV?
</p>

<p>
Yes, I know I can install Linux on my Mac.  I'm just not quite ready
to delete my entire-disk partition and run the risk of turning it into
a doorstop though....

<p>
Hi Mike,
</p>

<p>
Hold on, I thought Kubuntu is a Debian-based, not Gentoo-based, right? <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Ahh, nice look-and-feel comes back!  Configurability again!
</pre>

<p>
Indeed. I switched a bunch of my machines to Ubuntu (Dapper Drake) over
the last year or so, and I've been astounded by how stuff "just works".
</p>

<p>
And not just little things, stuff that usually takes ages to figure out,
like 3D acceleration:
  <a href="http://www.penlug.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/LinuxHardwareInfoToshibaTecra9000">http://www.penlug.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/LinuxHardwareInfoToshibaTecra9000</a>
and support for xvmc in the nVidia drivers:
  <a href="http://www.penlug.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/LinuxHardwareInfoNvidia5200">http://www.penlug.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/LinuxHardwareInfoNvidia5200</a>
All stuff that "just works" in Ubuntu.
</p>

<p>
And Ubuntu has such a nice simple "update" button that launches a cute
graphical package update tool, I hardly even have to do any typing these days
to keep the home systems up to date, which is a great time-saver.
</p>

<p>
I've been too busy with work to even hope to keep up with what's going on
in linux these days, but being able to depend on linux even if you're
too busy to keep track of the details is kind of reassuring.
</p>

<p>
I find that most proprietary software tends to go to pieces without a lot of
care and feeding, but linux systems just keep right on going even if you're
completely swamped and only have time to do the bare minimum (making
backups and doing the security updates).
</p>


<pre>
&gt;  Thousands of software titles can be downloaded and installed and removed in a few
&gt; easy steps!
</pre>

<p>
Yep, too easy. Just need to watch out for the quirky package renaming
blitz that's been going on recently, with thunderbird becoming "icedove" and
ethereal becoming wireshark. Throws me for a loop when a program is
just "gone" but it's still "there" under a new name <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>


<pre>
&gt; As I've explored more of KDE as it's preconfigured on Kubuntu, I found
&gt; that this version it does automatically start a player when you put a
&gt; CD on, and opens a image directory when you plug a camera in.
</pre>

<p>
Yep, I was surprised by that too. Ubuntu even did the right thing for
a couple of
external firewire hard drives, and it gets the wireless stuff working on the
laptop too easily now. Even the previous generation of pcHDTV card (the HD3000)
works "out of the box".
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Why not let a company go through the hassle of getting
&gt; Linux to work with the proprietary video card and hardware, and tell
&gt; you definitively whether the built-in modem or wi-fi works with Linux
&gt; before you buy it?  That's worth another $500 to me compared to a
&gt; generic laptop.
</pre>

<p>
Or just use a slightly older laptop? Linux tends to run fine on hardware
that Microsoft users have discarded as being too slow (or too small).
And it runs great on Apple hardware, which is very nice in the first place.
</p>

<p>
Well maybe I had a spot of beginner's luck with Ubuntu, but
my feeling is that Linux is pulling ahead faster every day, with more
people joining in all the time.
</p>

<p>
Cheers,
Peter.

Correct.  I used Debian for nine years, switched to Gentoo two years
ago, and now came "back" to Kubuntu.

You never tried to view a WMV file?  I was shocked when my MacBook said

I've never done any of those.
</p>

<p>
This, to me, is one of the things that makes Macs and Windows inferior
to Linunx/X11/X. And the other thing? Right-button clicking in a
scrollbar moves you up/down a page and middle button clicking jumps you
to that spot in the document.  On a OS X, it's an either-or proposition;
you can't do both.
</p>


<pre>

</pre>

<p>
Oh right, there are GUIs for that now, aren't there. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
</p>

<p>
C'mon though, Mac OS X comes with bash, Perl, ruby, python, screen
Samba, postfix, etc. already installed.  What do you need a GUI for? <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
</p>

least for non-commercial use.

<pre>

&gt; next version of Mac OS X, with much fanfare.)
</pre>

<p>
To be fair, they'll be able to do things with VDs that I've not seen
done elsewhere: not only will you be able to hit a button and view all
four desktops at once a la' Expose, you'll also be able to drag-n-drop
between the Expose-d desktops.

<p>
Have you seen the hullaballo about BootCamp?  The ability to boot
multiple OSes on one machine is <strong>such</strong> an amazing thing to these people.

&gt; Finally I thought, why am I knocking myself out trying to accommodate

<p>
I don't think it's easier on Linux. I think it's more of a what-you-are-used-to 
mentality than anything else.

I highly reccomend Emperor Linux.  The Dell laptop I got from them back

Automounting should certainly be something which one can toggle. My
friend has a phone which offers its data-space as a USB storage
device. When it is connected to a Mac, automount kicks in and so one
has to go about un-mounting it everytime one wants to use the phone
for dialout!
</p>

<p>
Other cribs about the Mac. I have still not figured out how to play
oggs streams in a way that does not conflict with using iTunes for other
sound streams. Perhaps the only solution is to bypass iTunes for
<strong>all</strong> sound streams. (xmms2 anyone).
</p>

Note that Debian and Ubuntu install quite niftily on a Mac notebook.
you need to install the broadcom wireless driver from non-free
though.

The Kububtu and Ubuntu sites have CD images for PowerPC macs but not

<p>
As far as I know a x86 Linux does work -- but Apple changed the x86
based Macs to some "modern" bios/boot system and to install winXX it is
necessary to install apples boot-patch to emualte a boot sequence Win
understands. That might be necessary for linux too -- or maybe not (any
more).
