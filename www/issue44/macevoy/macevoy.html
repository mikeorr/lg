<P> <HR> <P>  

The point of this article is to introduce a tool I call perlpp,
the Perl preprocessor. Since I wrote it, perlpp is not available in any
Linux distribution. See Resources for information on obtaining perlpp
and the examples described here.
<p>
<b>perlpp</b> is a beefy version of <b>cpp</b>, the C preprocessor;
it can do what cpp can do and much more. For example, introducing the
idea of code templates in any programming language is easy with perlpp.
<p>
Using <b>perlpp</b>, the Perl preprocessor, requires at least a
rudimentary knowledge of programming in Perl. Perl 5 or later must be
installed on your system.
<p>
Since Perl is such a useful language, almost every programmer should
know a little about it. I will start by covering some of the rudiments
of Perl used in the examples. If you are already fairly comfortable with
Perl, move on to the next section.
<p>
<b>Variables.</b>  Scalar variables, which can take on values of strings,
integers, or doubles, always have a <tt>$</tt> as the first
character. List variables, which are simple lists of scalars, always have
a <tt>@</tt> as the first character. All variables are global,
unless preceded by <tt>my</tt> when first used within a block.
<p>
<b>String quoting.</b> Strings can be quoted three ways in
Perl. They can be quoted almost exactly using single forward quotes
(<tt>'</tt>), quoted with interpolation using double quotes
(<tt>&quot;</tt>), or system quotes using single back quotes
(<tt>`</tt>). We will present more detail on this later,
but basically:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>	Single-quoted strings are subject to minimal
translation. For example, <tt>'\n'</tt> is a
backslash followed by the letter n.
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>	Double-quoted strings have a great deal of
translation. For example, <tt>&quot;i=$i\n&quot;</tt> is the
characters <tt>i=</tt>, followed by the value of the variable
<tt>$i</tt>, followed by a new-line character. In Perl parlance,
double-quoted strings are said to be <i>interpolated</i>.
  <li>	Back-quoted strings are interpolated like double-quoted
strings, but the value of a back-quoted string is the output (whatever is
sent to STDOUT) of executing the translated string as a shell command. For
example, <tt>`ls $dir`</tt> is the output of running
the <tt>ls</tt> command with the value of <tt>$dir</tt>
as an argument.
</ul>
<b>Loops.</b> Perl supports the csh-style loop of the form
<p>
<pre>
foreach $index (@LIST) { 
   statement1;
   statement2; 
   .... 
}
</pre>
as well as the C-style loop:
<p>
<pre>
for (<i>do-once</i>; <i>check-first-each-time</i>; <i>do-last-each-time</i>) { 
   statement1;
   statement2; 
   .... 
}
</pre>
Both types are used in the examples.
<p>
In fact, the basic syntax of Perl mimics C in many respects, so C
programmers can read Perl scripts fairly easy. No, that is too bold:
a C programmer can write C-looking Perl, and it will mostly work as
expected. A Perl programmer would solve the same problem in a completely
different manner. In doing so, he may accomplish something difficult to
imagine: a program more obscure than what can readily be written in C.
If you don't believe me, look at the perlpp source, which is a
Perl script.
<p>
Perl is a great deal more than this tiny view, but these ideas should
be enough to understand the examples. See Resources for more information
about Perl.
<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Let's begin by talking about cpp. C programmers don't get
far before learning that C programs, at least logically, pass through
two stages of translation. The first stage, the preprocessing stage,
uses commands such as
<p>
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</pre>
and
<p>
<pre>
#define FOO(<i>x</i>) bar(<i>x</i>)
</pre>
to translate the hybrid C/cpp input file into a pure C input file,
which is then input to the pure C compiler. Pictorially,
<p>
<pre>
<i>input_file</i> -&gt; cpp -&gt; cc1 -&gt; <i>object_file</i>
</pre>
While the intended job of cpp is to preprocess input files for a C
(or C++) compiler, it can be used to preprocess other files. For example,
<b>xrdb</b> uses cpp to preprocess X11 resource files before loading them.
<b>cpp</b> is a very useful tool, but a programmer can quickly run into
limitations, essentially because cpp is a macro-processor with limited
facilities for computation and the manipulation of text.
<p>
The reason I wrote perlpp was to overcome these limitations for a
scientific computation problem at Pacific Northwest National Laboratories,
where I wrote the chemical equilibrium portion of a ground water transport
model. For the sake of compatibility with the rest of the model, it had to
be programmed in FORTRAN. For the sake of compatibility with Linux, Sun
and SGI development environments, it had to be FORTRAN 77. The problem
statement was roughly this: given the chemical equilibrium equations
for a given set of species, automatically generate an efficient reliable
solver for these equations.
<p>
This created a need to go from chemical equilibrium equations in symbolic
form to the generation of a Maple V (a symbolic mathematics package)
batch file from a template, followed by the inclusion of the results
from that batch file into a template-generated FORTRAN subroutine library
that satisfied the requirements of the project.
<p>
This environment required the automatic generation of several kinds of
programs from templates and was a natural breeding ground for thoughts
about useful preprocessors. Although it took me most of a week to come
up with the alpha version of perlpp, it easily saved that amount of
time just for that one project. Solving the same problem without it
may have taken four or five weeks longer. Furthermore, without perlpp,
the project would be much harder to maintain.
<p>
<h3>What Perlpp Does</h3>
<p>
<b>perlpp</b> takes input files and generates perl scripts which,
when run, create similar but better output files.
<p>
<h3>Example 1: Hello World!</h3>
<p>
Create a file called hello.c.ppp containing the lines
<p>
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main()
{
printf(&quot;Hello World!\n&quot;);
return 0;
}
</pre>
Now run the perlpp command by typing:
<p>
<pre>
perlpp -pl hello.c.ppp
</pre>
The <tt>-pl</tt> option is discussed later. If you
check, perlpp created the file hello.c.pl, which contains the following
Perl script:
<p>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
print '#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
';
print 'int main()
';
print '{
';
print '  printf(&quot;Hello World!\\n&quot;);
';
print '  return 0;
';
print '}
';
</pre>
Your mileage may vary on the exact contents of the first line. See
<A HREF="#macevoy_troubleshooting">"Troubleshooting"</A> if you have problems
generating this script.
<p>
Running hello.c.pl generates the same text as the original input
file, hello.c.ppp. In this way, perlpp can be viewed as an obscure and
computationally expensive way to copy text files.
<p>
The <tt>-pl</tt> option means ``create a perl
program''. If you leave it off, it simply runs the program and
saves the output in hello.c. This means
<p>
<pre>
perlpp hello.c.ppp
</pre>
is equivalent to
<p>
<pre>
perlpp -pl hello.c.ppp
  ./hello.c.pl &gt; hello.c
  rm hello.c.pl
</pre>
except that the file <tt>hello.c.pl</tt> is never explicitly
created.
<p>
So our first example, hello.c.ppp, when normally processed by perlpp,
creates a copy of itself, hello.c. While this should not excite you,
it should not surprise you either. After all, if you processed a text
file using cpp, containing no cpp directives, you would get back exactly
what you put in.
<p>
<b>cpp</b> is interesting only when the input file contains cpp directives.
Perlpp is only slightly interesting when the input file contains no
perlpp directives, because it generates a Perl script that regenerates
the input file using print statements. To get any further, the perlpp
directives must be used.
<p>
<h3>Directives</h3>
<p>
Only four directives are available for perlpp, along with a default
directive. Each describes how a given line of input will be translated
into the perl script.
<p>
<ol>
  <li>	<b>!</b> Perl source rule: if the first character of a line is
a ! (bang), copy the remaining part of the line to the generated perl
script verbatim.
  <li>	<tt>'</tt> print exact: If the first character
of a line is a <tt>'</tt> (single quote), then generate
a single-quoted (uninterpolated) print statement. Executing this print
statement will produce the remaining part of the input line exactly.
  <li>	<tt>&quot;</tt> print interpolated: if the first
character of a line is a <tt>&quot;</tt> (double quote),
generate a double-quoted (interpolating) print statement. For more on
interpolating strings, see the <b>perlop</b> man page. If use locale
is in effect, the case map used by \l, \L, \u and &lt;\U&gt;
is taken from the current locale. See the <b>perllocale</b> man page.
[It should be noted that \\ (two backslashes) in an
interpolated string translates into a single backslash, so \\n
interpolates to \n in the output. This will show up in our next
example.]
  <li>	<tt>`</tt> print system: if the first character
of a line is a <tt>`</tt> (back quote), then generate a
back-quoted (system) print statement. Executing this print statement
will produce the output of, first, interpolating the remainder of the line
as in rule 2 above, then running the interpolated text as a shell command.
</ol>
If none of the characters bang(!), single
quote(<tt>'</tt>), double quote(<tt>&quot;</tt>) or
back quote(<tt>`</tt>) begin a line, a default translation
occurs:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>	With no <tt>-qq</tt> option, perlpp
treats these lines as if they began with a single quote, i.e., use the
``print exact'' rule 2.
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>	With the <tt>-qq</tt> option, perlpp
treats these lines as if they began with a double quote, i.e., use the
``print interpolated'' rule 3.
</ul>
<h3>Example 2: Salutations</h3>
<p>
Create a file called salutations.c.ppp containing the lines:
<p>
<pre>
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  int main()
  {
  !foreach $s ('Hello World!','Hola Mundo!', 'Ciao!') {
  &quot;  printf(&quot;$s\\n&quot;);
  !}
    return 0;
  }
</pre>
Let's first look at the generated Perl script by typing:
<p>
<pre>
perlpp -pl salutations.c.ppp
</pre>
In salutations.c.pl, you will find
<p>
<pre>
  print '#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  ';
  print 'int main()
  ';
  print '{
  ';
  foreach $s ('Hello World!','Hola Mundo!', 'Ciao!') { 
  print &quot;  printf(\&quot;$s\\n\&quot;);
  &quot;;
  }
  print '  return 0;
  ';
  print '}
  ';
</pre>
Look carefully at the print statement generated by the printf statement
in salutations.c.ppp:
<p>
<pre>
print &quot;  printf(\&quot;$s\\n\&quot;);
  &quot;;
</pre>
Perlpp goes to the trouble of adding backslashes where appropriate so
that double quotes do not prematurely terminate the string. The same idea
applies to the other forms of quoted print statements perlpp generates.
<p>
Let perlpp run this script for us with
<p>
<pre>
perlpp salutations.c.ppp
</pre>
This generates the file salutations.c,
<p>
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main()
{
printf(&quot;Hello World!\n&quot;);
printf(&quot;Hola Mundo!\n&quot;);
printf(&quot;Ciao!\n&quot;);
return 0;
}
</pre>
<h3>Example 3: Fast Point Template</h3>
<p>
This last example uses perlpp to generate a template for fixed-length
vector classes in C++, where loops are unwound. Unwinding a loop means,
for example, replacing the code
<p>
<pre>
for (int i=0; i&lt;3; ++i) a[i]=i;
</pre>
with
<p>
<pre>
a[0]=0; a[1]=1; a[2]=2;
</pre>
Unwinding the loop does not change the effect of the code, but it
does make it faster. This is because the index variable does not have
to be incremented and compared between each assignment.
<p>
Such a fixed-length template class would be useful, for example, in
a graphics library where two-dimensional and three-dimensional vectors
of fixed types (float, int, double) would be used by the package.
All of these would be essentially the same--and thus a candidate
for a template class--except that the performance overhead for the
looping may not be acceptable in such a high-end application.
<p>
<b>perlpp</b> can help here. <b>perlpp</b> is first used to generate a Perl
program (using the <tt>-pl</tt> option) from a template
file, Point.Template.ppp. The Point.Template.pl script is designed
to create different fixed-length vector classes, depending on what
arguments are passed to it. Using the back-quote print system directive,
this script is then used in the primary source file, testPoint.cpp.ppp,
to generate the specific desired class.
<p>
The file Point.Template.ppp is fairly long, and available by anonymous
FTP as noted in Resources. Consequently, I will consider only
the portions of this file which illustrate something interesting about
how to use perlpp.
<p>
The first interesting line of <tt>Point.Template.ppp</tt> is
<p>
<pre>
! eval join(&quot;;&quot;,@ARGV);
</pre>
This, of course, will translate into the Perl statement
<p>
<pre>
eval join(&quot;;&quot;,@ARGV);
</pre>
Only the leading bang is deleted. Executing this line joins all
the command-line arguments of the script, separated by semicolons, and
evaluates that as a sequence of Perl statements. This is an extremely
crude form of command-line argument processing, but it serves our
purposes.
<p>
The next few lines check that the previous command-line evaluation
actually defined three crucial variables:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>	<tt>$name</tt>: the desired name of the class
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>	<tt>$dim</tt>: the dimension of the vector
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>	<tt>$type</tt>: type of the vector
</ul>
If they were not defined, the script writes to STDERR about it and
exits with an exit code of 1.
<p>
After this, the template goes about the business of generating the
desired class. This begins with
<p>
<pre>
&quot;class $name {
&quot;public:
!#
!# Declare internal array of desired type and size
!#
&quot;  $type a[$dim];
&quot;  static const int dim=$dim;
</pre>
Here <tt>$name</tt>, <tt>$type</tt> and
<tt>$dim</tt> are used to create specific text in the
class definition. In Perl, <tt>#</tt> denotes a comment, so
<tt>!#</tt> is effectively a comment in perlpp.
<p>
The first instance of loop unwinding is seen in the default
constructor for the class. The lines
<p>
<pre>
!  for ($i=0; $i&lt;$dim; ++$i) {
&quot;    a[$i]=0;
!  }
</pre>
translate into the Perl segment
<p>
<pre>
for ($i=0; $i&lt;$dim; ++$i) {
     print(&quot;    a[$i]=0;
&quot;);
}
</pre>
This loop is executed in the Perl script as the preprocessor, where
the assignment will be expanded to a sequence of assignments in the C++
class source. Loops are unwound in a similar fashion in other parts of
the class definition.
<p>
Efficiency aside, the next block of the perlpp source provides a class
constructor that would be impossible to declare using standard template
facilities: one with as many arguments as the dimension of the vector
class to be constructed.
<p>
<pre>
  !  @arg=(); for ($i=0; $i&lt;$dim; ++$i) { $arg[$i]=&quot;$type a$i&quot;; } 
  !  $args=join(',',@arg);
  !
  &quot;  $name($args)
</pre>
If you are new to Perl, the first line may be difficult to
understand. It begins by setting the <tt>@arg</tt> list
to an empty list, then loops to build <tt>$dim</tt> entries
in <tt>@arg</tt>: <tt>&quot;$type a0&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;$type a1&quot;</tt>, etc. The reason elements of
<tt>@arg</tt> are denoted by <tt>$arg[$i]</tt>
in the for loop is that <tt>@arg</tt>, once subscripted,
refers to the scalar variable available as the <i>i</i>th entry of
<tt>@arg</tt>. Remember, scalar variables always begin with
a <tt>$</tt> character--even those tucked inside a list.
<p>
Following this declaration, the constructor is defined to initialize
the vector with its arguments:
<p>
<pre>
&quot;  {
!    for ($i=0; $i&lt;$dim; ++$i) {
&quot;      a[$i]=a$i;
!    }
&quot;  }
</pre>
This is followed by the definition of subscript operators, which are
perfectly standard. After this, another feature of perlpp is illustrated:
the code for defining all the assignment operators is generated using
a loop structure:
<p>
<pre>
!  foreach $op (&quot;=&quot;,&quot;+=&quot;,&quot;-=&quot;,&quot;*=&quot;,&quot;/=&quot;) {
    .
    . # define the $op assignment operator
    .
!  }
</pre>
Since all the assignment operators are defined in essentially the
same way, this loop allows the template to be written more compactly
than with the standard template facilities. This makes the template
faster to write, maintain and debug.
<p>
A similar loop follows this to define the various binary operators for
the class: addition, subtraction, etc. These loops reduce the redundancy
of effort in defining the template, which, amusingly, is itself a tool
to reduce redundancy of effort. Okay, I admit I am easily amused.
<p>
The rest of the template declares and defines three operators, I/O
functions and a scalar multiply. They do what they are supposed to do,
and nothing new about perlpp is learned by going over them.
<p>
Let's move on to using Point.Template.ppp. First, convert it to
a Perl script with the command:
<p>
<pre>
perlpp -pl Point.Template.ppp
</pre>
Now look in the test program source file, testPoint.cpp.ppp.
The only interesting line is
<p>
<pre>
` ./Point.Template.pl '\$name=&quot;FixVect&quot;' '\$dim=2' '\$type=&quot;float&quot;'
</pre>
This runs the Point.Template.pl script just generated with
the arguments:
<p>
<pre>
$name=&quot;FixVect&quot;  $dim=2 $type=&quot;float&quot;
</pre>
With these arguments, the template script prints out a
<tt>FixVect</tt> class, which represents two-dimensional arrays of
floats. The back-quote perlpp directive includes this in the
testPoint.cpp source file.
<p>
Generating template classes in this way is not completely
satisfying, because the idea of declaring and defining the class
must usually be separated. However, this can be corrected by
modifications of the template file. Essentially, a fourth variable
could be set on calling the script, <tt>$use</tt>, which
has a value of either <tt>&quot;declare&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;define&quot;</tt>. Using if clauses, the script
would then provide either the definition or declaration portion of the
class. This is yet another way in which the redundancy of a template
can be reduced using perlpp.
<p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>
I don't want to leave you thinking of perlpp as sort of a
``compression algorithm.''  Keeping ideas together in a
project simplifies maintaining them. The goal of perlpp is to prevent
``concept leakage,'' where several parts of source files
redundantly represent an idea, and those source files have to be
maintained separately.
<p>
Essentially, perlpp replaces the rather rigid (but simple!)
text-processing language available as cpp with the expressive (but
complex) text-processing language available as Perl. Many programmers
use Perl in any case, so knowing the syntax of Perl pays twice: once
as a language in itself, and once as a powerful macro language for any
programming language.
<p>
If you don't know Perl, then perlpp is just another good reason
to learn it.

<p>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>
<b>perlpp</b> is a Perl script that generates Perl scripts. To use it, you
must have Perl installed, and perlpp must be able to find it. If
perlpp does not work, check that the first two lines of perlpp
reflect the actual location of your Perl executable.
<p>
If these are correct, make sure that execute permissions are set for
the script (<tt>chmod 755 perlpp</tt>), and that perlpp is visible from
your <tt>PATH</tt>.
<p>
If you just installed perlpp, you may have to refresh your shell PATH
directory cache with <tt>hash -r</tt> (if you use bash) or
<tt>rehash</tt>
(if you use csh).
<p>

<p>
<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>
Thanks to the Linux community for providing such a wonderful
environment for reliable scientific computations. I try very hard not
to taunt every time a colleague of mine tries to accomplish something
useful on a machine which crashes so often they have come to expect it.
<p>
I also want to thank Mike Littlejohn for test-driving perlpp and this
article, as well as Karl Castleton, Steve Yabusaki and Ashok Chilakapati
for getting me on the groundwater modeling project.
<p>
Finally, thanks to Pacific Northwest National Laboratories, the
Associated Western Universities fellowship program, and Mesa State
College for allowing me the time, resources and opportunity to develop
perlpp.
<p>

<p>
<h3>A Story</h3>
<p>
Over the summer, I left my Red Hat 5.0 machine running in my Mesa
State College, Grand Junction, Colorado office. I then went to
Pacific Northwest National Laboratories in Richland, Washington,
where I dreamed up perlpp.
<p>
I used my Linux box remotely for the whole summer: web-browsing,
e-mail, obtaining old source files, using Emacs, Maple, TeX, Perl
or the FORTRAN compiler. It's true that I used these tools on the
PNNL machines as well, but sometimes a license was not available, or
the Linux tool was better for my purposes than what I could obtain at
the lab.
<p>
For six weeks I used that machine remotely at least once each day.
Only once did I have a problem with connecting to it.
After the summer, I learned that my Colorado office, which is in a
building that is being remodeled, had experienced several power
failures. Apparently, my machine had restarted each time without a
hitch, and I had only noticed the single time I requested something
during an outage.
<p>
That is far more reliability--and accessibility--than many of
my colleagues experience with other operating systems.
