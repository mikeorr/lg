	>Greetings from Jim Dennis</H3>
<!-- begin greeting -->
<P>I had a great time this weekend at an annual science fiction conference
named <a href="http://www.baycon.org/">Baycon</a>.  Heather and I were staff
in their first terminal room, sponsored by <a href="http://www.redhat.com/"
	>Red Hat</a>, <a href="http://www.linuxcare.com/">LinuxCare</a>, 
	and <a href="http://www.valinux.com/">VA Linux Systems</a> and it was
	a rousing success.  Other SF conventions are looking forward to doing
	the same.
</P><P>
 Good news: Heather, my wife and principle editor,
 will be taking over the Answer Blurb.  She's refined her 
 'lgazmail' PERL script to the point where she can take up the
 slack and has graciously agreed to take over responsibility
 for the monthly blurb as well.
</P><P>
 Long time readers may recall that early Answer Guy columns
 had no blurbs.  They also had no HTML formatting.  The URLs
 weren't even wrapped in links!  I'd been frustrated by this
 for some time --- from about the time that I realized that
 Marjorie (then the editor of LG) was publishing my responses
 as a column, (and that she had dubbed me with as "The Answer 
 Guy" --- a title that still makes me nervous).  
</P><P>
 Heather agreed to step of to the plate and do the formatting.  
 She tried a few mail-to-web utilities like MHOnArc, and
 John Callendar's Babymail, etc.  Then she decided to derive
 her own from a Babymail source.  So her script reads "Jim's
 e-mail markup hints" and converts it to reasonable HTML.
</P><P>
 Heather also designed and drew the new Answer Guy Wizard (TM?)
 with its distinctive Question Crystal Ball and Answer Speak Bubble
 --- which visually refer to the question and answer speak bubbles
 throughout the column.  (She's also added the pilcrow bubble
 for editorial comments).
</P><P>
 In other words, Heather went way beyond just "wrapping the URLs
 in links" and completely overhauled the visual look of our
 column.
</P><P>
 I should also note that Heather is no slouch technically.  She
 has often helped me find answers to questions --- including the
 answers that I've published here.
</P><P>
 When we did that overhaul I also decided to add the "blurbs"
 The idea was to say things of interest that were not in response
 to any questions.  (I suppose I could've use a shill to jury rig
 the desired questions, but that would be cheating!).
</P><P>
 The blurb has sometimes been editorial (commenting on the
 Mindcraft/Microsoft fiasco and the wonderful Linux community
 anti-FUD response).  Sometimes it's been a summary and commentary
 on the sorts of questions we got in the previous month, feedback
 that we got from my answers, and any trends that we were seeing,
 etc.  
</P><P>
 For awhile I tried to identify a specific person and 
 forum every month --- to recognize them with the "Answer Guy's
 Support Award."  I wanted to point out where other individuals
 were providing lots of technical support in more specific forms
 of support in various fora.  For instance in May I wanted to
 recognize Ben Collins of the Debian-SPARC mailing list.  He
 seems to respond to most of the questions that show up there.
 (Unfortunately I was too much of a flake to keep that up for 
 long.  It's hard to dig up a really good new selection every month).
</P><P>
 Of course there have also been the two April Fool's hoax blurbs
 and a few others that weren't really there.
</P><P>
 The sad fact is that I don't have enough time to conceive and compose
 articles for this column every month.  It is much easier for me to
 answer questions (react) than to write from scratch.  (I tend to
 digress enough when there IS a question at hand.  I'm a regular
 attention deficit train wreck when left to my own devices!).
</P><P>
 Let me reassure everyone that I'm not leaving the "Answer Guy" 
 column.  I'm somewhat compulsive about answering technical questions,
 and I used to make a hobby out of USENet netnews before the
 advent of LG ensured that I get a 100 or so diverse Linux questions 
 every month in my inbox.  I sometimes still make it out to
 USENet --- though I dropped the uucp netnews feed that used to
 fill the disk on antares on a semi-regular basis!  (Now I just
 telnet out to a shell account at my ISP, or use my $NNTPSERVER
 environment setting to get to his news server).
</P><P>
 I'll also probably still insert a few comments to supplement 
 Heather's.  
</P>

<P>
Hi everybody.  I suppose I don't have to introduce myself now.  I will
also be taking on some deeper organizational features -- in the next few
months we'll see a revamp of how Tips, the Mailbag, and Answer Guy messages
are formatted -- though I think they won't look all that different.
</P><P>
Also, we'll have more Wizards joining us.  Jim had from the early days 
conveived of this as The Answer Gang -- he was just helping an editor with
a few technical notes, a role which anyone can play.  The Mailbag and Tips
is popular and more gurus are around, now.  If you'd like to join The 
Answer Gang as a regular, let us know what your specialties are.  
</p><p>
I'll have something more "Blurb"ish next month.  On to the answers!
