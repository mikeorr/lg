The following is a sampling of the responses we got to our recent <a
href="../169/lg_backpage.html">Backpage</a>. Thank you all! I've read
every one of these with interest, and am considering how to integrate the
best of your ideas and suggestions in order to make LG better.<br>

<h3>
Don't die, improvise
</h3>

<p>
I see <a href="http://www.linuxquestions.org">linuxquestions.org</a> is quite busy
and I have found it a good place to look for ideas on related problems to
mine. Similarly Google, with the right choice and order of keywords works
wonders these days. I still find that I have a big need (when I try to get
around to it) for well written howtos on things like setting up a simple
home DNS, sendmail, IP traffic accounting per day per machine, mumble, etc.
(Read: A five easy step wizard type thing for my distribution is required).
Things like IPtables and sendmail configuration files, .m4 are still
daunting to me. Real scary stuff. The moment I sit down, starting to read
up on it, someone in the house would like to do this or that and would just
like to ask...
</p> 

<p>
What I would not mind is a monthly email reminder on the
latest linuxgazette issue. (The LQ email is not too much spam for me.)
Whenever I have come across your magazine, I never have been disappointed
with the read and always tried to make a mental note to come back to it,
but just like the commercial magazines sites just lay there as a possible
reference for new information. (Yes, I am not a frequent reader.) I would
like to know which howtos are newly updated and worth a read and which are
too outdated (for the current releases of which distributions) How about
more cross links to and from new and updated articles in previous and
current issues - like LQ's list at the bottom of the page.  I would like to
know more about the kernel development (in a nutshell) that I can
understand.  What info is just as well documented on wikipedia?  To what
extend would articles already published elsewhere (commercially) be allowed
to be published here later (on LG.net)?

[ We send out a monthly reminder e-mail, with the article titles and
summaries, via the <a
href="http://lists.linuxgazette.net/mailman/listinfo/lg-announce">lg-announce
mailing list</a>; we also notify the world via a note on Facebook and
Twitter (thanks to Anderson Silva). Meanwhile, funny you should mention -
Rick Moen just wrote a series on DNS in issue 170. As far as links to and
from old issues, our <a
href="http://linuxgazette.net/faq/kb.html">Knowledge Base</a> has lots of
links to our previous articles. Do be aware, however, that many articles
drift out of scope after a while; Linux tends to grow by leaps and bounds,
so relevant information changes over time.
</p>

<p class="editorial">
As to republishing articles, that depends on how restrictive the original
publication license was (essentially, how much of their rights to the work
the author has signed away or retained.) Assuming that we can re-release it
under the OPL, and the subject matter is relevant to LG's mission, I'll be
happy to take a look at it. ]

<h3>
Why I hope that the Linux Gazette continues to publish
</h3>

<p>
I saw your Back Page letter in the December issue, asking to hear the
voices of your readers.  As a long-time silent reader of the Linux
Gazette, I guess I am overdue in letting you know why I find the Gazette a
valuable resource.
</p>

<p>
Although I could probably ramble on for quite a while, I'll limit myself
to the following four reasons why I hope that the Gazette lives for years
to come.
</p>


<h4>
1.  The Linux Gazette provides original content.
</h4>

<p>
In earlier times, sites with original content were not hard to find on the
Internet.  A search engine might direct you to dozens of sites run by
people or organizations that were actively involved, or at least
well-versed, in the subject you were seeking information about.  Often
times these sites existed because the people that created them had a
passion for the subject, wanted to share their knowledge of it, and took
pride in doing so.
</p>

<p>
These days, instead of dozens of sites, a search engine might direct you
to hundreds or thousands of sites.  Unfortunately, most of these sites
will contain information simply copied from other sites -- often sites
that have already copied it from somewhere else.
</p>

<p>
The people behind such sites do not have a passion for your subject of
interest, and they take no pride in presenting accurate information. These
sites exist in hopes of generating advertising revenue.
</p>

<p>
The Linux Gazette, on the other hand, has roots that go back to the days
when the desire to share helpful information was often the main
inspiration for creating a web site.  And the folks behind the Gazette
have continued the tradition to the present.
</p>

<p>
When I am looking for Linux-related information, <tt>"site:linuxgazette.net"</tt>
are often the first words I type into the search engine.  Often I will
find just what I need.  And when I don't find what I need, I will soon
know that; I won't have had to wade through a lot of crap before coming up
empty-handed.
</p>


<h4>
2.  The Linux Gazette focuses on substance over style.
</h4>

<p>I don't go to my web browser because I want to look at the latest artistic
creation of some overpaid web designer.  I want information.  And I don't
want to see the latest state-of-the-art methods of distracting me from
getting to and reading the information.
</p>

<p>
The Linux Gazette is mostly just good ol' HTML.  (Well, these days I guess
it is actually XHTML, but isn't that mostly good ol' HTML?)  And that is
all that it needs to be.  And that means that anyone can actually read it
with any browser, with no need to update to this week's version, or
reading and agreeing to a long license agreement for and downloading some
proprietary "helper".
</p>

<p>
While things like javascript and flash certainly have their place in the
world, when they are used for content which could easily be presented with
HTML they are an unnecessary complication.  And I appreciate it when web
sites are designed without unnecessary complications.
</p>

<p>
To say that the Gazette focuses on substance over style, certainly does
not mean that it lacks style.  I find the elegantly simple style to be a
welcome change from the overly-busy pages that seem to predominate on the
Web today.
</p>

<p>
Let's see, you go to linuxgazette.net and are presented with a list of
issues.  Clicking on an issue brings you the table of contents for that
issue.  Clicking on an article name brings you to the article.  What could
be more straight-forward than that?  And if you are looking for something
other than the content of the magazine, there is a clearly-labeled
navigation bar at the top of the page.
</p>

<p>
By contrast the current fashion seems to be to provide multiple lists of
links -- on the left side, on the right side, in the middle, at the top,
at the bottom, wherever links can be placed to allow you to go directly to
almost any other page on the web site and half a dozen other web sites as
well.  Never mind that I came to the page for some specific content
(perhaps one of those many lists) and don't want to spend time looking
around the page to see where it is hiding.
</p>

<p>
Give me a nice hierarchical layout like LG uses any day.
</p>

<p>
Centuries ago, newspapers realized that text was easier on the eyes if the
lines were not too long.  Because the Gazette minimizes its formatting, I
can (as I prefer) use a small window for my browser and the text, being
HTML, will be adjusted into lines that are a length which is easy to read.
</p>

<p>
By contrast, many sites these days override this wonderful feature of
HTML, and force me to read lines of a length that have been hard-coded by
their web site designers.  And these designers have not had a good
conversation with newspaper publishers, so I am forced to read long lines
in a wide window or do a heck of a lot of horizontal scrolling.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I'm not just saying that I appreciate the style of the Gazette.
I'm also saying that I appreciate the fact that you spend time on the
content that might otherwise be wasted designing a complicated style (and
probably redesigning it every year when you got tired of it).
</p>


<h4>
3. The Linux Gazette is a serial publication.
</h4>

<p>
I know that early in every month I can go to linuxgazette.net and find new
content.  I also know that if I am busy and don't visit until late in the
month (as was the case this month), the new content will still be there
waiting for me -- I don't have to keep checking frequently to ensure that
I don't miss something.
</p>

<p>
Many web sites that host Linux information seem to be forever in a state
of flux.  Sometimes that is because they are for ever being redesigned
("what are we paying our web designer for if the web site never gets
redesigned?"), and sometimes it is in the nature of the the design to be
forever changing: new information replaces the old; old information
vanishes or goes into hiding.
</p>

<p>
With the Linux Gazette, I know that if I find a useful article today, it
will still be available tomorrow, next week, and next month.  Even next
year it will still be available in the archive.  And -- except on the rare
need to correct some gross error -- the article will not have changed from
the time I first read it.  I won't have the aggravation of trying to track
down something that no longer exists.  (Much as I like Wikipedia -- at
least for its links to _real_ sources -- its dynamic nature can leave one
wondering about one's rate of advancing senility when revisiting a page
read in the past.)  The Gazette has a solid feel to it -- not quite as
solid as a stack of paper magazines sitting on a shelf, but much better
than the vast majority of what is found on the Web these days.
</p>


<h4>
4.  The accuracy of information at the Linux Gazette is well above
average.
</h4>

<p>
People, organizations, and corporations can mix varying amounts of fiction
into the factual content of their web sites.  In many, perhaps most, cases
the authors do not even realize it is fiction.
</p>

<p>
While the Linux Gazette is certainly not totally immune to this, I believe
it has far less of a problem in this department than many other sources.
</p>

<p>
Firstly, as touched on in item 1, above, when people take pride in what
they write (which I believe is a main reason that LG authors write -- they
certainly aren't doing it for the money), they are more likely to spend
time getting their facts straight.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, LG articles are read by someone other than the author before
publication.  And while the editors may not yet have achieved infinite
knowledge, there is more of a chance of misinformation being caught at
this stage.
</p>

<p>
Thirdly, LG has an auto-immune system known as Talkback.  When mistakes
are made, there is a good chance that someone will spot it and point it
out, as readers are encouraged to do by the availability of the Talkback
link.  Sometimes, even when no mistake has been made, this encourages a
reader to clarify something, or add additional information that was not in
the original article.
</p>

<p>
(The advantages of multiple people reviewing the content, be it before or
after publication, extends to the area of LG beyond the articles, such as
The Answer Gang and Two-cent Tips.  Hearing multiple voices adds to the
confidence level the reader has in the information (except, of course, in
those rare times when nobody can agree on anything).)
</p>



<p>
Okay, so there is one man's view of some reasons why the Linux Gazette has
certainly not "outlived its usefulness to the community".
</p>

<p>
If the Gazette ceased to publish new issues, the archives could still
exist.  However it would be a shame to let the archives get moldy with no
fresh input.  In a short time they would be of more interest to historians
than people looking for current information.
</p>

<p>
I hope that many other readers will share their thoughts with you, and let
you know that the work that you and everyone who contributes to the
Gazette is certainly not for naught, and is well appreciated.
</p>

[ Norm, thank you for your detailed and thoughtful input! It's nice to know
that our various editorial choices are appreciated. That is indeed why we
have a serial presentation, and a relatively simple layout. I like your
description of Talkback as "an auto-immune system" - it's become one of my
favorite features. ]

<h3>
Write about it!
</h3>

<p>
Hallo,
     I've just finished reading your Back Page in the last issue of LG. 
It made me feel like I just _had to_ jump to Thunderbird and write you 
an e-mail!
</p>

<p>
Your article is really inspiring and makes one really want to think 
about one of the thousands ideas that come to mind during a week of work 
with Linux and write about it...
</p>

<p>
I have wanted to do it some times. I also know myself enough to be sure 
that when I'll calm down, a few minutes from now, I'm likely to forget 
about all this and never write anything.
</p>

<p>
BUT.
</p>

<p>
I'll bookmark this article and put it at the top in my list, so next 
time an idea comes to me I'll remember I'll _have_ to at least try and 
write about it. And send it to LG!
</p>

<p>
And by the way, I've been and LG reader for some months now and I've 
never said thank you for your work. I do it now.

<h3>
And who are our readers?
</h3>

<p>
I finally had time to catch up on LG and the Back Page #169 requested a
little feedback.
</p>

<p>
Consider this it.
</p>

<p>
Who am I (And where have I heard that before?)?   I'm a retired Industrial
Electronic Tech, one of those twigits with dirt under the fingernails.    We
were stuck with that M$ creature at work, but at home, I ran Linux.   I
currently have 5 boxes networked at the house and all but one are Linux -
PCLinuxOS 2009, to be exact.    The one Windows machine is my wife's HP
laptop (Vista) that is dedicated to her embroidery machine, which can dual
boot to SimplyMepis.
</p>

<p>
I've been distro hopping since the around 1995.   Geez, I was on the
Internet when it was all text and you had to go thru a bulletin board that
had Internet access.   Then you had to know a few Unix commands to find your
way to a server and log in.   Remember when the search engines were named,
'Gopher', 'Archie', 'Veronica' and the like?   My God!  I think I'm old...
I started with FreeBSD way back when, then Debian and the whole schemer.
My favorite was the Debian based Kanotix.   But when it went under the bus,
I didn't care for the replacements: Sidux and the re-dazzled Kanotix, which
seemed pretty much a step-child.
</p>

<p>
When I hit PCLos, I found what I was looking for.   A tool that just works,
like a good table saw or a solid lathe.   The reason the wife's laptop has
Mepis is it was the first distro that would configure that machine's
Broadcom 43xx wireless chip out of the box.
</p>

<p>
I'm also a Ham Radio operator - AI4KH - and refuse to use MS for anything
Ham related.   Although, DXLab's suite, is my favorite, I've given it up
rather than go thru the pain of opening and, especially, closing any MS
operating system.    I get by with the Linux apps for digital operation and
logging,
</p>

<p>
If I was a programmer like my daughter, I'd be helping with some of the
Linux apps.   Alas, I'm also a woodworker, shooter, and Scottish Country
Dancer besides being active in US Submarine Veterans (USSVI).  I retired
from the Navy in '74, so I'm not a kid anymore.
</p>

<p>
Yes, I do touch base with LG when I have a chance, just too see what's going
on.   There is just  sooo much stuff out there, it's nice to know I can
still count on LG for honesty.
</p>

<p>
I hope this wasn't too long-winded for you.   I tend to run on at the
keyboard.
</p>

<p>
Thanks,<br>

Ben is the Editor-in-Chief for Linux Gazette and a member of The Answer Gang.
</p>

<p>
<em>
Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became interested in electricity
at the tender age of six, promptly demonstrated it by sticking a fork into
a socket and starting a fire, and has been falling down technological
mineshafts ever since. He has been working with computers since the Elder
Days, when they had to be built by soldering parts onto printed circuit
boards and programs had to fit into 4k of memory (the recurring nightmares
have almost faded, actually.)
</p>

<p>
His subsequent experiences include creating software in more than two dozen
languages, network and database maintenance during the approach of a
hurricane, writing articles for publications ranging from sailing magazines
to technological journals, and teaching on a variety of topics ranging from
Soviet weaponry and IBM hardware repair to Solaris and Linux
administration, engineering, and programming. He also has the distinction
of setting up the first Linux-based public access network in St. Georges,
Bermuda as well as one of the first large-scale Linux-based mail servers in
St. Thomas, USVI.
</p>

<p>
After a seven-year Atlantic/Caribbean cruise under sail and passages up and
down the East coast of the US, he is currently anchored in northern
Florida. His consulting business presents him with a variety of challenges
such as teaching professional advancement courses for Sun Microsystems and
providing Open Source solutions for local companies.
</p>

<p>
His current set of hobbies includes flying, yoga, martial arts,
motorcycles, writing, Roman history, and <strike>mangling</strike> playing
with his Ubuntu-based home network, in which he is ably assisted by his <a
href="../authors/tanaka-okopnik.html">wife</a>, <a
href="../authors/okopnik1.html">son</a> and daughter; his Palm Pilot is
crammed full of alarms, many of which contain exclamation points.
</p>

<p>
He has been working with Linux since 1997, and credits it with his complete
loss of interest in waging nuclear warfare on parts of the Pacific Northwest.
