<P>
hi,
</P>
<P>
in issue 74 there's a question from Faber Fedor asking about how to
setup an environment so that a user can't wander from their home
directory.
</P>
<P>
i believe the person asking the question was looking for something
along the lines of a restricted shell. tell the person asking the
question to look at the "-r" option to bash, smrsh, and/or do a google
search for "restricted shell".
</P>
<P>
best regards,
<br>trevor

<P>
Hello gazette,
</P>
<P>
Being a new Linux administrator, I had "hardened" down my install by implementing
a "protected" and "password=&lt;pass&gt; entry in my <TT>/etc/lilo.conf</TT> file to keep people
just as dangerous as myself out of single mode.
</P>
<P>
I also rem'd out the timeout= value so my install would always boot straight into
Linux.
</P>
<P>
My question for the day was "how could I boot Linux Single if I had to?
a Boot and Root set would work, but I discovered this...
</P>
<P>
After the BIOS Mem check, hold down either control key and the LILO boot "screen" is
displayed! And of course, you'd need the password=&lt;value&gt; to use it...
</P>
<P>
Wow, Now I am scary on 2 platforms.

<P>
Ok,
</P>
<P>
If the feature is unique to CSS2 then
you won't replicate it with CSS1 and cross-platform
browser support for either is restrictive ...
</P>
<P>
so .... I would suggest using Xml, xsl, xslt
and either DTD or xsd schema formats ...
</P>
<P>
this is more completely supported ... just a
little (mabye a lot) more work ... Check out
the books by Benoit Marchal ...

Anybody please tell me about installation of linux with win2000.
I already installed linux 7 on my pc.
now i want that without format my system i install win2000 on my pc.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
any body pls give me any utility. don't tell me FAQ.
this is boring for me. if anybody wants help me out than pls provide me
utility.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
If you find reading FAQ's boring, I don't think you're going to like Linux
too much.
</P>
<P>
Three recommendations:
</P>
<P>
For disk partition manipulation:
<ol>
<li> fips or
<li> Partition Magic (there are others, but these are two I've used)
</ol></P>
<P>
For installing and running Windows (MSW) with Linux.
<br>3) VMWare
</P>
<P>
It would be nice to be able to avoid MSW entirely, but since my work
demands it, using VMWare allows me to run it without having to reboot and
leave the Linux environment.

<br>answered by Yann Vernier and Mike Orr (The Answer Gang)

<P><STRONG>
On January 3, 2002 I'm having a external cable modem installed. I've
been looking around for some simple suggestions on what needs to be
done, confuguration wise, to my Linux machine. Can you help? Naturally,
the normal statement has been made - "We don't support Linux". The Linux
machine that it's being connected to has a second NIC installed and I've
accessed the machine via the second NIC to that's all set up. Where do I
go from there?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
We can't know the next step until you have the instructions for how to
connect using the cable modem. If you are using <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> GNU/Linux, a
simple way to prepare for running a masquerading gateway is to install
the ipmasq package, but we don't know if you need PPPOE, DHCP, or some
special login methods. A useful resource may be

<P>
Good luck! -- Yann
</P>

<em>
<P>
The extra Ethernet card should be all you need.  Beyond that, just follow
the Windows dialogs in the manual and see whether it's dhcp or a static IP,
which nameservers to put in <TT>/etc/resolv.conf</TT>, etc.
</P>
<P>
Yann is right about setting up masquerading if you have a local
network.  I don't think of that as "setting up a cable modem" though.
That's another step, connecting a local network to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Be glad you have an external modem.  It would be much harder to set up
if it were internal, because it would probably require some
proprietary DLL that isn't available for Linux.  -- Mike

I manually backup my linux server every day for that i need to put a label
on my tape according to the date, I backup my server. Does anyone know how
to manually label a tape in linux is there any command for doing that.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Please help
<br>Thanks in Advance
<br>Franco.F
</STRONG></P>

<P>
Well, <EM>my</EM> approach to this is to create a directory called
<TT>/tmp/TIMESTAMP</TT>, and, just before you make a backup, clear out all the
files, then use
</P>
<P><CODE>
touch /tmp/TIMESTAMP/`date +%Y%m%d-%a%H%M%S`
</CODE></P>
<P>
This wlil give you a label for the backup which you can read without
having to actually load any data.
</P>
<P>

I feel I must recommend O'Reilly's "Anatomy of a Linux System" poster.
It is a large, colourful poster giving a rough overview of how things
fit together and recommending (O'Reilly, of course) books.
</P>
<P>
Their address is <A HREF="http://www.ora.com"
	>http://www.ora.com</A> but I didn't find the poster in
their product list; it is probably promotional material which you'll
have to ask them for. -- Yann

I saw some sort of a thing like that for Linux.  Is it 3 or 4 feet
in diameter and it shows the ring structure of the operating system?
You know..., the kernel in the middle, with the applications at the
outer ring?  If that's the thing, it's kinda cool.  I think that I
am gonna get one of those. -- Chris G.
</P>

<P><em>
Hmmm.  The one I saw was just of the Linux kernel sources.
Core memory management and scheduler in the center and VFS
and core networking support forming a second tier, with
filesystems and specific device drivers on the periphery.
That one was a sort of a fractal star or "peacock." -- JimD
</em></P>

<P>
I'll have to look at the chart when I go back to work next week.  There's a
book entitled "The Design of the Unix Operating System" by Maurice Bach.
The poster that I saw, for Linux, looks like the structure on the cover of
that book.
