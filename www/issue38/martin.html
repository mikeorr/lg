<P>
This Document is covered by the GPL and can be used in anyway seen fit from 
the license.
<P>
This document is not intended to replace the ppp-howto it is intended to be 
a primer as howto setup PAP for calling an ISP that refuses tech support 
to a Linux user.
<P>
 PAP=Password Authentication Protocol.
<P>
  If your not sure if your ISP uses pap just bring minicom up and 
atdt&lt;isp-number&gt; and wait for the modem to connect.
<P>
If you get login: or some variant of that your isp is not using pap and this 
paper is not for you.
<P>
 If you get a line or two of trash like:
<PRE> 
{}{}{}{}{}}}}{{}{}}}{}{}{}{}[][][][][ 
 </PRE> 
 You know it's looking for PAP or mschap.
<P>
  I won't deal with MSChap since I don't have access to an ISP that uses 
it and I wouldn't want to knowing the reliability of NT.
 Now assuming your dealing with chap we need to figure out what version
of pppd your using. Type /usr/sbin/pppd --version and you will get the 
version number, I'll cover versions 2.2.0-f and 2.3.5 in this doc as 
thats what I'm familiar with.
  
<H3>pppd 2.2.0 version.</H3> 
<P>
This section I will cover the setup and impletation of pap with older 
distributions like RH 4.2 and Slackware 3.6 use this older version of the
pppd daemon.
<P>
 I prefer pico for the new users as editors of choice for console. If you don't
have it look into getting the latest Pine release it's part of it.
<P>
  You have to edit your ppp-on script if you have one if not I'll include 
one here. You need to look into /usr/doc/pppd*/scripts for the ppp scripts, 
at least thats where the defaults reside with RedHat.
<P>
Here's what my ppp-on looks like:<BR> 
<P>
  This is setup for your modem being on com2 in dos or /dev/ttyS1 in Linux.
You need to use ttySxx since the /dev/cua1 is now a defunct format with the 
2.2.x kernels. If you plan to upgrade to kernel 2.2.x you need upgrade your 
pppd to at least pppd-2.3.x to keep ppp working.
<PRE> 
#!/bin/sh
TELEPHONE=&lt;your-isp-phonenumber&gt;

LOCAL_IP=0.0.0.0        # Local IP address if known. Dynamic = 0.0.0.0
REMOTE_IP=0.0.0.0       # Remote IP address if desired. Normally 0.0.0.0
NETMASK=255.255.255.0   # The proper netmask if needed

export TELEPHONE   

DIALER_SCRIPT=/etc/ppp/ppp-on-dialer

exec  /usr/sbin/pppd debug lock modem crtscts /dev/ttyS1 115200 \
        asyncmap 20A0000 escape FF kdebug 0 $LOCAL_IP:$REMOTE_IP \
        noipdefault netmask $NETMASK defaultroute connect $DIALER_SCRIPT \
        +ua /etc/ppp/pap-secret
</PRE> 
Thats what your ppp-on file will need to make pap work. 
As you can see your login name and password are no longer included in this 
file so that closes a security risk there. 
<P>
   Anyplace you see &lt;name&gt; always omit the &lt; &gt; and just use the 
information needed.
<P>
 Next you need to edit /etc/ppp/ppp-on-dialer to disable the looking for a 
login and password lines.
<P>
Example:
<PRE> 
#!/bin/sh
#
# This is part 2 of the ppp-on script. It will perform the connection
# protocol for the desired connection.
#
# This is the ppp-on-dialer for PAP with pppd-2.2.0
exec /usr/sbin/chat -v                                  \
        TIMEOUT         3                               \
        ABORT           '\nBUSY\r'                      \
        ABORT           '\nNO ANSWER\r'                 \
        ABORT           '\nRINGING\r\n\r\nRINGING\r'    \
        ''              \rAT                            \
        'OK-+++\c-OK'   ATH0                            \
        TIMEOUT         30                              \
        OK              ATDT$TELEPHONE                  \
        CONNECT         ''                              \

</PRE> 
 Now we'll cover the password file setup and format. 
This next part is easy all you need is a file named pap-secret
with the login name and password on separate lines.
<P>
i.e., pap-secret with pppd-2.2.0
<PRE>
greg
stinky1
</PRE>
 After you make this file if it's not there. As root type 
 <PRE> 
 chmod -r pap-secret
</PRE>
  Please don't forget the /etc/resolv.conf file for your DNS numbers.
<P>
  I know I said this wasn't goin to be a ppp-howto but I'll include 
 /etc/resolv.conf just to save headaches and email as to why it don't it work.
<PRE> 
domain &lt;your.isp.com&gt;
search &lt;your.isp.com&gt;
nameserver xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
nameserver xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
</PRE> 
Your /etc/resolv.conf should look something like this with the proper 
information edited.
<P>
Put the ppp-on in /usr/sbin/ and put ppp-on-dialer in /etc/ppp with pap-secret
as root
<PRE> 
cp ppp-on /usr/sbin/
cp ppp-on-dialer /etc/ppp
cp pap-secret /etc/ppp
</PRE> 
Now all you should have to do is type ppp-on and you should get connected 
to the net with Linux. Enjoy.
<P>
<H3>pppd-2.3.5</H3> 
<P>
  Seting up PAP with pppd-2.3.5 is as easy as pppd-2.2.0 just the syntax 
has changed in the ppp-on script.
 Please refer to the ppp-on-dialerand the resolv.conf in the above for it
 so I don't have to repeat myself here.
<P>
Heres an example ppp-on script.
<PRE> 
#!/bin/sh

TELEPHONE=&lt;you-isp-phone-number&gt;

LOCAL_IP=0.0.0.0        # Local IP address if known. Dynamic = 0.0.0.0
REMOTE_IP=0.0.0.0       # Remote IP address if desired. Normally 0.0.0.0
NETMASK=255.255.255.0   # The proper netmask if needed

export TELEPHONE

DIALER_SCRIPT=/etc/ppp/ppp-on-dialer

exec  /usr/sbin/pppd debug lock modem crtscts /dev/cua1 115200 \
        asyncmap 20A0000 escape FF kdebug 0 name catfish $LOCAL_IP:$REMOTE_IP \
        noipdefault netmask $NETMASK defaultroute connect $DIALER_SCRIPT \
 </PRE>        
 Thats about all there is to it for ppp-on with pppd-2.3.5 and PAP.
<P>
Now for the /etc/pap-secret file the syntax here has changed from the 
earlier pppd-2.2.0 also.
<P>
 All you need here now is a single line with your login name the interface 
and your password. 
<P>
 So your pap-scret file would look like so.
<P>
I.E. pap-secret
<PRE> 
&lt;loginname&gt; ppp0 &lt;password&gt;
</PRE> 
Well thats all there is to it for the PAP howto, pretty basic stuff when 
theres documents for it. 
<P>
  Enjoy and happy surfing.
