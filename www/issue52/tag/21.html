<p><strong>From Berkeley F Bernard  on Wed, 29 Mar 2000  
</strong></p>
<!-- ::
Permission Denied on -display
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:: -->
<P><STRONG>
I can rsh to various hosts and run text screens but I cannot seem to get
the <TT>-Display</TT> to work.  It always comes back permission denied.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have tried various <tt>hosts.allow</tt>, <tt>.rhost</tt> and <tt>inetd.conf</tt> setting to no avail.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Is there a proper setup for these files?  Is there a debug setting that
will tell me why permission denied is being return?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks

Short answer: USE ssh!  (More on that later).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
My '<tt>rsh</tt>' command doesn't have a "<TT>-Display</TT>" (nor a <TT>-D</TT> nor a
<TT>-display</TT>, etc).  However, I'm going to go out on a limb here and
guess that you are running a local X server, and that you are
trying to get your '<tt>rsh</tt>' command to launch a remote X client.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The reason that the graphics program that you run on your Linux or
other UNIX system is called an "X Server" or a "display server" is
because the X Windowing System is actually a communications
protocol.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the field of computing servers share resources among clients.
A file server allows a set of clients to share files and and the
storege/disk space that they occupy.  A print server allows a set
of clients to share a printer -- it spools and schedules their
print jobs, possibly dispatching them to multiple printers, and
handing various matters of form (requiring an operator to mount of
the proper forms, or running tray changers, collators, etc).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
An X display server allows a set of clients to share a display.
It lets programs take over a portion of your screen (they get one
or more into, into which they can draw whatever they like).  The X
server also dispatches input to these clients, feeding them
keyboard and mouse events.   That is the basic programming model
for X, the client/server windowing system.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
One consequence of this is that the clients don't have to be on
the same system as the server.  It is sufficient that they have a
means of communication.  The most common form of communication
among X servers and their remote clients is TCP over port 6000,
6001, etc.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Naturally it is necessary for the X server to impose some form of
authentication and authorization on its clients.  It just wouldn't
be very handy if any user on any system on the Internet could just
start popping windows up on your display, and it would be darn
right ugly if they could start "invisible" applications that
requested notification of all keyboard, mouse, and other events
occuring through your server.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, your X server defaults to only honoring requests from your
local processes.  You can over-ride this policy, and extend
those services to other accounts on other systems using any
of three common mechanisms.  I'll describe two of them for your
edification, then I'll forward you another bit of mail (an answer
to another Answer Guy question) that will hopefully convince you
to just use '<tt>ssh</tt>'
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The first and worst means to loosen control over your X server
is to use the '<tt>xhost</tt>' command.  If you simply issue the command:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote><code>
xhost +
</code></BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... from an xterm within your X session you will have opened your
X server to the whole world.  DON'T DO THIS!  If you issue a
(slightly) more conservative command like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote><code>
xhost +foo.bar.not
</code></BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... you'll be allowing <EM>any user</EM> on <tt>foo.bar.not</tt> to access your X
server.   This is "slightly" better.  Unfortunately you'll also be
allowing any user on any system that can "spoof" packets so the
look like the "might have come from" <tt>foo.bar.not</tt> to access your X
server.   I think this is a bad idea, though I'll admit that I've
done it around the house, before I had a DSL line.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Did I say "loosen control" to your X server?  Maybe that should
just read "lose control."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There's a technique you can use to control access to your X
server.  On any reasonably modern and well packaged Linux
distribution you should find that your X server is actually
started with a <TT>-auth</TT> command line option.  This points the server
at an "X authority file"  (Usually that contains an "MIT Magic
Cookie").
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A what?!?  A Magic cookie.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Here's how this works.  When any X client program tries to perform
any X functions (using the X protocol) it searches its environment
for a <tt>DISPLAY</tt> value.  (It might also look on its command line, or
in it's own *rc files, or whatever).  Finding that it tries to
connect to the server.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When it connects the X server might request a "cookie."  (Sort of
a "password of the day").  The X client will then search for an
<tt>XAUTHORITY</tt> environment variable.  If one exists, its value is
presumed to be a file name; if not, the UNIX or Linux client will
probably look for a file named <tt>.Xauthority</tt>, in your home
directory. Thus the X client will open that file, search for the
matching cooking (one X authority file might have several cookies
in it), extract that and feed it to the X server that made the
request.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Notice that all of this is done transparently by the libraries.
You, as a user needn't be away of that process, so long as your
<tt>XAUTHORITY</tt> variable is set, and your <tt>~/.Xauthority</tt> file has the
valid cookie, then you don't need to fuss with anything.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you have an account in a NIS or HESIOD system, and your home
directory is on a network fileserver, then it's possible that
you'd never have to worry about these <tt>.Xauthority</tt> files.  As you
start X servers the appropriate cookies would be added to your
<tt>.Xauthority</tt> file.  As you rsh or telnet to remote systems your
home directory is mounted (and the <tt>.Xauthority</tt> file is thus
accessible to those client processes).  The file permissions can
be used to prevent other users from reading your <tt>.Xauthority</tt> file,
and thus they cannot extract the cookie and feed it to your X
server.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When you don't have your home directory on a shared filesystem,
it's still possible to use these magic cookies.  You just have to
extract the appropriate cookie from your local server, pass it to
the remote system (possibly through an rsh pipe), and merge it
into the <tt>.Xauthority</tt> file there.  The command that does all this
extracting, adding, merging and listing is called '<tt>xauth</tt>'.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You can think of the <tt>.Xauthority</tt> file as a sort of "archive of
passwords" and the '<tt>xauth</tt>' as analogous to '<tt>tar</tt>' for them.  
Well, sort of.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Anyway.  That's basically how the 'xauth' system works.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's about as secure as telnet.  It does essentially require a
password for access to the X server, without bothering the user to
keeping typing it for every program they launch.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is one tiny problem.  The X protocol doesn't use any
encryption.  Therefore, unless you were using something like
IPSec, these exchanges between remote clients and servers could be
sniffed (deliberately overheard) by anyone on your LAN.  (I won't
bother covering the affect of etherswitches on this scenario ---
other than to say that it doesn't buy as much as their purveyors
would suggest).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The X authority model, with its magic cookies is workable.  If you
search through the "Remote X Apps mini-HOWTO"
(<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/Remote-X-Apps.html"
	>http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/Remote-X-Apps.html</A>) you can
find out more info.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, this is all unnecessary if you use ssh.  I've just
answered a rather similar question earlier tonight; so I'll just
forward you a copy of the salient portions from my reply.
The mini-HOWTO that I've referenced above also covers this
(somewhat more briefly).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Hope that helps.
