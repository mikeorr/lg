<h1>RSA 2005 Conference and Expo, San Francisco - Special Report</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</A></b></p>

<p>
<p> More than crypto systems and algorithms, the RSA conference and expo
has become a premier showcase of the full spectrum of security products and
concerns in this era of every more insecure computing.

<p> This reflects growing in interest for security products at government
and businesses everywhere.   More attendees [about 13000] and more
exhibitors were on-hand than ever before [over 275 companies and
organizations before the conference started] for this 14<sup>th</sup>
annual RSA conference.


<p> And one trend more than any other may offer some respite from the
growing tsunami of malware and identity theft: Trusted Computing.


<p> The specifications developed over the last few years by the Trusted
Computing Group [TCG] are now starting to implemented by major PC and
software firms, most significantly motherboard crypto for PCs and notebooks
from HP and IBM that identify users prior to bootup. Follow this link for
the TGC presentations at RSA2005 [first 3 items]:

<p> <a href="https://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/downloads/tcg_presentations/" target="_blank">https://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/downloads/tcg_presentations/</a>

<p> An emerging standard for Trusted Computing is a 'Trusted Platform',
which will relay on a cryptographically secured module to hold identity
information, certificates and secret keys that can be verified and
exchanged in a trusted computing environment.  These modules, or TPMs, are
now available as is new software for identity management and attesting to
the integrity of the underlying computing platform.  There are also
software versions of TPMs, some open source, that are able to play in a
trusted environment, although they are   less secure than hardware TP
modules.   See <a
href="http://www.infsec.ethz.ch/people/psevinc/">http://www.infsec.ethz.ch/people/psevinc/</a>.

<p> Here is a trusted computing network verification diagram:

align='left' border=1 vspace=20><br clear='left'>

<p> Anti-spyware products are becoming almost as ubiquitous as anti-virus
software. Almost all anti-virus, anti-worm vendors were adding or
incorporating anti-spyware modules in their product lines.  Symantec will
be adding this as a feature to existing products while McAfee will be
offering an anti-spyware additional module to its enterprise offerings.

<p> Phishing was also a topic at many vendor presentations, even though
this was largely referred as a social engineering attack.   The Identity
Management companies tried to link phishing with ID mgt, but generally
required end-to-end use of their products. That long view of security gives
birth to another TLA -  UTM or "unified threat management" as Symantec CEO
John Thomson called in his keynote.

<p> Also there were renewed efforts to work together on an industry level.

<p> A rare partnership between government and industry resulted in the
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS),  unveiled at the RSA Conference
by the <strong>National Infrastructure Advisory Council</strong>
[<strong>NIAC</strong>, a  part of the U.S.  Department of Homeland
Security] and leading vendors like Cisco, Ebay, Microsoft, and Symantec.
This  new and ambitious system aims to provide a common descriptive
language and standardized formula for reporting and assessing computer
security vulnerabilities and issues, instead of varying and confusing
vendor-specific ratings.

<p> CVSS, which is partly related to Mitre Corp.'s CVE rating system, helps
prioritize software vulnerabilities both for ISVs and for enterprise users,
calculating the risk by considering  the number of systems involved, the
type of exploit required, and if a software patch is available.

<p> Three major security and auditing groups announced the formation of a
cooperative alliance to create better security policies and legislation and
to better work with security professionals throughout the industry.   These
were the ASIS International, the ISACA (Information Systems Audit and
Control Association) and ISSA (Information Systems Security Association).
The groups will also work together to define certification and training
requirements for the Chief Security Officer (CSO) role and other
security-related positions in industry.


<p> And Microsoft introduced its Microsoft Security Resource Center team at
its booth where security issues could be addressed.  This was mostly a
customer feedback exercise and an attempt to raise the profile of the MSRC,
which also ran a blog for the length of the conference.  It  ties into the
TechNet security pages, [Finally, links for tools and patches.]

<p> Underscoring the new Microsoft security initiatives, Bill Gates
delivered the show's opening keynote address on Monday.  It highlighted new
Microsoft security products, including their enhanced 'Internet security
and acceleration' [ISA] server and future identity management products, and
touted a new version of Internet Explorer by this summer - but only
for Win XP users.

<p> Microsoft was a platinum sponsor and had about 100 employees at the
show. Besides a large booth with a presentation area, there was a separate
expo area where attendees could get 'hands-on' test experience with
Microsoft security products and tools.

<p> [After the RSA Conference, Gartner Corp analyst Neil MacDonald posted
a critique of the latest MS security offerings, rejecting the incremental
approach they are taking rather than a fundamental architectural change,
particularly with its IE web browser. See:

<p> <a href="http://www3.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?doc_cd=126360">http://www3.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?doc_cd=126360</a>

<p> Also in the critique: "The decision to restrict IE 7.0 to the XP
platform also suggests that Microsoft wants to force users of older
platforms to upgrade if they want improved security." ]

<h3>Conference Tracks and Technical Sessions</h3>

<p> Conference sessions were held in the afternoons in 16 simultaneous
tracks, including two separate Hackers &amp; Threats tracks, tracks for
developers and cryptographers, business tracks, and  tracks for privacy,
web security, wireless and Identity &amp; Access Management.

<p> The Hacker Tracks definitely covered a lot of important ground and gave
pause to developers and security officers alike. One paper focused on that
old nemesis, SQL Injection, showing that it was still a major concern since
the old standard approach of hiding error messages or using generic problem
messages does not actually stop the hack.

<p> The presentation, by Imperva's <strong>Ofer Maor</strong>, shows the
result of security testing on MySQL and all leading DBs using indirect
query tests to discover the number and type of data fields available to an
SQL injection attack.  These so-called 'blind' injection techniques only
take a little more effort but still yield confidential data.

<p> For instance, even with hidden or generic error messages an attacker
could request additional fields above and below the actual number  until
the correct number was determined and also check the data type one field at
a time until there was no error message or the target data emerged:

<p> inject :  <code>ORDER BY 1 --</code>
[and other numbers to get the right number of columns]

<p> Assuming we get the number of columns, '4' here, and that we know a
valid acctnum, (<em>AccNum=11223344</em>), we can use the following
sequence with the the UNION SELECT clause to get the data types for the
columns:

<ul type='none'>
<li><code>11223344) UNION SELECT
NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL WHERE 1=2 --</code> No Error - Syntax is
right. MS SQL Server Used. Proceeding.

<li><code>11223344) UNION SELECT
1,NULL,NULL,NULL WHERE 1=2 --</code> No Error - First column is
an integer.

<li><code>11223344) UNION SELECT
1,2,NULL,NULL WHERE 1=2 --</code> Error! - Second column is not
an integer.

<li><code>11223344) UNION SELECT
1,'2',NULL,NULL WHERE 1=2 --</code> No Error - Second column is a
string.

<li><code>11223344) UNION SELECT
1,'2',3,NULL WHERE 1=2 --</code> Error! - Third column is not an
integer.

<li><code>11223344) UNION SELECT
1,'2','3',NULL WHERE 1=2 --</code> No Error - Third column is a
string.

<li><code>11223344) UNION SELECT
1,'2','3',4 WHERE 1=2 --</code> Error! - Fourth column is not an
integer.

<li><code>11223344) UNION SELECT 1,'2','3','4' WHERE 1=2 --</code> No
Error - Fourth column is a string.
</ul>

<p><code> From this point an attacker can craft more specific queries to
get system tables and eventually get, for example, CCnum, SSnum and other
sensitive variables.</code>

<p> This and other presentations are available only to full conference
attendees but Imperva has several white papers on their website which were
the basis for RSA presentation:

<p> <a href="http://www.imperva.com/application_defense_center/glossary/sql_injection.html">http://www.imperva.com/application_defense_center/glossary/sql_injection.html</a>
<br> 
<a href="http://www.imperva.com/application_defense_center/white_papers/blind_sql_server_injection.html">http://www.imperva.com/application_defense_center/white_papers/blind_sql_server_injection.html</a>

<p><strong>Maor</strong> also discussed how signature-based security tools
could be thwarted by using other SQL tricks - concatenation, buried
comments and use of character values for instance - to camouflage the
injected SQL.  Real security must be implemented at the application level
and web masters and developers must be careful in their designs and coding
and also very comprehensive in testing.

<p> At the conclusion of the session, Maor suggested using different admin
accounts and passwords for different tables and application functions as a
deterrent.  Also, while the occurrence of a certain SQL signature in a
parameter value might not be enough to alert for SQL injection attack, the
same signature in correlation with error responses or abnormal parameter
size of  other signatures may indicate an SQL injection attack.

<p> Microsoft researchers Kurt Dillard and Mike Danseglio gave a Hacker
track technical presentation on a new generation of stealthy rootkits for
Windows kernels. These smarter root kits intercept system calls and
actively filter out signs of their presence to avoid detection by software
and security staff.  Microsoft has posted a short white paper on file
hiding and a 'cross-view diff' tool they are developing to detect this
behavior:

<p> <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/rootkit">http://research.microsoft.com/rootkit</a>

<p> Another presentation by Dan Houser on stopping script kiddies and
automated attacks [for a mere $30K effort] suggested hiding critical
servers in the open by using available IP addresses for virtual servers on
an Internet-wide honey-pot. From the slides:

<p>
<ul type='square'>
<li> Convert unused Class B and C IP address space into decoy tripwire nets
<li> example: 16,320,000 decoys, 200 "real" servers
<li> Stop swallowing packets: route unreachable hosts to the virtual honeynet
<li> 190,000 decoys per "real" server = 99.9995% detection
<li> Any hits are malicious - route to IDS / IPS
</ul>

<p> The result is that port scans would take weeks and even years to
complete while source addresses for the attackers can be identified and
blocked before real systems are compromised. This is approach also known as
the Big Freakin' Haystack Initiative; see more at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bfhi">http://sourceforge.net/projects/bfhi</a>.


<h3>Vendor News</h3>

<p> Sun announced security enhancements to be added to its new Solaris10
OS, including an integrity checking process that provides assurance against
accidental or malicious tampering. A future update to Solaris 10 will
feature automatic run-time verification. This feature is designed to check
the system's code at the exact moment of execution, protecting against the
possibility of unauthorized modification between periodic auditing checks
and actual use. Administrators will be able to customize which signatures
will be checked, and use provided tools to digitally-sign code from other
sources.

<p>After 15 months of certification testing by an independent organization,
Sun announced that its Solaris 9 Operating System has received 'Common
Criteria Certification'. Common Criteria is a  critical requirement to many
governments, military and financial institutions. [Except for Sun's
military-grade Trusted Solaris operating system, Solaris becomes the only
general purpose operating system with protection profiles of both
Controlled Access Protection Profile and Role Based Access Control at
Evaluation Assurance Level 4+ (EAL4+). ]

<p> Also, among Sun speakers at RSA conference this week was their Chief
Security Officer, Whitfield Diffie, who headlined a cryptographers panel.
Diffie is co-author of the <em>Diffie-Hellman</em> standard for Public Key
exchange [PKI].

<p> Hewlett-Packard's booth demonstrated an HP technology to limit the
spread of viruses and worms throughout an enterprise by isolating problem
PCs and workstations and limiting outbound bandwidth. Its new
virus-throttling software will be available for ProLiant Servers and
ProCurve Networking by HP 5300 series switches.

<p> HP also announced its Security Containment suite for its HP-UX 11iv2
OS. This virtualizes application into domains and limits memory and file
access by domains.  

<p> Other new products at RSA2005 used Linux, but it was often implicit
rather than obvious: 

<p> Linux was 'inside' for many security appliances: many security
appliances for email, VPNs, firewalls, etc., use embedded Linux at least as
a guest OS for serial port terminal sessions. Some run their IDS on Linux.
Some of the longer term appliance vendors use hardened freeBSD [Borderware,
for example]. Sun uses ENEA's OSE [not Linux or secure Solaris],  and a
few use WindRiver's realtime OS, Vx Works. A few embedded Linux examples,
most using a 2.6 kernel:

<ul type='square'>
<li> Symantec appliances for firewalls, email, and network intrusion
<li> Foundry's web acceleration appliance
<li> ServGates EdgeForce line of all-in-one security appliances
<li> TippingPoint's UnityOne IPS and integrated security appliance,
winner of SC Magazine's 2005 award for 'best security solution' and
a true 1 Gps device, uses WindRiver Vx, but the companion SMS
manager device uses Linux.
</ul>

<p> Novell introduced its Security Manager product, which is based on its
SuSE Linux and runs on any standard PC server. The product includes
firewall and VPN gateway, intrusion protection, virus protection, spam
blocks and configurable content filtering. In this case, the underlying
software comes from Astaro Networks which also sells it directly [about
$300 for a server and a 10 device monitoring license].


<h3>Separation Anxiety</h3>

<p> Conference security separated the different classes of attendees so
successfully that it may become model of what other conferences will do.
Not only were the badges and holders different for full-conference
attendees, exhibitors, and expo attendees, the full-conference attendees
had their photos on the badges.

<p> Professional security company personnel were used instead of convention
center part timers, so expo attendees were cleared out of the exhibition
hall at certain times and  only full conference attendees got to see Bill
Gates keynote. Some vendors also provided expo perks to those with
full-conference badges.

<p> A theatrical presentation preceding the show's opening highlighted the
prohibition and codebreaker theme. It told the story of honored
codebreakers and security pioneers Elizabeth and William Friedman and how
they helped start US government codebreaking hegemony in World War I and
into the 1920s and 30s.

<p> Opening ceremony awards were aimed at recognizing ongoing contributions
to the advancement of information security. RSA 2005 recipients honored for
these annual awards include: for public policy, Orson Swindle, Federal
Trade Commission; for mathematics, Dan Boneh, associate professor, Stanford
University; and for best security practices, Michael Assante, CIO at
American Electric Power.  


<h3>Collateral and Contests</h3>

<p> There were more t-shirts, pens and other collateral offerings,
indicating a healthier industry. Borderware, a provider of anti-spam and
anti-virus software, offered a daily drawing for a 50-inch TV. There were
also uncountable drawings for iPods and X-Boxes.  Some vendors offered
wheel-spins for PC and X-Box games [and mousepads for the not-so-lucky].

<p> Three of the more useful collaterals were the CISSP [computer security
professional certification] assessment CD from CA, the box set of Solaris10
DVDs from Sun [saves a really, really long series of downloads and at least
4 CD-Rs], and the numerous retractable Ethernet cables [like the older
phone port connectors, only more useful.]

<p> Special commendation in this department goes to McAfee who offered the
current edition of "Hacking Exposed" - 737 pages - for only sitting through
a short presentation and a short demo. Although they did finally run out of
books, this was a great service toward promoting secure computing
everywhere. I was very happy to get an updated copy!

<p> And I was very happy to attend the 2005 RSA Conference and Expo.

<p> If you are are interested and live nearby, RSA Conference will also be
holding one-day regional events throughout the year including: September
13, 2005 in Chicago and September 15, 2005 in New York. For more
