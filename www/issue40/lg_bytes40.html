Debian Touts Integrated SGML Environment
</font>
</H3> 
<P> 
Date: Tue, 30 Mar 1999 10:41:44 -0500
Debian's 2.1 distribution, now in release, features integrated SGML,
XML, and DSSSL infrastructure and packages.  Debian's innovative SGML
subsystem positions Debian as a premier platform for SGML and XML
developers, offering a complete working toolset for documenters and
markup programmers with no manual setup required.
<P> 
Features:
<ul>
<li>James Clark's jade 1.2.1 and SP suite version 1.3.3,
   enabling validation and formatting of SGML or XML
   http://www.jclark.com/jade/.
<li>SGMLOpen shared system catalog integration (no need to manually 
   register SGML Public Identifiers or set with environment
   variables).
<li>docbook (v3.0) and docbook-stylesheets (v1.13) available, providing
   an industry-standard markup convention
   http://www.ora.com/davenport/
<li>psgml, which in conjunction with Emacs19, Emacs20, XEmacs19, or
   XEmacs20, provides a profession SGML editing environment.
   http://www.lysator.liu.se/projects/about_psgml.html
<li>jadetex, combined with jade, facilitates the conversion of SGML to
   PostScript or PDF, for high quality printed output.
<li>a host of other SGML, XML, and DSSSL software packages are
   available, including but not limited to sgml-tools, expat,
   sdc, perlsgml, sgmlspm, and dsc.
</ul>
We believe that Debian's open model of participation and committment
to system quality (as reflected in the Debian Policy
http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/) puts Debian
head-and-shoulders above other commercial or free systems.  SGML
integration efforts continue apace in the unstable distribution,
including DocBook 3.1, DocBk XML, TEI, and more DTDs.

PKZIP LINUX:  A Step Ahead
<P>
Miamisburg, OHIO -- (March 30, 1999)<BR> 
With a 32-bit algorithm, PKZIP UNIX zips LINUX files up to 2GB of
uncompressed data and creates a single, compressed archive resulting in
an
average savings in disk storage space of 50-70%, with some database and
spreadsheet compressing to 1/10th the original size.
<P>
PKZIP UNIX is cross-platform compatible with the entire line of PKZIP
products including the AS/400, DOS, Macintosh, MVS, OS/2, VM, VMS, VSE
environments, MultiZip for NetWare and Nico Mak Computing's WinZip. A
self-extractor program is included so that zipped files can be utilized
other LINUX users. With a self-extractor attachment (SFX), PKZIP is
launched
when the zipped file is opened.
<P>

HP OpenMail/VirtualVault news
</font>
</H3> 
<P>
PALO ALTO, Calif., March 30, 1999 -- Hewlett-Packard Company today
announced a new program that combines HP OpenMail with the HP
VirtualVault trusted Web platform, enabling organizations to reduce the
costs of supporting remote e-mail users dramatically while greatly
simplifying access.
<P>
The integration of OpenMail and VirtualVault eliminates the need for
remote users to rely on dial-up networking or carry a laptop to access
e-mail from remote locations.  OpenMail users simply access an
SSL-secured URL from any device with an Internet browser, including
PDAs, Web phones, walk-up terminals and PCs.  The browser accesses
OpenMail Web client software located on a VirtualVault server.  The
server then connects users to their OpenMail accounts on OpenMail
servers inside the corporate firewall.
<P>
With this solution, companies can reduce their investment in
remote-access systems, private networking, and associated support and
help-desk staff.  HP estimates that it can cost organizations up to $500
annually to support a remote user.  By using OpenMail with VirtualVault,
organizations can reduce these costs by as much as 75 percent.

Salon Adopts Linux

<P>
San Francisco, April 5 -- Salon.com (<A HREF="http://www.salon.com/">
http://www.salon.com/</A>), formerly known as
Salon Magazine, has adopted Linux as its enterprise Internet server
platform. The adoption of Linux, and the new Web address, coincide with a
site redesign that launched today.
<P>
The server platform has moved from Windows NT to a customized version of
the Red Hat 5.2 distribution of Linux. The site is moving its critical
business functions, Web serving and ad serving to the Linux platform in
order to support Salon.com's growing needs.
<P>
Says Chad Dickerson, Vice President of Technology, "For a growing company
like Salon, Linux is the best of all worlds. It's a proven technology, it's
low cost and high performance, and it's broadly supported.  The robustness
and stability of the Linux operating system make it ideal for
mission-critical applications."
<P>
According to Dickerson, Linux will provide a solid technical backbone to
support Salon's move from a magazine-based model to a network of web sites.
The site redesign needs the versatility and power of Linux to keep pace
with its growing business and e-commerce needs.
<P>
A key factor in the decision to adopt Linux was the availability of Real
Media's industry-leading Open Ad Stream advertising software for use with
Linux and the Apache web server.

TCL/TK in a Nutshell Release
</font>
</H3> 
<P>
April 12, 1999<BR> 
Sebastopol, CA--The Tcl language and Tk graphical toolkit are simple
and powerful building blocks for custom applications. The Tcl/Tk
combination is increasingly popular because it lets you produce
sophisticated graphical interfaces with a few easy commands, develop
and change scripts quickly, and conveniently tie together existing
utilities or programming libraries.
<P>
One of the attractive features of Tcl/Tk is the wide variety of
commands, many offering a wealth of options. Most of the things you'd
like to do have been anticipated by the language's creator, John
Ousterhout, or one of the developers of Tcl/Tk's many powerful
extensions. Thus, you'll find that a command or option probably exists
to provide just what you need. Keep TCL/TK in a Nutshell on your desk as you write
scripts, and you'll be able to find almost instantly the particular
option you need.

rewrite of AGI's flagship, EasyCopy/X, which has an installed base of
more than 150,000 users worldwide. With this new generation EasyCopy has

EasyCopy/X 6.0 comes with a new Graphical User Interface, an integrated
image viewer and a fast image browser. For image printing the new GUI
offers complete control of the printer setup and improved selection of
page layout and color options. WYSIWYG preview assists the user in
printing or saving the image with the right options.
EasyCopy 6.0 provides an open and flexible solution. It includes

Printing and viewing assure that black/white as well as color image data
will receive superior attention. You can remove background colors
whenever it is appropriate to combine the sharpest output with saving
money on ink or toner. You can communicate data via paper or
transparencies using the printer of your choice or through the companion
product, EasyConvert, share the data with applications demanding a
different file format.

The Independence Distribution
</font>
</H3> 
<P>
Date: Sun,  7 Mar 1999 20:52:15 GMT<BR> 
We have a dream: spreding Linux between the masses.  This requires
making it easy to use.  But it also requires to start thinking in
those people who are not using or will not be using Linux as a
traditional Unix.  In those people who have to administer the box
before knowing the simplest of the Unix commands.  In those who will be
using it at home and have a different idea of fun than C programming.
It will require to stop thinking everyone is in a LAN or the box is
powered up 24h a day.  It will require to stop thinking Linux will be
used only as a server or a programmers workstation.
<P>
The high cost of Unix banned it outside many areas of use.  Linux can
go where Unix never went but fulfilling those differents needs will
not be reached by designing Linux distributions as just a cheap
version of UNIX.
<P>
The Independence distribution is licensed under the GPL.  It is
developped not for profit by a small group of volunteers.  Not for
profit means we don't ourselves distribute it on CDROM but we will
help anyone interested in doing it.  Small group means you can make a
difference if you contribute.

Linux on Quad 750 PPC SBC
</font>
</H3> 
<P>
March 1, 1999, San Diego, CA -- Synergy Microsystems, Inc. today announced
that it has successfully run Linux with Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP) on
a quad-PowerPC 750 CPU board, running at 433 MHz. SMP allows the operating
system to dynamically balance the processing load among the four
processors. This allows the most efficient use of the four processors,
resulting in performance up to four times faster than a single-processor
board. This is the first time this level of performance has been achieved,
and the first time Linux has been offered on a VMEbus single board
computer.
<P>
The PowerPC 750 is currently available at speeds as high as 433 MHz. In
addition, the processor features its own private L2 cache that can be
accessed at up to 300 MHz. Four such processors in a system provide a very
powerful compute engine for high-end general-purpose needs, digital signal
processing (DSP), array processing and server applications.
