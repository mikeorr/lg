<P>
Hi! Good day.
</P>
<P>
I've been looking for a good documentation on configuring Sendmail +
Courier IMAP (with MailDir) but I can't find one. My server's specs:
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>Mandrake 8.2
<br>Sendmail 8.12
<br>Procmail 3.22
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
Currently, I'm using the IMAP and POP server distributed with Mandrake. Im
using Postfix as my MTA before, but when I needed to use MailScanner
(<A HREF="http://www.mailscanner.info"
	>http://www.mailscanner.info</A>) I have no choice but to use Sendmail.
I want to switch to Courier IMAP and make use of their MailDir feature and
MySQL auth, but I can't find a good tutorial or howto. I believe you can
help me with this one.
</P>
<P>
Thanks and more power

<P>
I have been searching everywhere for a possible cause to this little
problem.  I have two LNE100tx Ethernet adapters in a Redhat Linux 7.1
machine with kernel version 2.4.9-34smp.  Eth0 is hooked to a 100tx
switch and Eth1 to a Toshiba cable modem, both using cat5e cable with
very short runs.  I use an iptables based firewall rule set to allow for
ip-masquerading.  The inside interface works perfectly, and so far as
I've seen the outside interface actually works perfectly in spite of the
fact that ifconfig shows that I have 0 tx packets on that interface and
tons of errors.  My real question is if these are true readings how can
I still ping this machine and receive responses without it transmitting
packets to the cable modem?  I have included some relevant output from
ifconfig, iptables -L as I'm not sure that it's not a conflict in my
rule set, and ping output from another location.  Any information on
this problem (even if it's just that the output of ifconfig is wrong)
would be greatly appreciated.
</P>
<P>
Ifconfig output:

<P><STRONG>
I have no problems finding references that multilink ppp dual modems are
possible in linux but for the life of me I can't find a step by step
guide how to set this up. I am a newbe using Mandrake 8.2 and would
really appreciate info on how to actually set my computer up for
multilink 56k modems. My ISP does provide this service.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
You will most likely need to re-configure and compile your kernel - you
will need to install the source pkg from your Mandrake installation CD's
if it's not already installed.  I don't believe that that most distro
supplied kernels are configured for that.  From the kernel confg help:

</P>
<P>
If you have two serial connections to some other computer (this
usually requires two modems and two telephone lines) and you use
SLIP (the protocol for sending Internet traffic over telephone
lines) or PPP (a better SLIP) on them, you can make them behave like
one double speed connection using this driver. Naturally, this has
to be supported at the other end as well, either with a similar EQL
Linux driver or with a Livingston Portmaster 2e.

Say Y if you want this and read Documentation/networking/eql.txt.
You may also want to read section 6.2 of the NET-3-HOWTO, available

As a long time self-taught user of Linux/Unix/Ultrix (and several other
flavours), I've become addicted to such handy tools as vi, grep, sed, awk,
ctags, and the bazillion other little utilities that can be so artisticly
chained together to produce the desired results.  I've stumbled across your
LG archives, and all I can say is "WOAH!"  I'm going to have to find myself
a text-to-speech translator so I can read/listen-to all of this good stuff
whilst at work, because there's just so much in here.  Thanks for such a
fabulous (and fun!) resource...

The unusual Subject: line and From: line suggest you received a message
from a Klez worm/virus.  Klez operates by choosing a To: address and a From:
address randomly from the user's Microsoft Outlook address book.  In other
words, it comes from someplace completely different than where it claims to
have come from.  If you know anybody who uses Outlook and has both your address
and LG's in their addressbook, you can warn them.  Or if you have the
original message, you can tell from its Received: headers which domain it
came from.  If you want to send me the headers, I can show you how to verify
whether it's Klez and what the originating domain is.
</P>
<P>
Usually Klez messages come with a binary attachment, but sometimes the program
goofs and sends only a one-liner.  Of course, you don't ever want to run -- or
let your computer automatically run -- a binary attachment from somebody you
don't know, because that's how viruses and worms spread.  Klez in particular
also tries to disguise the attachment so it looks like a different type than
it is.  For instance, it can disguise an executable program as a sound file,
which tricks certain versions of Windows into executing it.
</P>
