<P> 
Good Morning,
<P> 
   Late last week I became aware of the national NetDay96 project
and volunteered at my daughter's school.  During the weekend, I
realized that this was an opportunity to involve the Linux community
in a project that could not only benefit our local schools, but
expose new classes of people to Linux.
<P> 
   If this topic is suitable for SSC's ventures to publicize,
please help spread the word.  For NetDay96, maybe something in
the _Linux Gazette_ could reach a few people in time to for them
to make a contribution.  If there is a NetDay97, perhaps an
article in the _Linux Journal_ reporting on NetDay96 with suggestions on 
how to promote Linux during such an event would be appropriate.
<P> 
   Attached is a posting that recently (1996/09/13) appeared
on comp.os.linux.announce.
<P> 
   A data point: The October 1996 LJ arrived in Ocean Springs,
Mississippi on Friday.  
<P> 
I strongly agree with "Linux people, now is the time to strike."
and have recently become much more aggressive in sharing my
experiences with Linux.  Would you be interested in an article
providing guidelines and suggestions on how to promote Linux?
<P> 
   Thank you for your time and if this project is not suitable
for SSC, perhaps other opportunities will allow us to work
together in the future.
<P> 
Paul...<BR>

<H3> NetDay96 </H3> 
<P> 
In the United States of America, preparations are under way for NetDay96.
NetDay96 is a grass-roots effort to install the basic wiring required to
make classrooms network ready.
<P> 
If Linux enthusiasts across the United States would participate in their
local NetDay96 and be prepared to follow up with assistance in creating
highly functional and reliable networks for our school systems, much
favorable publicity could be generated for the Linux movement.
<P> 
This is an unique opportunity to expand the name recognition of Linux.
<P> 
The following steps describe how you can help:
<ul>
<li>Volunteer to help wire a school and wear a Linux T-Shirt to the event.
<li>Be prepared to discuss the benefits (and limitations) of Linux.
<li>Suggest that your Linux User's Group sponsors a school by funding a
wiring kit.  The cost of the wiring kit ranges from $339 to $376
depending on the vendor.
<li>Contact a local Linux-based Internet Service Provider and request
their support for NetDay96.
</ul>
For more information on NetDay96 or to volunteer, feel free to visit their
web site at <A HREF="http://www.netday96.com">http://www.netday96.com</A>.

<P> 
If you volunteer, please consider sharing your experiences and success
stories with the community by sending them to 
<A HREF="mailto:li@li.org">li@li.org</A>.  We will post
a report summarizing the success of this event.
<P> 
If you do not live in the United States, you may want to consider
organizing a similar project for your community.

<H3> Linux International </H3> 
<P> 
Linux International was established to promote the development and use
of Linux.  The people at Linux International know how good Linux is and
want it to become an accepted competitor to products from even the largest
computer companies.  Among other things, it serves as a bridge between the
dedicated and skilled community of developers, and the general world of
commerce and industry.
<P> 
Linux International is a non-profit organization run by volunteers, many
of whom are high-profile Linux developers or activists.
