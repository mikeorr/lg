<p>
Hello,
</p>

<p>
I started playing with Software RAID sometime back and have posted my
notes here at <a href="http://amitksaha.blogspot.com/2008/03/software-raid-on-linux-part-1.html">http://amitksaha.blogspot.com/2008/03/software-raid-on-linux-part-1.html</a>
</p>

<p>
Would be nice to have some feedback/comments.
</p>

<p>
Ben: Can i contribute to LG as an article?
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
Amit

To make my last note a little clearer: go ahead and *format it* per LG
standards and send it to me, and I'll be happy to check it out. Please
see <a href="../../../faq/author.html">http://linuxgazette.net/faq/author.html</a> for details.

<p>
But since he did here are some (unfortunately mostly negative)
criticisms:
</p>

<pre>
	1. The article seems to say that installing "mdadm"
	is the same as installing kernel support for RAID. This is
	not true. Ideally, if you find "/proc/mdstat" does not exist
	you should first check whether the appropriate modules exist
	(under /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/md/).
 
	2. The article suggests using two consecutive partitions on
	a single disk under raid level0 which seems to be rather
	pointless unless there are some tests which one wants to run.
 
	3. The mdadm approach is one of the different ways to
	support raid under linux (some others being lvm and evms).
	The article fails to mention these others and the differences.
 
	4. Without a clear indication of the tests to be run, there
	is not much in the article which one cannot get from "man mdadm".
 
	5. Why use "Software RAID"? This question should at least be
	addressed in the article.
</pre>

<p>
So this is a good start to an article but is well short of the real
thing.

Y'know, we're always looking for more tech editors to do <em>exactly</em> this
kind of thing. If you ever feel like contributing in that respect, just
let me know; as Shakespeare has Henry V say to Montjoy, "I know thy
quality."

Thanks; I am teaching myself- so seeing it work that way, I thought,
may be installing 'mdadm' inserts the kernel module as well.

This actually inserts the 'md' support kernel module:

<p>
Yes, but you might want to check the full MD subsystem. It has its own
modules for RAID0/1/4/5/6 that also need to be present.=20
</p>

<pre>
lynx@miranda:~$ grep MD /boot/config-2.6.24.3
[...]
CONFIG_MD=3Dy
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_MD=3Dm
CONFIG_MD_LINEAR=3Dm
CONFIG_MD_RAID0=3Dm

CONFIG_MD_RAID5_RESHAPE=3Dy
CONFIG_MD_MULTIPATH=3Dm
CONFIG_MD_FAULTY=3Dm

Grab a kernel tree, run "make menuconfig" and browse the MD section. The
descriptions carry some interesting information.

Make sure that you meantion how traditional raidtools is. The mdadm
tools work a lot better. Also make sure to mention how to mark the RAID
partitions as autodetect (by writing 0xfd in the partition type).

</pre>

<p>
Well, there are some more reasons for and against. From the top of my
head I can tell you about the following things:
</p>

<pre>
 - Software RAID is independent of proprietary management software,
   maintaining a software RAID work the same way on all machines that
   run Linux. This can be an important advantage when your staff is
   poorly trained and the management console to your proprietary RAID
   system is written by equally poorly trained staff.
 
 - When considering software RAID think of the performance. All RAID
   algorithms are done by the system CPU and every block has to be
   copied over the system's data bus (i.e. sda1 &lt;-&gt; IO controller &lt;-&gt; RAM
   possibly CPU &lt;-&gt; IO controller &lt;-&gt; sdb1).=20

<p>
Happy RAIDing, <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<p>
Doing spanning (RAID0) or mirroring (RAID1) within a single drive spindle 
is an excellent way to thrash that physical drive to death while enduring
miserable performance -- though most people would say that's something
to be avoided, not deliberately sought.
</p>


<pre>

&gt; &gt;         support raid under linux (some others being lvm and evms).

</pre>

<p>
My understanding is that the traditional raidtools are now considered
obsolete, in favour of mdadm -- and that, at least to that degree, the
Software RAID HOWTO is likewise out of date.  Outdated write-ups are one
of the hazards one encounters in this area.

That's really, <strong>really</strong> good advice that Ren? is giving you, Amit.
Rather than going through submission/rejection/rewriting/resubmission
times N, why not consider improving it as much as you can, now that
you've got a couple of good new perspectives? This would make your
article better, as well as increasing your knowledge on the topic.
</p>

<p>
Frankly, I'd say that your "mistake" in submitting the article here in
TAG turned out to be an excellent thing - live tech editing from TAG is
a huge benefit. Take advantage of it while it's here; this special,
one-time deal is subject to availability and may end soon to the
incredible demand! [1] If you order today, you get not only the thing
itself, but a set of these highly polished, indestructible, guaranteed-
for-life - say, have you seem my demonstration with the tomato? Oh,
never mind.

&gt;         1. The article seems to say that installing "mdadm"
&gt;         is the same as installing kernel support for RAID. This is
&gt;         not true. Ideally, if you find "/proc/mdstat" does not exist
&gt;         you should first check whether the appropriate modules exist
&gt;         (under /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/md/).

<p>
What if the modules are not present? Will installing 'mdadm' build the
Kernel module as well and then insert it?

<p>
No. Your article assumes that you have a "stock" Debian kernel
installed. For such a kernel, most features are built as modules and
can be loaded dynamically as required.
</p>

<p>
If the user has compiled their own kernel where they did not compile
in support for "md" either statically or as modules, then the
installation of "mdadm" will work but the commands will not work. 
</p>

<p>

Kapil.

Thanks for the re-confirmation. I was wondering that will be the
answer to my query <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">

&gt; &gt; &gt; Its Ben's decision- I am open for rejection as well <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; But you can influence Ben's decision by adding content. ;)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; That's really, <strong>really</strong> good advice that Ren? is giving you, Amit.
&gt;  Rather than going through submission/rejection/rewriting/resubmission
&gt;  times N, why not consider improving it as much as you can, now that
&gt;  you've got a couple of good new perspectives? This would make your
&gt;  article better, as well as increasing your knowledge on the topic.
&gt;
&gt;  Frankly, I'd say that your "mistake" in submitting the article here in
&gt;  TAG turned out to be an excellent thing - live tech editing from TAG is
&gt;  a huge benefit. Take advantage of it while it's here; this special,
&gt;  one-time deal is subject to availability and may end soon to the
&gt;  incredible demand! [1] If you order today, you get not only the thing
&gt;  itself, but a set of these highly polished, indestructible, guaranteed-

&gt;  never mind.
&gt;

Not all mistakes necessarily lead to all negatives- its proved once again here!

<p>
Thanks guys!
