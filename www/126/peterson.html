<h1>Plotting time series data with Gnuplot</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/peterson.html">Ron Peterson</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Good systems administrators log stuff.  Lots of stuff.  A lot of the
information we collect consists of time series data: a set of numerical
values assocated with a sequence of discrete time values.</p>

<p>There are any number of tools to help the diligent sysadmin monitor
this data visually as it is collected.  A good many of them are built
using Tobias Oetiker's excellent <a
href="http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/rrdtool/">RRDTool</a>.
Some noteworthy examples include Cacti, Cricket, and Smokeping.  There
are many others.</p>

<p>That's all well and good as long as you know what you want to
monitor.  However, sometimes you'd just like to do some quick ad hoc
visualization.  As you might surmise, most Linux systems provide a myriad
of visualization tools (<a
href="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/">Grace</a> and <a
href="http://gri.sourceforge.net/">GRI</a> come to mind).  In this
article, I'll introduce you to <a
href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">Gnuplot</a>, focusing specifically on
how to plot time series data.</p>

<h3>Prepare some data</h3>

<p>Gnuplot without data is like gravy without potatoes.  So before we
get to the gravy, let's make some potatoes.  Let's say for the sake of
argument, or at least for the purpose of giving the rest of the article
something to talk about, I include the following line in my system's
crontab file:</p>

<p><pre class="code">
*/1 * * * * root /bin/cat /proc/loadavg 2&gt;&amp;1 | /usr/bin/logger -p local3.info -t CRON-LOADAVG
</pre></p>

<p>If you're like me, and have configured your system's syslog.conf as
follows:</p>

<p><pre class="code">
local3.*  /var/log/cron.log
</pre></p>

<p>...then you will find all local3 facility messages in their own
special file.  Because we're telling 'logger' to tag all of our load
average data, it will be easy to extract this information from the rest
of our logfile clutter.  A simple 'grep CRON-LOADAVG /var/log/cron.log &gt;
load.dat.1' should do nicely.  This will give us a file that looks like
so:</p>

<p><pre class="code">
Mar 19 00:30:02 ahost CRON-LOADAVG: 0.40 0.78 1.19 11/296 3690
Mar 19 00:31:01 ahost CRON-LOADAVG: 3.54 1.55 1.41 4/311 3997
Mar 19 00:32:01 ahost CRON-LOADAVG: 2.68 1.59 1.43 2/278 4142
...
</pre></p>

<p>Now let's extract just the data we want:</p>

<p><pre class="code">
cat load.dat.1 | tr -s ' ' ' ' | cut -d' ' -f1,2,3,6 &gt; load.dat.2
</pre></p>

<p>The translate command 'tr' squishes multiple spaces into a single
space, so that we can expect more consistent behaviour from the 'cut'
command.  In this case, the translate command 'tr' is superfluous, but
I think it's a good habit nonetheless.  With any luck, our data now
looks something like:</p>

<p><pre class="code">
Mar 19 00:30:02 0.40
Mar 19 00:31:01 3.54
Mar 19 00:32:01 2.68
...
</pre></p>

<p>That's almost perfect.  Unfortunately, our gnuplot example will
expect two space delimited columns of input, so we need to replace the
spaces delimiting our timestamp components with some other character,
like a hyphen.

<p><pre class="code">
perl -pe 's/(.*?)\s(.*?)\s(.*)/$1-$2-$3/;' load.dat.2 &gt; load.dat.3
</pre></p>

<p>This isn't a Perl article, so I won't bore you with the details of
what this command is doing. In the interest of pedagogy though, I think
it's helpful to illustrate how sausages are sometimes made; even if it
does make me look like a butcher. Our data now looks like:</p>

<p><pre class="code">
Mar-19-00:30:02 0.40
Mar-19-00:31:01 3.54
Mar-19-00:32:01 2.68
...
</pre></p>

<h3>Plot it</h3>

<p>Now it's time for the gravy.  First I'll give you a taste, and then I'll
explain the recipe.  Create a file with the following contents,
excluding the line numbers.  Call it 'plot-load.conf'.  Edit the date
range on line six to include the extents of your data.</p>

<p><pre class="code">
1  set terminal png size 1200,800
2  set xdata time
3  set timefmt "%b-%d-%H:%M:%S"
4  set output "load.png"
5  # time range must be in same format as data file
6  set xrange ["Mar-25-00:00:00":"Mar-26-00:00:00"]
7  set yrange [0:50]
8  set grid
9  set xlabel "Date\\nTime"
10 set ylabel "Load"
11 set title "Load Averages"
12 set key left box
13 plot "load.dat.3" using 1:2 index 0 title "ahost" with lines
</pre></p>

<p>If you run the following command, you should end up with a file
called 'load.png'.  Use your favorite image viewer to take a look.
Hopefully nothing too alarming shows up.</p>

<p><pre class="code">
cat plot-load.conf | gnuplot
</pre></p>

<p>The first line of our gnuplot command file says to create a PNG file,
and gives its dimensions.  PNG is only one of a myriad possible output
formats.  The second line says our X axis represents time data.  The
third line uses standard date format specification (see 'man date') to
indicate what our data file's timestamp data looks like.  We must use
the same format in line six, where we indicate our graph's start time
and end time.  You can omit this, but I find it's useful to anchor the
endpoints, particularly when plotting multiple data sources in a single
graph. Line seven sets the plot limits of our Y axis.</p>

<p>Line 13 deserves a little bit of extra attention.  The name of our
data source comes first.  The 'using 1:2' bit means to extract data from
columns one and two of our data source.  The 'index 0' bit means to use
the first data set in the file.  Data sets are delimited by pairs of
blank records.  Our file was simple.  It only comprised col1 and col2 of
data set zero in the following pseudo data file.</p>

<p><pre class="code">
# data set zero
col1 col2 col3 col4
col1 col2 col3 col4
col1 col2 col3 col4


# data set one
col1 col2 col3 col4
col1 col2 col3 col4
col1 col2 col3 col4
col1 col2 col3 col4


# data set two
col1 col2 col3 col4
col1 col2 col3 col4
col1 col2 col3 col4
</pre></p>

<p>Asuuming we had multiple data sets in a single file (perhaps we want
to compare load averages from multiple hosts), one way we could combine
this data into a single graph would be to expand our line 13 as
follows:</p>

<p><pre class="code">
plot "load.dat.3" using 1:2 index 0 title "ahost" with lines, \
plot "load.dat.3" using 1:2 index 1 title "bhost" with lines, \
plot "load.dat.3" using 1:2 index 2 title "chost" with lines
</pre></p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Potatoes are nice, but as Trotsky once noted, they are "the classic
symbol of poverty".  Knowing how to quickly whip up some time series
plots is useful, but Gnuplot is capable of far more than I've even
hinted at in this article.  Hopefully I've managed to whet your appetite
to learn even more.</p>

<p>Best.</p>
