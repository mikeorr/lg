Thanks to all our authors, not just the ones above, but also those who wrote
giving us their tips and tricks and making suggestions. Thanks also to our
new mirror sites.
<P> 
I've spent so much time at work lately, my dear husband says he doesn't
recognize me anymore! I'm hoping once this issue is up, the May issue of
<I>Linux Journal</I> is gone to layout, and Linux World is in the past, I
might have some time again to spend with Riley and other family members. My
daughter Shannon is coming to visit on March 11 and I am looking forward to
that.
<P> 
I will be at Linux World on March 2 and 3. Hope to meet you there!
<P> 
Have fun!
