>Another (Lose)-Modem</H3>
<p><strong>From Barbara Ercolano on 20 Sep 1998 </strong></p>


<p><strong>
Hi James,
I saw your "Answer Guy" page and I thought that maybe if you spare a few
minutes you might help me with solving my connection problem. I have
recently installed redhat linux on my PC and i am now trying to set up an
internet connection. I have the chatscript the ppp-on and the ppp-off
script the thing is that when i try to run the ppp-on nothing happens .
</strong></p>


<p><strong>
The syslog file says:

That suggests that there is not a Hayes compatible modem on
the other end of the connection.  Either you're pointing
this at the wrong device (it's going to your serial mouse)--
or you have a <EM>WINMODEM</EM>!

'winmodems' are <EM>NOT</EM> hayes compatible devices.  They are
little chunks of cheap hardware that can be used with
proprietary (MS Windows only) drivers to <EM>emulate</EM> a modem

<blockquote>
Oddly enough you can use just about any nameserver on the
Internet --- not just the one that your ISP provides.
I've occasionally used the nameserver from one of my
former employers when setting up a new machine at a 
customer site --- just long enough to have DNS to 
'dig' up the more appropriate and closer nameservers
(which should <EM>all</EM> have names or CNAMES of the form: 
ns*.foo.org in my not-so-humble-opinion).

</strong></p>


<blockquote>
If you can't get a boring old terminal emulation package
like 'minicom', 'ckermit' talking to your modem --- then 
it is quite relevant to your problems running SLIP, PPP, 
fax, or anything else to that modem.   The simplest think 
you can do to a modem is send it an ATZ and get an OK
response.  If you can't do that --- the modem 
(or your serial port, or your way of talking to the 
serial port) isn't working.

<strong><p>
Hi James,
thanks for your email... I am not sure whether i have a winmodem ....
my modem's a Hayes Accura 336 External Fax Modem...
</p></strong>


<blockquote><img src="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" height="28" width="50" 
	alt="(!)" border="0"
>By their nature winmodems must be internal.  Since you 
have an external modem (and a Hayes (TM) brand one
at that) we can rule out that as the culprit.
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
This leads us to the next possibility.  I mentioned that
it might be a problem between the OS and your serial
hardware.
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
If you are using the correct /dev/ttyS* node --- then
the next mostly likely problem is an interrupts 
conflict.
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
Is this a  (PnP) "Plug and Pray" system?  (Reboot and
get into the CMOS setup program to look for those features).
If so, try disabling that and setting all of your COM and
printer ports to manually selected, non-conflicting ranges.
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
One of the bugaboos about Linux and most other Unix variants
is that they tend not tolerate IRQ's conflicts the way that
MS-DOS and Win 95 might.  (This tendency in DOS and Windows
probably leads to some of the intermittent hands and that
you see with those OS').  So, you should not set your COM2
and COM3 ports on the same IRQ.
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
First, read the Linux Serial HOWTO.  It will go into 
excruciating detail about the topic.  Next play with
commands like 'statserial' and 'setserial' and look at
the /proc/interrupts and /proc/ioports psuedo-files.
Also the boot up messages might help.
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
Also I think i have got the right port ttyS1 (cua1) for COM2...
I have tried running minicom, and the init string appeared whith my cursor
at the end of it, so i pressed enter and nothing happened after that (I
should have got OK, shouldn't I?) I tried to enter my username and password
(even though no login prompt appeared), and again nothing really happened I
saw the modem blink but that's about it, so i exited minicom without
resetting and looked at the syslog file... it said something about the line
not being 8-bit clean and that bit 7 was set to zero.... all this has
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
I'm glad you looked in the syslog --- I don't think I
remembered to suggest that in my earlier response.
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
This could be a cabling or IRQ problem.  Make sure that 
the modem cable is a good one.  I used to see problems
with cheap cables that didn't have all of the handshaking
lines connected and things like that.

>Yes, I was wrong to assume that it was a winmodem (I've been
getting too many of those recently) but it looks like I'm
still on the right track.  There is some problem with 
Linux's ability to talk to the device --- in this case it's
either having trouble talking to the serial port --- or the
cable isn't relaying that to the modem.  Or, it is still 
possible that you just have the wrong ttyS* port.  Try the
others, ttyS0 through ttyS3 for good measure.  (If your
modem is working on one of those --- skip that one).

<p><strong>From Barbara Ercolano on 21 Sep 1998 </strong></p>

<p><strong>
Hi ... it's me again , still tryin'...
I've just done
</strong></p>



<p><code><strong>cat /proc/interrupts</strong></code></p>



<p><strong>
and this is what i've got:
</strong></p>


<p><strong>
0: 646864  timer
1:   2933  keyboard
2:      0  cascade
4:   2457 +serial
8:      1 +rtc
13:     0  matherror
14: 71407 +ide0
</strong></p>


<p><strong>
now the question is , shouldn't i get two lines saying serial if my modem
was correctly installed??? The 4:  2457 +  serial line is the mouse isn't
it?
</strong></p>


<blockquote><img src="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" height="28" width="50" 
	alt="(!)" border="0"
>Yes.  You probably should have another line there.
But what about the rest of the suggestions in the 
Serial-HOWTO.  Did you read through that?  
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
It used to say something about doing a 'dmesg' command
or viewing syslog's /var/log/messsages shortly after a
reboot --- with an example of the sorts of lines you should
see from the kernel.
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
The dmesg command is to "display" (actually *re-display*)
message that were generated during the boot sequence.  All 
those messages that tell you what your kernel "found."
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
If this port works under DOS, Windows, et al, then you 
might use the "MSD.EXE" (Microsoft Diagnostics) package
to tell you where DOS is finding the port.  You can also
use the "procinfo" command (from Linux) to get handy 
one page summaries of some system diagnostics and performance
stats (including how many interrupts have been recieved and
handled by kernel on each IRQ).
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
It may be that your serial port is set at a reasonable 
(non-conflicting) IRQ --- but that it's at one that the
kernel doesn't probe by default.  
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
To fix that you'd use the 'setserial' command to associate
a give /dev/ttyS* device with an IRQ and set other
characteristics on the line.  It's also possible, though
less likely, that you might have to use the stty command
to set yet other characteristics of the tty lines.
</blockquote>


<p><strong><img src="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" height="28" width="50" 
	alt="(?)" border="0"
>Maybe this is where my problem is... what do you think? And if this is the
problem , what do i need to do?
</strong></p>


<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" height="28" width="50" 
	alt="(!)" border="0"
>Try reading that HOWTO.  It's a bit long --- but I'd just
end up retyping most of it at this point anyway.  Also 
read the man pages for 'setserial' and 'stty' and play 
with them a little bit.
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
Since you seem to have a serial mouse --- try putting the
mouse on that other serial port, and changing your start
scripts (/etc/rc.d/$whatever) to have gpm, and X use that.
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
Actually on most Linux systems there's a symlink under
/dev/ from "mouse" -&gt; ttyS1 or -&gt; psaux or whatever, and
anther from "modem" -&gt; ttyS* (or to the deprecated cua* 
"callout" ports).  So, when you move a mouse or modem 
to a different serial port, you usually only have to 
change those symlinks according (just 'rm' the symlink and
create a new one or use the 'ln -sf $device mouse' command.
