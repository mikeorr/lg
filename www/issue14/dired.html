<H2>The Cracraft and Lijewski DIRED Programs</H2>
<H4>By Grant B. Gustafson

<P> <HR> <P>  

The directory navigator and program launcher called &quot;DIRED&quot;
in the original incarnations of EMACS has two stand-alone
Unix clones. Mike Lijewski's &quot;dired&quot; 2.2 is written in C++
(1996). The original &quot;dired&quot; was written in C by Stuart
Cracraft (1980), available as version 3.05 (1997).
<P> 
Historically, shortly after emacs &quot;dired&quot; appeared in the
TECO implementation, a stand-alone version was written by
Stuart Cracraft (1980). The emacs version and the C version
have not kept up with one another.
<P> 
Lijewski wrote &quot;dired&quot; in 1990, while at Cornell University
Theory Center, without any knowledge of Cracraft's &quot;dired&quot;.
The Theory Center ran on IBM VM/CMS, under which there is a
utility call &quot;file manager&quot;. This program manages the flat
VM/CMS file system and represents the main user interface
into files. The creation of &quot;dired&quot; eased the transition
from VM/CMS to Unix.
<P> 
Lijewski's &quot;dired&quot; has the advantage of hindsight and C++
program development so it promises to be written in modern
syntax and very maintainable. Cracraft's &quot;dired&quot; was
rewritten in 1996 in ANSI C. It suffers with flaws in both
design and readability, but the features are there.

<P><HR> <P>  
<center><H3> 
    Common features of Cracraft's and Lijewski's &quot;dired&quot;
</H3> </center>
<ul> 
<li>Copy current file
<li>Hard link current file to another file.
<li>Symbolic link current file to another file.
<li>Unzip current file (gunzip).
<li>Zip current file (gzip).
<li>Rename current file.
<li>Display help.
<li>Cursor up one.
<li>Cursor down one.
<li>Back one page.
<li>Forward one page.
<li>Go to first file.
<li>Go to last file.
<li>Do shell command /w filename substitution.
<li>Search forward for file matching regular expression.
<li>Search reverse for file matching regular expression.
<li>Launch EDITOR on a file or DIRED on a directory.
<li>Recognize new window size and refresh screen.
<li>Delete current file
<li>Prompt for and edit a directory.
<li>Change the mode of the current file.
<li>Launch PAGER on this file.
<li>Sort the file list.
<li>Print file contents.
<li>Reload directory.
<li>Abort DIRED.
<li>Suspend DIRED.
<li>Exit immediately.
<li>Setup by command line, resource file or environment variable.
</ul>
  Minor differences exist in the implementation of these
  features. Cracraft's dired supports split screen.
  Lijewski's dired supports scrolling by half-page. Deletes
  in Cracraft's dired are done in batch whereas Lijewski's
  dired does them immediately.
<P> 
  Curiously, the common features of the two direds also
  account for the most often used dired commands.
<P> 
  The differences between Lijewski's &quot;dired&quot; and Cracraft's
  &quot;dired&quot; in 1997 appear below. Many features commonly exist
  in both versions, so only the superficial differences are
  discussed. Strengths and weaknesses of each are also
  listed.

           Unique features of Lijewski's &quot;dired&quot;
</H3> </center>
<ul> 
<li>Compress current file.
<li>Uncompress current file.
<li>Change the group of the current file.
<li>View only files matching a regular expression.
</ul> 

Strengths:
<ul> 
<li>Excellent for persons with minimal Unix knowledge.
<li>Has a full complement of basic commands for file maintenance.
<li>Key configuration in resource file &quot;~/.diredrc&quot;.
</ul> 

Weaknesses:
<ul> 
<li>Does file maintenance one file at a time with prompts.
<li>Fixed full screen format.
<li>No ANSI colorization to match color-ls.
</ul> 

<P><HR> <P>  
<center><H3> 
          Unique features of Cracraft's Dired 3.05
</H3> </center>
<ul>
<li>Manual page display, DIRED 3.05 in detail.
<li>Key Tutor. Describe key. Execute key.
<li>Tag files for later processing.
<li>Dynamic format setup for the screen and shell commands.
<li>Toggle colorization of file names (4 color tables).
<li>Undo search and page move.
<li>Bookmarks.
<li>Abort or suspend DIRED and PUSHD to the displayed directory.
<li>Groff current file as a manual page.
<li>Type current text or binary file on terminal with pause.
<li>Write the formatted file list to a unique file in /tmp.
<li>Aliased shell commands, interactive or in resource ~/.diredset.
<li>Setup for shell commands attached to internal variables.
</ul>

Strengths:
<ul>
<li>Favors use by seasoned Unix people.
<li>Configurable screen format.
<li>Keys are fixed to give uniformity across different hosts.
</ul>

Weaknesses:
<ul>
<li>Key configuration is compiled into &quot;dired&quot; and can't be changed.
</ul>


<P><HR> <P>  
<center><H3> 
          Misfeatures of both versions of &quot;dired&quot;
</H3> </center>
<P> 

The program tends to be used for browsing and deleting
files; users find the other features too obtuse for daily
use. Too many commands. Its hard to remember what key does
which command.
