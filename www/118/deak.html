<h1>Microprocessor Simulator on Linux</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/deak.html">Hrvoje Deak</A>, <A HREF="../authors/magtalas.html">Jonathan Magtalas</A> and <A HREF="../authors/edwards.html">Matt Edwards</A></b></p>

<p>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>There have long been three options in developing, testing, and
  debugging microprocessor applications.</p>

  <p>For hobbyists and enthusiasts, the simple and probably the
  most frustrating way of developing an application was to write
  and download the program code into the microprocessor, plug the
  microprocessor into the circuit, and hope it works. Needless to
  say, you could find yourself spending most of your development
  time debugging and downloading the program back into the
  microprocessor, over and over again.</p>

  <p>If you were developing a slightly more advanced application,
  you might invest some time into acquiring and learning simulation
  software. This technique allows to you to see if the code used
  for your program does as it's expected, on a nice and easy to
  follow graphical user interface, where registers, memory, and
  program execution can be viewed. Then, once you feel the code is
  correct, you would perform the option above: Plug and pray.
  However, the lack of any interaction with actual hardware during
  development and debugging means that how the program performs and
  executes on simulation software may be different from how it
  performs in a real-world application.</p>

  <p>Finally, if you were serious about developing microprocessor
  applications in a reasonably short amount of time, you could
  invest in an in-circuit emulator that actually gives you an idea
  of real-world performance. However, priced in the thousands of
  dollars, this option is well out of the means for the average
  microprocessor enthusiasts.</p>

  <p>We present a fourth option &mdash; using your regular IBM PC to run
  simulation software that controls real hardware in real time,
  through the parallel port. This has been achieved under Linux,
  and simply could not have been achieved under Windows due to
  lack of access to I/O ports.</p>

  <p>We decided to implement this solution using the PIC16F84A, a
  popular processor for hobbyists with a simple instruction set
  that can run reasonably advanced applications</p>

  <h2>The difficult bit - The hardware interface</h2>

  <p>We found plenty of good quality microprocessor simulators for
  a wide range of microprocessor families. However, as mentioned
  above, the lack of any hardware interaction was seen as a major
  drawback, when developing an application. What was the solution?
  The parallel port on the PC was seen as an input and output
  device that had enough I/O pins to be able to provide enough
  support for the 13 I/O pins on a PIC16F84A. (For our simulator, we
  don't need the two oscillator inputs, as the clock timing is done
  in software.) However, it is not as easy reading and writing data
  to the parallel port as we originally thought: In the more recent
  versions of Windows, access to I/O ports on the PC is virtually
  non-existent, without a hack. In Linux, there is a better way.</p>

  <p>First, allow the program to run as a root
  application:</p>
  <pre>
 su - root               # Become root, give password when requested.
 chown root your_program # Make root the enabling program's owner.
 chmod u+s your_program  # Set the SUID bit.
</pre>

  <p>Then, access the I/O ports at the beginning of your
  program, and remove root privileges:</p>
  <pre>
   /*--- Set access to the ports.*/ 
        if (ioperm(0x378, 3, 1)) 
                perror("Failed ioperm lp0 on") ;
       
        /*---  remove root privileges.*/     
        setgid( getgid() ) ;
        setuid( getuid() ) ; 
</pre>

  <p>For more information, read P.J. Radcliffe's article in 
  <em>Linux Gazette's</em> March 2005 edition ("Linux: A Clear Winner for
  Hardware I/O").</p>

  <p>However, hardware interaction through the parallel port was
  only one feature that we wanted to provide. To properly simulate
  a real-world application, using the parallel port as a substitute
  for the PIC16F84A's I/O ports, we also wanted to make the
  simulation be able to run in real-time.</p>

  <p>Typical PIC16F84A applications run off a 4 MHz clock. That
  translates to a 1 MHz instruction rate. This means 1000
  instructions every millisecond. With release of the Linux
  kernel 2.6, we could achieve 1 millisecond time slicing, which
  gave us our best chance of running an application in real time.
  In our tests on an 800Mhz Pentium 3 laptop, the amount of time
  the instruction execution (1000 instructions) take out of the
  1 ms. time slice is about 50%.</p>

  <p>Reading and writing to the parallel port after every
  instruction that accesses the processor's I/O is infeasible:
  Perfect real-time simulation could not be done. However, we could
  achieve what we dubbed pseudo-real-time, that is, we run as many
  instructions as needed in the 1 ms. time slice the Linux
  kernel gives our program, and then perform the reading and writing
  to the parallel port: input pins are read and output pins are
  written to. This meant that, in the time, all the instructions
  were executing in the 1 ms. slice, if an output pin went from a 0
  to a 1 and then back to 0, the end result would be that the
  parallel port pin representing this PIC16F84A pin would not see
  the change. That is why we call it pseudo-real-time.</p>

  <h2>Software side</h2>

  <p>We wanted the simulator software to have an easy-to-use
  graphical interface. One thing lacking from many
  microprocessor simulators we found on the Net was a
  quality user interface. The ability of these programs to actually
  simulate a microprocessor was unquestioned; however, we felt that
  users need a program that not only runs correctly but also makes life
  easier for a microprocessor developer through its GUI.</p>

  <p>For our GUI design, we decided to use Qt Designer, an open
  source (for non-commercial products)<a href="#1"><strong>[1]</strong></a>  
  and easy-to-use IDE that
  uses the Qt graphics library to help users build effective
  designs. Coming from a predominantly Windows programming
  background, we found Qt Designer to be very powerful, and, in
  many ways, very similar to Visual Studio .NET &mdash; which made the
  learning curve very gentle.</p>

  <p>Using Qt Designer also fell into line with another of our
  project's goals &mdash; being an open source project. We decided early on
  that by making the simulator open source, we could use GPL code and
  allow users who had an understanding of programming to make their
  own changes to our software where they see fit.</p>

  <p>Being able to use GPLed code made our job easier, and huge thanks
  must be given to Scott Dattalo, the creator of GPSIM. GPSIM is an
  open-source microprocessor simulator that simulates the entire
  PIC family of processors. Our project took the PIC16F84A
  emulation out of GPSIM, and used it for our back-end code. Also,
  our thanks go to P.J. Radcliffe, an RMIT academic, whose article
  in <em>Linux Gazette</em> on hardware I/O under Linux (March 2005) and
  accompanying software (a program called lptty_start) helped us
  access the parallel port under Linux, and made the job of reading
  and writing to the parallel port a whole lot easier.</p>

  <h2>A typical example</h2>

  <p>Now, we will go through a simple application that uses 
  our simulator's features. Here is a simple segment of code that
  flashes an LED on and off (really fast) from Port A, pin 0 on the
  PIC16F84A:</p>
  <pre>
list    p=16c84
  __config _wdt_off


include "p16c84.inc"

        org     0

        goto    start
        org     4

start: 
        bsf     status,rp0
        movlw   0x10
        movwf   trisa ; set low 4 bits of port a to output

        bcf     status,rp0
here:

        call    turnon
        call    turnoff
        goto    here

turnon:
        movlw   0x01
        movwf   porta ;move 1 to bit 0 of port a
        
        return

turnoff:
        movlw   0x00
        movwf   porta ;move 0 to bit 0 of port a

        return
      
        end        
</pre>

  <p>The ASM code has to be compiled using an external compiler. We
  recommend GPASM, an easy-to-use free compiler. To load
  this file into our simulator, click on the open icon in the
  toolbar. This will open up a file open dialog, from which you can
  select either a .hex file or a symbolic .cod file. It is
  considered better to load the COD file, because it has more
  information associated with it, such as symbol names for variables
  declared in your source code and actually being able to view the
  original ASM source code.</p>

  <p>Once you've selected a file, another dialog pops up to
  show what kind of parallel port configuration you want. You have
  the option of being able to use 0-13 inputs and 0-4 outputs, or
  0-5 inputs and 0-12 outputs &mdash; or not use the parallel port (if its
  not required). For the above application, we will use the second
  option (5 inputs/12 outputs).</p>

    align="center"></p>

  <p>Once loaded, you can see, under the source code tab, that there are
  two components: a history list that shows the most recently
  executed instructions, and a source code viewer that shows the
  associated ASM file with the program. By double-clicking on a
  line of source code, you can add and remove breakpoints to a
  particular line of code. When executing, a program will stop when
  it hits a breakpoint, and this feature can be used to view the
  state of the PIC16F84A program during execution.</p>

    <img src="misc/deak/sourcebrowser.jpg" alt=
    "Screenshot of source browser tab" width="600" height="418"
    align="center">

  <p>By clicking on the memory viewer tab, we can see three
  components. First, we can view the program opcodes in the
  memory browser tab, under the opcode viewer component. The current
  instruction is highlighted. When executing a program in
  single-step mode, the highlighted line changes with each
  instruction step. The opcode viewer shows the memory address
  where the instruction is located, the 'hex' representation, and
  the disassembled (ASM) representation of the code.</p>

  <p>Also located under the "Memory Browser" tab is a memory viewer
  (bottom half of tab). This graphical component allows users to
  view/modify the value of memory. Users can view register memory
  (RAM), program memory, or EEPROM memory of the PIC16F84A, by
  selecting the appropriate radio button on the bottom of the page.
  They can also add break points on the reading and writing of
  registers. This is indicated by a yellow and red background on
  the register, respectively.</p>

  <p>Another simulator feature to aid viewing what
  really happens during a PIC application's execution is the Watch
  Viewer. It allows the user to right-click on a memory location
  (in the memory viewer tab), and, from the menu that pops up, select
  to add a 'watch' to a memory location. For instance, if you want
  to view an general purpose register that your program uses as an
  important variable, you can add a 'watch' to it.</p>

    <img src="misc/deak/memorybrowser.jpg" alt=
    "Screenshot of memory browser tab" width="600" height="418"
    align="center"

  <p>The third tab, the Hardware tab, is where you can specify the
  mapping between PIC16F84A pin and parallel port pin. To map a pin
  to one on the parallel port, you click on the drop-down box associated with
  that pin, and select which parallel port pin you want the PIC pin
  to be mapped to. For instance, in our above program, if you
  wanted Port A Bit 0 (pin 17 on the PIC chip) to be mapped to
  parallel port pin 9, you would click on the drop-down box next to
  RA0, and select the number 9. Now, any change in the value of RA0
  will be reflected on this parallel port pin. By connected an LED
  to this parallel port pin, we can run the PIC application. (Also,
  note that your parallel port mapping configuration can be saved and
  loaded to file).</p>

  <p>The mapping of parallel port pins to PIC pins can be saved or
  loaded to files, by clicking the corresponding buttons at the bottom
  right-hand corner of the screen.</p>

    <img src="misc/deak/hardware.jpg" alt=
    "Screenshot of hardware tab" width="600" height="418"
    align="center">

  <p>We can run the program in full-speed mode, by clicking
  on the run-icon in the toolbar. We stop execution in full-speed
  mode, when breakpoint is hit or the user clicks on the stop icon
  in the toolbar. We can also run in single step mode where we run
  one instruction at a time, by clicking on the step icon. The user
  can choose to step over an instruction that they do not want
  executed, by clicking the step-over icon.</p>

comments</span>:  Because Qt Designer's licence restricts usage,
albeit certainly generous and relatively benevolent for a
proprietary software package, it is actually under what would be termed
a "viewable source" or "source-available" licence, and not a genuinely
open source one.  Fortunately, that doesn't prevent using it to create 
open source works of your own, as you've illustrated in the article.
