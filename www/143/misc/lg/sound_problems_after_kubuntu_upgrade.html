<p>
My sound isn't working right.  How do I fix it?
</p>

<p>
Seriously, I upgraded from Kububtu 6.10 to 7.04 in a different root
partition, though they're sharing the same home partition.  Now where
the old system makes a big sound, the new system makes a teensy-weensy
little sound.  I go back and startle the neighbors; I sally ho (or ho
Sally), and I have to wait till the refrigerator shuts off to hear the
sound.
</p>

<p>
The configuration in both appears to be identical.  KInfoCenter says
it's a VIA 8237 device with ALC655, Type 10 ALSA emulation.  KMix has
"Master" and "PCM" unmuted and their volumes near maximum.  In the
Switches tab, all the lights are off except "External Amplifier",
which doesn't do anything either way.
</p>

<p>
The KDE Peripherals dialog has "Enable the sound system", "Run with
the highest possible priority", "sound buffer as large as possible",
"auto-suspend if idle after 60 seconds", "autodetect audio device",
"default quality", "Midi through midi through port-0 - ALSA device".
The test sound is quiet and distorted on the new system, but loud and
clear on the old one.

Is it the same ALSA version? Maybe there's a bug somewhere...

That may well be the problem. As I understand it, <em>Kubuntu</em> works pretty
well - but if you use one of those strange distros that nobody's ever
heard of, you have only yourself to blame. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Why don't you just tell Sally to shut off your refrigerator every time
you want to play your Weird Al Yankovic or whatever? Seems like a pretty
good solution to me...

<p>
Have you checked which sound-related modules are loading in both cases?
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
# Repeat once per distro, then run "vim -d" on the two files
lsmod|egrep '^s(ou)?nd' &gt; /var/tmp/`date +%F`_modules
</pre>
Are they the same versions, or have any changes been made? 
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
# Repeat once per distro, then run "vim -d" on the two files
for n in `lsmod|awk '/^s(ou)?nd/{print $1}'`; do modinfo $n; done &gt; /var/tmp/`date +%F`_sound
</pre>
Which I/O range, IRQ, and DMA is your sound hardware using in both
cases? Examine /proc/{interrupts, iomem, ioports, dma}; get the PCI
address via
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
lspci|awk '/[Aa]udio|[Ss]ound/{print $1}'
</pre>
If you find any differences, try specifying the old (working) values
when you load the modules in the new setup. Many modules accept
arguments; see the 'parm' lines in 'modinfo' output for a given module.

2 files, and you are probably wanting to see what differences there are...

<p>
nah. Pick 2 files that are nearly the same and try it <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
After that  man vim gave...
<pre>
       -d          Start  in  diff  mode.  There should be two or
                   three file name arguments.  Vim will open  all
                   the  files  and show differences between them.
                   Works like vimdiff(1).
</pre>
It's pretty neat.

<p>
On some systems (such as FC3), there is a symlink to vim called vimdiff
that does the same.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I've nearly stopped using
&gt; 'diff' except in scripts - this is <strong>so</strong> much more useful and intuitive.

<p>
Very! Although I often run diff to see if there are <strong>any</strong> differences
first just so I don't have to exit two files in vim.

Speak up there, I can't hear you.

So what you're saying is that the sound is really faint?  This is what you
get for using KDE; there have been all manner of reports over the years of
various KDE apps breaking the weirdest of things.  At least make sure you
haven't got that abomination that is ArtsD (or whatever the stupid
capitalisation of it is) running.

&gt; it's a VIA 8237 device with ALC655, Type 10 ALSA emulation.  KMix has
&gt; "Master" and "PCM" unmuted and their volumes near maximum.  In the
&gt; Switches tab, all the lights are off except "External Amplifier",

<p>
There's a few things to check here (you're naughty in trying to throw
red-herrings at U/us with all this KDE stuff.  :P):
</p>

<p>
1.  Make sure you don't have any OSS cruft loaded.  (Even the emulation
layer -- just go with straight ALSA).
</p>

<p>
2.  Check the version of ALSA:
</p>

<pre>
cat /proc/asound/version
</pre>
against the ALSA library version.  They <strong>ought</strong> to match:
</p>

<pre>
grep VERSION_STR /usr/include/alsa/version.h
</pre>
If they don't, best to compile ALSA by hand, and fudge its install.
</p>

<p>
A lot of the VIA-based on-board jobbies are notorious for choppy sound --
something which could be symptomatic of this quietness.  There's an option
for setting the fragment size in ~/.asoundrc -- I can't remember what it is.
