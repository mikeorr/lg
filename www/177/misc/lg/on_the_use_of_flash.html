I just wanted to object. No cartoon is way better than a flash cartoon.
</p>

<p>
I see you've hashed it somewhat already. Just my 2 cents.

<p>
I really like the gazette otherwise.

I must admit that I get really, really puzzled when I hear or read
something like this. If you dislike Flash this much, why would you spend
time looking at it? Why not just click the "Back" button, or surf to
another page - and perhaps remember the author's name so you can avoid
seeing his work in the future?
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I see you've hashed it somewhat already. Just my 2 cents.
</pre>

<p>
And this implies that you even have a Flash interpreter installed
with/for your browser. Why would you do that if you hated it this much?
If I was in your place, I'd use a text browser like "w3m" and never
worry about seeing a Flash image again - and I would certainly not
install the Flash plugin if I was going to use a graphical browser.
</p>

<p>
What am I missing?
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; I really like the gazette otherwise.
</pre>

<p>
Thanks! I appreciate that, and will pass it on to the LG staff.

&gt; I don't spend any time looking at it, I just noticed the links to .swf
&gt; files on the pages in the full page view mode. I was genuinely
&gt; surprised and not positively. I'm not so very concerned of my own well
&gt; being but that of the entire LG readership.
</pre>

<p>
Now I'm <em>really</em> confused. How does a Flash cartoon affect someone's
well-being? 
</p>

<p>
Perhaps you're operating from the idea of "Flash = proprietary = EVIL,
and therefore must never be used by anyone associated with Linux". In
that case, I'd recommend talking to the OpenOffice people, whose
software reads Microsoft's DOC, XLS, PPT, and other formats; I'd also
consider starting a campaign against the Gnash project (GNU's free SWF
movie player), "flasm" (free assembler/disassembler for Flash), the Ming
project (libraries which allow you to generate Flash under Linux),
"swfdec", and so on. I'd also recommend taking a look at any other
Linux-related web publication: every single one of them uses Flash, at
least in their ads.
</p>

<p>
This idea of that kind of "purity" in the Linux world is a mistaken one,
as well as being dangerous to the whole concept of Linux. Sure, the
kernel itself must remain forever Free and open - but trying to live in
some sort of a sterile void where nothing but the perfect, 100%-accepted
document formats are used is an unrealistic dream. In the real world,
people need to get their work done - and you cannot deny that a very
large part of the business world uses proprietary formats. The choices
come down to 1) adapt and survive, and change the world, or 2) fade away
and die.
</p>

<p>
Linux is alive, viable, expanding, and thriving today because the app
developers wisely decided to go with choice #1. The most popular Open
Source app in the world - OpenOffice - is a loud and explicit statement
of what really works. By the same token, Flash is ubiquitous, and in
constant demand; by my estimate, it used to be the <em>most</em>
complained-about problem under Linux (it's become much less of a problem
today, since most distros allow you to install it via their package
installation system.) I can guarantee you that the average Windows user
will not switch to Linux if they have to lose their ability to view
Flash. No YouTube? No Flash games? No cute little dancing badgers? The
answer will be "NO, THANK YOU." Period.
</p>

<p>
As to our cartoons: Shane Collinge, whose art I and many others enjoy, 
publishes his work in the Flash format - and frankly, I find that format
to be much more efficient (with regard to file size) than anything I
could convert it to. Having carefully considered all the pro and con
arguments for myself, I saw nothing wrong with using Flash in LG, and
still don't; if anything, the "pro" side is even stronger than it was,
while the "con" side has faded away to almost nothing.

&gt; The comment about "hashing" was referring to this
&gt; <a href='../../../124/misc/nottag/flash.html'>http://linuxgazette.net/124/misc/nottag/flash.html</a> and in particular
&gt; quote "Just for the record, exactly one person complained last month."
</pre>

<p>
Yours is the second one, then. It's been more than four years since the
last one. It's obviously not something that weighs heavily on most
people's minds. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<p>
I think it would be much better to be clear on what it is you're
advocating and why. "Flash is bad" as a general statement... well,
why?
</p>

<p>
 From the Free Software advocacy point of view: just blindly shouting
"Flash is bad" helps nobody -- it's missing an opportunity to promote
the Free alternatives.
</p>

<p>
(For the record, as well as Gnash, there's also Lightspark, which
supports only the newer version of Flash -
<a href='https://launchpad.net/lightspark'>https://launchpad.net/lightspark</a> - and Gordon, which is a
Javascript/HTML5 based implementation of a Flash runtime -
<a href='http://wiki.github.com/tobeytailor/gordon/'>http://wiki.github.com/tobeytailor/gordon/</a>)
</p>

<p>
 From the Open Source advocacy point of view: see Ben's answer, I guess.
</p>

<p>
 From the Open Standards advocacy point of view, it would be a little
more effective to actually mention which standard it is that should be
used instead of a particular usage of Flash (in this case, SVG is the
open standard for vector graphics).

<p>
I think I'd take a middle ground here. I think a lot of of people in the 
open world felt pretty aggrieved at the arrival of flash into the standards 
based WWW. I was certainly one. It fragmented the web in a proprietorial 
land grab - it still does, though less than previously. Many extensively 
flash based sites have accessibility issues. I find that many flash 
exponents are highly dismissive of the standard alternatives, to the extent 
they do not consider accessibility issues. I also find flash an affront in 
that it panders to the providers wish to dictate the presentation of the 
information. Compare and contrast with my flexibility over how I see things 
with CSS etc.
</p>

<p>
Having said that, I'm no purist, and by installing Flashblock on Firefox, I 
see less adverts, have pages load quicker, and can selectively view those 
flash sections I may be interested in - yes youtube, said cartoons, etc.
</p>

<p>
