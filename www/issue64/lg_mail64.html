Hi,
</P>
<P>
I have a problem trying to setup Linux to access the servers at the
University of Phoenix.  The servers (Microsoft IIS) require a "log on using
Secure Password Authentication" under Microsoft Outlook Express.  I
understand that this requires a email and news reader to authenticate using
the WindowsNT Challenge/Response (NTCR) protocol [a really bad use of the
http protocol].  The school does have a website to get to the email and news
groups but it is timed and is very particular and seems to like rejecting
Netscape Navigator access.  The UOP Tech group's pat answer is that they
only support Outlook Express under Windows, I want a Linux answer.
</P>
<P>
Is there any program or daemon that I could run to allow me to authenticate
using this protocol so I could use Linux based email and news readers?  I
have tried using pine, staroffice, and leafnode and several others which are
common under <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A>/RedHat 6.2.
</P>
<P>
Thanks,
<br>K. Woodward

Dear LG readers
</P>
<P>
I am a doctor working in a hospital in Sri Lanka. I am thinking of
connecting several computers in the hospital eg: one in the ward with the
operating theatre, the pathology laboratory etc. The cheapest wasy would be
via an internal modem and the use of the intercom telephones which work via
the telephone exchange in the hospital.
Is there a way of email/ file transfer which would allow say the doctor in
the ward to download the results from the biochemistry department?
I have read about C-kermit and UUCP but they are too confucing for us mere
doctors.
I have used RedHat Linux, but am hoping to use <A HREF="http://linux.corel.com/">Corel</A> Linux and Star Office
in the hospital as they are more user friendly.
Is there a simple, preferably GUI based communication tool which can do the
above? Can StarOffice do it? If one can see the other desktop and click and
download the file or email say with "ward 29 results on 26 January 2001"
after connecting up - that is a dream come true!
</P>

Hi there
</P>
<P>
I have two graphics cards in my machine:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote><code>
1:0:0 AGP 3DFX Voodoo3 2000 16Mb
2:0:0 PCI 3DFX Voodoo3 2000 16Mb
</code></BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
I am running XFree 4.0 under kernel 2.2.17 with <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> 7.0
</P>
<P>
The problem is that I cannot get X to run on the second graphics card,
either in multihead or regular mode. My BIOS allows me to specify which card
is initialised as primary (the PCI or AGP card) and, depending on which one
I select, X will only run on that card. It runs perfectly on each respective
card when it is primary. I am trying to do multihead, but I can't get the
secondary card to work either way. It does initialise (ie the monitor
receives a signal) when I try to start X on the secondary card, but the
screen remains blank. I am forced to do a cold reboot and watch fsck go
through its motions every time.
</P>
<P>
Any thoughts?
</P>
<P>
Thanks

<P>
The following is a message I posted last night on redhat.networking.general,
I thought I'd send it to you guys as well since you always seem to be able
to provide good answers...
</P>
<HR width="10%" align="center"><P>
I'm trying to set up a demand-dialed PPP link to my employer's LAN.  I've
got it mostly working, except for one thing. I'd like to be able to just do
'ifup ppp0' (or have it done at boot) and then be able to bring up the link
on demand. The problem is, I need to 'route add -net 172.18.0.0/16 ppp0' so
that traffic from my machine to and address on the work LAN brings up the
link (DNS is not an issue, I'll be accessing the machines by numeric IP
address). The route command has to be done after pppd has started and the
ppp0 interface exists, but before the link is actually dialed. None of the
'ipup-post' processing helps me, because it doesn't get executed until after
the link is dialed. It's sort of a chicken-and-egg problem, eh? If I do the
ifup and then the route commands manually, everything works beautifully. I
just need a way to automate it better.
</P>
<P>
Also, it would be nice to be able to make a few mods to my ipchains ruleset
when the ppp0 interface comes up, but that's easier to work around because I
<EM>can</EM> set an ipchains rule for an interface which isn't up yet.
</P>
<P>
If anyone has a nice elegant solution to this, please let me know.  By
elegant I mean better than throwing the route command in rc.local - that's
going to cause problems if I ifdown and later ifup the interface, because it
won't get executed again.
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, this is on RedHat 7.0 with all the latest updates (except
kernel 2.2.17 - haven't gotten around to that yet).  In addition to the ppp0
I have eth0 (home LAN) and eth1 (cablemodem internet, and the reason that
pppd's 'defaultroute' option doesn't help me either).
</P>
<P>
Thanks,
<br>Brian Smith

Hi.
</p><p>

I have been paying attention to your magazine and web site quite a bit in
the past couple of months and have learned from and enjoyed the
information.  If you ever want to publish an article on companies that are
running successfully on open-source and/or Linux we would embrace the
opporuntity to be featured.  We are a custom software development company
who run all Linux work stations (including Marketing/Sales, Operations,
Programmers, Art, Human Resources, etc).  We are also dependent on Linux
for our servers, network, etc.  We have even gone as far as developing apps
internally that have proven to be very useful.
</p><p>

Have you thought of doing a monthly profile (like a quarter page column) on
companies that run mostly or all Linux products?  You could just build a
Q&A and companies could fill in the blanks.  i.e. "What desktop programs do
you use?" (or) "What are the biggest benefits/problems you've encountered?"
-- Just an idea.
</p><p>

I look forward to hearing from you.  Keep up the great work.
</p><p>

Regards, 
<br>Trent M. Carlyle

It's our practice to be cocky <EM>and</EM> to give people useful answers, if they

The "Answer Gang" column has become a tradition in our magazine and we have

in the Linux Documentation Project HOWTOs (<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org"

if you want to stomp into the nearest Techy Bar and see if the alpha geek

In the latest issue of The Linux Gazette, the following appeared:
</P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
[Heather] Well, then, keep an eye on the Progeny project - Ian Murdoch himself and a handful of trusted friends, are working on putting together a new debian based distro which is really aimed at desktop users &gt;more than the server and hardcore-linuxer crowd, yet is aware of the "standard" debian project enough to &gt;allow a smooth transition.
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P>
[Bruce Byfield, Director of Marketing and Communications,
Progeny Linux Systems]
<BR>
I wanted to mention that appearances are deceiving. In many ways,
Progeny <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> has taken on an 
unexpected life of its own, with many
features for the desktop market. However, that's only what everyone
is seeing right now.
</P>
<P>
In the long term, Progeny Debian is the foundation for Progeny's
Linux NOW (Network of Workstations) project, and therefore aimed
squarely at the server market.
</P>
<P>
Not that I'm complaining, you understand. Any coverage is good
coverage, and all that. However, because Progeny Debian is the first
Progeny project that will released, people are getting a distorted
view of what the company is about, and we don't want anyone to feel
that Progeny is misrepresenting itself.
</P>



<!-- end 2 -->

<HR WIDTH="40%" ALIGN="center">

<blockquote>
<P>
So the "Linux NOW" will be a clustering project, while the present
"Progeny Debian" is the side effect of work on a good installer system
for the project overall?  (just want to make sure that when I'm updating
my view of it, I'm getting it right this time.)
</P>
</blockquote>
<P>
Yes, you're basically right. That's not to say that desktop
refinements won't be added, but Progeny plans to be more of a
provider of services than a seller of software.
</P>
<P>
However, maybe I should add that, in the strictest sense, Linux NOW
isn't a clustering project. Although it could loosely be called
that, Progeny is avoiding the term to prevent misunderstandings (to
say nothing of criticisms). Instead, it's being called a network of
workstations or a networking computer solution. I suspect, though,
that it would be a welcome edition to a clustering solution.
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>
Thank you very much for correcting us in this regard.  I do like what I
am seeing and I suspect that when you roll out the big guns on the server
issues that a lot of netadmins will also be very happy with it. -- Heather

Hello,
</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000066"><EM>
What do I do ??
</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<blockquote>
<P><STRONG> [Heather]
Well, the startx text results from booting it under the other kernel, may
give you an idea of some features to actually declare in your XF86Config file.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Look
especially at the things that start with two dashes since those are things
it decides on its own.  If you succeed at declaring these in your config, the
server should boot up the same way on 2.2.16 but the same features will
change to being marked with two stars.  Then you can try it under the new kernel
and see if it straightens up and flies right.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I note that you may have a particularly old i810 server anyway, since
XFCOM are the Xfree Compatible series, and according to 
<A HREF="http://www.xfree86.org"
	>http://www.xfree86.org</A>
the i810 is among their source tree.  Defaulting to not building it, but
it's in there 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">  So a smarter i810 
server for 3.3.6 might be available from your
distro vendor's updates area.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Xfree86 4 is reported to work with the i810's as well.  The readme for
its 810 support mentions that the Tyan Tomcat and some settop box
(HappyPC)
also work.  That server includes the ability to declare a few features
(such as the DAC) if they get misdetected or just missed.  Switching from
X 3.3.x to X 4 has been very happy for some, tweaky for others, so I have
to leave that possibility up to you.
</STRONG></P>
</blockquote>
<P>
I figured out that I have to do some serious reading ( the kernel docs and
the
XFree86 docs , etc.) and then I will be more prepared to try out
the tweakings you mentioned above ( specially the first suggestion ).
Good thing I will learn a lot that way.
</P>
<P>
Last but not the least , I must say a big  <EM>Thanks</EM>  to You
for carrying on the 'conversation' .
I learnt a lot from you, specially how to go to the
heart of the problem.
Thanks again.
</P>
<P>
Here I dive into the  Docs . . . .
</P>
<P>
Bye!

Thank you for your site. I found what I needed, very easily, and
quickly about my Linksys Ether16 LAN Card. The Linksys web site
was useless in comparison.

You are also "not too in tune" with ethics. You're also not too bright,

<P>
Thank you for your quick response to my upgrade problems. After my two
experiences with  upgrades, your suggestion fills the bill on that
situation. Don't upgrade, do a new installation. Especially with the
hard drive resources and partitioning program available to work with.
</P>
<P>
Using Partition Magic for Linux, I created a fresh 10GB hard drive with
anly unallocated space on it and used PM to copy the 6.1 installation to
it and now have a 7.0 updrade on my other disk. Just as soon as I am
happy with RH 7.0. I will run a complete new install on the 10gig disk.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the big disk was to allow me to experiment with different
distributions and new kernels.
</P>
<P>
Your opinion is well valued and my experience bears out what you
suggested.
</P>
<P>
Many thanks to you and the Answer Gang and the many hours of enjoyable
reading and learning gained from the Linux Gazzette each month. It's
nice to have people  like you willing to share your knowledge and
experience with us.
</P>
<blockquote>
&lt;Smile&gt; Glad I could help, Bob. As far as I'm concerned, a well-documented
story of things going wrong can be quite valuable; it may save someone
else the trouble of trying the same route. Thanks for writing.

Why the big fuss ?? I downloaded the 2.4 kernel untarred it in <TT>/usr/src</TT>
symlinked it to linux configured and compiled it &amp; have been using it
for some time with no apparent problems. I use <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> 7.0 pro on a 433celeron.
Must admit I have not tried it on my other machine (a 233 cyrix)with
redhat caldera,windows &amp; turbolinux installed.(My apologies I did upgrade
modutils and several other utilities first) Cheers

I finally came up with a much clearer way of expressing it, as a thread
on a similar vein came through the debian-laptops mailing list:
</P>
<P>
According to the fellow who berated The Answer Gang about this (suggesting
NOT moving around the include link -- Thanks Michal!) ... as passed through 
my tiny little "not a kernel hacker" brain ... the idea is that glibc has a 
certain set of the headers which it sort of generically expects to use 
when compiling userland apps.
</P>
<P>
Whereas the one inside the real linux sources is desperately needed to be
from the kernel sources, when compiling the kernel itself.  (Duh 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> )
</P>
<P>
The problem we keep running into is with apps that "cross the blood/brain
barrier" ... pcmcia as a <EM>prime</EM> example ... it probably would greatly
prefer the "real" includes.  But, you can't just <EM>move</EM> them -- 
most userland apps prefer the fakes!  Er... older versions.  The versions
that were there when glibc was itself built.  They're not at all fake. 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</P>
<P>
Worse, when we start hopping entire kernel versions, or if you are someone
who is developing kernel modules yourself.  Newer versions have a link in
<TT>/lib/modules</TT> called 'build' that says where it got its sources from, so that
something smart can be done, however, I have no idea if gcc does The Right
Thing with that yet.
</P>
<P>
Until then, in the debian distribution at least, <TT>/usr/include/linux</TT> contains
its <EM>own</EM> copy of headers for userland compiles.  Their docs for the libc6
package explain clearly to use:
</P>
<blockquote><code>
gcc -I/usr/src/linux-X.Y.Z/include  ...
</code></blockquote>
<p>
...if you really need the headers from a specific kernel.
</P>
<P>
All this doesn't really help a poor user decide, but I hope it makes a lot
more sense to you folks now.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who works in this magic at a deeper level is certainly welcome to
chime in and improve our view of Linux physics.  Send that techy stuff to
<A HREF="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net"
	>tag@lists.linuxgazette.net</A> so the whole Gang can see it.
