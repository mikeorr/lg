One of the points of going to such conventions is to meet people.
</p>

<p>
I met faces that were only familiar from photographs--our editor
and our TAG editor. Indeed, I met Ben and Kat on Day 2. That was
really great but we could not chat much given the tempo of talks and
so on.
</p>

<p>
Part of the adventure of getting to Scale5x was exactly that--getting
there. I had decided that since it was only myself that was being
transported---no other people and no equipment--it was time to be
environment-friendly and use Public Transportation. "Public Transportation
in LA? You must be kidding!" At least that was the response of many people
I talked to. In the end, the journey by bus and metro was rather easy. It
was long but far from boring. I had some mathematics to keep me company, but
there was all the different kinds of LA that one can only see while riding
in a bus.
</p>

<p>
I have not been to many FOSS meetings in the past--preferring to be a
mailing list person. However, one thing that one notices is that there
is surge of companies coming to these meetings nowadays. The technical
content of the talks was also rather low--perhaps this why it was
called "Expo" and not "DevConf". However, most of the talks which I
attended were well-prepared and useful.
</p>

<p>
All in all a great experience. Since it was Kat who pointed out in
her posting to TAG that "scale5x" was happening just in my temporary
neighbourhood, a big thank you to her as well.

You're welcome, Kapil! 
</p>

<p>
I'm sorry things were so hectic that we didn't get time, and I'd like to
see if we can squeeeeze in something before Ben and I take off back
east.
</p>

<p>
Thank you so much for you conreports!
</p>

<p>
Waving hello as well to the LG folk we managed to run into, and regrets
that we didn't manage to meet everyone, and that others were unable to
make it.  SCaLE is a great little event, and it was a great place to get
the word out about LG. Stay tuned for news about all things resulting
from our participation there!
