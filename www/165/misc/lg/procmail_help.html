Dear Mr. James T. Dennis,
</p>

<p>
I read of your article on the web "The Answer Guy" and I think you can
help me with my application.
</p>

<p>
I need help to write a program to sort out of some of my e-mail and auto
response to buttons " accept" or "decline". I am not a dot generation
and it will require too much efforts to start from the beginning. I am
asking some one will write the application for me for a
fee(appreciation). Can you help? Or, can you assign someone else to
help? I use the regular hotmail in the window environment.
</p>

<p>
Regards,
</p>

<p>
Terry Tung
</p>

&gt; Dear Mr. James T. Dennis,

<p>
Ah -- is this the vague call of desperation?   Clearly, despite your
call for paid help, you've not even bothered to read up on that's
happening at the linuxgazette within recent times.  James Dennis is,
unfortunately, no longer around here at LG.

<p>
Then you're screwed, and furthermore, clearly don't understand the
point of procmail, either.
</p>

<p>
That being said -- humour us a little, and be more specific -- this
"clicking buttons blah blah" stuff means nothing -- *no one* trying to
follow this is going to have a clue as to what you're talking about,
let alone risk the possibility of trying to take on the vague offer of
paid work if you don't even bother to put some level of thought and
appreciation to what you're wanting; and hence potentially asking of
others.

[ Reinstating tag@... don't cull the damn Cc list, please. ]

&gt; Dear Mr. Thomas Adam,
&gt; Starting with an apology, I did not mean to offend any one. I am not a
&gt; person in the circle of your society. I just happened to read about "the
&gt; answer guy" on the web about auto response to the e-mail and thought of my
&gt; application. That's the reason, I wrote the first e-mail to make the
&gt; request. Long time ago I was able to write Fortran programming and I worked
&gt; at the computer center when I was in my graduate school at Ole Miss in the
&gt; early 70's. But I am not in the programming society any more. If you will,
&gt; maybe you can point me to some direction to do some read and do some simple
&gt; application in the auto response to e-mail for me. Thank you again.
</pre>

<p>
So you're after an autoresponder?  Something like the classic
"vacation" program found on Unix (and later Linux?)  My advice:  don't
bother.  They're a <strong>real</strong> nusiance on things like mailing lists.   And
before anyone chimes in and says:  "But you can configure $FOO not to
send to $BAR" -- yes, you can, but the clueless <strong>never</strong> do.
</p>

<p>
Google it is for you then, Tung.
</p>

The nice person still culled the Cc list.  I'm done playing with him;
he's useless.

Dear Mr. Thomas Adam,
No, not for vacation. It is for answering acceptance to "e-mail
blast", or broadcasting offers to many recipients. In order to be the
first one to accept an e-mail offering of some work opportunities thru
e-mail blast, I want to be able to accept the work automatically.
Therefore, I would not be beaten out by others. Thank you for you
thoughts and your time.
</p>

<p>

</p>
