<p><strong>From Carlos Javier Castro Pe\qa on Fri, 03 Jul 1998 

Hi,
<br><br>

I have been looking for an answer for my question for a long time,
but I could find no useful solution. I am building a Linux LAN and I
cannot send mail with <tt>sendmail</tt> ! I do not have a DNS server.  I have
found a lot of people with the same problem and no answer.
<br><br>

I am using Red Hat 5 with the version of sendmail distributed by
them.  My kernel 2.0.33 and networking enabled. The mails don't get
delivered because a 'hostname lookup failure'. The manual of Red Hat
5 says how to configure <tt>sendmail</tt>, but that does not work if you
don't have a DNS server. I was also suggested to change the
<tt>/etc/nsswitch.conf</tt> file, but it didn't work. Can you help me,
please?
<br><br>

Regards, javier

	I understand your problem and feel your pain.
<br><br>

	The problem is that '<tt>sendmail</tt>' is conforming to the 
	SMTP standards --- which require that it look up the 
	MX record for any host prior to sending mail to it.
<br><br>

	This sort of record (MX) can only be served over DNS (there
	isn't any way that I know of to mark an <tt>/etc/hosts</tt> entry as an
	"MX" record) (There might be some weird NIS or NIS+ way to do it
	-- but I don't know much about those protocols).
<br><br>

	I've worked around that here at my house (I don't run DNS
	internally --- I just point to a caching DNS server on my
	gateway router (a Linux box doing masquerading for 
	<strong>external</strong> references).
<br><br>

	Internally I just use a mailertable that relays all mail from my
	systems to the mail router (which then spools them out over
	uucp).  That mailertable refers to the gateway system using its
	IP address (which forces <tt>sendmail</tt> to skip the DNS MX query).  On
	another system I just use uucp over TCP (for outgoing mail) and
	POP (for incoming).
<br><br>

	It would be much easier for me to set up DNS and leave it at
	that -- but I can be incredibly stubborn sometimes and my main
	mail feed is over uucp in any event --- so it's just as easy to
	use that internally.
<br><br>

	The reason modifying your <tt>/etc/nsswitch.conf</tt> (or 
	<tt>/etc/host.conf</tt>
	--- as it's usually done under the Linux resolvers) doesn't work
	for <tt>sendmail</tt> --- but does work for normal programs using other
	protocols is that other protocols are normally only interested
	in address and reverse address records (using the
	<tt>gethostbyname()</tt> and 
	<tt>gethostbyadd()</tt> library calls).  '<tt>sendmail</tt>'
	is looking for MX records since it is common to require special
	routing for mail.
<br><br>

	As I said --- the easiest solution is to create a local DNS
	domain or subdomain for yourself. For example I'd create the
	<tt>lan.starshine.org</tt> domain and name my local systems things like
	<tt>antares.lan.starshine.org</tt> etc.  This would allow me to set up an
	"authoritive" set of records on my internal LAN and still defer
	to my ISP for the virtually hosted <tt>www.starshine.org</tt>
	<tt>ftp.starshine.org</tt>, and <tt>mail.starshine.org</tt> (I'd 
	list myself as an
	"unregistered secondary" to my ISP's nameservers for the
	<tt>starshine.org</tt> zone).
<br><br>

	(I could also just copy his records into my own db and
	essentially <strong>lie</strong> to my system about being 
	authoritative for the
	whole zone.  This would break any time my ISP changed any of my
	publicly accessible address records --- but that would probably
	only be a minor issue.  It would only affect my systems while
	they were resolving my virtual hosts.  My ISP would never refer
	to my name servers as authorities or secondaries --- and I could
	use IPFW (now IPChains) to prevent any such requests from
	getting through to my internal nameserver in any event).
<br><br>

	The point is that SMTP (the mail transport protocol to which
	sendmail defaults) relies on DNS --- and it is not trivial to
	get SMTP working with DNS disabled.  You can use a different
	transport protocol (such as I do with uucp) or you can configure
	your systems to use direct IP addresses rather than names
	in their configuration files.   This last option isn't so
	bad if your plan is to set up masquerading and null clients
	(a sort of sendmail client that forward <strong>all</strong> of its mail
	to a hub, even the local addressed items -- and lets the 
	hub deal with it).
<br><br>

	Naturally I'm glossing over the details here.  I have the
	<a href="http://www.ora.com/">O'Reilly</a> 
	'sendmail' and 'DNS & BIND' books here at my side
	--- and I have the notes from a week long seminar I took
	on these topics (Robert Harker --- 
	<A HREF="http://www.harker.com">http://www.harker.com</A>)
	--- which are also about 1000 pages.  It is basically 
	impossible to comprehensively explain DNS and <tt>sendmail</tt> in
	this column, or on the newsgroups and mailing lists.
<br><br>

	I hope though that this helps.  If you like I'll post
	(sanitized) copies of my <tt>sendmail.mc</tt> files and my 
	uucp configuration files to show a couple of examples of
	how I do it --- with the warning that my configuration is
	uniquely atypical!

Dennis,
</strong></p>

<p><strong>
Thank you for your answer. Maybe the most important thing is that
you let me know that I cannot use sendmail for my purpouses wihthout
a DNS server. If I knew that from the beginning, I would have spared
a lot of time trying different configurations. If you don't mind,
I'll post your answer in some Linux mailing lists, because a lot of
people has the same question, and there is no usefull answer.

	I hope it helps.  I don't get into the newsgroups as much

	I start by reading and lurking.  When I've read for a few

	I start to recognize the common questions, and start to piece

	For a few months I'll answer questions in the NG or ML.  Eventually,

	That turns out to have been good experience for answering

Is it possible to make that sendmail uses IP addresses. I need to
forward the mail of the Linux host, to the Linux gateway. The users
of the Linux host can download the mail from the gateway with POP
and IMAP.

<pre>
divert(-1)
divert(0)dnl
VERSIONID(`@(#)clientproto.mc	8.7 (Berkeley) 3/23/96')

OSTYPE(linux)
FEATURE(nullclient, `[192.168.1.1]')

	... replacing the IP address with the one for your 
	smart hub or gateway.  You use the m4 package (also 
	include with all recent versions of sendmail) to generate 
	a cf file from this using a command like:

<blockquote><blockquote><code>
		m4 ../m4/cf.m4 betel.mc &gt; /etc/sendmail.cf
</code></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote>
	(after making backups of your existing cf file, of course).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	The important thing is that is will define a line like:
</blockquote>

<pre>
DM[192.168.64.1.1]
</pre>

<blockquote>
	... which should prevent '<tt>sendmail</tt>' from using DNS to 
	do any resolution.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	Try that and see if it works.  I really can't set up a test
	environment for that at the moment.  If that doesn't work, try
	changing the address to an arbitrary name, adding the
	"mailertable" <tt>FEATURE</tt> and creating a small mailertable that
	points the name at the IP address using the syntax:
</blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><code>
		myhub:	smtp:[192.168.1.1]

<blockquote>
	Please let me know how it goes.
