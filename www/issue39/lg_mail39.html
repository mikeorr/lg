Subject: <font color="navy">Intel NIC</font>
<P>
I have a problem while I am trying to implement firewall on a Linux box.
Problem is that I have installed two Intel NIC's in the system and gave
them two IPs with the same subnet, when I ping them from the other
machines both of them reply but when I ping to each other they don't.
What could be the reason?
Thanks

Subject: <font color="navy">Does Linux like WINS?</font>
<P> 
Hello all.  Now that my network card is working, I am trying to connect my
Linux box (Red Hat 5.2, kernel 2.0.36-0.7) to my Windows network.  After
some struggling, the Linux machine now appears and is accessible in the
Network Neighborhoods of all my Win 9x/NT4 workstations.  Furthermore, I can
ping and telnet from each workstation to the Linux server by its host name
(WHL31) and by its static IP address (192.168.34.6).
<P>
However, I can only ping from the Linux box to the workstations by their
respective IP address.  Since the workstations receive IP addresses
dynamically from the DHCP service on my NT3.51 server, I cannot simply add
the host names for all workstations to /etc/hosts.  Therefore, my NT3.51
server (192.168.34.1) also acts as the WINS server for my network.  I have
configured Samba (1.9.18p10) with the following entries in /etc/smb.conf:
<PRE>
wins server = 192.168.34.1
name resolve order = wins hosts lmhosts bcast
</PRE>
but the Linux machine does not seem to be querying the WINS database.
<P>
What am I missing here?  Is there another way to direct Linux to the WINS
database?  I was hoping to try things this way first, before trying to set
up the Linux server as the WINS and/or DNS-caching server for my network.
<P>
Thank you for your attention in this matter.  Any suggestions and ideas
would be most welcome.  However, please bear in mind that I am not very
network savvy.  For that matter, I'm also do not have any formal IS
training.
<P>
Regards,

Subject: <font color="navy">Linux to Netware Problem</font>
<P>
   Hi, I liked your zine very much. 
   I'm mailing you, because it appears that no one knows how to solve my
problem ( at least here, in Brazil).
   The problem appears when I try to connect ( dialing ) to my ISP, that is
a Novell Netware. Look at the logs.
<P>
	First, I tried to connect with minicom :
<PRE>
CONNECT 33600/ARQ/V34/LAPM/V42BIS
</PRE>
[ after some time: ]
<PRE>
Connected to NetWare CONNECT 2.0.30 Service Selector on port AIO_111913000.

Sorry, there are no services available at this time.
</PRE>
     Ok, I thought. Minicom is not the best way to connect. So, someone
said that connecting with pppd would be the solution. The result was the
same. Then, I read about ezppp in one home page that said it works works
with Win NT. The result was the same. My modem is an USR Sportster 33.6 -
Slack 3.5 and I can connect normally in other ISPs.
<P>
    Would you know the solution ? If so, please help-me.
  Thanks,
<P>

mount the then hda2 hda5 etc as Linux it would corrupt the files on reboot or
shutdown with an error message such as can't find fs signature.  I have
subsequently purchased a replacement primary drive and have changed the
settings in the bios to reflect LBA for the Segate so as you can see the CHS is
re-interpreted as CHS 523/255/63 but that is showing an error.

I've searched high and low for info on how to do this - something like an nbtstat on a win32 box from a UNIX server.
I just need a way to allow a Linux server to retrieve the user name that a win9x / NT user is logged in to a hot-desking machine with.
<P>
So if I log in to a Win95 box as fubaruser / password, then try and open a local intranet page on the Linux server, it will allow me to log in with my own personal profile for the intranet site -  and this profile will follow me from Win9x machine to Win9x machine.
Because of the unclean nature of these machines, and the multiplicity of browsers in use, cookies are impractical.

Does anyone know if it is possible to do file sharing over a simple

into a RS232 modem, and a null modem cable.  Sounds good so far...
<P>
Getting netatalk to use the serial connection instead of the Ethernet
one was another issue... SuSE 5.2-6.0 doesn't include slattach and the
HOWTOs claim that's what I need.

This machine is a Mac Plus and it really really needs some storage
space. It would be an awesome client otherwise; I should be able to
run MacTCP, Eudora and Mosaic!  Except... I can't LOAD them on the
machine without some sort of networking.  Incompatible floppies, you
know.
<P>
Any ideas?  I've also read the netatalk HOWTO and it says "First you
need TCP/IP running" and doesn't seem to include the thought of a
SERIAL connection.

Subject: <font color="navy">What is a *.ajr file?</font>
<P>
I had kind of forgotten that your message about issue #38 had come in
via email.  So last night (on my desktop computer), I went over to you
home page and found the "Linux Gazette Downloading Information" section,
pointed at the "here" in "Linux Gazette can be downloaded by clicking
here" and went to download issue #38.  As my pointer went over the
"here", my status line (in Netscape) indicated that I would be
downloading "ftp://ftp.ssc.com/pub/lg/lg-issue38.tar.gz".  But when I
clicked on the "here" and the dialog box game up for me to decide where
I wanted to put the file, the file name was "lg-issue38_tar.arj".  (I
should have said earlier that I use Win98/Netscapte on my desktop.)  And
that is exactly what I downloaded; a "ajr" file.
<P>
Supper was on the table, so I left it as that and (later) sat in the
bedroom (with my laptop that has the same combination of software) and
(since I still hadn't read you issue) downloaded another copy of the
issue.  That copy was downloaded as a 'gz' file which I then
decompressed, stored and read.  It didn't come to me that (earlier) I
had downloaded a 'ajr' file before.  Now this morning, using the deaktop
computer, I downloaded another copy and that copy was (again) a 'ajr'
file.
<P>
What is a 'ajr' compressed file?  Do you have any idea why (with my
desktop computer) I download a 'ajr' file but with my laptop, download a
'gz' file.  I really don't think that I have made some 'silly' mistake
or that I have different versions of the OS or Netscape (as far as I can
remember, both machines were derived from the same CD/disk file (Win98
from the CD; Netscape from a downloaded installation file).
<P>
I just started to download the base files (from the next 'here' in the
web page) and the same thing happened again.  The status bar for
Netscape indicated that I would be accessing a 'gz' file, but the
'Download To' dialog file indicated that I would be receiving a 'ajr'
file.
<P>
I've been around computers and the Internet long enough that I am
considered an 'expert'.  But this one kind of flips me out.

<P>
My fdisk (Debian 1.3) does not recognize my SCSI drive correctly. I'm using
a Future Domain TMC8xx card using the ST01 setting in the kernel config,
this is fine on my current small SCSI drives, but I'm wanting to replace
these with a couple of HP C2247's.
<P>
When running fdisk the initial message (and also at boot time) is showing
>64 heads, but fdisk will only allow me to set 64 heads.
<P>
How can I create a partition to use all of the disk ?
<P>
Is this a limitation of fdisk, the kernel or the SCSI card ?
Thanks

<P>
Being a complete newbie where Linux is concerned and working for a company
that has few Unix servers running WINS and DHCP and hosting a few websites.
I was asked if I would be interested in learning Unix to cover sysadmin.  I
jumped at the chance, although the training is not for a few months I
decided to ditch my win98 system at home and go head long into a Linux
install(Red Hat 5.1)
<P>
It has taken me all weekend to get it up and running, with the X Window
System configured, now this is not a long time as I like to read all the
instructions, learn from past mistakes and many hair pulling moments that
manuals and HOWTOs and FAQ are there for a reason.  My next step along the
Linux path is to get my modem working............It's a winmodem so I appear
to be stuck, I do not really want to spend any more money on a modem; is
there anyway I can get a winmodem (internal) to work under Linux, I read somewhere
this is not possible as the CPU does most of the modem's work (driven by
software.
<P>
Can anyone point me in the direction of any info on getting winmodems to
work under Linux?
Thanks,
<P>

<P>
I've only just discovered your site, and it looks very useful.
<P>
A decent collection of how to set up and use a DAT drive with Linux would
have made my life a lot easier recently. There are bits about it all over
the place, but they really are all over the place.
<P>
I'd like to be able to centrally administer my Linux boxes (we now have 6 in
the office). The boxes are used for file serving, mail, and anything else to
software development (we've got about 10 engineers here). I know that one
way of centrally administering Unix is to centralize the /usr partition and
NFS mount it. It doesn't look like RPM will allow that very easily. I don't
need to be able to boot via the network, but it would be useful to have a
more centralized system, than a whole bunch of boxes that have to be updated
with every new fix or application to be added. Do you have any
ideas/inspiration on this?

I recently bought a copy of partition magic 4.  I used it to steal more
space from windows and add it to my / ext2 partition .... apparently it
resized the partition but not the file system.  Is there any way I can tell
the file system to non-destructively rebuild itself using more space?

Subject: <font color="navy">Own domain over part-time dial-up (article, issue 36)</font>
<P>
Interesting article.  Just a couple of comments about the script:
<P>
First, the comment "for some reason this didn't work".  It's not altogether
clear what you expected it to do, but the exit 0 is entirely superfluous.
If you hoped to exit from the entire script, this cannot be done from within
a sub-shell.  Is there any reason for executing such a phenomenal number of
sub-shells?  It is not as if you are doing the sorts of things which
sub-shells make easier, such as localizing changes to the environment or to
the current working directory.
<P>
If one assumes that really you wanted to exit from your script here, then
you would be better off writing:
<PRE>
  if [ -f /var/lock/LCK..modem ] ; then
    echo "modem not available" 1>&2  # redirect stdout to stderr
    exit 1                           # error exits should not exit 0
  else
    /etc/ppp/ppp-on
    sleep 45
  fi
</PRE>
Second, test -e is bash-specific syntax.  The habitual use of bash-specific
syntax results in scripts that are non-portable.  All versions of test (and
of /bin/sh that have test as an in-built) that I know of support test -f;
this is standard syntax for this operation.  For example, HP-UX /bin/sh
does, as it happens, support test -e, but on Solaris this doesn't work.  For
/bin/ksh the situation is reversed, with the Solaris version accepting test
-e but the HP-UX version not.  All Linux distributions come with a /bin/sh
(sometimes just a symlink to /bin/bash), so better to use /bin/sh for shell
programming, as per Unix convention, and to stick to the standard part of
the shell programming language.
<P>
It is not altogether clear whether you think that the line #!/bin/bash half
way down the script as the first line of a sub-shell section will have an
effect, but this could be confusing to a reader less familiar with shell
programming.
<P>

I am using Red Hat Linux 5.2. In FVWM95 I start Wharf. From this Wharf I click
at xterm icon I get a blank xterm window. This is because the person who wrote

 Now, what annoys me is how come such a big company would do something as stupid as this.

<P>
Am I just being obtuse, or does KDE feel like a heavy, bloated,
resource-intensive desktop environment?  If that's what I wanted, I
would stay with M(I'm sorry, I can't say the word)t. Features and
benefits be damned, FVWM2 comes real close to the type of responsiveness
I feel should be expected of the desktop ... KDE doesn't even come
close.
<P>
And WHY hasn't anyone else complained? At least, not in a forum that
I've been aware of.  Is it that everyone is so enamored of the
acceptance that Linux has been getting that they are afraid to rock the
boat?
<P>
On the other hand, I suppose that we (the Linux user community) feel
like we can pass this KDE thing off as a ready replacement for W(I'm
sorry, but I can't say that word, either)s, given that it is so slow and
bloated that W(you know)s users will feel right at home.
<P>
Yeah, that's the ticket, we'll make 'em feel right at home.
