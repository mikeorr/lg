<p>
<b></b><br />
<b>Fri, 27 Oct 2006 17:04:01 -0400</b>
</p>

<p>
Greetings,
</p>

<p>
I have Linux (2.6.15.6) booting from a USB drive.  My application is
machine control and I wanted to use something solid-state.  A USB stick
seemed like a good idea because it is cheap and readily available and
reasonably fast.
</p>

<p>
My problem is that I get file system corruption and "bad sectors" some
times, presumably due to an unclean shut down.  I am using an ext2
filesystem with the thinking that a journal would just wear out the
drive in a certain spot.  Maybe that's not correct -- I am not sure if
the drive has a wear-leveling algorithm implemented or not.
</p>

<p>
Questions:
</p>

<p>
1. Is ext2 the right choice?  Or would reiserfs be better? Vfat??
</p>

<p>
2. Is their a quick way to detect bad sectors?  I tried running e2fsck
-c but it has been 45 minutes so far!
</p>

<p>
I am thinking if I can detect the corruption, I can just reformat the
partition and restore it from another read-only partition.  The kernel
seems to report them:
<pre>
sd 5:0:0:0: SCSI error: return code = 0x08000002
sdb: Current: sense key=0x3
    ASC=0x11 ASCQ=0x0
end_request: I/O error, dev sdb, sector 598730
</pre>
I guess I could grep the messages log, but I don't think that is a
conclusive check.
</p>

<p>
Any pointers would be appreciated.
</p>

<p>
Flash-memory drives have some peculiar physical characteristics, and
choice of filesystem for them depends on whether you value multi-OS
compatibility (which suggests VFAT) or whether you value drive life and
even-ness of wear (which suggests JFFS2 or YAFFS).  Essentially, they
have a limited number of erase/write cycles per sector, and each sector
must be read, erased, and rewritten any time any data in the sector
changes.  The reasons why VFAT is bad for drive life, not to mention
atime updating, follow logically from that, and should be obvious.
</p>

<p>
I imagine that the wear resulting from ext2/ext3 or ReiserFS would be
absolutely excessive.

<p>
I imagine that the wear resulting from e2fsck would be absolutely
frightful, sorry to say.

                    something to them that we are missing. --Gamel Abdel Nasser

Rick, 
</p>

<p>
Thanks a lot for the help!  I will look into those other filesystems.
The other thing I forgot to mention is that if you write over that
sector again it seems to work.  So I don't think we are hitting the
10000 writes, but maybe not.  I wonder if it is possible that the drive
is marking a sector bad because it was in the middle of zeroing the
sector or something?
</p>

<p>
I do have the partitions mounted with noatime.  I think part of my
problem maybe that I am using sqlite which seems to want to sync
everything to disk all the time.  What I will probably end up with is
using a RAM disk and then syncing that to USB drive on a shutdown.
</p>

<p>
I'm thinking it smells a bit like borderline filesystem corruption,
e.g., a given sector has existing coherency problems, which get cured in
the act of going through an erase/rewrite cycle.  That might be just a
SWAG (silly wild-assed guess) on my part, of course.

<p>
I do think that sounds like a winner.  It's so tempting to just treat
these NAND flash-memory devices as if they were just tiny, electonic
hard disks, but that's really not quite the right model, as it turns
out.
