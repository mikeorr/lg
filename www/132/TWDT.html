Hi, all -
</p>

<p>
I've just put up an "LG projects" page (it's not yet linked anywhere);
please take a look at it, let me know what you think. I've found it
tremendously useful already for "externalizing" the project ideas I've
been carrying around in my head for a long time - now, I don't have to
remember all that stuff any more (whee!!!) <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<h3>Shoe string hosting</h3>

<p>
Or maybe the subject should read "I'm cheap, I want a host, but don't 
want to get ripped off and feel poorly about my choice".
</p>

<p>
Seriously, I've been looking at a bunch of low-cost hosting services. 
There are a whole bunch in the sub-$5.00 per month range ... and they 
all seem to be pretty much equal. Some of the review sites even give 
them decent ratings.
</p>

<p>
But, for everyone which a decent rating it's not hard to find a "never, 
ever use this host" review.
</p>

<p>
So, any of you folks using a cheap host you're happy with?
</p>

<p>
Oh, this is just for my personal stuff. I think I need less than 100meg 
storage and a few gig/month bandwidth. I can register my own domain, or 
get the free one included in most of the packages (is this a good/bad idea).
</p>

<p>
Hopefully someone has some experience to share.

&gt;  Another question: I've come across this after updating
&gt;  Debian testing: I seem to be loosing fonts, or at least
&gt;  the helvetica font I need for vncviewer and imagemagic:

&gt;  For example, "display image.jpg" gives me:

&gt; display: unable to load font

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  And vncviewer gives me this:

&gt; $ vncviewer wherever:2
&gt; VNC server supports protocol version 3.7 (viewer 3.3)
&gt; Password:

Mine certainly recognizes those patterns, and can match them from the
installed fonts (which is why, I suppose, I don't have that problem. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
If yours can't - and I suspect that this is what you'll find - then you
need to do a little investigative work to find out what's happening.
First, you'll need to find out what X considers your font directories:

<h3>Nokia tablet article</h3>

<b>Thu, 26 Oct 2006 10:11:15 -0700</b>
</p>

<p>
[For the Mailbag, regarding my Aug 9 letter about a Nokia tablet article.]
</p>

<p>
The more I looked into the Nokia Internet Tablet 770, the more I
became concerned about its speed, capacity, and cost of add-ons I
considered essential.  I finally ended up going to the dark side and
getting a Macintosh laptop. [1] So if anybody wants to do an article
on the Nokia or on Linux or Open Source use in palmtops in general,
we're looking for one.
</p>

<p>
[1] Well, it's not <strong>that</strong> dark, it's only twilight compared to a
certain other OS.  But it was strange reading a 6-page license
agreement when I hadn't used proprietary software for nine years.  And
I still use Linux at work. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<h3>FFMPEG Installation</h3>
<p>
<b>Suramya Tomar [suramya at suramya.com]</b><br />
<b>Tue, 10 Oct 2006 17:04:22 -0400</b>
</p>

<p>
Hey Everyone,
  Got the questions below via email and I was hoping one of you might 
have an answer for him (The stuff in brackets are my questions):
</p>

<p>
1. If /tmp partition is mounted with noexec and nosuid flags, is it not 
possible to run ./configure? If so how can we bypass this?
</p>

<p>
(I remember reading somewhere that mounting /tmp with noexec and nosuid 
is a good security precaution, but if it causes trouble with the 
./configure then is it worth it?)
</p>

<p>
2. How to modify (RPM - atrpms.net) installation of FFMPEG to include 
the amr_nb / amr_wb fixes in order for me to be able to convert 3GPP 
video to FLV.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for the help.

Please feel free to forward my e-mail to this group as it would be great 
to have a solution to this.

<h3>More suggestions on my perl app... And, an announcement!</h3>
<p>
<b>clarjon1 [clarjon1 at gmail.com]</b><br />
<b>Tue, 1 Aug 2006 20:50:57 -0400</b>

<p>
Hello, gang!
I've worked on my perl program a bit, and added stuff like command
line switches to it.  I've gotten it set up so that, if I don't enter
a switch, it will display the contents of the 'calendar' file, and if
there is a command line switch, it won't.  Nothing fancy...
</p>

<p>
I've attatched it, because I don't want to spend a lot of time
stripping out a lot of comments.  Hope you don't mind.  Here's what I
want to do (other than update the TODO in it):
</p>

<p>
1) More interactive:  Nothing like Ncurses, just something along the
lines of if I add my -A switch (for Add), and I don't specify any
input, that it will allow me to enter input rather than just add a
blank line.
2) Make it use arrays!  That is, be able to read arrays from disk.  Or
would I just be better off telling it to use postgres as a database?
Either way, I don't know what to do.
3) Make it able to search for a specific item, and/or sort by specific
items.  Very useful, dunno if it's worth the time and effort, really.
</p>

<p>
That's all I can think of at the moment.
</p>

<p>
Oh yeah, the announcement!
</p>

<p>
I'm going to Los Angeles, California on the 8th this month, to attend
the DCLA conference there.  I'm going to be in a plane on Monday!
Very nervous, I am.  I believe that we will be driving a 2hr drive
down to Toronto, Ontario, and then taking a flight from there all the
way to LA (hope I get a window seat!!)
</p>

<p>
Any LG people in LA?  Maybe we could meet (unlikely, but would be nice :D)
</p>

<p>
Apparently, the hotel is nearby the conference (a Hilton, I've heard)

<h3>Debian Installation</h3>
<p>
<b>Neil Youngman [ny at youngman.org.uk]</b><br />
<b>Sun, 1 Oct 2006 19:49:09 +0100</b>
</p>

<p>
Well I've had enough of the creeping bit rot in my Mepis installation and I 
want to be rid of Mepis. I'm trying to go back to a plain vanilla Debian 
installation. I've also recently upgraded my system with a SATA conroller and 
a 200GB hard disk, onto which I tried to install Debian with the Debian 3.1 
net installer.
</p>

<p>
The default install hung, so I went for the "expert" install and got an 
installation on the SATA disk. It's definitely there, I can see it, but I 
can't boot from it. 
</p>

<p>
It's on /dev/sda5, and grub loads the kernel up, but the kernel panics because 
as far as it's concerned /dev/sda5 doesn't exist. I can only assume that the 
kernel it has installed doesn't have the right module (SiI3112) installed for 
the SATA controller. 
</p>

<p>
Is there a way to check what modules are built into this kernel? 
</p>

<p>
Is there a simple way around this? 
</p>

<p>
Is it best just to build my own kernel to replace the one that has been 
installed? 
</p>

The weird thing is, it was Mailman that objected to your message and
held it for my manual approval, claiming that SpamAssassin had flagged
it as "possible spam" -- yet, as you can see, SA's score was 3.5, well
below the 4.0 spamicity threshold I set in SpamAssassin.  I'm not sure
what's going on <em>there</em>.
</p>

<p>
In any event, spamicity = 3.5 is eyebrow-raising enough in itself, so
let's see what all those failed tests in the X-Spam-Status line are:[1]

AWL:  Auto-WhiteList.  This is a simple "address or IP that has been

heard from recently a small boost to the maybe-distrust-this spamicity
score.

BAYES_00:  A "Bayesian" statistical test on the body text.  The "BAYES_00" 
result means that the Bayesian estimate of probability is that there's 
only a 0-1% likelihood of your post being spam, and that result actually
<em>reduces</em> the post's spamicity score.

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; Some news.
&gt; 
&gt; I suppose this was bound to happen sooner or later. Debian
&gt; maintainer's J. Jaspert and E. Bloch lost patience with J. Schilling
&gt; and have forked "cdrtools" to create cdrkit. Some details at
&gt; 
&gt; 	<a href="http://debburn.alioth.debian.org/FORK">http://debburn.alioth.debian.org/FORK</a> 
&gt; 
&gt; (The forked tar.gz can be found in <a href="http://debburn.alioth.debian.org/">http://debburn.alioth.debian.org/</a>).
&gt; Other reasons for the fork can be found on
&gt; <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cdrecord">http://bugs.debian.org/cdrecord</a> and on the Linux Kernel mailing lists.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Good for them <strong>and</strong> everyone else, I say. I've been struggling with (and
quietly cursing at) Joerg Schilling's DVD-writing software for a long
time. On the one hand, it's the only DVD-writer that I could get to work
on this strange DVD drive I have (Matshita DVD-RAM UJ-820S) - but it
would only let me write at 1x due to nothing more than some strange
conceit of the author's. As I recall from his explanation on a web page,
he had decided that the Linux /dev implementation sucks, and until it
was rewritten to be more like that of BSD, he wouldn't do anything to
make 'cdrecord' work reasonably. Elsewhere, in every instance that I've
seen him involved in a discussion about any technical issue, I was
struck by his inflexibility ("bull-headedness" would be too strong of a
term, since he is highly technically competent, but the stubborn refusal
to even consider any viewpoint other than his own was... less than
admirable.)
</p>

<p>
Now, according to the Debian bunch, he's exhibiting that same kind of
intransigence and blind adherence in an area which is clearly not his
strong point - licensing issues. [shrug] His right as the author, of
course... but this is exactly the reason that forking is such a useful
method. This is, in my opinion, as good as Open Source gets.
</p>

monster in QuakeII is called 'Jorg'? I'm just sayin'. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">))

<h3>navigation using ubuntu</h3>

&gt; Hi Ben
&gt; I've started using Ubuntu which is so great compared to Windoze and if I
&gt; can manage to run some navigational software I could eliminate Windoze
&gt; altogether. (It would be like getting rid of an abcessed tooth). Any
&gt; ideas? Will Wine run Nobeltec? Or do you know of any Nav software
&gt; available in open source?
</pre>
</p>

<p>
I've actually posted about this on the 'origamiboats' list a while back,
but I'll repeat it and expand on it a bit. If you don't mind, I'm also
going to CC this exchange to The Answer Gang at the Linux Gazette; this
is actually a question that I get asked on a regular basis by other
sailors who use Linux, and I believe a number of people could benefit
from the answer.
</p>

<p>
I've checked out a number of programs intended for navigational use
under Linux; all of these have been useful to some degree, and some,
like SeeMyDEnc (<a href="http://www.sevencs.com/index.php?page=123">http://www.sevencs.com/index.php?page=123</a>) are becoming
more and more useful day by day, as NOAA and other chart-producing
agencies convert more and more of their charts to the S-57 and other
modern charting formats; in fact, S-57 charts and viewers have become so
good that they are now treated as a legal equivalent of paper charts in
commercial shipping regulations (!). These converted charts,
incidentally, are available free of charge at
<a href="http://chartmaker.ncd.noaa.gov/">http://chartmaker.ncd.noaa.gov/</a> - a service that's worth thousands of
dollars to cruisers, given the average cost of paper charts.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, the two programs that I use most of all in my navigation are
'xtide' and Mayko's 'mxmap'; the former shows a list of currents and
tides for any location in the world, while the latter is a very
featureful chart viewer. 'mxmap' reads BSB charts, does GPS tracking,
allows you to construct/follow routes, set markers, "scribble" on the
charts, and do lots of other goodies. It also allows you to use, e.g., a
scan of a map or a chart - you just set the lat/long of diagonally
opposing corners, and away you go.
</p>

<p>
The only problem with 'mxmap' is that it is unmaintained; the developers
(Mayko), as far as anyone seems able to tell, have disappeared off the
face of the earth leaving us with this really nice piece of software.
Maybe they went cruising. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
Since Ubuntu is Debian-based, you should be able to install 'xtide' via
the standard installation mechanism ('apt-get install xtide' as root);
"xmap" can be found at <a href="http://fresh.t-systems-sfr.com/linux/src/">http://fresh.t-systems-sfr.com/linux/src/</a> (look
for three files with 'xmap' in the name - one of them is a bunch of
sample maps, the other two are static and dynamic versions of the
program.)

<h3>mass-editing MP3s</h3>
<p>
<b>Faber J. Fedor [faber at linuxnj.com]</b><br />
<b>Wed, 6 Sep 2006 11:11:07 -0400</b>
</p>

<p>
<p class="editorial">
 Ben's response to this question was published as
<a href="../131/lg_tips.html#2-cent-tips.05">http://linuxgazette.net/131/lg_tips.html#2-cent-tips.05</a> --Kat 
</p>

Does anyone know of an app/script that will automagically set ID3 tags
in my MP3s files using freedb?
</p>

<p>
I got one of those pod thingies that are so popular with the kids these
days and discovered that quite a few of my MP3s don't have ID3 tags on
them.  I have no idea how that happened since I've ripped every CD with
grip (which means my MP3s directory hierarchy follow the standard format
of artist/album/song.mp3). 
</p>

<p>
Googling "mass edit mp3s" brings up mostly Windows apps. I gather most
of those will let me makes changes to ID3 tags across a group of MP3s
(say changing "Bush, Kate" to "Kate Bush" en masse) as opposed to what I
want (look up the info on freedb and apply that info to the MP3s).
</p>

<p>
I did come across something on IBM Developer Works that uses a couple of
Perl modules (we now have Ben's attention!) and freedb but I couldn't
get it to work properly, meaning a) I couldn't understand the docs and
b) I couldn't redirect the output to a file to see wtf it was doing.
</p>

<p>
Since I don't want to rip and encode all of those CDs again, I'll
happily roll my own, but I thought I'd check with you guys to see if
I've missed an existing solution.

<h3>gmail setup</h3>

<p>
Hi All,
</p>

<p>
I'm getting lots of bounce notices regarding incoming mail from gmail.
I'm baffled.  Would this be generated by <em>my</em> host?
</p>

<p>
1) I'm popping with fetchmail.
</p>

<p>
2) Due to postfix (yuck) sending mail to the bit-bucket, I've tried
bypassing it and specifying procmail as the mda in .fetchmailrc.
</p>

<p>
I don't understand why it cites failure to establish an smtp connection
with jkarns at localhost:
</p>

<p>
   TEMP_FAILURE: Could not initiate SMTP conversation with any hosts:
   [localhost (1): Connection refused]
</p>

<p>
It would make a little more sense to me to see msgs like this being
generated by postfix on my host, but don't see what POPping from gmail
should be related in any way to an smtp connection.
</p>

<p>
Any suggestions / help much appreciated.
</p>

</p>

<p>
For 2.6.17-rc1 upwards you should try out "uswsusp" which tries to
sort out problems with prior suspend(s).
</p>

<p>
My current situation is quite happy vis-a-vis both suspend to disk
suspend to ram. I use the "stock" Debian linux-image-2.6.17-2-686
(version 2.6.17-8) and initramfs-tools (version 0.77b) with
aforementioned uswsusp (0.2-3).
</p>

<p>
Everything "works" out of the box except for a minor hiccough with
suspend-to-ram which required some hacking as follows. 
<pre>
	a. Save current device config to disk 
		cat /proc/bus/pci/00/02.0 &gt; /var/lib/acpi/vid_0
		cat /proc/bus/pci/00/02.1 &gt; /var/lib/acpi/vid_1
	b. Suspend-to-ram
		echo -n mem &gt; /sys/power/state
	c. Restore device state on resume
		cat &gt; /proc/bus/pci/00/02.0 &lt; /var/lib/acpi/vid_0
		cat &gt; /proc/bus/pci/00/02.1 &lt; /var/lib/acpi/vid_1
</pre>
The developers of suspend are undecided on whether they should wait
for the kernel to fix this or just make the change to s2ram since the
problem seems to be for specific hardware combinations like the
thinkpad R51 with intel graphics (or perhaps only for that
combination!).
</p>

<p>
I should perhaps also mention that suspend worked fine on my laptop
with Ubuntu Dapper which I tested out.
</p>

<p>
Generally, I have found that "suspend-to-disk" works out-of-the-box
with all laptops that I have come across; "suspend-to-ram" seems more
tricky. Given my experience, I would say that Ben is singularly unlucky :-(

Everything looks fine to me.  I would suggest you move the default port to

<p>
IIUC, I think it's asking for your passphrase, the one you used to generate
the key-pair, no?  To get around that, you have to generate keys with no
pass-phrase (which is considered A Bad Thing).

&gt; setting PermitRootLogin to 'no', and AllowUsers to 'user' (the name of

&gt; is it supposed to do that?

<p>
Yes, it's supposed to do that.  With that behaviour (prompting for the
password three times), the cracker isn't sure if A) root logins are disabled
or B) he has the wrong password. If it failed immediately, he would know
that A was true.  Anything to slow the little buggers down.

You know what I mean.  I have only one OS setup on my harddisk and I have no

<p>
I noticed in the kernel sources there is a file named bootsector.  I cannot
find any information on how to use it.

<p>
It must be simple to do but the question is how?

I am using fedora core 5, arch: x86_64.  All updated using yum.

<h3>IE6 under IceWM</h3>

Hi. I've dl'd and installed the IE6 running under Wine from
<a href="http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page">http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page</a> This is useful step 
in testing web page development ... I don't care enough about it to 
actually test with a real windows machine, but if I can test locally 
using IE6 it is not a big deal.
</p>

<p>
Under gnome or KDe it works just fine. But, it crashed (or stalls) under
icewm. I have tried to start from a terminal and from the toolbar. Under
a terminal I get the Wine debug prompt, and a "loading" window. But that
is about it.
</p>

<p>
I am thinking there is a path difference or something. But, I have
checked and don't see and obvious differences.
</p>

<p>
I have checked on the tatanka page and don't see anything on this topic. 
And a request to the IceWM users list has drawn a blank as well. Maybe 
one of you guys has an idea on this?

<h3>fonts puzzle, and puzzling gmail spyware page upon login from firefox</h3>

<p>
Hi All,
</p>

<p>
  Has anyone else come across this gmail "spyware"
  page when trying to log into gmail using Firefox?
</p>

<p>
    [ Snipped image ]
</p>

<p>
  As you can imagine, it plays havoc with the gmail
  notifier extension, as well as making me doubt
  my ability to read, each time I try to log in.
  (Trying to type in the contents of the squiggly
   message displayed in the box seems to be a task
   my brain is almost incapable of handling early
   in the morning).
  So I'm wondering, is this something Firefox is
  doing to annoy gmail? Or just something
  gmail has started doing to annoy all their users?
</p>

<p>
  Another question: I've come across this after updating
  Debian testing: I seem to be loosing fonts, or at least
  the helvetica font I need for vncviewer and imagemagic:
</p>

<p>
  For example, "display image.jpg" gives me:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
display: unable to load font
`-*-helvetica-medium-r-normal--12-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1'.
display: unable to load font
`-*-helvetica-medium-r-normal--12-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1'.
</pre>
  And vncviewer gives me this:
</p>

<p>
<pre>

Warning: Unable to load any usable ISO8859 font
Warning: Missing charsets in String to FontSet conversion
Warning: Unable to load any usable fontset
Error: Aborting: no font found
</pre>
  I tried searching for explanations, and as far as
  I can tell I've got all the font packages installed.
  I attach the output from running
<pre>
    dpkg --get-selections &gt; /tmp/dpkg--get-selections
</pre>
  in case it could be helpful.
</p>

<p>
    [ snipped ]
</p>

<p>
  I have a machine running Debian stable, and both
  "display" and "vncviewer" are working fine, but
  comparing the strace hasn't gotten me very far.
  I was wondering if anyone would have any hints,
  I've not much experience / understanding of X11 fonts.
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
Peter.

</p>

<p>
Thanks for the help.

<h3>Pointers to Perl CGI Resources</h3>

Hi Gang,
</p>

<p>
I could have Googl-ed to find plentiful of answers but decided
otherwise to seek wisdom here.
</p>

<p>
My plans are to develop simple web-based application using Perl
scripts and MySQL as back-end for data storage. Am planning to host
the application using Apache http server. Am aware that Perl modules
(DBI) are needed to interact with database. I have little knowledge of
db design.
</p>

<p>
My question :
</p>

<p>
Am lost here, how to start this whole activity ? Reason is, am not
comfortable in embedding the Perl scripts with HTML tags and regular
functions for data management needs.
</p>

<p>
Intention is to keep the, scripts providing the front-end and back-end
processing, separate and not mix all in the same script(s).
</p>

<p>
Looking forward to your suggestions.
</p>

<p>
/Ram

Somebody took the audio from a Micr0s0ft Vista "we're so brilliant,
we've invented all this new stuff" shill session and overlaid it on a
video of themselves doing it all on their OS/X desktop - with a few
additional twists. High amusement factor, including Bill G's 1977
"jailbird" photos.

<h3>frame rate of VCD and DVD</h3>

<p>
Dear gang...
</p>

<p>
I face a trouble here. Does anyone know the frame rate of VCD and DVD? 
Also, what is the fps (frame per second) of movie trailers spreading on 
Internet? What is the right way to calculate the fps? 
</p>

<p>
My another problem is, suppose I have a video clip which has 30 fps. 
What should I do if I want to double the fps (i.e 60 fps)? Is there any 
tool available to do this?
</p>

<p>
Any hints would be greatly appreciated... Thanks in advance.
</p>

<p>
regards,

<h3>DNS security</h3>

<p>
I am a member of the network group at a university in Atlanta Georgia,
some time ago we had a minor DOS from off campus to our main DNS server,
at that time we decided to only allow outside connections from our
service provider (Peachnet) and block all others with our firewall. We
seem now to have a problem with the root "EDU" servers.
<pre>
;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
edu.                    172800  IN      NS      M3.NSTLD.COM.
edu.                    172800  IN      NS      A3.NSTLD.COM.
edu.                    172800  IN      NS      C3.NSTLD.COM.
edu.                    172800  IN      NS      D3.NSTLD.COM.
edu.                    172800  IN      NS      E3.NSTLD.COM.
edu.                    172800  IN      NS      G3.NSTLD.COM.
edu.                    172800  IN      NS      H3.NSTLD.COM.
edu.                    172800  IN      NS      L3.NSTLD.COM.
</pre>
They cannot resolve anything in our domain including our primary DNS
server. Do we need to include these servers in our rule base ?
How do we protect against a DOS attack on our DNS servers ?
</p>

<p>

I'm using scponly for one of my users and recently he asked for the
public key to bypass password prompt. Did you create the user as normal
and then add them to scponly? Or did you add them using scponly's script
(setup_chroot.sh) first?

<p>
Hi,
</p>

<p>
I've written the article:
<a href="../116/herrmann.html">http://linuxgazette.net/116/herrmann.html</a>
</p>

<p>
and was contacted by a reader a little while back, telling me it's not
working for him. I could verify that with the current version of the
perl module OpenOffice::OODoc  the script indeed fails to create the
slides in the odp file. It includes the pics -- you can extract them,
but they are not shown on any slides, and there is only the one default
slide. 
</p>

<p>
I've no way of telling at what exact version my script breaks. The one
its working with is version 1.309, currently CPAN  is at 2.028 -- major
revision 1 -&gt; 2 is likely. 
</p>

<p>
A rather simple change to the script fixes the problem:
</p>

<p>
just change:
  my $test=  $document-&gt;appendElement
    ('//office:body',0,'draw:page');
</p>

<p>
into:
</p>

<p>
  my $test=  $document-&gt;appendElement
    ('//office:presentation',0,'draw:page');
</p>


<p>
and the script works again. A small caveat: I've sometimes problem with
the slides beeing in the correct order (i.e. not the order in the
inputfile), but I can't say under what conditions this can happen yet. 
</p>

<p>

Hello Ben,
</p>

<p>
I have been trying to modify your script to work with latest Knoppix
with no luck at all. File called 'linux' is too big to fit to floppy
and besides, it seems that latest Knoppix cannot boot from diskette.
</p>

<p>
Please tell me, what is the latest Knoppix version that can work with
your script?
Could you please make a boot.img that would work with Knoppix V5.0.1 and
put it online somewhere?
</p>

&gt;   In the LG#127 article "With Knoppix at a HotSpot", you made the
&gt;   comment:
&gt; 
&gt;      [ I do a lot of travelling, and connect to a wide variety of
&gt;        strange WLANs. In my experience, at least, connecting to a
&gt;        wireless LAN with Linux is usually just as simple as Edgar
&gt;        describes. -- Ben ]
&gt; 
&gt;   Well, I have a very different experience.  I have no trouble at all
&gt;   connecting to a managed wifi network; at home or work, I just set
&gt;   the ESSID and WEP key in /etc/network/interfaces, and "netscheme
&gt;   work" does the rest.  But this same machine has never managed to
&gt;   connect to an <em>open</em> wifi network.
&gt; 
&gt;   Today, I visited my municipal wifi and tried to connect.  I ran
&gt;   Kismet to see that the ESSID was "OldTownWifi" and that wep and
&gt;   encryption were both off.  So I used iwconfig to set the essid and
&gt;   managed mode, then ran dhclient.  Nothing.  No response from their
&gt;   server at all.
&gt; 
&gt;   So how about this: you help me understand why I can see an open
&gt;   hotspot with Kismet but can't seem to give the right incantation to
&gt;   connect, and I'll write up a "dummy's guide" for LG.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Well, that sounds like a fair sort of deal... but I don't know that I
can answer the question as posed. In my mind, at least, it comes down to
"why doesn't dhcpclient work as it should?" - and I can't really tell
you, since I don't use it. I suppose you could always take a look at
your '/var/log/{daemon,kern}.log' or '/var/log/messages' and figure out
where it's failing.
</p>

<p>
To be a bit more specific, I've tried using 'dhcpclient' in the past - I
don't recall why - but it simply didn't work no matter what I tried, on
a "known good" Ethernet connection which worked fine with 'pump' on a
different machine. I pounded on the config file for a while, tried
everything in the manpage - then gave up and installed 'pump'... and
everything instantly started working - and if I recall correctly, it
required no configuration on my part.
</p>

<p>
I've been using 'pump' ever since.
</p>

<p>
These days, I usually use the 'ifup/ifdown' front ends instead of using
it directly (although sometimes I forget and use it directly; it works
fine either way.) I never have to set the ESSID unless I'm trying to get
onto a private network; the one time that I ended up wrestling with it
turned out to be a case of solving the wrong problem - the responsible
bit was a broken kernel module for my ipw2200, and not the client at
all. As I've said, It Just Works.

<p>
Hi there,
</p>

<p>
I'm Thai from Vietnam. I just want to introduce you
Kiosk Appliance (<a href="http://kiosk.rpath.org">http://kiosk.rpath.org</a>) which is a
distro focusing on user's security and privacy
inspired by your article "Creating a Rudimentary Kiosk
System using FVWM". Using rPath technology, I provide
3 versions of Kiosk Appliance: a VMWare image, a
LiveCD and an installable CD.  Included is just enough
rPath Linux and FVWM to run a locked down version of
Firefox. Firefox is also pre-configured to
automatically reset after each used so that personal
information is never stored permanently. The current
stable version is 0.2 which features:
</p>

<p>
1) Clear all personal data on exit;
</p>

<p>
2) Reset after a period of inactivity;
</p>

<p>
3) Disable form history;
</p>

<p>
4) Disable page caching;
</p>

<p>
...and much more, you can view more details at
<a href="http://www.rpath.org/rbuilder/project/kiosk/release?id=5096">http://www.rpath.org/rbuilder/project/kiosk/release?id=5096</a>
</p>

<p>
I've been working on Kiosk Appliance 0.3 which has
many more features such as the ability to disable
access to Firefox's internal URLs or dialogs, i.e
about:* URL, the Firefox Preferences dialog...I hope
K.A 0.3 to be released on the next few days. Many
thanks to Thomas Adam for helping me to configure
fvwm.
</p>

<p>
Any thought or suggestion? I'm really anxious to hear
from you.
</p>

<p>
Best regards,
</p>

<p>
Thai Duong.

Hi,
Just want to shout out that the puzzle is great!
I'd been a long time reader of linuxgazette (since 2001 I guess)
although I lost interest in linuxgazette for a while (maybe because
I'm no longer a linux newbie). Now I'm really looking for the next
issue :D
I noticed that the september's puzzle is harder than the august's. But
I won't complain just because I couldn't complete the puzzle myself. I
think puzzles are good for newbies too to examine what they learned
and find some fun of it. For that, we need easier puzzles with common
acronyms such as gnome, kde, and other common commands. So if you have
enough manpower, two puzzles in an issue would be great (one for geeks
and one for newbies).
Cheers,
<pre>-- 
Duy

Hi,
</p>

<p>
Harring Figueiredo suggested:
</p>

<p>
Shouldn't the tests be if(buffer_... = NULL)? Probably a typo
</p>

<p>
You agreed.
</p>

<p>
In fact, shouldn't it be if(buffer_... == NULL)? (Comparison, not assignment).
</p>

<p>
Regards

I have a similar Zaurus 3100. I checked out both Openzaurus' OPIE &amp; GPE. They 
were nice, but felt too similar to a palm pilot or a "plain" old PDA.
</p>

<p>
If you really want your Zaurus to be just like a "regular" PC running a full 
blown OS, OpenBSD on the Zaurus is great. It's the full OS installation with 
gcc, X windows, etc. Basically, if it compiles on OpenBSD it'll work on the 
Zaurus. Completely self-hosted development--no need for cross compilers on 
other boxes. Combined with a lightweight desktop such as blackbox it's amazing. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Just to clarify, Groups of Linux Users Everywhere (GLUE) was never
related to Linux Gazette. Linux Gazette was hosted at SSC
(linuxgazette.com) for a period of time. GLUE was a separate project
(I think it was created by SSC but I don't know its origins). Because
they were on the same server, SSC may have put it under the
linuxgazette.com domain at some point, but it was never a part of our
ezine.  I made one version of GLUE and I thought it was under the
linuxjournal.com domain, but that was so many years ago that I don't
remember for sure.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Intel Stakes a Claim to the Future, Shows Off Quad-Core System at IDF</h3>

<p>
At its annual developer conference and Geek-fest/Love-in, the Fall Intel
Developer Forum in San Francisco, Intel gathered partners and technologists
to demonstrate it leadership in a plethora of technologies.   Intel showed
off new graphics engines that rivaled the gaming and video features of
nVidia and ATI [recently bought by its chief competitor, AMD],  LAN and
WiFi solutions, virtualization, experiments in solar power and fuel cells,
and numerous other forward-looking research projects.   Intel used the IDF
conference as a springboard for new initiatives and to explain its road map
in more detail than in the past.
</p>  

<p>
Intel committed itself and its partners to releasing quad-core x86 chips
before the end of this year, moving up its earlier 2007 release date.   And
prototype systems were on hand as proof from many Intel partners.   To be
sure, these were modified dual socket mother boards that now can take dual
core chips, but these showed that most modern OSes could take advantage of
the extra cores and perform reasonable job scheduling without modification.
</p>      

<p>
Code-named Kentfield, the first chips will still sport the "Core 2"
branding, but with be  4 cores, as in 2 dual-core chips in a single socket
package.   This is partly done to improve the product yields [by about 20%
over the 4 cores on the same silicon wafer, according to Intel CEO Paul
Ortelli].  The follow-on chip will be called Clovertown and will be in the
Xeon 5300 series, a quad-core variant of Woodcrest. First out of the
chute are the quad-core products aimed at the desktop, followed server
editions. [see photo here:
<a href="ftp://download.intel.com/pressroom/kits/idffall_2006/Intel%20Core2%20Extreme%20Quad-Core%20microprocessor.jpg">ftp://download.intel.com/pressroom/kits/idffall_2006/Intel%20Core2%20Extreme%20Quad-Core%20microprocessor.jpg</a>
]
</p>

<p>
Patrick Patla, director for AMD's Server and Workstation Business, in
Austin, Texas, was quoted in eWeek calling the Intel Quad core a
"Franken-quad," and less efficient  with a single memory bus than the true
quad-core chip that AMD will release in early 2007.
</p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Tera scale processors</h3>

<p>
Gigabits and Gigahertz make for a massively parallel TeraScale processor.
Intel's peak at the future of computing included an 80 core CPU.   Seemingly
one-upping the IBM-Sony Cell processor, 'Tera' is more of a design point  to
which Intel is applying its vast engineering resources.
</p>  

<p>
Operating at 3.1 GHz, the goal of this multi-core experimental chip is to
test interconnect strategies for rapidly moving terabytes of data from core
to core and between cores and memory.  This monster  uses SRAM for speed
and directly connect memory blocks to each processor.  One possible design
has entire RAM blocks in the core design.  At 100 MB or more per core, that
would be the entire system, or 8 terabytes, without a memory controller.
Research efforts are aimed at trying to design DRAM to work in this manner
so as to reduce power consumption.  This could be a back door for Intel to
re-enter the memory market.
</p>

<p>
Potential uses of the technology include high-performance devices to play
photo-realistic games, share real-time video and do multimedia data mining.
Intel Senior Fellow and Chief Technology Officer Justin Rattner said
"When combined with our recent breakthroughs in silicon photonics, these
experimental chips address the three major requirements for tera-scale
computing - teraOPS of performance, terabytes-per-second of memory
bandwidth, and terabits-per-second of I/O capacity."

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Eclipse Foundation Selects Black Duck's protexIP to Review Contributed Code</h3>

<p>
Black Duck Software, a provider of software compliance management
solutions,  announced in September that the Eclipse Foundation has
purchased and deployed Black Duck's protexIP(TM)/development platform.
Eclipse uses protexIP to review software submitted by committers and ensure
it is in compliance with the specific software licensing requirements of
the Eclipse Foundation.
</p>

<p>
Eclipse is a community of open source projects, each comprised of its own
group of independent developers. The process of open source software
development regularly involves the assembly of open source code with
invented and reused components, and as a result, various licenses can
govern various parts of an application. The open nature of Eclipse's
projects intensifies the need for Eclipse to evaluate the copyrights
governing their code bases.
</p>

<p>
"Companies worldwide are capitalizing on applications developed by the
Eclipse community, and many software vendors sell products that are
dependent on Eclipse," said Mike Milinkovich, executive director of Eclipse
Foundation. "For that reason, it is absolutely vital for us to analyze our
code before we release it to our community."
</p>

<p>
protexIP compares software code to the protexIP KnowledgeBase, the most
complete database of information on open source software components, code
and license obligations available today. It contains information on tens of
thousands of open source projects from more than 2,000 sites worldwide; and
more than 650 open source and commercial licenses.
</p>

<p>
"The Eclipse Foundation represents some of the most innovative work in
application development today, as teams of developers are working together
to create tools and frameworks that will help build better business
applications," said Douglas A. Levin, CEO of Black Duck Software.
"Eclipse's purchase of protexIP makes sense given the decentralized and
very successful nature of the community's process. Eclipse now has greater
certainty that the licenses governing the code are in order."

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Terracotta Offers Eclipse Plug-in for Point-and-Click Clustering Technology</h3>

<p>
Terracotta, Inc., a leader in solutions for enterprise Java scalability,
has announced availability of its Eclipse plug-in for Terracotta DSO, the
company's enterprise-class JVM clustering technology. Bundled with
Terracotta DSO, the new plug-in makes Terracotta's point-and-click
clustering functionality available from within the Eclipse IDE and
demonstrates the company's on-going commitment to open source integration.
</p>

<p>
"Eclipse has taken the developer world by storm and become one of the most
popular open source IDEs for Java application development," said Ari Zilka,
founder and chief technology officer at Terracotta. "Terracotta DSO already
provides plug-in capacity and availability for Java applications running on
two or more machines. This plug-in further simplifies the clustering
process by automatically generating the necessary configuration files."
</p>

<p>
Terracotta DSO (Distributed Shared Objects) is a runtime solution that
allows data to be shared across multiple JVMs without the need for
proprietary APIs, custom code, databases, or message queues. With
Terracotta DSO, objects can be clustered at runtime just by specifying them
by name.
</p>

<p>
Typically, objects and data to be clustered, as well as classes to be
instrumented, are manually declared in an XML configuration file. With the
Eclipse plug-in, the declaration process is automated via graphical
representation of classes and objects, which can be browsed and acted upon
within the IDE. Right-clicking objects and selecting Terracotta options
from the context menu automatically generates the XML configuration file.
The point-and-click automation improves productivity and eliminates
iterations.
</p>

<p>
To facilitate application testing, the Eclipse plug-in lets developers
start and stop Terracotta servers and clients from within the Eclipse IDE.
In addition, the plug-in provides a more intuitive, developer-friendly XML
experience by replacing raw text with graphical representations of
sub-declarations within the XML configuration file.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Attendance Surpasses the 10,000 Mark for the Flagship Linux and Open Source Event</h3>

<p>
IDG World Expo announced the successful completion of LinuxWorld Conference
&amp; Expo(&reg;), held August 14-17, 2006. More than 10,000 participants from
around the globe arrived at San Francisco's Moscone Center to examine the
latest products and solutions, hear about emerging trends in the industry
and experience new content. This year's event also paid tribute to the
15-year anniversary of the kernel with a spirited panel discussion entitled
"Celebrating 20 Years of Linux" which highlighted several industry
milestones while envisioning the future of Linux as if the year was 2011.
</p> 

<p>
"We're extremely pleased with the results of LinuxWorld San Francisco,"
said Melinda Kendall, group vice president at IDG World Expo. "The exhibit
hall was crowded with attendees, media coverage of the event was
tremendous, the conference program was very well attended and several of
our new programs including CIO Summit, Linux in the Channel Day and
Healthcare Day were extremely well received."
</p>

<p>
Two key themes that resonated throughout the show were mobile Linux and
virtualization. Motorola, Nokia and PalmSource, all new exhibitors at
LinuxWorld San Francisco, touted their line of mobile Linux products and
two keynote addresses focused on these themes: "Creating Must-Have Mobile
Experiences With Linux," by Greg Bisio, Corporate Vice President of
Motorola, and "Where Virtualization is Leading Your IT Department" by Peter
Levine, CEO, XenSource.  All of the keynote addresses from LinuxWorld can

<p>
Linus Torvalds announced the release of the 2.6.18 Linux kernel, following
the previous stable kernel release by three months.   With a hearty
"Arrgh!," he said, "she's good to go, hoist anchor!", this being the second
year in a row that a kernel release has coincided with 'Talk Like A Pirate
Day' . "Here's some real booty for all you land-lubbers," Linus continued,
"there's not too many changes, with t'bulk of the patch bein' defconfig
updates, but the shortlog at the aft of this here email describes the
details if you care, you scurvy dogs." In keeping with the theme, he signed
the announcement, "Linus 'but you can call me Cap'n'".

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 -- First Beta</h3>

<p>
The first beta of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, based on Fedora 5 and some
early features from Fedora 6, is available since September -- if you have a
Red Hat Network account --  but some reviewers are not impressed.    The
package management tools don't work well with RH repositories, especially the
version of 'yum' included, and the management tools for the brand new Xen
virtualization hypervisor have received complaints. But that's why there
are beta tests.
</p>   

<p>
RHEL 5 is based primarily on the 2.6.18 Linux kernel.  It comes in client
and server versions with optional directories for additional functionality
like virtualization and clustering.
</p>

<p>
You can access the beta with a temporary subscription to RHN at the RH
evaluation page:  <a href="http://www.redhat.com/rhel/details/eval/">http://www.redhat.com/rhel/details/eval/</a>  [Does not reflect the RHEL 5 beta by this issue's publication]

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />SimplyMEPIS 6.0-1 Live DVD Available at Newsstands</h3>

<p>
MEPIS has released the  SimplyMEPIS 6.0-1 DVD Edition: an update of
SimplyMEPIS 6.0, MEPIS' first Ubuntu based edition released earlier this
summer.  The SimplyMEPIS 6.0-1 bootable DVD not only includes hundreds of
bug and security fixes, but the 1,900 packages of the three SimplyMEPIS
Extras CDs, as well.  Also, this Mepis edition has been cover-mounted on
the October 2006 issue of Linux Magazine from Linux New Media AG  available
at thousands of bookstores and newsstands worldwide including Borders,
Barnes &amp; Noble, Fry's, Micro Center, Chapters, WHSmith and Eason.
</p>

<p>
Warren Woodford of MEPIS said "We enjoyed working with Linux Magazine to
produce this coordinated release.  The cover-mounted DVD is convenient for
those who do not have the opportunity or inclination to download ISO files
and burn their own CDs or DVD.  By featuring our new DVD, Linux Magazine
will enable thousands of dissatisfied Windows users to try and, hopefully,
switch to SimplyMEPIS."
</p>

<p>
The ISO image is available for download in the 'release' subdirectory at
the MEPIS Subscriber's Site and at MEPIS public mirrors.  Current users of
SimplyMEPIS 6.0 do not need to install 6.0-1 but can update, as usual,
through the Ubuntu and MEPIS package pools.
</p>

<p>
SimplyMEPIS is a full featured desktop solution that integrates the Linux
OS with hundreds of popular application packages including KDE, OpenOffice,
Amarok, Firefox, and Thunderbird.  Satisfied users are encouraged to help
offset the costs of development by making a contribution or a purchase at
the MEPIS store at <a href="http://www.mepis.org/store">www.mepis.org/store</a>.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />BeleniX 0.5</h3>
<a href="http://www.genunix.org/distributions/belenix_site/belenix_home.html">http://www.genunix.org/distributions/belenix_site/belenix_home.html</a>

<p>
A new release of BeleniX is available after some delay. This brings in
several new features and software upgrades with more upgrades coming soon.
The main points of this release are:
</p>

<ul>
   <li> 1. New support for read-only mounting and accessing both Ext2FS and
   NTFS partitions on either Primary or Logical Partitions, based on the
   original Mount-NTFS work done by Martin Rosenau. That codebase was
   enhanced and Ext2FS mount support added via libext2fs from e2fsprogs.
   <li> 2. Updated to a recent pre-build48 snapshot of OpenSolaris with many
   bugfixes, enhancements and new features.
   <li> 3. The utilities from NTFSprogs and E2fsprogs are integrated into
   BeleniX. These were release earlier as SVR4 packages.
   <li> 4. The utilities from NTFSprogs provide read-write access to NTFS
   primary partitions as well.
   <li> 5. The Partition Table Viewer utility has been integrated. This
   utility and the above ones provide useful recovery facilities for
   hard disk partitions.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Avokia Claims Most Far-flung Database Cluster Ever</h3>

cluster between Toronto and San Francisco: a distance of almost 2,500
miles.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Torpark browser anonymizes Internet connections</h3>

<p>
Hacktivismo, an international group of tech-savvy human rights workers
affiliated with the Cult of the Dead Cow [cDc], has released Torpark, an
anonymous, portable Web browser based on Mozilla Firefox. Torpark comes
pre-configured, requires no installation, can run off a USB memory stick,
and leaves no tracks behind in the browser or computer. Torpark is a highly
modified variant of Portable Firefox, that uses the TOR (The Onion Router)
network to anonymize the connection between the user and the website that
is being visited.
</p>

<p>
When a user logs onto the Internet, a unique IP address is assigned to
manage the computer's identity. Each website the user visits can see and
log the user's IP address. Hostile governments and data thieves can
easily monitor this interaction to correlate activity and determine a
user's identity.
</p>

<p>
Torpark causes the IP address seen by the website to change every few
minutes to frustrate eavesdropping and mask the requesting source. For
example, a user could be surfing the Internet from a home computer in
Ghana, and it might appear to websites that the user was coming from a
university computer in Germany or any other country with servers in the TOR
network.
</p>

<p>
It is important to note that the data passing from the user's computer
into the TOR network is encrypted. Therefore, the user's Internet
Service Provider (ISP) cannot see the information that is passing through
the Torpark browser, such as the websites visited, or posts the user might
have made to a forum. The ISP can only see an encrypted connection to the
TOR network.
</p>

<p>
But there are limitations to the anonymity: Torpark anonymizes the
user's connection but not the data. Data traveling between the client
and the TOR network is encrypted, but the data between the TOR network and
websites is unencrypted. So a user should not use his/her username or
password on websites that do not offer a secure login and session (noted by
a golden padlock at the bottom of the Torpark browser screen).
</p>

<p>
Torpark is being released under the GNU General Public License and is
dedicated to the Panchen Lama.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />IBM working on smart-car subsystems</h3>

<p>
IBM has inked a five-year deal with Magna Electronics, a Canadian firm that
makes auto electronics. The goal of the partnership is to develop
systems that protect drivers  and mediate interactions with neighboring
vehicles.
</p>

<p>
Part of IBM's Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA),
systems would be developed to analyze traffic patterns and real time
performance data and react to potential problems. Beside collision
avoidance, driver alertness would be monitored. Another possibility are
headlights that dim for approaching cars. The technology would also
include autonomic systems that could diagnose internal problems, since
there would be no reliable benefit if the safety system failed when needed.
</p>


<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />PNY MaxFile Attache 12GB Micro Drive</h3>

<p>
PNY Technologies, Inc. announced its latest MaxFile(TM) Attache(R), a USB
2.0 micro hard drive with 12GB of storage space. The extra-small drive
includes a Migo(TM) backup and synchronization software download, so users
can sync everything from their e-mail, documents, favorites and settings
wherever they go.
</p>

<p>
"MaxFile Attache provides an ideal solution for users looking for
... cost-effective, high-capacity, compact, portable storage," said Dean
Delserro, senior marketing manager, flash, for PNY Technologies. "Only
slightly larger than a traditional USB flash drive, MaxFile's small form
factor is ideal for anyone that needs to safely carry loads of important
information with them. MaxFile Attache is a perfect choice for the user
that requires more storage at a lower cost per megabyte than is
traditionally available on a USB Flash drive, and still wants to be able to
carry it in their pocket, purse, briefcase or backpack. ...Moreover,
MaxFile Attache eliminates the need to travel with a bulky laptop,
particularly at a time when airline travelers need to limit their carry-on
items"
</p>

<p>
With 12GB of memory, MaxFile Attache can store thousands of documents,
presentations, digital photos, and songs, games - or over 25 hours of video
- and features a read and write speed of up to 11MB/sec.  Moreover, the
device features a durable, aluminum outer casing and is self-powered by a
sturdy, USB connector.
</p>

<p>
PNY's MaxFile Attache is available starting in September from retailers and
e-tailers with an MSRP of $169.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Anousheh Ansari, First Female Private Space Explorer and  the First Blogger
from Space</h3> 

<p>
The X PRIZE Foundation announced that <a
href="http://www.xprize.org">http://www.xprize.org</a> will host the
first-ever blog from space during Anousheh Ansari's historic flight to the
International Space Station. The webpage was designed by the X PRIZE
Foundation, a nonprofit prize institute in partnership with Prodea Systems,
the home technology company that is sponsoring her journey.
</p> 

<p>
"My ultimate goal is to bring this experience ... to more and more people
and to inspire young woman and men to go into the fields related to space,"
said Anousheh Ansari during a recent interview from the Baikonur Cosmodrome
in Kazakhstan. "I hope that thousands of individuals from around the world
will visit the X PRIZE site to learn what its like to fly into orbit."
</p>

<p>
In addition to the <a href="http://spaceblog.xprize.org">first-ever blog from space</a>, visitors will also read
Ansari's life story as well as watch exclusive video and interviews from
her training, preflight activities, launch and landing. Visitors will also
have exclusive access to the first episodes of the X PRIZE Foundation
Futurecast. This new podcast will feature visionaries and entrepreneurs
from around the globe to talk about what the future holds for us. The first
episodes, which can be found on the X PRIZE Foundation website and Apple's
iTunes podcast directory, will be the first podcast from space.
</p>

<p>
An active proponent of world-changing technologies, Anousheh Ansari has
been immersed in the space industry for years. Anousheh along with Amir
Ansari, her brother-in-law, and co-founder and chief technical officer of
Prodea Systems, provided the title sponsorship for the Ansari X PRIZE, a
$10 million cash prize awarded to Burt Rutan in 2004, for the first
non-governmental organization to launch a reusable manned spacecraft into
space twice within two weeks. Anousheh Ansari is also a member of the X
PRIZE Foundation Board of Trustees. Her philanthropic work through the X
PRIZE Foundation has made her an integral figure in the development of the
private spaceflight industry.
</p>

<p>
"The X PRIZE Foundation is very proud to host Anousheh's blog. We are a
21st century organization pushing the boundaries of technology," said Dr.
Peter H. Diamandis, Chairman and CEO of the X PRIZE. "We thought blogging
from space was the proper use of technology to reach today's youth. We hope
millions will visit our website and learn about Anousheh's mission as well
as the X PRIZE Cup in New Mexico, and our future X PRIZES for genome
sequencing and hyper fuel-efficient automobiles."
</p>

<p>
On Monday September 18, 2006 Ansari is scheduled to blast off in a Russian
Soyuz spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, part of a
crew-exchange flight to the International Space Station. Her journey will
last for 10 days and will include a two day trip to the International Space
Station on the Soyuz as well as numerous experiments and activities that
she will film in order to create education programs upon landing.
</p>

<p>
In 2004, the $10 million Ansari X PRIZE proved that offering a prize is an
effective, efficient and economic model for accelerating breakthroughs in
science and technology. Based on that success, the X PRIZE Foundation is
now expanding their efforts to offer more prizes in the space industry, as
well as, in the areas of health, energy, transportation, and education.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />"Multiplied" Linux Desktop Migration Strategy</h3>

<p>
Modern PCs spend most of the day idle. By using the Multiplied Linux
Desktop Strategy, organisations can now leverage this unused computing
power and connect up to 10 full-featured workstations to a SINGLE,
shared SLED 10 or openSUSE 10.1 computer. For administrators, this means
only one computer to install, configure, secure, backup and administer
instead of 10.  For users, this means a rich user experience that is
indistinguishable from single-user computers for typical office
applications.  Ideal for Linux computer labs, Linux thin clients, Linux
Internet caf&eacute;s and Linux point-of-sale terminals, where users are in
close physical proximity to the host machine.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />StartSSL and Firefox 2.0 release</h3>

<p>
Eilat, Israel, October 23, 2006 - StartCom congratulates the <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/">Mozilla</a>
team on the successful release of the new <a
 href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox 2.0</a> web browser.
After one year of development since the last release, this award-winning
and free web browser got even better than before. The new Firefox web
browser is available for immediate download! In addition to that,
StartCom is very pleased to announce the availability of the <a
 href="http://www.startssl.com/">StartCom Certification Authority</a>
as an included and trusted instance for the issuance of digital
certification in Mozilla software, including the new Firefox browser.
</p>

<p>
- The StartCom Certification Authority has matured a lot since the
first announcement in February 2005 and offers today a range of
products from free digital certification to PKI solutions for the
corporate. The project started at <a href="http://cert.startcom.org/">http://cert.startcom.org</a>
with a limited wizard to create free digital certificates for web
servers. Since then, StartCom developed various additional products for
private and commercial use, underwent a third party audit and issued
over 20,000 digital certificates. But today - with the release of the
new Firefox web browser - marks the first time, that free digital
certification (provided by StartCom) is supported and trusted by a
major browser  vendor with a significant market share. This makes it
very easy for the subscribers of the certificates and the relaying
parties (visitors) of digitally secured web sites (SSL) to use this
free service! Also the signing and encryption of email is supported in
the same manner which allows the protection of the identity and privacy
of the user.
</p>

<p>
- This event is also an excellent opportunity to make another few
announcements: StartSSL(&trade;) is the new trade mark for products and
solutions of the StartCom Certification Authority and is available at <a
 href="http://www.startssl.com/">www.StartSSL.com</a>. Additionally
StartCom started the <a href="http://www.startssl.org/">StartSSL&trade;
Web-of-Trust (WoT)</a>, which is an attempt to create a
community network of notaries and members, where notaries perform the
verification of the fellow members. Please visit the new web sites for
more information and everybody is invited to participate in the
StartSSL(tm) WoT or make use of any of StartComs free or paid products and
services.

<h3>2-cent Tip: Unicode conversion</h3>
 
 <p>Benjamin A. Okopnik ([ben at linuxgazette.net]) 
 <br /> 
 Mon, 4 Sep 2006 15:27:16 -0400</p> 
  
 

<p>
A couple of years ago, I decided to stop wrestling with what I call
"encoding craziness" for various bits of non-English text that I have
scattered around my file system. Russian, for example, has at least four
different encodings that I've run into - and guessing which one a given
text file was written in was like a game of darts played in the dark. At
300 yards. With your hands tied behind you, so you had to use your toes.
Oh, and while you were severely drunk on Stoli vodka. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> UTF-8 (Unicode)
allowed me to, well, unify all of that into one single encoding that was
readable without scrambling for whichever character set I needed (and
may or may not have installed.) Better yet, Unicode usually displays
just fine in HTML browsers - no special entity encoding is required.
</p>

<p>
For some reason, though, good converters appear to be something of a
black art - and finding one that works, as opposed to all those that
<strong>claim</strong> to work, was rather frustrating. Therefore, I decided to write
one in my favorite language, Perl - only to find that the job has
already been done for me, via the 'encoding' pragma. In other words,
conversion from, say, KOI8-R to UTF-8 is no more complex than this:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
# Convert and write to a file
perl -Mencoding=koi8r,STDOUT,utf8 -pe0 &lt; file.koi8r &gt; file.utf8
# Or just display it in a pager:
perl -Mencoding=koi8r,STDOUT,utf8 -pe0 &lt; file.koi8r|less
</pre>
It is literally that simple. Pretty much every encoding you can imagine
is available (see 'perldoc Encode::Supported' for the naming conventions
and charsets). The conversion does not have to be to UTF-8 - it'll do
any of the listed charsets - but why would you care? <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
<pre>
# Print the Kanji for 'Rakuda' (Camel) from multibyte strings:
perl -Mencoding=euc-jp,STDOUT,utf-8 -wle'print "Follow the
\xF1\xD1\xF1\xCC!"'
Follow the 駱駝!
# Or you can do it in Hiragana, but using Unicode values instead:
perl -Mencoding=shift-jis,STDOUT,utf8 -wle'print "Follow the
\x{3089}\x{304F}\x{3060}!"'
Follow the らくだ!

Here's a quick tidbit to help the PS1 variable do the right thing

<p>IPCop is a firewall for the Small Office/Home Office (SOHO)
network, which is extremely easy to use. It provides most of the
basic features that you would expect a modern firewall to have, and
what is most important is that it sets this all up for you in a
highly automated and simplified way. It's very easy to get an IPCop
system up and running and takes hardly any time.
</p>

<h3>Trust Relationships between the Interfaces</h3>

<p>The four types of network interface&mdash;Green, Red, Blue, and
Orange&mdash;supported by IPCop have differing levels of trust
associated with them. Here is a simple table outlining what traffic
is allowed to go to and from which interfaces. This table, and the
knowledge contained within it, should form the basis of our
planning when considering how many interfaces to use and what to
use them for. This is basically the Traffic Flow diagram from the
<a href="http://www.ipcop.org/1.4.0/en/admin/html/section-firewall.html">IPCop administrative guide</a>.

<p>In visualizing the way in which traffic goes through the IPCop
firewall, we can see it as a sort of giant junction with a traffic
cop (literally, an IP Cop&mdash;hence the name!) in the middle of
it. When a car (in network parlance, a packet of data) reaches the
crossroads, the cop decides in which direction the packet should go
(based on the routing tables IPCop uses), and pushes it in the
appropriate direction.</p>

<p>In the case of a Green client accessing the Internet, we can see
from the previous table that this access is OPEN, so the cop allows
the traffic through. In other instances, however, this might not be
the case. If a Blue client tries to access a client on the Green
segment, for instance, the cop might allow the traffic through if
it comes over a VPN or through DMZ pinholes&mdash;but if a client
on the Blue segment has neither of these things explicitly allowing
the traffic, it is stopped. The car is pulled over, the occupants
victims of some virtual time in the cells!</p>

<p>Note that (generally) when we illustrate IPCop Configurations,
the Red interface is uppermost (North), the Orange interface is to
the left (West), the Blue interface is to the right (East), and the
Green interface is to the bottom (South).</p>

<h3>Altering IPCop Functionality</h3>

<p>As with many aspects of the behavior of the IPCop firewall, it
is possible to alter the behavior of the firewalling rules in order
to customize IPCop to meet a topology un-catered for by the default
rules. Within the context of the firewall rules, IPCop has had a
file since the 1.4-series release that allows users to specifically
add their own firewall rules (<code>/etc/rc.d/rc.firewall.local</code>). Since
version 1.3, there have been iptables chains, CUSTOMINPUT,
CUSTOMFORWARD, etc., allowing iptables rules to be added manually.
Specifically using iptables is out of our scope here, but we
recommend that interested readers read the 
<a href="http://www.linuxguruz.com/iptables/howto/">Linux iptables HOWTO</a>.
</p>

<h3>Topology One: NAT Firewall</h3>

<p>Our first topology exists as a drop-in replacement for the many
NAT firewalls that exist in the market. In small offices and homes,
solutions such as the embedded NAT firewalls sold by D-Link,
Linksys, and friends are frequently deployed in order to provide
small networks with cost-effective Internet access. Solutions such
as Internet Connection Sharing, a combined NAT firewall, DNS Proxy,
and DHCP Server, built into client editions of Windows since
Windows 98, are also frequently used in order to allow one PC with
a modem or network interface to act as a network gateway for other
clients. For our purposes here, we will consider ICS, as such a
topology with ICS is effectively a superset of the work required to
replace a router such as a Linksys or NETGEAR model as mentioned
previously. Our migration from one of these routers to IPCop would
be identical save for the decommissioning of the ICS software on
the client&mdash;if we remove the router, this is unnecessary and
the router can be left configured as-is (and/or kept as a backup,
or reused elsewhere) (See <a href="http://www.annoyances.org/exec/show/ics">http://www.annoyances.org/exec/show/ics</a> 
for more information on implementing (and consequently,
decommissioning) ICS on different Windows versions). Such
solutions, while cheap and convenient, are often not scalable or
reliable, and provide poor security. They open workstations up to
unnecessary security risks, provide limited throughput, and are
often unreliable, requiring frequent reboots and locking up.</p>

<p>As with software firewalls, a network firewall is designed as a
barrier in between your workstations and the Internet. By
connecting one of your workstations directly to the Internet and
using a solution like ICS, although you reduce the resources
required to share the internet connection, you expose that
workstation to unnecessary risk. There is also an obligation for
that PC to be on all the time&mdash;compared to a low-end PC with
no unnecessary components and a low-power PSU running IPCop, this
may be noisier, and have a higher power consumption.</p>

<p>IPCop offers a cost-effective replacement in such situations,
providing small businesses and home users with a powerful firewall
without the need for over-complexity, and adding other features not
present in embedded solutions or ICS, such as a customizable DHCP
Server, Intrusion Detection, a Proxy Server, and so on.</p>

<p>Such a topology ensures that firewalling is done before data
gets to clients, using a package designed to act as a network
firewall, greatly increasing the quality of service to clients as
well as the security that their network offers. In this situation,
the components of IPCop in use would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Green/Red zones</li>
<li>DHCP Server</li>
<li>DNS Server</li>
</ul>

<p>In such a situation, a network administrator or consultant might
also choose to enable any of the following pieces of functionality
in order to enhance the services provided to the network:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intrusion Detection</li>
<li>IPSec in order to allow remote work or remote support</li>
<li>Port Forwarding in order to allow remote access to VNC or
Terminal Services/Remote Desktop for a simplified model of remote
access for remote support (more convenient than IPSec although
inherently more insecure)</li>
</ul>

<p>Decommissioning of ICS in such a situation is quite
simple&mdash;we would merely disable the ICS functionality, as
depicted in the following screenshot (taken from the network
connections property of the external, internet-facing ICS network
interface). Removing ICS is as simple as deselecting the 'Allow
other network users to connect through this computer's Internet
connection' option. After we have done this, we should hit OK,
reboot if asked to, and then we are free to disable and/or remove
the external interface on the workstation (disable if we wish to
leave a second network card in the machine or if it has two onboard
cards, or remove if we are using an external modem or other piece
of hardware we intend to remove or install in our IPCop host).</p>

<img src="misc/dempster/screenshot-IPCop.png" alt=
"Windows ICS dialog" width="367" height="445" border="1" vspace="5"
hspace="5">

<p>Firewall rules for this topology are simple; as the Green
segment is automatically allowed to access resources on the Red
interface, there is no topology-specific setup required in order to
set this up. Another substantial benefit in deploying IPCop for
such a small office situation is that in the event that the
business is required to grow, the solution that it has is scalable.
Such a business running a handful of Windows workstations in a
workgroup may decide that a workgroup is insufficient for its needs
and that it requires centralized management, file storage, and
configuration.</p>

<p>IPCop, even in a pre-upgrade scenario like this, is advantageous
simply because it provides a built-in, open upgrade path. There is
no hardware or software upgrade required to move from simple NAT
and DHCP to a network with several network segments, port
forwarding, and a proxy server. If the Server already has several
network cards (and with the price of these nowadays, there's no
reason for it not to, if an expansion is anticipated), this can
even be done with little or no noticeable interruption in service
to existing clients.</p>

<h3>Topology Two: NAT Firewall with DMZ</h3>

<p>In a small office situation with a growing company, the need for
incoming email might force the activation of the Orange zone, and
the deployment and installation of a mail server in this segment.
Such a company might choose to keep its Desktop and Internal Server
infrastructure within the Green network segment and put their 
server in the DMZ on a switch/hub, or simply attached to the Orange
interface of the IPCop host using a crossover cable. As such
systems are exposed to the Internet, this segmentation provides a
considerable advantage by providing a 'stop line' past which it
would be harder for an intruder to escalate his or her access to
the network. Microsoft's Exchange mail server has for some time
supported such a configuration through the use of the 'front end'
and 'back end' exchange roles (although these roles will be
deprecated with future Exchange releases). With a different network
configuration however, such as Linux clients using a management
system such as Novell's eDirectory or RedHat's Directory Server
(RHDS), or a filtering appliance, a similar system with
externally-facing SMTP servers (perhaps running the open-source MTA
exim) would be equally beneficial.</p>

<p>In this topology, Clients are freely able to connect to the mail
server (whether via POP, IMAP, RPC, or RPC over HTTP). In order for
a mail server that exists as part of the network domain to
authenticate to the directory server, we would also need to open
the appropriate ports (contingent upon the directory provider) to
the directory server using the DMZ Pinholes feature.</p>

<p>We also have a Port Forwarding rule set up from the external IP
address of the IPCop firewall to port 25 on the mail server. This
allows external mail servers to connect to the mail server in order
to deliver email. In this topology, a compromise of the mail server
(which in the Green segment could compromise the entire network
segment) is controlled, as there is some level of protection
provided by the firewall.</p>

<p>In such a topology, we use the following capabilities of the
IPCop Firewall:</p>

<ul>
<li>Red, Orange, Green zones</li>
<li>DMZ Pinholes</li>
<li>DHCP Server</li>
<li>DNS Server</li>
<li>Port Forwarding to Orange segment</li>
</ul>

<p>We might also choose to employ any of the following elements of
functionality:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intrusion Detection System</li>
<li>Port Forwarding to web server on the mail server (for external
access of IMAP or Exchange mailboxes via a webmail solution such as
Horde, SquirrelMail, or Outlook Web Access) Proxy Server (for
desktop Internet access)</li>
<li>IPSec for remote access to Servers in the Green and Orange
segment or for external support</li>
<li>Back-end mail server with mailboxes in the Green zone, using
the Server in the Orange zone as a relay, performing anti-spam and
anti-virus scanning/filtering</li>
</ul>

<h3>Topology Three: NAT Firewall with DMZ and Wireless</h3>

<p>In a larger organization, or if the network above grew, we might
choose to expand our network topology using one or more IPCop
firewalls.</p>

<p>Several IPCop firewalls might be used by such an individual in
order to separate several sites, or in order to further segregate
one or more DMZs with physically distinct firewalls. It is also
worth considering that IPCop is designed primarily for networks in
which it is the only network firewall, in the Small and Medium
Business, and Home/Home Office market. Although it is possible to
set IPCop up in larger deployments, this is fairly rare, and there
are other packages that are arguably more suited to such
deployments. In such circumstances, the constraints of IPCop's
network segmentation begin to be more burdensome than they are
convenient, and the amount of work required to tailor IPCop to meet
an organization's needs may exceed the work it would take to
manually set up another firewall package to suit the same
topology.</p>

<p>In this example, we will consider the broadest scope in which
one IPCop box could be deployed, using all four network interfaces
to protect a network with an internal (Green) network, an Internet
or WAN connection (Red), a DMZ containing more than one Server
(Orange), and a wireless segment (Blue) with an IPSec VPN system.
In such a situation, we would almost certainly choose to deploy all
of the higher-end features that IPCop contains, such as the Proxy
Server and the Intrusion Detection System.</p>

<p>In this situation, the services we are providing for individual
network interfaces are as follows: On the Red Interface, in
addition to the default firewalling policy, we are invoking the
Port Forwarding feature to allow connections to the mail server on
port 25 in the DMZ, and also to port 443 (https) on the mail server
in order to allow connections to the business webmail system. We
are also allowing incoming IPSec connections to the IPCop firewall
in order to allow remote access to staff who work remotely and to
provide remote connectivity for support purposes for the IT Staff
and third-party software and hardware vendors.</p>

<p>On the Blue interface, we are providing connectivity via an
IPSec VPN for clients in order that they can access services run
from Servers internally on the Green segment and DMZ segment.
Vendors and visitors are allowed access to the Green segment
through use of WPA in pre-shared key mode configured on the
wireless access point.</p>

<p class="editorial">[ When using pre-shared keys make sure you use
the longest possible key combination straight from a good random source.
Even WPA cannot guard against the brute-forcing of weak keys. This
is also a fine reason for changing the pre-shared key 
periodically. -- Ren&eacute; ]
</p>

<p>WPA-PSK with solely an access point prevents access to the
wireless segment and the Internet by unauthorized users, and is an
adequate solution for most small and medium networks; use of a
newer, WPA2-PSK-capable access point increases this security more
for those without an access point or network infrastructure
implementing RADIUS or Certificate Services. The firewalling policy
and IPSec system ensures that visitors/vendors only have access to
the Red zone (the Internet), and not to any of the resources on the
network.</p>

<p>On the Orange interface, our pinholes allow the DMZ servers to
connect to a directory server and Kerberos domain controller in the
Green segment in order to authenticate users logging onto them via
the company directory system. This ensures that the policy and
configuration for these Servers is managed centrally, and that
there are logs stored centrally for them, but the damage that could
be caused by a compromise of these externally-facing services is
greatly minimized, ensuring business security and regulatory
compliance.</p>

<p>On the Green interface we allow connectivity to all interfaces;
 workstations and Servers within the Green segment are managed
service workstations on which users do not have the necessary level
of access to cause damage to the resources to which they have
access.</p>

<p class="editorial">[ Trojans have become very popular. This a
good reason to think about restricting the networked
machine access inside the Green network to proxies equipped with
intrusion detection/prevention software. -- Ren&eacute; ]
</p>

<p>In such a situation, we are making use of the following IPCop
features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Red, Orange, Green, Blue zones</li>
<li>DMZ Pinholes</li>
<li>DHCP Server</li>
<li>DNS Server</li>
<li>Port Forwarding to Orange segment</li>
<li>IPSec for remote access to Green, Orange, Blue segments</li>
<li>IPSec for access to internal resources by Blue users</li>
<li>Intrusion Detection System</li>
<li>Port Forwarding to web server on the Mail server
externally</li>
<li>Proxy Server (for desktop Internet access)</li>
</ul>

<p>In a larger organization, we may also choose to use IPSec in
site-to-site mode in order to link this office with one or more
branch or parent offices. In this role, as in the role of a single
network firewall, IPCop excels.</p>

<h1>Boosting Apache Performance by using Reverse Proxies</h1>

<p>
<p> Once upon not so very long ago, a lone Web server was in
distress. Countless Web browsers had laid siege to its port. The
bandwidth was exhausted; the CPUs were busy; the database was
moaning. The head of the IT department approached Pooz and me,
asking for an improvement. Upgrading either the hardware or the
Internet connection was not an option, so we tried to find out what
else we could do - caches to the rescue!</p>

<h2>Caches Wherever You Go</h2>

<p> Every computer lives on caching. Your CPU has one, your disk
drive, your operating system, your video card, and of course your
Web browser. Caches are designed to keep a copy of data that is
accessed often. The CPU caches can store instructions and data.
Instead of accessing system memory to get the next instruction or
piece of data, it retrieves it from the cache. The Web browser,
however, is more interested in caching files such as images,
cascading style sheets, documents, and the like. This speeds up Web
surfing, because certain format elements appear quite frequently in
Web pages. Rather than repeatedly downloading the same image or
file, it re-uses items found in the cache. This is especially true
if you look at generated pages from a content management system
(CMS). Now, if we can find a way of telling the Web browser that
its copy in the cache is valid, then we might save some of our
bandwidth at the Web server. In case of our CMS, which is Typo3, we
can also save both CPU time and database access, provided we can
publish the expiration time of generated HTML documents as well.
You can also insert an additional cache between Web browsers and
your server, to reduce server requests still further. This cache is
called a <em>reverse proxy</em>, sometimes called a <em>gateway</em>
or <em>surrogate</em> cache. Classical proxies work for their
clients, but a reverse proxy works for the server. This proxy also
has a disk and memory cache, which can be used to offload static
content from the Apache server. The following picture illustrates
where the caches are and what they do.</p>

<p> <img src="misc/pfeiffer/caches.png" alt=
"Overview of caches involved in Web browsing" width="463" height=
"380"></p>

<p> The green lines mark <em>cache hits</em>. A cache hit is valid
content (i.e., not expired) that is found in a cache and can be
copied from there. Hits often don't reach the Web server. Some
clients may ask the Web server if the content has already changed,
but this short question doesn't generate much traffic. The Web
server simply answers with a "HTTP/1.x 304 Not Modified" header and
no additional data. The red lines mark <em>cache misses</em>. A
miss occurs when the cache doesn't find the requested object and
requests it from the target server. It is then copied to disk or
memory and served to the client. Whenever another request is
forwarded to the cache, a local copy is used as long as it is
valid.</p>

<h2>Cache Control Headers</h2>

<p> How does a cache know when to use a local copy and when to ask
the server? Well, it depends. A browser cache looks for messages
from the Web server. The server can use cache control headers to
give advice. Let's look at an example. The request "GET
http://www.luchs.at/linuxgazette/index.html HTTP/1.1" fetches a Web
page whose HTTP headers look like this.</p>

<pre>
HTTP/1.x 200 OK
Date: Tue, 03 Oct 2006 10:24:35 GMT
Server: Apache
Last-Modified: Mon, 02 Oct 2006 02:04:36 GMT
Etag: "e324ac5-6d7d5500"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Cache-Control: max-age=142800
Expires: Thu, 05 Oct 2006 02:04:36 GMT
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Length: 3028
Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1
X-Cache: MISS from bazaar.office.lan
X-Cache-Lookup: MISS from bazaar.office.lan:3128
Via: 1.0 bazaar.office.lan:3128 (squid/2.6.STABLE1)
Proxy-Connection: keep-alive
</pre>

<p>The server gives you the HTML document. In addition, the HTTP header
contains the following fields:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Last-Modified:</em> indicates when the document was last
changed.</li>
<li><em>Cache-Control:</em> tells any cache between the server and
the browser that the document may be cached for 142800
seconds.</li>
<li><em>Expires:</em> tells any cache when the document is
definitely out of date.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Cache-Control:</em> is better than <em>Expires:</em>, because
the latter requires the machines to use a synchronised time source.
<em>Cache-Control:</em> is more general but only valid for HTTP
1.1. There is some data included that wasn't sent by the Apache
server. The last four HTTP header fields were inserted by the local
Squid proxy in our office. It tells us that we made a cache miss.</p>

<h2>Server Side Cache Configuration</h2>

<p>Now let's turn to our servers, and see what we can configure
there.</p>

<h3>Apache's mod_expires</h3>

<p> Even though the <em>Cache-Control:</em> is better, we first look
at a way to generate an <em>Expires:</em> header for served
content. The Apache Web server has a module for this called
mod_expires. Most distributions include it in their Apache version.
You can also compile it as a module and insert it after installing
your own Apache. Either way, you now have the possibility to create
<em>Expires:</em> headers, either in the global configuration or
per virtual host. A sample setup could look like this (for Apache
2.0.x):</p>

<pre>
&lt;IfModule mod_expires.c&gt;
    ExpiresActive On
    ExpiresByType text/html "modification plus 3 days"
    ExpiresByType text/xml  "modification plus 3 days"
    ExpiresByType image/gif "access plus 4 weeks"
    ExpiresByType image/jpg "access plus 4 weeks"
    ExpiresByType image/png "access plus 4 weeks"
    ExpiresByType video/quicktime "access plus 2 months"
    ExpiresByType audio/mpeg "access plus 2 months"
    ExpiresByType application/pdf "modification plus 2 months"
    ExpiresByType application/ps "modification plus 2 months"
    ExpiresByType application/xml "modification plus 2 weeks"
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>

<p>The first line activates the module. If you forget it, mod_expires
won't do anything. The remaining lines set the expiration period
per MIME type. mod_expires automatically calculates and inserts a
<em>Cache-Control:</em> header as appropriate, which is nice. You
can use either "modification plus ..." or "access plus ...".
"modification" works only with files that Apache reads from disk.
This means that you have to use "access" if you want to set expires
headers for dynamically generated content, as well. <strong>Be
careful!</strong> Although CGI scripts are required to set their
own expiration date in the past to guarantee immediate reloads -
some developers don't care. mod_expires will break badly written
CGIs - harshly. Once, I spent an hour digging through horrible code
to find out why a login script didn't work anymore. The developer
had forgotten to set the expiration time correctly, so I adapted
the server config for this particular virtual host as a workaround.
Also, be sure to select suitable expiration periods. The above
values are examples. You might have different requirements,
depending on how frequently your content changes.</p>

<h3>Squid Reverse Proxy</h3>

<p> The Squid proxy has a metric ton of configuration directives. If
you have no experience with a Squid proxy, this can seem a bit
overwhelming, at first. Therefore, I present only a minimal config
file, that does what we intend to do. The capabilities of Squid are
worth a second look, though. I will assume we are running a
Squid proxy 2.6.x installed from source and installed in
<tt>/usr/local/squid/</tt>.</p>

<p> The reverse proxy assumes the place of the original Web server.
It has to intercept every request, in order to compare it with its
cache content. Let's assume we have two machines:</p>

<ul>
<li>stingray.example.net serving http://www.example.net/
(172.16.23.42)</li>
<li>squid.example.net (172.16.23.43)</li>
</ul>

<p>The local <tt>/usr/local/squid/etc/squid.conf</tt> defines what our
Squid should do. We begin with the IP addresses, and tell it to
listen for incoming requests on port 80.</p>

<pre>
http_port       172.16.23.43:80 vhost vport
http_port       127.0.0.1:80
icp_port        0
cache_peer      172.16.23.42 parent 80 0 originserver default
</pre>

<p>ICP denotes the Internet Cache Protocol. We don't need it, and turn
it off by using port 0. <em>cache_peer</em> tells our reverse proxy
to forward every request it cannot handle to the Web server. Next,
we have to define the access rules. In contrast to the situation with
client proxies, a reverse proxy for a public Web server has to answer
requests for everybody. <strong>Warning:</strong> This is a good reason
not to mix forward and reverse proxies, or you will end up with an open
proxy, which is a bad thing.</p>

<pre>
acl         all src 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0
acl         manager proto cache_object
acl         localhost src 127.0.0.1/255.255.255.255
acl         accel_hosts dst 172.16.23.42 172.16.23.43
http_access allow accel_hosts
http_access allow manager localhost
http_access deny manager
http_access deny all
deny_info   http://www.example.net/ all
</pre>

<p>The <em>acl</em> lines define groups. <em>accel_hosts</em> are our
two servers. <em>http_access allow accel_hosts</em> allows everyone
to access these servers. The other lines are from the Squid default
configuration, and deactivate the cache manager URL. We don't need
this right now. The last line is a safeguard against unwanted error
pages. (Squid has a set of its own: they differ from the Apache
error pages.) Users are sent to our front page, in case there are
any troubles with requests. You can view the <a href=
"misc/pfeiffer/squid.conf.txt">full squid.conf</a> seperately,
because the rest "only" deals with the cache setup and tuning. (Take
care: the config is taken from a server with 2 GB RAM and lots of
disks. You might want to reduce the cache memory size.) As I said,
Squid is capable of doing many wonderful things. As soon as 
Squid is up and running, we are ready to send our users to the
reverse proxy.</p>

<h3>Statistics</h3>

<p> You have to be careful, if you rely on accurate statistics from
your Web server logs. A good deal of HTTP requests will be
intercepted by the Squid reverse proxy. This means that the Apache
server sees fewer requests, and that they originate from the IP
address of the proxy server. That was the very idea of our setup.
You can collect Apache-like logs on Squid, if you change the log
format.</p>

<pre>
logformat       combined %{Host}&gt;h %&gt;a %ui %un [%tl] "%rm %ru  HTTP/%rv" %Hs %&lt;st "%{Referer}&gt;h" "%{User-Agent}&gt;h" %Ss:%Sh
logformat       vcombined %{Host}&gt;h %&gt;a %ui %un [%tl] "%rm %ru  HTTP/%rv" %Hs %&lt;st "%{Referer}&gt;h" "%{User-Agent}&gt;h"
access_log      /var/log/squid/access.log combined
access_log      /var/log/squid/vaccess.log vcombined
</pre>

<p>In order to incorporate them into your log analysis, you have to
copy the logs from the reverse proxy and merge them with your
Apache logs. As soon as your Web setup uses a proxy or even load
balancing techniques, maintaining accurate statistics gets quite
tricky.</p>

<h3>Activating the Cache</h3>

<p> After you have configured Apache and Squid, you are ready to test
everything. Start with a single virtual host reserved for testing
purposes. Change the DNS records to point to the reverse proxy
machine. Check the logs. Surf around. Analyse the headers. When you
are confident, move the other DNS records. A side note for
debugging: You can force a "real" reload in Internet Explorer and
Mozilla Firefox if you hold down the shift key while pressing the
"Reload" button. An ordinary reload may just hit the local cache,
now.</p>

<p> You won't get a good impression of what's changed, just by
looking at the logs. I recommend a monitoring system with
statistics, Munin, for example, so that you can graphically see what
your servers are doing. I have two graphs from testing servers,
taken during a load simulation.</p>

<p> <img src=
"misc/pfeiffer/squid.example.net-squid_requests-day.png" alt=
"Graph showing requests per day for the Squid proxy" width="497"
height="296"> <img src=
"misc/pfeiffer/stingray.example.net-apache_accesses-day.png" alt=
"Graph showing requests per day for the Apache server" width="497"
height="268"></p>

<p>In the first graph, red shows cache misses; green shows cache hits.
Below, you can see the hits on the Apache server behind the reverse
proxy. The shape of the graphs is similar, but keep in mind that
all requests shown in green on the Squid server never reach the
Apache, and thus reduce the load. If you compare the results, you
will see that only one in two of the requests gets through to the
Apache server.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p> Now, you know what you can achieve using the resources of
Apache and Squid. Our Web server handled the traffic spikes well,
the CPU load went down by 50%, and all the surfers were happy again.
You can do a lot more, if you use multiple Internet connections and
load balancing on the firewall or your router. Fortunately, we
didn't need to do that in our case.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<pre>
But you know nowadays
It's the old man
He's got all the money
And a young man ain't got nothin' in the world these days

- The Who `Young Man Blues'
</pre>

<p>Laptops are fine, if you can afford them. Even if you cannot afford
one, often enough the situation arises that computer work has to be
done at home - whether you are studying, doing business charts,
programming, Web designing....</p>

<p>This article presents a reliable and truly cheap alternative to
buying a laptop for keeping up with work/study demands.</p>


<h3>Scripting, not purchasing</h3>

<img src="misc/renker/le_stick_du_USB.jpg"
     width="170" height="141" border="0"
     alt="USB stick image" align="right">

<p>My situation forced me to prepare work at home, but a laptop was far
too expensive. Perhaps due to the popularity of laptops, it is actually
<em>much</em> cheaper to buy a second-hand PC. A portable hard drive would
have been a nice thing, but requires synchronising directory content
between three locations - the portable drive, the computers at home, and
those at work.</p>

<p>The solution presented here is possibly the cheapest possible and
based on an inexpensive USB stick; the required `intelligence' to
reliably synchronise directories is provided by a set of scripts. Unlike
hardware-based solutions, this works across different distributions and
even operating systems.  The principle is simple, but there are a number
of subtle problems that have been ironed out during three years of use
(with my second-hand PC) on a daily basis.</p>


<h3>Overview</h3>


<p>The USB directory synchroniser consists of the following:</p>
<ol>
   <li>A <em>central Perl script</em> to track file modification times.</li>
   <li>A mode of <em>mounting</em> the stick which ensures file integrity.</li>
   <li><em>Add-ons</em> to the script, such as timestamping, additional archives, and command execution.</li>
   <li><em>Subsidiary scripts</em> for adding/reading important notes and remote command execution.</li>
</ol>

<p>This all is too much for one article; hence, the basic functionality
(first two items) is covered by this article, the remaining items
follow in a subsequent part.</p>

<p>This part starts with a reduced, but fully functional <a
href="misc/renker/pack_bare_bones.pl.txt">`bare-bones' script</a>, to
explain core functionality, how to set up, and how to hack it. When the
<a href="misc/renker/pack.pl.txt">full script</a> follows in part II,
its functionality will then be obvious - it is not more complex, but
just has more bells and whistles.</p>

<p>If you are a Perl hacker, you should feel at liberty to skim through the
following sections and move on to the more complex version.</p>



<h2>Reliable archives versus removable media</h2>

<p>The daily archive has a fixed name; mine is called
`<em>actual.2</em>' and is located in <tt>$flashdir</tt>:</p>

<pre class="code">
$flashdir =  ${ENV}{'VOL'} || "/vol/flash";
$tarfile  = "$flashdir/actual.2";
</pre>

<p>The first line sets the mount point, which can be overridden using
the <tt>VOL</tt> environment variable. (For example, you could say
<tt>export VOL=/vol/floppy</tt> and store the archive on a floppy
disk.)</p>

<p>Mounting happens as with any other filesystem (e.g., hard drive
partitions), but with one important difference: the system may be able
to tell when a USB stick is inserted, but it can <em>not</em> reliably
tell or sync any unflushed file system buffers when the stick is pulled
out. As convenient as the `storage media' icons are on Gnome/KDE
desktops, I have found them unsatisfactory for the purpose of archiving:
more than once I have ended up with corrupt, half-full archives, this
way.  Therefore, a different alternative is presented here; and there is
additional provision to make sure that the archive does indeed end up on
the USB stick.</p>


<h3>Mounting the USB stick</h3>

<p>The safest bet, but tedious, is to always <tt>mount(8)</tt> /
<tt>umount(8)</tt> the stick:</p>

<pre class="code">
mount -t vfat  /dev/sda1 /vol/flash
</pre>

<p>USB uses the SCSI subsystem; therefore, in most cases the first USB
stick stuck into your  computer will appear as <tt>/dev/sda1</tt>; check
this via <tt>dmesg</tt> and/or in <tt>/var/log/messages</tt>.</p>

<p>A better alternative to manual mounting is the automounter, which
auto-mounts a directory the first time one tries to access (read) it;
and umounts automatically after a fixed timeout.</p>


<h3>Automatic mounting</h3>

<p>Most, if not all, systems come with the automounter per default
(<tt>man autofs(8)</tt>); it is started at boot-time via
<tt>/etc/init.d/autofs</tt>. The automounter is configured via so-called
`map' files, which designate the mapping from hardware devices (such as
<tt>/dev/sda1</tt>) to mountpoints.</p> The first file to consider is <a
href="misc/renker/auto.master.txt">/etc/auto.master</a> which contains
but one line:</p>

<tt>/vol  /etc/auto.vol      --timeout=20</tt>

<p>This instructs autofs to consult the file <tt>auto.vol</tt> in all
matters of volatile media. The file <a
href="misc/renker/auto.vol.txt">/etc/auto.vol</a> then contains the
actual map; the relevant entry is the following:</p>

<pre class="code">
flash  -fstype=auto,dirsync,user,umask=000,exec,noatime,shortname=winnt :/dev/sda1
</pre>

<p>
The above line can be parsed into three distinct sections: mountpoint under
<tt>/vol</tt>, mount options, and the device to be mounted. (To create the
all mountpoints, use <tt>mkdir -vp /vol/{flash,floppy,cdrom}</tt> under
<tt>bash</tt>; see <a href="misc/renker/auto.vol.txt">the file</a> for the
configuration of floppy/cdrom).  The fstype is <em>auto</em>matically
detected; but I can only recommend to stick with vfat: using ext2/3 will
trigger unpleasant <tt>fsck</tt>-ing at boot time. Important for electronic
filesystems such as USB sticks are <em>dirsync</em> and <em>noatime</em>, as these
reduce the number of device accesses (limited by component lifetime). For
the remaining options, see <tt>mount(8)</tt>.  </p>

<p>After creating and editing these two files (with the correct settings
for your stick), you should be able to do a `<tt>/etc/init.d/autofs
restart</tt>' and see contents of your flash directory via `<tt>ls -l
/vol/flash'</tt>.  If so, you are ready to experiment with <a
href="misc/renker/pack_bare_bones.pl.txt">the script</a> and its <a
href="misc/renker/pack.list-example.txt">configuration file</a> (if it
is copied into <tt>/etc/pack.list</tt>, make sure that you have write
access). The automounter should best be enabled at boot time (Fedora/RH:
<tt>chkconfig --list autofs</tt>, Debian: <tt>update-rc.d -n autofs
defaults</tt>).</p> <p>The script works very well with automounting:
before doing anything, it will first try to access the
<tt>$flashdir</tt>.  If it cannot access, after several repeated
attempts it will give up with a warning message.</p>

<p>The remainder of the article now describes how the script works. (You
can also see debug output by setting the shell variable <tt>debug</tt>
to &gt; 4.)  </p>



<h2>Functioning of the core script</h2>

<p>The <a href="misc/renker/pack_bare_bones.pl.txt">main, bare-bones
script</a>, which we will now take apart, uses <em>Perl built-ins</em> for
things that have to run fast (such as traversing directories and
creating lists), and <em>calls other programs</em> (such as <tt>tar</tt>)
for everything else.</p>

<p>The following requirements made a script inevitable:</p>
<ul>

  <li> <em>directories</em>: tar  will happily add <em>all and any
subdirectories</em>, if one is not very careful. For example, if you
modified <tt>/usr/src/linux/.config</tt> and use `<tt>find
/usr/src/linux/ -mtime -1'</tt> to track your latest files,
<tt>find</tt> will include the directory <tt>/usr/src/linux/</tt> as
well.  Now, instead of a 10KB tar file, you would end up with 40..100MB
(which will take painfully long, especially if the PC has USB 1.1).</li>


  <li> <em>symlinks</em> are a real pain: you can either choose between
dereferencing (-h) or without, but both is not possible.</li>

  <li><em>maintainability</em>: it is all well to do `<tt>tar -zcvf
archive.tgz  someDir</tt>', but gets soon out of hand once a mixture of
files in different locations is involved</li>

  <li> <em>configurability</em>: re-programming scripts every day is
tedious, one <em>configuration file</em> is used instead to list all
relevant files and directories</li>

</ul>

<dl>
<dt><em><strong>Functional Principle:</strong></em></dt>
<dd>A configuration file is used to keep track of the important files and directories.</dd> 
<dd>To take home (on the USB stick) all tracked files home that changed during the last <tt>x</tt> days, 
    the script is called with the <tt>--days x option</tt>.</dd>
<dd>At home, the archive is unpacked using the <tt>--unpack</tt> option. 
    This works in both directions (from home to work, and from work to home).</dd>
</dl>

<h3>User interaction</h3>

<p>An important program called by this script is <strong>(g)dialog</strong>,
which provides GUI dialogs (example error box in <a
href="misc/renker/error-dialog.png">dialog</a> and in <a
href="misc/renker/error-gdialog.png">gdialog</a>):</p>

<pre class="code">
$dialog = ($ENV{'DISPLAY'} &amp;&amp; (qx#which gdialog 2&gt;/dev/null#))? "gdialog" : "dialog";
</pre>


<p>On the console, <tt>dialog</tt> is called; under X,  <tt>gdialog</tt>
is used for the same purposes. The <tt>qx/.../</tt> statement chooses
dialog in both cases if gdialog is not available. On a Debian system,
you can install both via <tt>apt-get install dialog zenity</tt> (gdialog
is in the zenity package); similar for other distros.</p>

<p>For the rest of the <em>user interaction</em>, the pager
<tt>$less</tt> is used, and we have the logging function:</p>

<pre class="code">
sub log {
   printf STDERR "\033[1;34;7m@_\033[m\n";
}
</pre>

<p>The funny digits are <em>ANSI escape sequences</em> to colour the
output (a screenshot is <a
href="misc/renker/console_listing.png">here</a>); good examples of using
these can be found elsewhere in LG.  Since Perl already has a
<tt>log</tt>(-arithm) function, we need to make clear which log we want;
hence above function will be invoked as <tt>::log()</tt> (which is an
abbreviation for <tt>main::log()</tt>).</p>


<h3>Core blocks of the script</h3>

<p>The bare-bones script can already do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>unpack</strong> the archive from USB stick  (<tt>--unpack</tt> option)</li>
  <li> <strong>create</strong> a new archive   (default when no option is given, <tt>--yes</tt> overwrites)</li>
  <li> restrict the <b>age</b> of tracked files to <tt>n</tt> days     (<tt>--days n</tt> option)</li>
  <li> <strong>list</strong> those files in tracked directories that have changed during   the last <tt>n</tt> days
           (<tt>--list</tt> option)</li>
</ul>

<p>In increasing order of complexity, we will consider (1) listing, (2)
un-packing, (3) packing, and (4) building the file list.</p>



<h3>1) Listing files that have changed</h3>

<p>This is easy, <tt>$see</tt> is true when the <tt>--list</tt> option
is set:</p>

<pre class="code">
if ( $see ) {
   build_list();
   system "$less $list";
}
</pre>

The <tt>build_list()</tt> function hides all the complexity of parsing,
collating, and checking; it is discussed later. The third line calls our
pager `<tt>$less</tt>' (<tt>PAGER</tt> environment variable) on the
newly created <tt>$list</tt>.

<h3>2) Un-packing an archive</h3>

<p>Un-packing is done by invoking the script with the <tt>--unpack</tt>
option.  On my system, I have found it useful to use the following
<em>alias</em> (the <tt>pack</tt> script is in <tt>~/bin</tt> and
<tt>~/.bashrc</tt> contains: <tt>export PATH=~/bin:$PATH</tt>):</p>

<pre class="code">
alias unpack="pack --unpack"
</pre>


Un-packing is described by the following <em>pseudo-code</em>:
<ol>
  <li> check if archive was created on this host  </li>
  <li> call <tt>unpack()</tt>, a wrapper around `<tt>tar -jxpPvf $tarfile</tt>' </li>
  <li> display errors encountered in (2), if any </li>
</ol>

<p>Step (1) is important: if you accidentally left an archive on the
stick and then, not knowingly, unpack it some days later, it will
silently overwrite your files with the older files stored in the
archive. This has happened to me several times, but the remedy is both
simple and very efficient.</p>

<p>Tar has a rich set of features, stemming from the old days when it
was used as Tape ARchiver. That is, it supports storing archives on
several different (tape) volumes and with the <tt>--label=myLabel</tt>
option, these volume archives can be given individual names. You can
view the volume name of an archive by using <tt>-t</tt> to list an
archive, the volume label appears in the first line.  So, in the present
case, the volume names are simply set to the fully-qualified
<tt>hostname(1)</tt> of the system. (This assumes that different PCs have
different <tt>hostname</tt>.)</p>




<h3>3) Archiving what has changed in the past days</h3>

<p>The inverse operation to unpacking is simple, all the complexity is
in <tt>build_list()</tt>:</p>

<pre class="code">
  ::log "Creating backup archive file ...";
  system "tar -jcpPvf $tarfile --label $hostname --files-from=$list 2>$log";
  if ($? != 0) {
       unlink $tarfile;
       error "Tar Problem!\nDeleting archive $tarfile";
  }
  ::log "Syncing ...";
  system "sync; sync;";

  ::log "Testing file integrity:";
  system "bzip2 -tvv $tarfile";
</pre>

<p>The <tt>$tarfile</tt> is created with the files from <tt>$list</tt>,
the volume label is set to the <tt>$hostname</tt>. In case of error, the
archive is deleted (<tt>unlink</tt>-ed) and an error window will pop up.
Otherwise, <tt>sync(1)</tt> is called twice to flush filesystem buffers.
The subsequent file integrity test provides additional protection
against removing the USB stick before all of the data has been safely
transferred. (This is a common problem with removable media, and it is
good to be cautious, here.)</p>

<h3>4a) Building the file list: <em>parsing configuration file</em></h3>

<p>The <tt>build_list()</tt> routine adds intelligent functionality
around the tar program: it processes the contents of a configuration
file in such a manner that only files changed in the last few days are
passed on to tar, without adding unwanted subdirectories, but with full
expansion of symlinks.</p>

<p>The complexity that this requires is hidden behind recursion (a
function calling itself again), which is a good working principle, since
directories are themselves recursive: a sub-sub-directory is a directory
in a directory is a directory in a directory ... :-)</p>

<p>Let's look at the main loop, which parses the file <tt>$config</tt>.</p>

<pre class="code">
while(&lt;&gt;) {
    strip_comments_and_leading_whitespace();
    next if $line_is_empty;

    my @arr = split;                  # put all single words into @arr

    if ($arr[0] = m/&lt;\s*rec\s*&gt;/i)       {  # line starts with &lt;REC&gt;
       shift @arr;
       getLinkedFiles(@arr);
    } elsif ($arr[0] = m/&lt;\s*link\s*&gt;/i) {  # line starts with &lt;LINK&gt;
       shift @arr;
       readLink(@arr);
    } else {                          # this is a `normal' line
       foreach (@arr) {
         if (m#[{*]#) {               # e.g. /home/gerrit/{.bash*,.exrc,bin/*}
             let_bash_expand_entry();
         } elsif ( -d ) {             # a single directory: traverse
             getLinkedFiles($_);
         } else {                     # a file or a link: just print to list
             printf "$_\n";
         }
       }
    }
 }
</pre>

<p>The configuration file contains file/directory names on each line;
bash shell-globbing syntax is allowed. (In this case, bash is actually
used to expand entries.) Configuration lines starting with &lt;LINK&gt;
mean "<em>I want this symlink to be followed, but I don't care about deep
directory traversal</em>".  You get the full works of directory traversal
plus symlink expansion with deep recursion by using the &lt;REC&gt; tag.
<a href="misc/renker/pack.list-example.txt">Here</a> is an example
configuration file which illustrates the principle.</p>

<p>The <tt>while()</tt> loop iterates over each line of the
<tt>$config</tt> file.  The <tt>split</tt> statement separates single
words into the array <tt>@arr</tt>.  Hence, when a line starts with a
&lt;LINK&gt; or &lt;REC&gt; tag, we need to remove that tag from
<tt>@arr</tt> before passing it as argument to one of the functions;
this is handled by the <tt>shift</tt> statement.  All output from the
invoked subroutines is redirected to the <tt>TMPLIST</tt> temporary
file, containing the expanded list of files, resolved symlinks, and
traversed directories.</p>

<p>We now briefly  look at <tt>getLinkedFiles()</tt>, which maintains a
hash-list <tt>%KNOWN</tt> to avoid cycles and proceeds differently by
these cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li> plain files are just added</li>
  <li> symlinks are resolved via <tt>readlink_recurse()</tt></li>
  <li> directories are only added if their contents are all new;
       otherwise <tt>getLinkedFiles()</tt> is called on the directory contents </li>
</ul>

<p>The <tt>readlink_recurse()</tt> routine in turn calls
<tt>getLinkedFiles()</tt> to resolve new file entries; it contains a
logic to avoid getting lost in symlink loops. This can be a bad trap
otherwise (try e.g. this: <tt>ln -s a b; ln -s b a; namei a</tt>).</p>



<h3>4b) Sort out the temporary filelists: build_list()</h3>

<p>To pick those files that have changed during the last <tt>$days</tt>
days, <tt>build_list()</tt> uses a simple trick: it rewinds the start
time <tt>$^T</tt> (Perl special variable) of the script by this amount
in seconds.  This means that, once file modification times are tested,
Perl already thinks it is executing <tt>$days</tt> back in history:</p>

<tt>$^T -= $days * 24 * 3600;</tt>

<p> The following is the <em>final processing</em> of the file list, refining 
    <tt>TMPLIST</tt> into <tt>LIST</tt>:</p>

<pre class="code">
while(&lt;TMPLIST&gt;) {
    chomp;
    s#/[^/]+/(\.\.)+/(\S+)#/$2#g;
    error "FATAL:\n \"$_\"\n--$!\n" unless -e $_;

    next if ( (-M ) >= 0 );
    print LIST "$_\n" unless $KNOWN{$_}++;
}
</pre>

<p>After <tt>chomp()</tt>ing the `<tt>\n</tt>', pathnames containing
`..' are normalised: for example, <tt>/usr/local/lib/wx/../../bin/wx2
is</tt> reduced to <tt>/usr/local/bin/wx2</tt>.  If the file does not
exist (e.g., due to a broken symlink), an error message is produced. (An
example output is <a href="misc/renker/error-gdialog.png">here</a>.)</p>

<p>The <em>file age test `-M'</em> returns the time since the file
(<tt>$_</tt>) was last modified; a negative modification age means that
the file was modified in the future. Relative to the rewound start time
<tt>$^T</tt>, this means: all files created during the last
<tt>$days</tt> until now will appear with a negative modification time;
and thus be added to the list.  Last, the filename is printed into the
<tt>LIST</tt> unless it has been encountered before (indicated by a
non-null entry in the hashlist <tt>%KNOWN</tt>).</p>

<p>That's it, the list is built, the file closed, and it's passed on to
<tt>tar</tt> to create the archive.</p>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This part of the article has described how to use a USB stick for
daily directory synchronisation between two non-networked computers. The
principle has been presented on a scaled-down (but fully functional) <a
href="misc/renker/pack_bare_bones.pl.txt">script</a>.  The next part
will introduce additional functionality that simplifies the usage and
makes it robust for many day-to-day situations.</p>

<p>In summary, using USB sticks for synchronising directories between
home and workplace is an efficient, workable, and very cost-effective
solution. Some companies now even give away USB sticks for free, thereby
contributing to a significant reduction in Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
of the solution presented in this article.</p>

<h1>Booting a Linux Box via a USB Micro Drive (USB-MD)</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/sevenich.html">Dr. Richard Sevenich</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<h3>Problem to Solve</h3>

<p>
The situation can typically arise at an educational institution or in a
training environment where a general purpose (Linux-based or not) computer
laboratory is set up to allow student users access to a lab machines, but
not super user (root) access. The machines will typically be set up via the
BIOS to boot to the hard drive first, so that the systems cannot be
subverted by inserting a bootable CD ROM or bootable floppy. Of course, a
BIOS password is required in order to change BIOS settings. However, there
will often exist a group, e.g. an advanced operating systems class, where
Linux is required and super user access is essential. It is undesirable to
give this group super user access to the regular system or BIOS password
access.
</p> 

<p>
We would like to at least achieve a set-up where the normal users of the
computer laboratory can conduct business as before while the advanced
users can boot into a separate configuration where they have super user
privileges. We do not want the advanced users to require root access to
the the configuration for normal users, because the advanced users will
be routinely modifying and occasionally breaking the system. In
summary, the goal is that
</p>

<ul>
<li>normal users automatically get a normal system upon boot without super user privileges</li>
<li>advanced users automatically get a hackable system upon boot with super user privileges</li>
</ul>

<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>

<p>
The proposed solution is to be implemented by the system administrator, who
has super user access, knowledge of needed passwords, etc. Once the
solutions are implemented, the system administrator can once again go hide
in his/her cave.  We start by modifying the BIOS to boot the system with a
bootable CD.  For our case study, we chose Xubuntu-6.06.1 as our bootable
CD. The 6.10 version is not yet available at this writing. Xubuntu, not
using KDS or Gnome, presumably has somewhat smaller footprint than the
equivalent Ubuntu or Kubuntu versions. This could be important since our
ultimate installation target is a USB micro drive (USB-MD). It may also run
a bit faster on that hardware target than its more top heavy cousins, which
is also an issue with today's 3600 RPM USB-MD.
</p>

<p>
Our solution assumes that the machine to be used allows booting from the
MBR of the USB-MD when the BIOS is appropriately configured. In this case,
we place a master boot record (MBR) on the USB-MD. The advanced user can
then insert this USB-MD into a laboratory computer and reboot the system
into Xubuntu. A normal user has no such USB-MD and when a reboot is
attempted the system will boot first from the hard drive MBR, hence into
the normal operating system configuration.
</p>

<strong>Some Advantages:</strong>

<ul>
<li>the USB-MD is very portable (e.g. 2"x2"x0.5"), does not require a
separate power supply, and is relatively inexpensive (academic students
would find that the USB-MD price is similar to that of a textbook) </li>

<li>it can be assigned to or purchased by the user who can then use it at
home as well</li>

<li>if the USB-MD is not inserted before booting, the machine boots to the
default hard drive partition - as desired for the more general
population</li>
</ul>

<strong>Some Disadvantages:</strong>
<ul>
<li>the machines in the original computer laboratory are now less secure
because there is a new user class with root access to the machine</li>

<li>although the USB-MD could be used at home, modifications to the
installation may be needed e.g. because the graphics card may differ, the
usb discovery order may differ, etc. Such problems can be surmounted, but
require some expertise </li>
</ul>

<p>
The first disadvantage is ameliorated if the laboratory is a teaching
laboratory holding no sensitive data, essentially just information (e.g.
configuration, applications) that would be inconvenient to reconstruct from
the backup media. Further, if malice is not present, there is little
likelihood that the machines would be compromised. It is assumed, for
example, that the Xubuntu installation on the USB-MD would be configured so
that it would not automatically mount the hard drive partitions at bootup.
So the advanced user would have to overtly violate the laboratory protocol
to compromise the normal system.  The second disadvantage has various
cures. We already mentioned overt modifications such as using a different
/etc/X11/xorg.conf for different target machines. Perhaps more attractive
would be to employ a USB-MD with large enough capacity to create two
Xubuntu installations - one for the laboratory environment and the other
for home use.  Whichever one was booted should also mount the other, for
easy data transfer and backup. Alternatively, the two separate
installations could share a common /home directory in its own partition. At
this writing, for this author's purposes, a 10 GB USB-MD would appear to
fit that purpose nicely. Maybe one will appear at birthday time.
</p>

<h3>Rejected Solutions</h3>

<p>
The bootable CD with a companion USB stick for storage is also a potential
solution, but doesn't work as well for the problem space envisioned. For
example, if kernel recompilation and redeployment is an area of
investigation (e.g. investigating the implementation of new system calls)
or if changing major portions of the root file system are fair game, one
either burns a new CD to try the results or moves more and more of the
system to the USB stick. Because the USB has a more limited capacity, the
USB-MD solution rather naturally evolves.
</p>

<p>
Another possibility is just to make the laboratory machine dual/multi boot,
so it can boot into the 'normal user' Linux or the 'advanced-user' Linux.
There are several serious drawbacks. First, the advanced user cannot change
the USB-MD boot configuration for grub (or lilo) because that resides on
the hard drive and requires super user privileges. Of course, the advanced
user merely needs to boot the USB-MD and mount the hard drive to make such
changes. However, our protocol is to avoid having the advanced user mount
the hard drives, to prevent inadvertent damage. Second, the normal user can
boot into the 'advanced user' Linux. This would likely be unsuccessful, but
is still undesirable.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps yet another solution involves virtualization. This may ultimately
be viable, but the author's current understanding of one such approach, Xen
Virtualization, indicates that within the sandbox of a sub domain the user
may be given super user privileges, but such tasks as kernel recompilation
and redeployment will require super user access at the hypervisor level.
</p>

<h3>Case Study</h3>

<p>
The case study was conducted in the Computer Science department at
Malaspina University-College in Nanaimo, BC, Canada. The Linux box used was
one from a recently configured laboratory. The USB-MD was the property of
the author.
</p> 

<h4>Case Study - Equipment</h4>

<p>
The salient hardware details are these:
</p>

<pre>
Linux box vendor          -&gt;   recent Seanix purchase
BIOS vendor               -&gt;   Intel
BIOS version              -&gt;   NT94510J.86A.3813.2006.0411.1332
USB-MD vendor             -&gt;   T-one
USB-MD capacity           -&gt;   5 GB
</pre>

<h4>Case Study - Installing Xubuntu on the USB-MD</h4>

<p>
The basic steps here are
</p>
<ul>
<li>download the Xubuntu iso</li>

<li>burn the Xubuntu live CD, ensuring that it verifies correctly</li>

<li>boot the machine, where the BIOS has already been configured to boot from CD first</li>

<li>wait for the Xubuntu live CD system to boot completely</li>

<li>insert the USB-MD in a usb slot </li>

<li>wait for the icon to appear, indicating that the USB-MD has been recognized</li>

<li>click on the install icon</li>

<li>carry out installation to the USB-MD (no detailed instructions
here; it is a minor variant of a typical Xubuntu install, which is well
documented elsewhere)</li>

<li>subsequently ensure (with fdisk, menu option 'a') that the boot
flag is set for the USB-MD partition to be booted; the Xubuntu live CD
installation doesn't appear to do this automatically </li>
</ul>

<p>
[Note: Xubuntu should also provide an option to install to the hard drive, which we do not want here.]
</p>

<p>
When the USB-MD installation has completed, choose to reboot the system,
removing the CD at the appropriate time (typically, it will be ejected). At
the very start of reboot, enter the BIOS to ensure that the system will
reboot from the USB-MD first. The reboot may take several tries in order to
get the BIOS settings just right. For the Intel BIOS referenced above, the
choices in the BOOT sub menu were these. Not all are salient, but the
following choices worked:
</p>

<table align="left" width="50%" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>boot Menu Type</td>
      <td>Advance</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>Boot Drive Order</td>
      <td>USB-MD<br>
		  CD<br>
		  Floppy<br>
		  Hard Drive</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>Boot to Optical Devices</td>
      <td>Enable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>Boot to Removable Devices</td>
      <td>Enable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>Boot to Network Devices</td>
      <td>Disable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>USB Boot</td>
      <td>Enable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>Zip Emulation Type</td>
      <td>Hard Disk</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>Boot USB Devices First</td>
      <td>Enable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>USB Mass Storage<br>
          Emulation Type</td>
      <td>All Fixed Disk</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br clear="all" />

<p>
Different BIOS vendors will provide different choices and wording, but the
above gives the idea.
</p>

<p>
The file /boot/grub/menu.lst installed by Xubuntu on the USB-MD for booting
the Seanix machine was as follows (except for editing of the title line):
</p>

<pre class="code">
title             Xubuntu 6.06.1 on USB_MD
root              (hd0,0)
kernel            /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.15-26-386 root=/dev/sdb1 ro quiet splash
initrd            /boot/initrd.img-2.6.15-26-386
savedefault
boot
</pre>

<p>
The Seanix hard drive (scsi) was seen as /dev/sda. It was also
recognized first in the BIOS bootup, whether or not the hard drive MBR
was chosen to boot Linux. This could then be used to boot up into the
USB-MD via the MBR on the USB-MD.
</p>

<h4>Case Study - Modifying Xubuntu on the USB-MD for a home system</h4>

<p>
The author's home machine already had a version of Kubuntu (one of
Xubuntu's heavier cousins) installed. It differs from the laboratory
Seanix machines in these important aspects:
</p>

<ul>
<li>cannot boot from the MBR of the USB-MD</li>

<li>has a different graphics card</li>

<li>first sees the USB-MD as /dev/sda1 rather than /dev/sdb1 (as seen by the Seanix)</li>
</ul>

<p>
These differences needed to be addressed and were dealt with as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>the existing /boot/grub/menu.lst on the hard drive was modified to include a boot stanza for the USB-MD </li>

<li>the /etc/X11/xorg.conf on the USB-MD was replaced with a copy of that from the home machine's /etc/X11/xorg.conf</li>

<li>the modified  /boot/grub/menu.lst on the hard drive refers to the USB-MD as (hd1,0) or, equivalently, /dev/sda1</li>
</ul>

<p>
The new stanza for the USB-MD interjected into the /boot/grub/menu.lst on the hard drive was:
</p>

<pre class="code">
title             Xubuntu 6.06.1 on USB_MD
root              (hd1,0)
kernel            /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.15-26-386 root=/dev/sda1 ro quiet splash
initrd            /boot/initrd.img-2.6.15-26-386
savedefault
boot
</pre>

<p>
With this new stanza and the proper replacement for /etc/X11/xorg.conf,
the USB-MD could be booted from the home machine. Note that this is the
dual/boot solution rejected earlier for the laboratory machines.
However, we assume that the home machine does not need to protect
different user groups from each other.
</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
The bootable USB-MD is an acceptable solution where general purpose labs
can provide convenient access to
</p>

<ul>
<li>normal users, without granting super user privileges</li>

<li>advanced users, granting super user privileges </li>
</ul>

<p>
while keeping a hardware separation between the two groups. Once the
system is implemented, it requires virtually no extra care or feeding
by the system administrator.
</p> 

<p>
The solution does compromise security somewhat, which is acceptable for
the typical general purpose teaching/training laboratory where sensitive
data are not stored and where the advanced user is trustworthy.

<h1>Troubleshooting Apache using strace</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Occasionally system administrators can run into situations where 
the conventional way of
troubleshooting an issue may not yield results. The conventional way
means using test scripts, observing the log files, tweaking
configuration settings and the like. In such cases, one will have to dig
deeper into the internals of the server. <b>Strace</b> proves to
be a valuable tool in such situations. The <b>strace</b> utility
intercepts and records the system calls which are made by a
process and the signals which are received by a process. This
article shows how to use <b>strace</b> to troubleshoot Apache by
illustrating a real-world issue. I will begin with the problem
statement and then move on to describe the initial troubleshooting
attempts. The inner workings of the Apache server are briefly explained just
before examining the strace results. Various options of <b>strace</b>
and its internal working is beyond the scope of this article,
so please refer to the man pages for the same.</p>

<h3>Problem statement</h3>

<p>
<b>ISSUE</b>: Can't send mail from web pages using PHP 'mail()'
function.<br>
<b>OS</b>: RedHat<br>
<b>SMTP Server</b>: Sendmail<br>
<b>Web Server</b>: Apache/1.3.22 - It's a virtual hosting
environment, there are many sites hosted in the server.<br>
<b>PHP version</b>: 4.0.6<br>
</p>
<!-- SCNR: Anyone running Apache 1.3.22 and PHP 4.0.6 may have more troubles
     than mail delivery... (pfeiffer) -->

<h3>Initial troubleshooting attempts</h3>

<p>
Let me first recreate the issue and see the error for myself. I
will create a test script, 'mail.php', that will use the 'mail()'
function for sending mail. The test script is as follows.
</p>

<pre class="code">
&lt;?php
error_reporting(E_ALL);
$to = "Vishnu &lt;we2cares@fastmail.fm&gt;";
$subject = "This is a test email";
$message = "This is a test email, please ignore.";

if (mail($to,$subject,$message))
{
echo "Thank you for sending email";
}
else
{
echo "Can't send email";
}
?&gt;
</pre>

<p>I placed mail.php into the web area of the virtual domain in question,
and then accessed it through a browser. The resulting page
displayed an echoed message "Can't send email", no PHP specific
error messages were shown. Analyzing the maillog shows no trace of
mail injected from the virtual domain in question. I needed to verify
whether the issue is specific to the virtual host in question or
whether the issue is server wide. The same test script was used in a few
other virtual hosts and produced the same result. That means the issue
is not specific to a virtual host, it's a server wide issue. Looks
like Apache/PHP is broken.</p>

<p>Let me see whether the mail() function is disabled in the
php.ini file using <b>disable_functions</b>.</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@dns1 root]# grep disable_functions /etc/php.ini
disable_functions =
</pre>

<p>No, mail function is not disabled.</p>

<p>I have turned on <b>display_errors</b> and
<b>display_startup_errors</b> in php.ini so that any internal PHP
error is displayed on the web page, but that didn't help either.
The test PHP page doesn't display any error, there are no error
messages in the Apache, sendmail or other system logs. What
next?</p>

<!-- Ok, sorry, now I have to say something. -->

<p class="editorial">[ When debugging a production system be sure to use
your development system (which, by the way, should be identical to and
separate from your production environment). If you cannot avoid using the
production system for this, make sure your error messages are never
displayed to the browser and redirect them to your logs. This is more
secure and doesn't bother your end users with messages they can't
understand. -- Ren&eacute; ]
</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, in order to know what's happening 
at the process level, the <b>strace</b> utility is very useful.
Before using <b>strace</b> to troubleshoot the issue, I will give a
brief explanation of how Apache serves an incoming request.</p>

<h3>Detour into Apache</h3>

<p>Apache starts by creating a parent process with root privileges.
This is the main process, it is responsible for forking child
processes and maintaining them. The main Apache process doesn't
serve any requests, the requests are served by child processes.
The number of idle child processes at a given time is determined
by the <b>MinSpareServers</b> and <b>MaxSpareServers</b> directives
in <b>httpd.conf</b>. When a new request comes in, it is served by
one of the idle child processes. If there are no idle child processes,
then a new child process is forked by the parent, to serve an
incoming request. From the <b>ps</b> result shown below, it's clear
the the process with PID 1861 is the Apache parent process. It is
running with "root" privileges, all the child processes are running
as user "apache".

        |             +-httpd(2302)
</pre>

<h3>Using strace</h3>

<p>Now we know that our request for mail.php is served by one of
the Apache child processes and that <b>strace</b> can be used to
get details of how requests are served, but there is one more
problem: Which child process serves the mail.php request? We either
know the process ID of the exact child process, or we 
trace all the child processes and then sort out the output of strace. There is no way to
know in advance which child process will serve the mail.php
request, so we will have to trace the parent Apache and all its
child processes. The "-f" <b>strace</b> option traces child
processes as they are created by currently traced processes as a
result of the 'fork' system call.</p>

<p>Here we go...<br>
First stop Apache and then restart Apache with <b>strace</b>.</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@dns1 root]# strace -f -o trace.txt /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd start
</pre>

<p>The "-o" option saves the result to "trace.txt" file. Now access
the test PHP page through the browser. Stop <b>strace</b> and 
restart Apache as usual. It may be necessary to send the <b>strace</b> process
a SIGKILL signal, because it captures some signals it gets from the terminal
session.
</p>

<p>Let us now go ahead and examine the <b>strace</b> result in the
trace.txt file.</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@dns1 root]# grep mail.php trace.txt
21837 read(7, "GET /mail.php HTTP/1.1\r\nUser-Age"..., 4096) = 472
21837 stat64("/var/www/virtdomain/mail.php", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=587, ...}) = 0
</pre>

<p>From the above <b>grep</b> result it's clear that the Apache
child process serving our request for mail.php is the one
with PID "21837". Now <b>grep</b> trace.txt for "21837". Relevant
result is pasted below.</p>

<pre class="code">
21837 chdir("/var/www/virtdomaint") = 0
21837 open("/var/www/virtdomain/mail.php", O_RDONLY) = 8
.
.
.
.
21837 fork() = 21844
</pre>

<p>The last line shows that the Apache child process forks another process
with PID 21844. Let us <b>grep</b> for 21844 in trace.txt and see
what it does.</p>

<pre class="code">
21844 execve("/bin/sh", ["sh", "-c", "/usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i"], [/* 21 vars */]) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
</pre>

<p>Well, the process is used for sending mail using /usr/sbin/sendmail,
but an incorrect permissions prevent it doing so. Sendmail
permissions are set correctly, but checking /bin/sh reveals that it is
set to "770" with "root.root" ownership. Since the Apache child
process is running as user "apache", it doesn't have read and
execute permission over /bin/sh, and hence the issue. Changing
/bin/sh permission to "755" fixed it.</p>

<p class="editorial"> [ At this point I'd be inclined to wonder <em>why</em>
the file permissions were wrong. It could be that someone is tip-toeing
through your filesystem. -- Steve Brown ] </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>With a basic understanding of Apache and using <b>strace</b>,
we could find the root cause of the issue and hence fix it.
<b>Strace</b> is a general purpose utility and it can be used to
troubleshoot any program. <b>Strace</b> and <b>GDB</b> (GNU
Debugger) are very useful in system level troubleshooting. <a href=

<hr>

<p>
When I first started reading "Classic Shell Scripting" by Arnold Robbins
and Nelson H. F. Beebe, the quality of the content inspired me to write
a review of this book. As opposed to most books on the subject that only
explain and give examples of syntax, this book aims to develop in the
reader a deeper understanding and true mastery of the POSIX shell.
</p>

<p>
The UNIX toolbox philosophy has been (to use a description from Robert
Floyd's acceptance of the ACM Turing Award) a staple "Programming
Paradigm" for UNIX programmers for several decades. In addition, to
developing a better understanding of existing UNIX tools, this book will
help programmers understand the ideas behind "pipeline programming":
producing programs that take data sources, process the data in a
sequence of serially connected steps and output the end result.
</p>

<p>
For example, the "wc" command provides standard counts of characters,
words, and line numbers in a given file.  To count all of the non-comment
lines in all shell scripts (assumed to end with .sh) in ~/bin: </p>

<pre class="code">cat `find ~/bin/ -name "*.sh"` | sed -e '/^ *#/d' | wc -l</pre>

<p>
This simple pipeline creates a data source containing all lines from all
shell scripts ending with .sh in your ~/bin directory. The sed command
then deletes any lines beginning with comments and the wc command counts
the remaining lines.  Commands like this make it easy to report how many
lines of code an application has.  This is a simple example of what can
be done with UNIX pipelines. This book helps the reader develop the
skills to write such programs.  </p>

<p>
The book begins with an inviting preface and draws the reader in, right
away.  The authors mention that the point of learning shell scripting is
to obtain proficiency in using the UNIX toolbox philosophy.  This
entails using a combination of smaller specialized tools to accomplish a
larger task.  As such, the book focuses on several main themes: </p>

<ul>
<li>
What the Unix tools are, specifically the reasons why the various
commands were created and the special jobs they were intended to do.
</li>

<li>
How to combine these Unix tools using pipes and file redirections.
</li>

<li>
Popular extensions to standard tools, specifically the use of GNU- or 
BSD-derived Unix systems and some indispensable nonstandard shell tools.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each chapter contains background and introductions into the Unix toolbox
philosophy. Collectively, they emphasize the need for and eventual
standardization of the Unix utilities through the POSIX standard, the
main points of which are: </p>

<ul>
<li>
Each command should do a single task (only) and do it as well as possible.
</li>

<li>
Process input and output lines of text, not any specific binary format.
</li>

<li>
A thorough understanding of regular expressions will ease many text processing tasks.
</li>

<li>
Default input and output comes from the keyboard and goes to the console respectively.
</li>

<li>
A program should do its task as quietly as possible and operate with no unnecessary output.
</li>

<li>
Borrow from the work of others: Learn as much as possible about existing
commands and use them whenever possible.  If no command exists to do the
task at hand ... invent one.  This is the focus of this book.  Use the
commands already in existence to construct new ones.  </li> 

</ul>

<p class="editorial">
[ Much of the above recapitulates the "Main Tenets" from Mike Gancarz' "The UNIX Philosophy" (Digital Press, Newton, MA 1995, 151 pp., $19.95, ISBN
1-55558-123-4) - another excellent read. -- Ben ]
</p>

<p>
I found the book to be a plethora of interesting ideas and command
descriptions.  Rather than describe each chapter in detail, I have chosen
to present a sequence of "factoids" containing the "Classic Shell
Scripting" content I found most interesting.  I should mention that
these are just a sample of the types of things you can learn by reading
this book.  </p>

<h4>Portability of "echo"</h4>

<p>
The built-in command echo is not as universal as you might first think.
The BSD version allowed the switch "-n" to disable the printing of a
newline after the string: </p>

<pre class="code">echo -n "Enter Choice: "</pre>

<p>
The System V version of echo used another approach for the same purpose:
They choose to implement a version that recognized a special escape
sequence "\c", so the above would become: </p>

<pre class="code">echo "Enter Choice: \c"</pre>

<p>
The current POSIX standard on echo does not include the "-n" option. On
my Linux system there are two echo commands: one in the shell and other
located in /bin.  The System V behavior can be implemented with a "-e"
switch </p>

<pre class="code">echo -e "Enter Choice: \c"</pre>

<p>
The purpose of this discussion is that echo in shell scripts may not be
as portable as one imagines.  For very simple string printing, this is
not usually a problem. For more complicated situations, one should use
the POSIX standardized command "printf". To do the above with printf, one
would use (as the newline is provided by default): </p>

<pre class="code">printf "Enter Choice: "</pre>

<p>
If a newline was desired, it could be inserted with "\n".
</p>

<h4>Debugging Shell Scripts:</h4>

<p>
Debugging shell scripts can be a simple as inserting a "-x" in the
shebang head of a shell script.  For instance, replace
<!-- Perhaps "shebang" should be replaced by something else - Hugo -->
</p>

<pre>#!/bin/sh</pre>

<p>
with
</p>

<pre>#!/bin/sh -x</pre>

<p>
The "-x" flag results in the shell echoing each and every command before
the command gets executed. Each sub-shell created also increments a prompt, 
so you can tell at what stack level each command executed.  For
instance, if your script is </p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh

cat $1
echo `wc $1`
</pre>

<p>
Given an input set of files (file{1,2,3}) like the following (the $
being the shell prompt) </p>

<pre class="code">
$cat file1
file2
$cat file2
file3
$cat file3
Finally some data!
</pre>

<p>
the script (degEg.sh):
</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh -x

cat file1
cat $(cat file1)
cat $(cat $(cat file1))
</pre>

<p>
produces for output
</p>

<pre class="code">
+ cat file1
file2
++ cat file1
+ cat file2
file3
+++ cat file1
++ cat file2
+ cat file3
Finally some data!
</pre>

<p>
Each level of "+"'s denotes the stack level in the script.  For
instance, the first command "cat file1" is at stack level 1 and 
produces the result "file2".  The next command is </p>

<pre>cat $(cat file1)</pre>

<p>
which must execute cat file1 first, before it can execute the "cat"
command on the existing result.  This "inner" call is performed at stack
level 2, represented in the above as </p>

<pre>++ cat file1</pre>

<p>
this result is file2, and is subject to the next cat command given in
debugging output like </p>

<pre>+ cat file2</pre>

<p>
with the result of "file3".  The rest of the example is similar.
</p>


<h4>Internationalization of your commands</h4>

<p>
There has been a recent push in the POSIX community aimed at
internationalization.  As such, you can make your computer speak Italian
and display help for the ls command, with </p>

<pre>LC_ALL=it_IT ls --help</pre>

<p>
These are just a small sample of some of the interesting things this
book has to offer. If you are a shell programmer who wants to take
his/her skills "to the next level", you should consider reading this
book.  </p>

Greetings from the Gazette's reference section! Recently I offered my
crossword writing services to the Linux Gazette, which our fair editor was
rather ... enthused about.
</p>

<p class="editorial">
[ Sam, you didn't think I *meant* it about the caviar and champagne served
by the Playboy bunnies, did you? Some people will take a figure of speech
_so_ seriously... -- Ben ]
</p>

<p>
My goal with these puzzles is to provide a Linux and FOSS vocabulary brain
teaser. Some of the clues and answers will be purposefully obscure in the
hopes that you will look them up once you have completed the puzzle. I will
also surround said parts with easier words or common "geek" culture
references.
</p>

<p>
I am open to commentary, so if you feel I could be doing something better
or you think you have found an error, please let me know. And before you
ask, yes, I do hope to increase the size of the puzzles to the standard
15x15 (time permitting).

<em>
<p>
Samuel Kotel Bisbee-vonKaufmann was born ('87) and raised in the Boston, MA
area. His interest in all things electronics was established early as his
father was an electrician. Teaching himself HTML and web design at the age
of 10, Sam has spiraled deeper into the confusion that is computer science
and the FOSS community, running his first distro, Red Hat, when he was
approximately 13 years old. Entering boarding high school in 2002,
Northfield Mount Hermon, he found his way into the school's computer club,
GEECS for Electronics, Engineering, Computers, and Science (a recursive
acronym), which would allow him to share in and teach the Linux experience
to future generations. Also during high school Sam was abducted into the
Open and Free Technology Community (<a
href="http://www.oftc.org">http://www.oftc.org</a>), had his first article
published, and became more involved in various communities and projects.
</p>

<p>
Sam is currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Boston University and
continues to be involved in the FOSS community. Other hobbies include martial
arts, writing, buildering, working, chess, and crossword puzzles.  Then there
is something about Linux, algorithms, programing, etc., but who makes money
doing that?
</p>

<p>
Sam prefers programming in C++ and Bash, is fluent in Java and PHP, and while
he can work in Perl, he hates it. If you would like to know more then feel free
to ask.
