</pre>
Hey Ben.  Que pasa?  Apologies in advance, as I know this rambles quite
a bit.  I learned some important lessons from it, so thought I'd pass
them on.
</p>

<p>
I ran into a bit of (for me, anyway) an interesting mystery today, and
it partly concerns LG's very own Rick Moen.  I was reminded while
brousing through /current that I'd been meaning to go look into a few
things on Rick's Linux Mafia site (I'm presently in the last stages of
recovering from a failed hard drive[ii], and old bookmarks is about all
that's left to do).
</p>

<p>
So, Iceweasel --&gt; linuxmafia.net ...
</p>

<p>
Yup, that was my first mistake.  Rick's not at .net, he's at .com.  I
don't know how I came up with .net (creeping senility perhaps), but
there you are.  BTW, linuxmafia.net appears to be a P2P invite only
torrent site out of Georgia, as one of my mailinglist buddies was kind
enough to point out.  He followed that up with "whois is your friend."
</p>

<p>
Well, I knew that.  On the other hand, it's not always your (or my, at
least) friend because "whois -h whois.arin.net linuxmafia.com" shows
no match.  On the other hand, "dig mx" does work.  Um, wtf?  Is there
some serious Juju going on here, or am I just more ignorant than I
hope I am?
</p>

<p>
The plot thickens; I'm not the only one.  F-Secure appears to be a bit
confused on this sort of thing too.  see:
<pre>
   <a href="http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/#00001203">http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/#00001203</a>
</pre>
So, what's wrong with whois, or is there something magical going on
about Rick's (and F-Secure's example) sites?  Or, am I an idiot?
</p>

<p>
I was getting too cute with shell aliases[i], but I see plain old
"whois linuxmafia.com" does work quite nicely, showing it's registered
with Tucows Inc.  I thought my "arin" alias was all I needed to find
registry info in this part of the world, "ripe" for Europe, "apnic"
for the Far East, and etc.  Definitely not true.  Drat.
</p>

<p>
The moral of the story appears to be that (as a plain "whois $BLAH"
shows):
<pre>
    Domain names in the .com and .net domains can now be 
    registered with many different competing registrars.
    Go to <a href="http://www.internic.net">http://www.internic.net</a> for detailed information.
</pre>
So, I ought to be giving up on my ("my friend") whois aliases.
</p>

<p>
--------------------------------------
</p>

<p>
On the off-chance you end up dumping this into LG's "Mailbag", I'll
add that anyone who hasn't spent time at Rick's site is missing
some great stuff.  I've learned a lot from him over the years, and his
wry, dry, diplomatic, and often truly vitriolic BOFH "we don't suffer
fools here!" style is damned entertaining.
</p>

<p>
And for Rick, guess what?  linuxone.com is still registered, at
Computer Services Langenbach Gmbh DBA joker.com.  DN squatter snapped
it up I guess, since it mentions none of the entities you mention in
your article.
</p>

<p>
[ii] And another thing:
<pre>
   <a href="http://grml.org">http://grml.org</a>
</pre>
a Debian Sid downstream.  John Hasler, in Debian-User, suggested
"privoxy" the other day.  I went to install it, and found it's already
running.  Pretty neat.  I makes web surfing look like it was back in the
early '90s, without the animated banner ads.  It even makes ZDNet
almost worth reading.  Grml's pretty slick.
</p>

<p>
I hope you found this interesting.  It was an interesting excursion
for me.
</p>

<p>
[i] Obsolete:
<pre>
   alias abuse='whois -h whois.abuse.net'
   alias afnic='whois -h whois.afrinic.net'
   alias apnic='whois -h whois.apnic.net'
   alias arin='whois -h whois.arin.net \+'
   alias brnic='whois -h whois.registro.br'
   alias jpnic='whois -h whois.nic.ad.jp'
   alias krnic='whois -h whois.krnic.net'

   alias ripe='whois -h whois.ripe.net'
   alias nic="h | egrep 'afnic|apnic|arin|brnic|jpnic|krnic|ripe|host'"
</pre>
[where "h" is another alias, "alias h=history"].

Hmm, I'm still a bit jet-lagged (long story), but the first thing that
comes to mind is:  Is ARIN really the right place to ask that query?
</p>

<p>
ARIN is the "regional Internet registry" within Canada, the USA, most of
the Caribbean, and various North Altantic islands for Internet <em>number</em>
resources (IP addresses and BGP Autonomous System numbers), but not for 
either Generic TLD or Country Code TLD Internet <em>names</em>.  
</p>

<p>
In the same sense as ARIN is, RIPE is indeed the IANA-designated
Internet number registry for Europe /  Middle East / Central Asia, APNIC
is likewise for Asia and the Pacific, LACNIC ditto for Latin America and
the rest of the Caribbean, and AfriNIC for Africa -- but only for
numbers, not domain names.  Those five regional Internet registries, by
the way, have their own umbrella group under which they collaborate:
Number Resource Organization, <a href="http://www.nro.net/">http://www.nro.net/</a> .
</p>


<p>
Anyway....
</p>

<p>
Usually, one leaves choice of whois server up to one's client software
for the TCP/IP whois protocol, since thankfully they're usually
preprogrammed to do something at least halfway intelligent with routing
of most queries.  (Once upon a time, everything was at a single whois
server operated by DARPA, but things are much more decentralised, now.)
For example, the open-source whois client I find on Linux machines seems
hardwired to, at least in most cases, go by default straight to
"whois.internic.net", which in turn -- again, thankfully -- has been set
up by ICANN to "redirect" incoming queries to somewhere slightly more
appropriate to each case.  As you found out, in the case of
linuxmafia.com, ICANN sends you over to whois.tucows.com, the directory
service for my registrar, Tucows's Open Shared Registry System
(OpenSRS).

That's where the disconnect here occurs, methinks.  Yes, ARIN is
NorthAM (or northern part of Western Hemi., but only for a specific
part of the IP/DNS lookup thingy stuff; the DNS part).  IP (dotted
quad) is a different story.  I conclude there's serious DNS juju going
on here of which I'm (at least somewhat <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)"> ignorant.

&gt; NorthAM (or northern part of Western Hemi., but only for a specific

<p>
Well, only half of the DNS part, really, and not the part you were
interested in -- the IN-ADDR.ARPA reverse-lookup portion.  That's what
we mean when we say they're an Internet <em>number</em> registry only (as
designated for that role by IANA).
</p>

<p>
You were fundamentally interested in <em>forward</em> DNS information, which is
exactly why going to the <em>number</em> registry didn't get you useful
answers.
