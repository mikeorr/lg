<P>
I'm making the move from Windows to Linux and am in the process of
tracking down Linux programs to replace anything in Windows that I feel
I cannot do without. It's a short but stubborn list. Presently, I'm
trying to locate a Linux Family Tree program (I'm using Family Tree
Maker in Windows) and also need a Linux program that can import the
contents of several Cardfile databases.
<P>
I've heard of and have downloaded the Unix based LifeLines program but
have not yet tried it. Though it comes highly recommended, even the
author admits that it's somewhat dated. I was hoping a more recent
program was available. Not necessarily freeware, by the way.
<P>
Suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks,

Subject: <font color="maroon">RH5.2 and Intel EtherExpress Pro/10+ ISA NIC</font>
<P>
I am a Linux newbie, with some computer experience, trying to install my
intel etherexpress pro/10+ isa card on my new Linux box (Macmillan RH 5.2,
kernel 2.0.36-0.7).  I have read several newsgroup postings regarding this
network card, but I could really use a step-by-step guide.
<P>
The card did work when the OS was win98.  Linux is now the only OS on this
computer.  The Linux install was successful except that it did not recognize
my network card.  I disabled the plug and play function of the card using
the intel configuration software (softset2), and then tried re-installing
Linux and passing the IRQ and I/O settings (7 and 320-32Fh respectively) but
that also did not work.  I then tried to add the following lines to
/etc/conf.modules:
<PRE>
alias eth0 eepro
options eth0 io=320-32Fh irq=7
</PRE>
this was also unsucessful.  Furthermore, pnpdump returns "board not found,"
and even AFTER reading the HOWTO for isapnptools, I have no idea what to add
to add to my isapnp.conf file.
<P>
Any help would be very appreciated, just please be detailed as I am not a
guru by any stretch of the imagination.

thank you.

the problem is that this connection goes through a masquerading-server and
as a result it is almost impossible to connect to your computer from a

To go around this limitation I have set up a small script that uses ssh to
forward a few ports (21, 22 and 80) to a computer outside the building.
This is fine as long as you and your friends now to wich computer the ports
have been forwarded to.

A more fancy solution would be to use ssh to tunnel ppp! The problem is
that I dont now of an ISP that would let me to use PPP over the Internet
instead of over their modem-pools.

Subject: <font color="maroon">Linux & Win95/98/NT clients</font>
<P>
Well, I am system administrator in colleage (about 200 machines). Mostly
they're running Win95/98 and some of them running NT4.0 Workstation. We
don't use yet Linux as a server ( but I use it a lot for
java-development). We use NT4.0.
So my question is :
I'd like to install Linux as a file-server & keep on him images of
hard-disks from classrooms(i.e every classroom has own "master" with all
the programmes installed on it). So if something goes wrong with one (or
more) of a computers in the classroom I'd like to keep this "masters" on
Linux server & connect to them somehow from this computer and take the
"image" off to my win95/98/nt client.
Somehow - I mean I have to have a boot-diskette that does the work.
The second point is that I'm not sure in possibility that
in-the-same-time I can use the "image" on Linux with multiple
connections... Sometimes the "image" has to be requested by 20-25
clients(in the same time).=20
If somebody can help me it's really great coz' this way I can install
first-Linux-server in our network ( I really like this OS.... but it
doesn't depend on me :) )
Any information will be appreciated.
Thanx.

Can someone tell me how to turn on a gcc compile option to trap a divide
by zero and NaN with type float or double. I can get the divide-by-zero
trap with type int.  Is this a trap that can be done on the kernal level?
The signal SIGFPED only works on integers?? I am using Red Hat 5.2
installation.
<P>
Trap on divide by zero: a=1., b=0., a/b=Inf
<P>
Trap on overflow: a=3.4e38, b=3.4e38, a*b=Inf
<P>
Trap on NaN: sqrt(-1)
<P>
I have included a small test code to illustrate the problem (question)..
<P>
To build sample code:
  <PRE> 
  cc -g tst.c -lm -o tst
</PRE> 
<P>
Test code:
  <PRE> 
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  #include &lt;math.h&gt;

  main() {
   float a,b,c,d;
   int   ia,ib,ic;
   int   i;
  
   a=1.; b=0.;
   c=a/b;
   d=(float)sqrt((double)-a);
   printf("Float: a=%f b=%f a/b=%f d=sqrt(-a)=%f\n",a,b,c,d);
   ia=1; ib=0;

  Float: a=1.000000 b=0.000000 a/b=Inf d=sqrt(-a)=NaN
  Floating point exception (core dumped)

Launching into issue 37, I go straight to Software Announcements. And

Well, I design electronic circuits, and immediately hit the link. What I

work on any version of Visio. So, I would need the Linux version of
visio.
<P>
So then I followed the link to Visio, and looked to see 'platform
requirements'. It said this:

<P>
As usual, <I>Linux Gazette</I> remains one of my favorite sources
of net-gleaned Linux information.  Thank you!
<P>
Under software announcements of issue #37 there is a link
to SpiceLink which i was very thrilled about to see such
a graphical support for spice under Linux.  But alas, even
through it's linked from <I>Linux Gazette</I> this software cannot
run under Linux.  From the president of the SpiceLink following
an inquiry:
<blockquote> <font color="navy">
You're right about SpiceLink; it's for Visio and therefore Windows.
</font></blockquote> 
(maybe when they get near 100% of the Windows market they'll think about Linux).
Perhaps a note might be added that one better have WINE
running and even then it's uncertain...?
<P>
Many thanks!

Subject: <font color="maroon">RE: What is a 'high crime'</font>
<P>
A "High crime" is not necessarily what could be called a 'heinous' act.
A 'High crime' is simply a 'crime' committed by a 'High' official (such
as a senator, federal judge, or president.) Because of their unique
positions, what would not be considered crimes for us, may be considered
crimes for 'High' officials, hence the term 'common criminal' versus
'high criminal'.  For instance, accepting bribes would, for private
citizens outside of public office, not be considered a crime (immoral
perhaps, but not criminal.)  For high officials, bribery is most
definitely a 'high' crime.
<P>
Some people feel that the questions that the president did not
truthfully answer should not have been asked and were not relevant to
governing.  After all, even some of the framers of the constitution were
known to have had 'improper relations'.  But these same people seem to
forget that we did not have laws relating to sexual
harassment/discrimination back then.  Also, the judgment by the courts
pertaining directly to those 'irrelevant' questions was that the
questions were relevant and proper at the time they were asked.
<P>
As to using the principle of 'acts related to governing', it would seem
that these same people feel that R. Nixon should have been impeached -
even though his alleged acts and deceptions had nothing to do with
'governing'.  Using the Nixon precedent, W. Clinton should be held
accountable for lies and deception even if they had little bearing on
the act of 'governing'.
<P>
So then, we are left to ask, were the lies and deception in the courts
by the president acceptable?  I guess we all need to answer that for
ourselves.  If it is appropriate for the president to not tell the whole
truth on those matters that the court has decided he should answer for
and go unpunished for lying, then we should stop enforcing sexual
discrimination cases altogether.  Women should just accept their place
as 2nd class citizens and let the rest of us get on with the job of
making a living.  Just think, if he had 'pleaded the fifth', we wouldn't
be having this wonderful education on the constitutional process.
<P>
This may not be the populist view, but the moral high ground usually
isn't.  Witness the popularity of Howard Stern and Larry Flynt.  I am
not perfect.  When I get caught breaking 'minor' laws, I should fully
expect some sort of punishment.  But just because I am not perfect, does
that mean I should give up any expectation of holding myself and others
to standards of common decency?

Subject: <font color="maroon">J. W. Pennington's article about Doubt</font>
<P>
I read Pennington's article with considerable interest and look forward to
more.  As a web developer (trained in Physics and Chemistry) I have to point
out the word that the hard sciences use in place of Mr. Pennington's
"doubt": we call that "skepticism".  Not cynicism, which many folks use as a
way to protect their ego. (Failure is more common than success, so cynics
just predict failure all the time to get their winning %age).
<P>
Skepticism is a firm belief in empirical or deductive fact coupled with a
firm disbelief in personal perception.  The good engineer is a skeptic; he
wants to know some empirical fact before he allows himself to believe his
perceptions.  He tests the girder design before it goes into a bridge, and
even then he over builds that bridge by a factor of 2 or 3 just in case the
wind blows, or any army drives across with tanks, or an earthquake hits.
And when it fails anyway, he shows up and figures out why.
<P>
Linux benefits from skepticism since we don't say "Ha, this is perfect" but
rather we say, "weeellll, this works but so far we haven't looked at x/y/z".
<P>
Kudos to the good author for pointing out a fine generality in which Linux
developers can take pride.  Healthy old-fashioned skepticism kicks ass.
<P>

Subject: <font color="maroon">Re: The Beauty of Doubt</font>
<P>
 It seems, you are really talking about *critical thinking*.
 *Doubt* is often caused by critical thinking, but shouldn't
 be explicitly cultivated, in my opinion. Many colleges
 offer classes on critical thinking, and the topic is not 
 that new. It is true, of course, that commercial
 software developers are not as free to think critically
 about their work as FSC folks, hence the advantage of FSC.
 <P> 
 Regarding the other three terms: *cooperation* seems too
 weak, free software developers *collaborate*."Cooperation" 
 is what Microsoft does when it gets sued for a breach of
 contract ;-)
<P>
 *Non-control (read: Freedom)* is vague. You probably mean
 *independent thinking* and, separately, *freedom to allocate
 personal resources*. For example, I may be interested in
 kernel hacking, just because I like the subject (not because
 I am paid for this) and may have new ideas, but not
 time/skill to implement them. Someone else, who has a month
 of vacation may pick them up and produce something useful.
<P>
 "Rebellion"...  how about "enthusiasm" or, better,
 "improvement drive". I would actually agree that many
 developers may be driven by a rebellion, but not the ones
 who are responsible for most innovation. "Rebellion" does
 not go well with incremental development models somehow.
<P>
 Finally, the lack and, OTOH, the ease of several aspects
 of management is critical to the FSC as much as the above
 issues. This may need to be discussed as well.
<P>
  well... so much for a non-native speaker. I guess, you will
 correct me if I messed up connotaions/meanings etc.

Subject: <font color="maroon">Did you know about Aspell?</font>
<P>
I saw you article titled "ispell: Spelling Checker" in the <I>Linux Gazette</I>
and was wondering if you knew of the existence of Aspell.
<P>
From the manual:
<P>
  1.1.1.1 Features that only Aspell has
  <ul>
<li> Does a much better job with coming up with suggestions than
Ispell
       does.
<li> Can learn from users misspellings.
<li>  Is an actual library that others programs can link to instead of
       having to use it through a pipe.
  <li> Is multiprocess intelligent. When a personal dictionary (or
       replacement list) is saved it will now first update he list
       against the dictionary on disk in case another process modified
       it.
</ul>  
  1.1.1.2 Things that only Aspell will have real soon
 <ul>
  <li> Support for detachable dictionaries so that more than one aspell
       class can use the same dictionary.
  <li> Support for multiple personal dictionaries as well as support for
       special auxiliary dictionaries.
  </ul>
  1.1.1.3 Things that, currently, only Ispell have
 <ul>
  <li> Lower memory footprint
  <li> Support for affix compression
  <li> Support for spell checking Latex and Nroff files.
</ul>
<P>
Granted that when your article was first published Aspell didn't exist.

Three states list perjury as a "High crime or misdemeanor" in their state
constitution 
they are California, Texas, and Alabama.
Three others call perjury an infamous crime  (same as "High crime..." ?)
they are
West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Illinois.
Three others list perjury as an offense serious enough for removal from
office 
they are Wyoming, Missouri, and Colorado.
<P>
All these states also list conviction of perjury as reason to preclude
someone from ever holding public office.

In all 50 states perjury is a crime!
