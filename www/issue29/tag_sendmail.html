	<h4 align="center">running extra '<tt>sendmail -q</tt>' processes</h4>
<p><strong>From Robert Cotran on 28 Apr 1998

<br><br>
Hi there.  You seem to know your stuff about Linux.  I've been running
it for two years.  I have a little server at home.  I was at first
running Slackware, I'm not running RedHat 5.0.  Here's my problem.  After 
a while of running, my <tt>sendmail</tt> jams up.  It doesn't let in any
mail and it doesn't send out any queued mail.  It's the strangest
thing.  And I had the same problem running Slackware.  I figured that
RedHat (having more updated programs) would be OK, but it's not.  After
a while, any queued messages just stay stuck in the <tt>/var/spool/mqueue</tt>
dir, and incoming connections on port 25 are either REAL slow, or not
possible.  After rebooting however, all the queued mail zips out, and
incoming connections are fine again.  Sorry to bug you, but I just
figured you might have an idea.  Thanks for any help you can give me!

<br><br>
Rob

	You don't say what sort of volume your trying to bump through
	there or what sort of connection you have to the net.  So
	I'll have to assume the worst.  

<br><br>
	When I was postmaster/sysadmin of a very high volume site
	I found that I needed to occasionally run extra copies of
	the command '<tt>sendmail -q</tt>' concurrently to help reduce the 
	backlog in the queue.  This command simply makes '<tt>sendmail</tt>'
	to one sweep through its queue (mostly outgoing) and 
	look for items that are ready for a retry.

<br><br>
	'<tt>sendmail</tt>' has locking mechanisms (those <tt>x*</tt> and 
	<tt>l*</tt> files) to prevent concurrency issues.  So this is a 
	safe procedure.

<br><br>
	Typically I find that it's the DNS requests that bog down
	the processing, so running a 
	<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/DNS-HOWTO-3.html"
	>caching nameserver</a> on the localhost and making it the primary 
	entry in your <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt> can be a big win.

<br><br>
	A trick I've used when a system gets temporarily really 
	overloaded is to tar/gzip up a bunch of <tt>qf*</tt> and 
	<tt>df*</tt> file pairs (queue control and data) --- ftp that 
	to another system and extract them into a new directory.  Then I 
	have that system run several queue run processes in 
	parallel to the other.  This is particularly handy
	if the other system has a separate pipe (connection
	to the Internet).

<br><br>
	In Robert Harker's '<tt>sendmail</tt>' Seminar (which I took
	a few months ago) he describe a "requeue" mailer.
	This is an advanced technique that he would use to
	requeue some mail into a separate, low priority,
	queue directory.  The idea is to prevent a relatively
	small number of messages to sites that are dead or
	down, and messages to bogus addresses (from your users'
	typos, etc) from clogging things up for the other
	70 or 80 percent that could be expedited.

<br><br>
	Another thing to seriously consider and investigate
	is whether you're site is being used as a spammer's
	relay.  If your SMTP processing load has suddenly and
	drastically increased then you might have had some of
	your systems "hijacked" by spammers.

<br><br>
	To understand this a little bit of explanation is in order.  The 
	Internet was founded in spirit of co-operation so '<tt>sendmail</tt>' 
	was designed and configured (for the last 20 years) to accept mail 
	from anyone, to anyone.  It would gladly relay mail at the request 
	of any MTA (mail transport agent).  

<br><br>
	This was practical and reasonable --- since mail that
	needs multiple hops to get somewhere (say from department
	to hub/gateway, to other site's hub, to recipient's
	department and thence to recipient's home host) shouldn't
	need to carry "authentication" information for every
	leg of its journey.

<br><br>
	However 'spammers' use this openness to send a few copies 
	of a message with hundreds or thousands of recipients listed
	for each.  This allows someone with a 28.8 modem to chew up
	thousands of gigabit hours of bandwidth over the entire 'net.

<br><br>
	In any event you can find some instructions on how to use
	the recent configuration options in '<tt>sendmail</tt>' to prevent
	some of this abuse.  Look at 
	<a href="http://www.sendmail.com/">http://www.sendmail.com/</a>
	for info on the new 8.9 release which supports a number 
	of anti-spam features for details.  (As you might expect
	this site also has lots of other sendmail information as 
	does the older and now slightly out-of-date 
	<a href="http://www.sendmail.org/">http://www.sendmail.org/</a>).
	Sendmail 8.9 includes support for a <tt>FEATURE</tt> (m4 macro set) 
	that links you into the "Real-Time Black Hole List" 
	(<a href="http://maps.vix.com/rbl/">RBL</a>) that is maintained by 
	Paul Vixie (author of DNS BIND/<tt>named</tt> and of the Vixie 
	'<tt>cron</tt>' among other things).

<br><br>
	Like all sendmail <tt>FEATURE</tt>'s this is optional.

<br><br>
	For information information about the RBL look at 
	<a href="http://maps.vix.com/rbl/">http://maps.vix.com/rbl/</a>
