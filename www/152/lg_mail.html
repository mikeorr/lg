<p>
...and it's quite the story. Not because of us specifically, but because
theplanet is such a huge data center - i.e., it's causing a huge outage
all over the place.
</p>

<p>
To quote Doug Erwin of theplanet (issued at 10:46 PM, May 31 2008):
</p>

<pre>
   This evening at 4:55pm CDT in our H1 data center, electrical gear
   shorted, creating an explosion and fire that knocked down three walls
   surrounding our electrical equipment room. Thankfully, no one was
   injured. In addition, no customer servers were damaged or lost.
   
   We have just been allowed into the building to physically inspect the
   damage. Early indications are that the short was in a high-volume wire
   conduit. We were not allowed to activate our backup generator plan based
   on instructions from the fire department.
   
   This is a significant outage, impacting approximately 9,000 servers and
   7,500 customers. All members of our support team are in, and all vendors
   who supply us with data center equipment are on site. Our initial
   assessment, although early, points to being able to have some service
   restored by mid-afternoon on Sunday. Rest assured we are working around
   the clock.
</pre>

<p>
Our publication process is rolling on regardless of this, of course. In
principle, we should be back up pretty much as soon as theplanet is. For
the moment, if anyone needs to contact me, I'll be monitoring this
linuxmafia.com address.

<p>
Recently received Chez Moen, and I replied back saying it's indeed an
astute and elegant idea, which I might very well adopt for my own
domains.  (In the absence of an MX = mail exchanger record in the DNS
for a mail-receiving machine on the Internet, RFC 2821 specifies that
the sending host should fallback on the "A" = forward lookup record,
instead.  This was also true with the original SMTP-defining RFC, RFC
821.)
</p>

<p>
And, in case anyone is wondering, Gokhan Gucukoglu's name is Turkish.
He seems to be based in the UK, and is one of those protean characters
active broadly across free / open source software, just to make the
rest of us look bad by comparison.  ;-&gt;

Hi,
</p>

<p>
I notice that linuxmafia.com has just one MX, linuxmafia.com.  See RFC 2821 
section 5: remove your MX record; there is an implicit MX rule.  Good MTAs 
know it, most spammers, their spamware, their agents, etc, etc, still 
don't.  It's a great little trick and is doing me bloody wonders.  (It may 
on very, very rare occasions break mailers which <strong>insist</strong> that there be an 
MX record when you issue MAIL FROM linuxmafia.com; such mailers are broken 
and you really don't want to talk to them anyway <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)"> .)
</p>

<p>
(If you wonder why I noticed at all, it's your multiline greeting.)

Cheers,
Sabahattin

Google brought me to you. You might be interested in this new resource for
experimenting with crontab commands.
</p>

<p>
For most of us, setting up a new cron job is not something we do every day.
So we can easily forget the details.
</p>

<p>
Cron Sandbox at HxPI offers an opportunity to play with the crontab
scheduling commands in safety.
</p>

<p>
Type in the 'm h D M Dw' parameters and see a calendar of job execution
times/dates.

Hi Guys,
</p>

<p>
I was finally able to do the compilation process. Thanks for the help. 
</p>

<p>
Another question:
</p>

<p>
1. I am using a tcpdump network sniffer to capture packets of the tcp
header. I wanted to analyze  a specific variable like smoothed rtt
(srtt). I already changed the header file to include this new srtt
variable into  the option side of the tcp.h header file and also change
the tcp_input.c source code to incorporate the said variable into the
options side. I am confused whether tcp_input.c is the  correct code to
change since tcp_output.c and tcp.c is also in the linux kernel code. I
am also confused how to output this new srtt variable into the tcp
header so as to be captured by the tcpdump and be seen in the
tracefiles.
</p>

<p>
Is there a specific function in the code to be manipulated to do the
task? Any help would be appreciated.
</p>

<p>
Thank you very much in advance.
</p>

<p>
Cheers,
</p>

<p>
Hello, Gang!
</p>

<p>
I am trying to compute a SHA1 hash inside a C++ program without linking
to additional libraries. There are some SHA1 code snippets around and
they seem to work. So far so good. In order to compare SHA1 sums it's
nice to have them in hexadecimal representation. The SHA1 code I used
holds the sum in a byte array which is basically an array of unsigned
chars. Creating hexadecimal output can be done as follows:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
// Filename:  hex_output.cc - cout test firing range
 
#include &lt;iomanip&gt;
#include &lt;ios&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
 
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
 
using namespace std;
 
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    unsigned char array[10];
    unsigned short i;
 
    // An array with a French accent (sorry, SCNR)
    array[0] =3D 'A';
    array[1] =3D 'L';
    array[2] =3D 'L';
    array[3] =3D 'o';
    array[4] =3D ' ';
    array[5] =3D 'O';
    array[6] =3D 'r';
    array[7] =3D 'l';
    array[8] =3D 'd';
    array[9] =3D '!';
    for( i=3D0; i&lt;10; i++) {
        cout &lt;&lt; hex &lt;&lt; setfill('0') &lt;&lt; setw(2) &lt;&lt; nouppercase &lt;&lt; array[i];
    }
    cout &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; endl;
    return(0);
}
</pre>

<p>
Unfortunately this outputs: 0A0L0L0o0 0O0r0l0d0!
</p>

<p>
As soon as I change the cout line to
</p>

<pre>
cout &lt;&lt; hex &lt;&lt; setfill('0') &lt;&lt; setw(2) &lt;&lt; nouppercase &lt;&lt; (unsigned short)array[i];
</pre>

<p>
it works and produces: 414c4c6f204f726c6421
</p>

<p>
It's late and I still lack my good night coffee, but why is that? I
didn't expect this behaviour.
</p>

<p>
Best,
Ren&eacute;.

I am adding   new variables to the tcp header(tcp.h)  of the linux

</p>

<p>
2.	If so, what are the necessary steps involved( i.e., re-compile

Dear TAG,
</p>

<p>
I was playing around the command line (learning), and I came across
df(1) reporting block size in "1k-blocks".  But my dumpe2fs(8) says the
block size is 4096 (4K). Shouldn't it be doing thus by default?
</p>

<p>
It seems this is filed as a Bug under Ubuntu (Bug #180415).
</p>

<p>
One suggestion is for the install program to calculate the blocksize at
install time, and put it somewhere safe (immutable). Like 'export
BLOCKSIZE=&lt;whatever&gt;' in /etc/profile.
</p>

<p>
I also saw that adding ' (apostrophe) before the block size will yield
you a digit separator -- cool, eh?
</p>

<p>
I did:
<pre>
BLOCKSIZE="'4096" ls -l
           ^ &lt;- see this?
</pre>

<p>
and it gave me size figures separated by commas! <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
My $LANG is en_IN.UTF-8
</p>

<p>
YMMV

That's funny:  I'd already permanently consigned to the outer darkness
the domain that sent us this rubbish last month, but neglected to do
likewise with two other variants.  I'm attending to that oversight, now.

<p>
Hi guys,
</p>

<p>
Good day!
</p>

<p>
I am currently doing my phd in telecommunications  working on tcp. I
found the document tcp_input.c  and tc.c source code document at a
website  but browsing through my kernel, I cannot find the source codes
mentioned.  Thus, this inquiry.
</p>

<p>
It would be appreciated if you can kindly help me on my questions since
I am new to tcp.
</p>

<p>
1.      I am using fedora core6 linux and I cannot find the file
tcp_input.c  and tcp.c in the kernel. Where can I find this code in the
kernel  since I need to do some modification on the tcp header as part
of my thesis?
</p>

<p>
2.      What are the steps  in inserting an estimated value into a
kernel variable?
</p>

<p>
I have already visited the linux kernel faq and I cannot find the answer
to my questions ( or maybe I need to browse more<img src="../gx/frown.png" alt=":-(">). I hope you can
shed light on the above queries. Thank you very much in advance.
</p>

<p>
Cheers,
</p>

<p>
Dom Ignacio

Hello TAG,
</p>

<p>
I have a text file from which I want to list only those lines which
contain either pattern1 or patern2 or both.
</p>

<p>
How to do this with 'gre'p?
</p>

<p>
Assume, file is 'patch', and 'string1' and 'string2' are the two patterns.
</p>

<p>
The strings for me are: 'ha_example' and 'handler'- so I cannot
possibly write a regex for that.
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
Amit
