<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A scheduler is responsible for the coordination of the
running of processes to manage their access to the system resources such
that each candidate process gets a fair share of the available process
time, with the utilisation of the CPU being maximised. The scheduler (dispatcher)
must ensure that processes gain access to the CPU for a time relative to
its designated priority and process class and that no process is starved
of access to the CPU, no matter if it is the lowest priority task available.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;A process may choose to voluntarily give up it's
use of the microprocessor when it must wait, usually for some system resource
or for synchronisation with another process. Alternatively the scheduler
may pre-emptively remove the thread or process from the CPU at the expiry
of it's allocated time quantum. The scheduler chooses which is the most
appropriate process to run next.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;Scheduling is an operation of the kernel, which
defines the following process states :</FONT>
