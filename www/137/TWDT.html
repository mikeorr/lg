<p>
Hi list
One of Google's SoC 2007 ideas by Ubuntu is
</p>

<p>
Remote accessibility
</p>

<p>
Ubuntu should have an easily installable and enable-able feature to
allow remote access to your desktop, files, and other resources over
the Internet. This could be accomplished via IPv6 when available,
dynamic DNS (i.e. dyndns.org) and UPnP when not. Ideally everything
would be ssh tunneled, with simple clients for Windows, Mac, and Linux
distributed on USB keys or CD-R's. The client could rely on public key
authentication and present options for VNC (or NX) remote control,
drive mapping, or other resource sharing once connected. When
appropriate, it should also allow read-only anonymous access if the
owner has enabled it (for websites and shared calendars, for example).
</p>

<p>
Any thoughts on how we could implement a Simple, Bare Bone Remote
access software?

Dear list,
</p>

<p>
Hope everyone is well here.  I am in search of some web
based tool for linux server and may be some one of you
suggest me some possible solutions.
</p>

<p>
I am using apache and webdav in a linux server. So
developers can create/edit their scripts  by accessing
webdav and can check it
through apache. Now not every one has to write permission on
all the folders under the htdocs.  since webdav authenticate
user
by LDAP so it can be solved by the &lt;limit&gt; tag in httpd.conf
</p>

<pre>
reference   <a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Apache-WebDAV-LDAP-HOWTO">http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Apache-WebDAV-LDAP-HOWTO</a>
</pre>
Based on the Project requirement I have to modify the
read/write  permission of the developers frequently.
Is there any web based tool so that this permission changing
can be done from a browser ?
I need this so that the project manager then do this from
his windows machine.
</p>

<p>
OR   is there any other solution to do this ? I left samba
as there was a problem to edit files on linux by dreamweaver
from windows
because of time server problem. So any other way ?
</p>

<p>
thanks for your time.

<p>
Good Day!
</p>

<p>
     I have a bit of a challenge on my hands that I think you can help me 
with. My company (as listed below) makes automated computer placement 
machines that run on a Linux platform. We have used RedHat exclusively for 
years. Recently, we have upgraded to a Fedora version.
</p>

<p>
    Into the Linux, we have our own GUI that is used for menu's, data 
entry, etc. We call it TPSys (Test and Place System). Well, there are many 
versions of TPSys that have been released over the years. Each version 
gives new features, some mechanical support, many software improvements.
</p>

<p>
     I am the corporate trainer for this company. I am in a situation now 
where we just released a new version of the TPSys. Many customers that we 
have won't be elegible or just won't get the new software, so I'm in a 
situation where I now have to offer courses on older TPSys software, as 
well as new! I need to have my demo machine running the software 
applicable to that course. Short of changing the hard drive each time, I 
would like to have the machine be a dual boot system so that I can choose.
</p>

<p>
     I have several options at hand. I have a secondary IDE spot that I 
can put a slave H/D, or, I can partition the drive (it's 80Gig, where we 
really only need a 40Gig partition to run).
</p>

<p>
     My question for you guys is this...... if I edit the lilo.conf file, 
there is a boot line. The standard line that is in my machine is 
"boot=/dev/hda". What do I need to add in order have the choice of which 
hard drive to boot from? Is there a way to do this, and do you know of 
anyone using this in a practical way?
</p>

<p>
     I really appreciate your time. Thank you in advance.

<p>
Hello all. I'm running Redhat Enterprise Linux version 3.0 with an
active RHN subscription.
</p>

<p>
Linux 2.4.21-47.EL #1 SMP Wed Jul 5 20:30:36 EDT 2006 x86_64 x86_64
x86_64 GNU/Linux
</p>

<p>
I want to upgrade to version 5.0. I?m a bit anxious though. I only have
a few users, but have spent a lot of time getting everything running
well on my box. My question: If I install Red Hat Enterprise V5 using
the upgrade option via the anaconda installer, will I loose any of my
data or applications? I know that doing a clean wipe and reinstall is
the BEST solution, but if possible I would like to upgrade.
</p>

<p>
Here is what I'm specifically concerned about loosing:
Apache, MySql, PHP, Qmail, Vpopmail, and various other small
applications (Webalizer, etc?). All of the above have been compiled from
source. I'm also concerned about stuff in /usr /usr/home /etc and /var
being overwritten.
</p>

<p>
I hope my questions aren't too silly. I'm a novice with basic
administration experience. My server is not a mission critical
commercial machine. Small variances caused by the upgrade would be
easily tolerated.
</p>

<p>
Thanks in advance for any info you may have.
</p>

<p>
Kind regards,
</p>

Hi!
     I have 3 distro`s installed in my system , Debian Etch , Xubuntu Feisty
and PCQLinux 2007(Based on Fedora Core 6). My TimeZone is Asia/Calcutta. Is
there anyway I can make all the distro`s show the right time.I don`t want to
use NTP since the system is not connected to the Internet all the
time.. Since Each time I boot into a distro it adds 5:30 to the system clock
and shows it as the time. By afternoon it shows 10 pm the next day ! Is there
anyway to make them show the right time ?
</p>

<p>
Cheers!

<p>
I know I've seen worse uses of XML, but I can't remember when - the
useful part is just a CSV blob. This is more compact than a 'proper'
use of XML, but it makes it harder to work with using XML tools: the
part that looks most interesting here is (in XPath)
/nmaprun/scaninfo/@services
</p>

<p>
(When I want to test simple XPath expressions, I load the XML into
Firefox and use this bookmarklet):
</p>

<pre>
 javascript:var r=prompt("Type your XPath here",
 '');alert(document.evaluate(r, document, null,
 XPathResult.STRING_TYPE, null).stringValue);
</pre>
It only works when the result is simple text, but that's normally all
I want to find.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; The goal is to move Nmap XML files into a database, with a
&gt; well-thought out DB schema. Ideally, this should work with PostgreSQL,
&gt; MySQL, and other popular databases.
&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Um... why?
</p>

<p>
FWIW, MySQL 5.1 has the ability to import XML directly:

<p>
I have taken some Ethereal logs
</p>

<p>
In Mand 2007 it does repeated DHCP Discovers over and over again and gets 
nothing back.
</p>

<p>
In Mand 2006 it does a single DHCP Request and gets a DHCP ACK back with its 
inet address.
</p>

<p>
I don't know the mechanics of who sends these DHCP signals but I am guessing 
that DHCP Discover is in some way incorrect for my setup. Does anyone know 
how to get it to send DHCP Request instead ?
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
Owen

Current version 3.40 based on Slackware 4.0 and uClibc
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/distributions/baslinux/bl2/index.htm">http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/distributions/baslinux/bl2/index.htm</a>
Previous version 2.1 based on Slackware 7.1
</p>

<p>
Basiclinux 2.1 comes with a 'user', 3.40 does not.
</p>

<p>
The author (Steven Darnold) and some highly experienced support mailing 
list members have not solved this problem in four years.
</p>

<p>
cat filename &gt; /dev/lp0 works for root, so does gs used CLI without lpr, 
or pbmtolj from netpbm.
</p>

<p>
lpr used from Opera, lpr filename or even cat filename | lpr work for 
'user', but for root they do not send anything to the print queue (lpq 
shows no entries).  No error messages.  I just get another prompt.
</p>

<p>
Permissions for lpr are unchanged from Slackware 7.1:
<pre>
-r-s--s--x 1 root lp
</pre>
(Must be s to print as user).
</p>

<pre>
lp0 is crw-r--r-- 1 root root
</pre>
chmod a+w lp0 did not help (crw-rw-rw-) nor did chmod 777 (crwxrwxrwx). 
lp0 works for root except with lpr.
</p>

<p>
In order to work as user I have had to change permissions on /dev/null 
(w), ttyp* and ptyp* (rw), set suid XVESA and anything svgalib (links2, 
zgv, gs), make /var/lock writeable, make any scripts suid or executable as 
user, etc.  An education.  I can now suid user (or login as user), dial, 
load Xvesa, icewm, and rxvt and Opera and print as user.
</p>

<p>
ssh still says 'host key verification failed' though telnet works.
</p>

<p>
I would like to quit struggling with permissions every time I try to work 
as user, and be able to print as root.  I do know I should not work as 
root online but I am not running any servers while online with my modem.
If you scold me please explain why.
</p>

<p>
Also BL3.40 comes with only root not user, so it would be helpful to print 
as root.  Both distributions were designed to be used as root, and the 
author is therefore not interested in solving the problem.
</p>

<p>
No other distribution seems to have this problem.  I read your knowledge 
base and various HOWTOs.
</p>

<p>
Does lpr depend on some other program, library, or device that I need to 
change permissions for?  Can YOU print with lpr as root?
</p>

<p>
Back around 2002 you explained how to use a 2-floppy disk Basiclinux 1 
with mdacon when I had no modprobe or telinit.  I am typing this on my 
dual-head system on the amber TTL monitor.  You also helped me with OSS 
and I can now record midi files from the 1986 Yamaha electronic piano to 
libc5 Rosegarden.

<p>
Hello there,
I've just read an article titled A Beginner's Guide to Dual Booting Linux 
Mint and Windows XP.
I'm interested in giving Linux mint a whirl, without deleting windows XP, so 
this article sounds good to me, but I have one question.
Assuming I successfully install Linux mint in a new partition, what will I 
see each time I boot my computer? i.e. will there be a screen each time 
asking whether I want to boot up in Linux or windows, or will I have to 
change settings in order to set which OS boots up?

At times, we all do things that may not have an obvious reason: for
example, send an email (one that smacks of asperity and entitlement) to
an address used only for publication issues in LG rather than using the
'Talkback' link on the bottom of that page that is specifically and
clearly intended for the purpose of discussing that page. A bit hard to
explain, that - particularly the slightly grating tone, eh?

<p>
In any case, I am CCing this reply to The Answer Gang, where the author
(Rick Moen) can answer you himself. I suspect it was a mistake, but I
will note that it was not one of any substance: as it stands, the
proposed test does exactly what Rick has said it will do - check for
compliance with the time shift. It would be interesting to hear your
explanation of how this has given you grounds for outrage.

<p>
Hello,
</p>

<p>
Here is a way to copy a partition which is mounted <strong>without</strong> copying
all the other partitions that are under it.
</p>

<p>
Let /patha be the mountpoint of the partition from which you want to
copy (it could even be the root path /).
</p>

<p>
Let /dev/new be the device to which you want to copy the data.
<pre>
	mkdir /var/tmp/src
	# The bind mount is the crucial thing!
	mount --bind /patha /var/tmp/src
	mkdir /var/tmp/target
	mount /dev/new /var/tmp/target
	cd /var/tmp/src
	# I find this a neat way to copy all files
	# and permissions
	find . | cpio -pdum /var/tmp/target
	umount /dev/new
	umount /var/tmp/src
	rmdir /var/tmp/{src,target}
</pre>
And you are done!
I hope the above commands are self-explanatory. If not, then I can
explain further.

<h2>News in General</h2>

<h3>Red Hat Releases Enterprise Linux 5.0</h3>

<p>
The new RHEL 5.0 release introduces Xen for virtualization, IPv6 support,
improved SELinux management tools, and a number of new services.  Red Hat
also includes a preview of a new encrypted file system, co-developed with
IBM.  
</p>

<p>
The new version of RHEL changes the user's license choices.  No more
conundrum between desktop, workstation, and server. There are now 2 base
classes: "Client" and "Server", each having license variations with
different degrees of virtual hosting.  There are 2 versions of server, where
the base server licence can only support up to 4 OS virtual guests, and the
advanced server license has no limitation on virtual guests.  Red Hat has
also developed technology to deliver software and updates to customers, even
in virtualized environments. Red Hat Network Satellite provides
capabilities to manage virtualized systems, including the ability to detect
and create Enterprise Linux-based guests and bring them into a managed
environment. RHEL subscribers now have the ability to manage dozens or
thousands of virtual systems as a single system.  
</p>

<p>Here is Red Hat's
technical review of its new Enterprise Linux 5:
<a href="http://www.press.redhat.com/2007/03/14/red-hat-enterprise-linux-5-technical-attributes/">http://www.press.redhat.com/2007/03/14/red-hat-enterprise-linux-5-technical-attributes/</a> .
</p>


<h3>Red Hat, Exadel Open Source Commercial Products under JBoss.org</h3>

<p>
At EclipseCon 2007, Red Hat and Exadel, a provider of rich application
components, announced a strategic partnership that will add mature,
Eclipse-based developer tools for building service-oriented architecture
(SOA) and rich, Web 2.0 applications to Red Hat's integrated platform,
including Red Hat Enterprise Linux and JBoss Enterprise Middleware. This
means that a mature, high-caliber set of Eclipse-based developer tools will
be available in open source. It also means that Red Hat is now supporting
Java Developers, following Sun's release of Java to open source.
</p>

<p>
Exadel Studio Pro provides an advanced Web development environment that
allows developers to work with multiple frameworks within a single
environment. RichFaces and Ajax4jsf offer powerful yet simple models for
building rich Internet and Web 2.0 applications, and supports JSF, Struts,
Hibernate, Spring, and many other platforms.
</p>

<p>
By combining Exadel's developer tools with JBoss Enterprise Middleware, Red
Hat offers a complete development and deployment platform that enables Java
programmers to assemble SOA components and Web 2.0 applications with
dramatically less coding, and reducing development and run-time errors.
</p>

<p>
RichFaces and Ajax4jsf are now available as JBoss RichFaces and JBoss
Ajax4jsf, respectively, on JBoss.org under the LGPL license. Red Hat is
currently working to open-source Exadel Studio Pro as Red Hat Developer
Studio under a GPL-based license. Availability for Red Hat Developer Studio
is planned for the first half of this year. For more information on the
projects, visit: <a href="http://www.jboss.org/">http://www.jboss.org/</a> .
</p>


<h3>Oracle Commits TopLink to JPA Open Source</h3>

<p>
Also at EclipseCon, Oracle announced that it was contributing its TopLink
database connectivity suite for Java to the Eclipse Foundation.  Besides
the code, Oracle announced the proposal of a new Eclipse project to deliver
a comprehensive persistence platform based on the contribution of Oracle
TopLink, a component of Oracle Fusion Middleware, source code, and test
cases.  
</p>

<p>
Oracle TopLink is an award-winning Java persistence framework
offering object-to-relational, object-to-XML, and Enterprise Information
System data access through all of the major standards, including the Java
Persistence API (JPA), Java API for XML Binding, Service Data Objects, and
the Java Connector Architecture.  (Whew... that's a lot of standards!)
Oracle TopLink works with any database, any application server, any
development toolset and process, and any Java application architecture.  In
addition to its code contribution, Oracle proposed a new Eclipse run-time
project to provide a set of persistence services that can be used in
Java and OSGi environments. Working closely with the Eclipse Foundation,
Eclipse member companies, and other contributors, Oracle will use the
existing code base of Oracle TopLink as the starting point for this
project. Through its participation in the OSGi Enterprise Expert Group,
Oracle will also work with the group members to create a set of blueprints
that define how OSGi applications can access standardized persistence
technologies.  
</p>

<p>
The Eclipse Persistence Platform project will be available
free of charge under the Eclipse Public License. For more information about
Oracle's development and contribution of open source solutions, visit:
<a href="http://otn.oracle.com/tech/eclipse/">http://otn.oracle.com/tech/eclipse/</a> .

<h3>Ian Murdock Joins Sun</h3>

<p>
Ian Murdock is leaving the Linux Foundation, and has joined Sun as the new
Chief Operating Platforms Officer. While Ian is not giving out too much
information yet about what he will be doing, we understand that he will be
responsible for building a strategy to evolve both Sun's Solaris and
GNU/Linux. 
</p>

<p>
As the founder of Debian, along with the work he has done as the
CTO of the Linux Foundation and the head of the Linux Standard Base, he
will bring a fresh perspective to Sun's OS strategy.  Ian wrote recently in
his blog: "The last several years have been hard for Sun, but the corner
has been turned. As an outsider, I've watched as Sun has successfully
embraced x86, pioneered energy efficiency as an essential computing
feature, open-sourced its software portfolio to maximize the network
effects, championed transparency in corporate communications, and so many
other great things. Now, I'm going to be a part of it."

<h3>GlassFish V2 Released</h3>

<p>
In other Sun news, Sun and the GlassFish community announced the beta
release of GlassFish V2, the next major version of the open source Java
EE 5 application server, and the release of the Sun Web Developer Pack, a
toolkit designed for simplifying and enabling advanced rich Internet
applications for the Java platform. These releases help enterprises build
and deploy SOA and Web 2.0 applications and services, leveraging 
next-generation Web technologies such as AJAX, scripting, and REST that 
simplify development and deployment of scalable, interactive applications.  
</p>

<p>
GlassFish V2 Beta adds all the enterprise features from Sun's Java System
Application Server Enterprise Edition, such as clustering, administration,
Web Services Interoperability Technology (WSIT), and load balancing to
support highly scalable, volume enterprise deployments for SOA and Web 2.0
applications.  Sun is also announcing creation of a Java Specification
Request (JSR) 311 (<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=311">http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=311</a>), focused on
providing support for RESTful Web Services in the Java Platform, working
with other vendors such as BEA, Apache, Google, JBoss, TmaxSoft, and Jerome
Louvel (author of the Restlet project). This JSR will help further promote
standardization around next-generation Web technologies, and will aim to
provide an easy-to-use API for developers for Java EE or Java SE platforms.
</p> 


<h3>Microsoft Offers Source Code Access to FoxPro Extensions</h3>

<p>Yes, even Redmond is doing an open source jig, of a sort. The
venerable code base for FoxPro has not had a major update in a while,
and hasn't been much of a revenue source since... perhaps Windows 95.
However, there will be what Microsoft calls "shared source" for the
extensions to the FoxPro codebase called the Sedna Project.
</p>

<p>
There had been an overly optimistic report (Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols's
article at 
<a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,2105307,00.asp?kc=EWRSS03129TX1K0000616">http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,2105307,00.asp?kc=EWRSS03129TX1K0000616</a>) that all of FoxPro would become open source, but that invoked a strong denial on the Microsoft
Developer Network Web site:
</p>

<p>
"To reiterate, today we are announcing that we are not planning on
releasing a VFP [Visual FoxPro] 10, and will be releasing the completed
Sedna work on CodePlex at no charge.  The components written as part of
Sedna will be placed in the community for further enhancement as part of
our shared source initiative. You can expect to see the Sedna code on
CodePlex, sometime before the end of summer 2007."
(<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vfoxpro/bb308952.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vfoxpro/bb308952.aspx</a>)
</p>

<p>
Sedna is about .Net and SQL server integration, and also MSbuild
integration, but not changes to the DB engine.  That code will remain
proprietary.
</p>

<p>
Microsoft hasn't specified which license will be used, but, in practice,
the term Microsoft Shared Source Initiative can include a bit of genuine
open source, along with some proprietary licences.
</p>

<p>
Too bad, because turning FoxPro, and xBase DBMSes in general, into an
open source project could lead to a renewal of the focused and fast
small apps that FoxPro and Clipper were famous for, in the late '80s.
</p>


<h3>Chip Wars Continue: AMD's Volley</h3>

<p>
In early December, AMD began showing off its true quad-core "Barcelona"
Opteron 8000 chip, which is expected to show a 40-70 performance gain over
its current Opteron dual-core performance.  The sample chip was shown
running in a 4-socket test system at the AMD Industry Analyst Forum, in
Berkeley, CA.  The test system was upgraded from 2-way chips to 4-way chips
in the same sockets (with a BIOS upgrade), as a proof of concept.  See the
demonstration at <a href="http://www.amd.com/quadcoredemo/">http://www.amd.com/quadcoredemo/</a> .
</p>

<p>
The "Barcelona" is initially aimed at multithreaded applications like
databases or guest operating systems, and will appear in systems supporting
up to 4 such chips, for an inexpensive 16-way server. It is also the first
65 nm chip AMD has produced.
</p>  

<p>
Unlike Intel's approach of first releasing a design with 2 dual cores in
the same case, the quad-core Opteron has faster internal data paths and
more shared cache memory. The future AMD 4-core chips will be called the
Opteron 8000 Series. Intel's quad chips include the Core 2 Extreme QX6700
for gamers, and the Xeon 5300 for servers.

<p>
AMD and IBM also announced a collaboration at the International Electron
Device Meeting last month, to build 45 nm chips by 2008. This development
makes use of immersion lithography using a transparent liquid to fill the
space between the projection lens and the wafer that contains hundreds of
microprocessors. This process provides increased depth of focus, and
improved image fidelity that can improve chip-level performance and
manufacturing efficiency.
</p> 

<p>
Intel is already experimenting with fabricating 45 nm chips, and has
finished designing its first 45 nm chips for release in 2008. Called the
'Penryn' family, these chips will also have 48 new media instructions.
Intel may beat AMD to market with the first 45 nm chips, but it is a
horse race.  AMD has quietly begun selling 2 new 65 nm chips with
performance and power consumption specs similar to that of Intel's
current high-end Xeon chips.   (Engineers at Sun tell <em>LG</em> that
the Intel Woodcrest family chips are very good at processing small and
medium data sets, while the AMD Opterons excel at moving large data sets
through the processors.)

<h3>France Gives Students the Gift of Open Source</h3>
<p>
The French National Assembly will open their next session on new Linux
computers.  These systems will probably be running Ubuntu or France's own
Linux distribution, Mandriva.  Beyond a switch to new Linux desktops for the
French government, other parts of the French government are currently using
the Apache Web server and the Mambo content management system.  Parisian
high school students will also be gifted with free software / open
source applications.  From a ComputerWorld report: 
</p>

<p>
"French authorities will give out 175,000 USB memory sticks loaded with
open-source software to Parisian high school students, at the start of the
next school year... The sticks will probably contain the Firefox 2 Web
browser, Thunderbird e-mail client, an office productivity suite such as
OpenOffice 2, an audio and video player, and software for instant
messaging.... "

<h3>OpenMake Announced the Release of Mojo 7.0 at EclipseCon</h3>

<p>
Mojo 7.0 is a free, community-oriented solution for automating
build-to-release tasks. This build-to-deploy automation solution is
complete, regardless of platform or development language
environment -- unlike other workflow tools designed to only support single
development environments, such as either Java or C.  Developers code,
maintain, manage, and orchestrate hundreds of make and Ant scripts, to
support their build-to-release process. In an effort to bring some order to
the chaos, they look to process-automation solutions that can sit on top of
these scripts, create a central place to execute the scripts in a precise
order, and log results. OpenMake's Mojo solution will provide 
enterprise-level process automation for managing the execution of ad hoc build,
testing, and deployment scripts. OpenMake's solution will interoperate with
other application life cycle tools through "Adaptors".  The Adaptors
provide "out of the box" integration with deployment tools for packaging,
testing tools for test script execution and SCM tools for check-in,
check-out, labeling, Bill of Material reporting, and Build Difference
reporting. Using this OpenMake solution, a complete application lifecycle
process can be defined as a workflow and re-executed by any approved user.
OpenMake offers script adaptors for integrating with SCM and IDE solutions
such as IBM RAD, IBM ClearQuest, IBM ClearCase, Eclipse, Microsoft Visual
Studio and .Net, Perforce, MKS Source, AccuRev, CVS, Subversion, Harvest,
Dimensions, PVCS, and Visual Source Safe.

<h3>SC Magazine Selects Core Impact Penetration Tester for Its Security Lab</h3>

<p>
Core Impact, a leading penetration testing product for assessing
information security risks, earned a perfect score and received one of the
first Lab Approved awards from <a href="http://scmagazine.com/us/">SC Magazine</a>. In its group test of
vulnerability assessment products published in the January 2007 issue, 
<em>SC Magazine</em> recognized Core Impact for its comprehensive
capability in a production environment, performance, and ease of use.
</p>   

<p>
The <em>SC Magazine</em> Lab Approved distinction is awarded to extraordinary
products that fit into the SC Lab environment, and which will be used in
its test bench for the coming year. Core Impact received a perfect five
(out of five) stars across all categories of the evaluation, which included
Features, Ease of Use, Performance, Documentation, and Value for Money.
</p>

<p>
According to the review, penetration tools tend to be designed for very
skilled users. They often run from command lines, and run individual
exploits only. While this is adequate for a research laboratory, for
production testing of large networks, speed, accuracy, and repeatability are
critical. This is where Core Impact shines. Core Impact is developed by
Core Security Technologies.
</p>

<p>
This latest industry accolade joins a growing list of honors for Core
Impact, including <em>eWeek</em> Excellence Awards for Best
Vulnerability Assessment &amp; Remediation Solution, <em>SC
Magazine</em> Reader Trust Award for Best Security Audit Product, the
<em>Info Security Products Guide</em> Hot Companies 2006 Award, and the

<h2>Magical Realism</h2>


<h3>Compact Optical Buffer Tested in Silicon</h3>

<p>
Let there be light... in the Data Center.
</p>

<p>
In the premiere January issue of the scientific journal <a
href="http://www.nature.com/nphoton/index.html">Nature
Photonics</a>, an IBM team reports optical buffering of 10 bits of
information on a tiny part of a silicon chip.  This advance could allow
supercomputers to use fast optical interconnects and achieve better
performance.  
</p>

<p>
This demonstration is a major milestone in development of all-optical
buffers for system interconnects inside systems and between servers. To
avoid data congestion in a switching fabric today, multiple
electrical-to-optical (EO) and OE conversions are necessary to convert
optical signals and store the packets in memory, until the congestion is
resolved. Avoiding multiple EO/OE conversion would not only drive the
cost/performance down significantly, but also might result in better signal
integrity and lower overall power consumption.
</p>

<p>
One way to delay light is to pass it through optical fibers. However,
current "delay line" devices are too big to fit on a microchip. IBM control
the light signal by passing it through a new form of silicon-based optical
delay line, built of up to 100 cascaded "micro-ring resonators." With the
optical waveguide curved to form a ring, it forces light to circle multiple
times, delaying its travel. The resonators are built using current silicon
complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication tools, and will
fit on a microchip.
</p>
  
<p>
This device can to store optical information for data streams as fast at
20 Gbps (gigabits per second). The device comprises up to 100
identical micro-ring resonators, all working in tune to produce
very large optical delays in excess of 500ps. Results represent at least a
factor of 10 improvement with respect to previous efforts.  Interestingly,
the actual demonstrated buffering capacity of 10 bits on a footprint of
0.03mm2 is only about 10 percent of a floppy disk's surface storage density.
</p> 

<p>
This is also an important technological advancement in the area of
nanophotonics. To create the experimental delay lines, significant efforts
were applied to design lossless coupling between the resonators, and to
control geometric parameters of all resonators to within just a few atomic
layers of silicon.

<h3>iRobot Unveils Ready-to-Roll Programmable Robot</h3>

<p>
iRobot Corp. has released iRobot Create, an affordable, programmable robot
designed for aspiring roboticists. Create comes pre-assembled, so
developers can design new robots without having to build a mobile robot
from scratch. The latest robot is available at <http://www.irobot.com>www.irobot.com</a> , and pricing
starts at US $129.99.
</p>

<p>
Create is based on the core technology of iRobot Roomba, the vacuuming
robot that is cleaning millions of homes worldwide, and is compatible with
Roomba's rechargeable batteries, remote control, and other accessories.
</p>

<p>
With Create, developers can now begin designing new robot applications, out
of the box. This new platform provides access to robot sensors and
actuators, via an open interface. Create also features standard connections
for electronics, and threaded mounting holes that allow users to secure
their inventions to the robot, streamlining additions such as sensors,
cameras, arms, and wireless connections.
</p>

<p>
A variety of methods and programming languages can be used to control
Create. Beginners can observe the robot's behavior in one of ten
demonstration modes, or they can program the robot directly by downloading
short scripts with any basic terminal program. More advanced users can
write programs for completely autonomous robot behavior in C or C++, using
the iRobot Command Module. Developers can also create custom software and
interact with Create using a variety of methods, including Microsoft
Robotics Studio, a Windows-based development toolkit.
</p> 

<p>
Helen Greiner, co-founder and chairman of iRobot says, "Innovators
dream of creating useful robots, but often get bogged down with designing a
mobile platform that works... iRobot Create fills a need in the robot
industry for a standard, durable hardware platform on which to rapidly
develop new, innovative mobile robots."

<h1>Cursor Appearance in the Linux Console</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/anonymous.html">Anonymous</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>


<p>
Escape sequences to control the cursor appearance in the
Linux console (text, no X11) are yet to be included in the
manpage on console_codes, but they are tentatively documented
in the file
</p>

<p>
    /usr/src/linux/Documentation/VGA-softcursor.txt
</p>

<p>
This article is mainly an interpreted version of the file
above, with examples added. The file was written in 1999;
if you read it, you'll understand why it needs interpretation.
</p>

<p>
The following files are also relevant:
</p>

<p>
    /usr/src/linux/drivers/char/vt.c<br>
    /usr/src/linux/include/linux/console-struct.h
</p>

<p>
the first of which is, unfortunately, quite tough to
digest.
</p>


<h3>(1) Hardware vs. Software Cursor</h3>

<p>
The Linux cursor is, by default, the normal PC text-mode
cursor. It looks like a short blinking underscore, whitish on
black, with weak contrast in daylight. This is the hardware
cursor, i.e., it is generated by the hardware.
</p>

<p>
However, Linux has the ability to manipulate the cursor
appearance using, e.g., a software-generated non-blinking full
block cursor. This is done with the escape sequence
</p>

<pre class="code">
    \e[?p1;p2;p3;c
</pre>

<p>
where \e is the escape character, and p1, p2 and p3 are
parameters. The last semi-colon is optional. It is used here
to tell the sequence closing letter 'c' from the
parameters. If you omit any of the parameters, they will
default to zero. Only decimals are accepted, and you will
never get an error: your input is going to be restrained to
the valid range.
</p>

<p>
Each console can have its own custom softcursor.
</p>


<h3>(2) Parameters</h3>

<p>
Parameter 3 sets the colour bits in the VGA adapter's
register, parameter 2 toggles the colour bits, and setting
goes before toggling. What that means in practice we'll have
to find out.
</p>

<p>
Parameter 1 specifies cursor size as follows:
</p>

<pre>
0   default
1   invisible
2   underscore
3   lower_third
4   lower_half
5   two_thirds
6   full block
</pre>

<p>
The size refers to the character cell at the cursor. As an
example, issuing
</p>

<pre class="code">
    echo -e "\e[?3c"
</pre>

<p>
from the command line will turn the cursor into a thick
underscore, reclaiming one third of the character cell.
</p>

<p>
Values 7-15 are also accepted, but they give the same as 6.
The cursor default is defined in console-struct.h as the
underscore, so, by default, value 0 is same as value 2.
</p>

<p>
If the first parameter is less than 16, parameters 2 and 3
will be set to 0, and you get the hardware cursor, whitish on
black. If visible, it will blink.
</p>

<p>
As for size, the good news is that parameter 1 really works.
The bad news is that parameter 2 and 3 depend in part on VGA
peculiarities likely to be implemented differently from
graphic adapter to graphic adapter. It can be assumed that
the kernel contributors were coding according to the
official VGA standard, but that rarely used VGA
specifications are implemented in a non-standard way.
</p>

<p>
A softcursor is obtained setting parameter 1 to 16. Values
17-31 are same as 16. A softcursor is a non-blinking full
block in some colour.
</p>

<p>
For instance, let's try
</p>

<pre class="code">
echo -e "\e[?16c"
</pre>

<p>
We see nothing. How come? Very simple - the cursor is now a
block of one full character cell. Parameter 2 and 3 are
missing, so they default to 0. That block uses colour 0,
which is black. Black on black, gives what? That's what you
are seeing.
</p>

<p>
Lesson learnt: if we want to see the softcursor, we must
specify parameter 2 and 3 in a suitable way. Let's try
again:
</p>

<pre class="code">
echo -e "\e[?16;0;16c"
</pre>

<p>
You can go through the entire range of colours (0-7), leaving
the second parameter at 0 and setting the third parameter to
a multiple of 16, or rather a multiple with factor 1-7.
Factor 0 already taught us a lesson. Only dim colours will
obtain.
</p>

<p>
So far, so good. We can get a blinking cursor in differing
sizes; its colour will be the foreground colour in the
console. We can get a non-blinking cursor in (dim)
colours, independently of foreground and background colours
in the console.
</p>


<h3>(3) Surprises</h3>

<p>
The values you enter for parameter 1 are reduced modulo 32.
That means 0-31, 32-63, 64-95 ... are the same. However:
</p>

<pre class="code">
48-63   (range 16-31 plus 32)
	gives a softcursor using the console foreground colour,
	making the character at the cursor invisible

112-127 (range 16-31 plus 32 plus 64)
	gives a softcursor using the console foreground colour
	but allowing the character at the cursor to be read
</pre>

<p>
Try the following:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    (i)     echo -e "\e[?48c"
    (ii)    echo -e "\e[?112c"
</pre>

<p>
Note that you are not specifying parameters 2 and 3. If you
do, the parameters will apply.
</p>

<p>
Also note that a bold foreground colour will be dimmed when
used as background by the softcursor. So if you changed the
console default to bold white on black, both (i) and (ii)
will give a dim white non-blinking block.
</p>

<p>
If you try to get some interesting cursor just firing off
wild parameters, be assured that your options are limited,
and you will be wasting plenty of time for nothing.
Essentially, what you have got to remember is:
</p>

<p>
    parameter 3 determines the softcursor background,<br>
    parameter 2 determines the softcursor foreground.
</p>

<p>
This rule, however, is not 100% correct, since parameter 3
does affect the dim/bold status of the foreground. For
instance, let's try the range 64-79 with parameter 2 fixed
at 0. The softcursor background is in this case red. What
changes when the parameter runs through the range 64-79 is
how the character at the cursor shows up.
</p>

<p>
We are starting from the defaults dim white on black and
issue
</p>

<pre class="code">
    echo -e "\e[?16;0;64c"
</pre>

<p>
The cursor background is red; the character at the cursor is
dim white. We go up from 64 to 71, and the result is the
same. However, for 72-79, the character at the cursor is
turned bold; we have bold white on red.
</p>

<p>
The result is simple: with parameter 2 fixed at 0, parameter
3 will have
</p>

<pre class="code">
    dim  foreground for  16*k + l    (l is 0-7)
    bold foreground for  16*k + l    (l is 8-15)
</pre>

<p>
where k runs from 1-7.
</p>

<p>
Fine, but what if we keep parameter 3 fixed and let
parameter 2 run? In our example, we keep parameter 3 at 64,
and let parameter 2 go through 1-15. The result is cursor
foreground in different colours, while the background does
not change.
</p>

<p>
This is the maximum you can aspire to. The softcursor's own
foreground and background can be different from foreground
and background in the console, showing you four colours at
all times.
</p>


<h3>(4) Delusions</h3>

<p>
You have dutifully read VGA-softcursor.txt, and something
caught your attention. Apparently, with the softcursor you
can
</p>

<pre>
    [ ... ] highbright the cursor character and still keep the original
    hardware cursor visible.
</pre>

<p>
Well, no - or at least, it depends. The authors were not
aware that their hardware was behaving its own way. Compare
with the following, where the author clearly warns that what
he is saying applies to his ATI Mach 64 card:
</p>

<pre>
    echo -e '\033[?18;255;8c' -- .... if this doesn't get your
    attention, I don't know what will... (nonblinking 'transparent'
    block... blinking the character it's over - over an underline
    that blinks at twice the rate....)
</pre>

</p>


<h3>(5) Mystery</h3>

<p>
Are we done yet? That would seem to be the case, but for a
crash I experienced recently.
</p>

<p>
A small text-mode application crashed, and left behind a
console with white on black and a blinking cursor underscore. 
That blinking underscore was red; yes, it was red!
</p>

<p>
Now, there is absolutely no trace on the Web of a hardware
cursor with its own very private colour. Of course, I cannot
prove it, but, after a couple of hours googling, I would take
any bet. Furthermore, the official wisdom states:
</p>

<pre>
    On the standard VGA, the [hardware] cursor color is obtained
    from the foreground color of the character that the cursor is
    superimposing. On the standard VGA, there is no way to modify
    this behavior.
</pre>

</p>

<p>
So here is my request for support:
</p>

<ul>
<li> -  Has anybody ever seen a console (text, no X11) with a
        hardware underscore blinking in its own distinct colour?

<li> -  If so, were you able to reproduce it?

<h1>Getting Started with Linux Mint</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/lazar.html">Shane Lazar</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>This is my second article aimed at new users of the <a
href="http://www.linuxmint.com/" target="_blank">Linux Mint</a>
distribution. My <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/136/lazar.html">first
article</a> is on installing a dual-boot setup with Linux Mint and
Windows XP. In this article, I would like to talk you through some basic
things one should know about using Linux Mint, and generally just help
you be productive in your new OS environment. I am going to direct my
articles toward a single home PC connected to the Internet, with
multiple users.</p>

<p>Although the desktop environment in modern day Linux is intuitive and
more or less easy to navigate through, for someone coming from Windows
XP, we must keep in mind that the two OSs are different at the 'roots',
even though at the surface they may seem similar. At first, the way
somethings are done in Linux might seem quirky.</p>

<p>One immediate difference you will notice is that Linux always asks
you for an administrator's password when performing changes to the
system. This may seem like an annoyance coming from Windows, but it is to
make sure nobody makes changes that could break your system, including
the administrator (by accident of course) and malicious software.
However, to ease things up a bit, once entered, Linux Mint will maintain
administrator mode for 15 minutes, and will not ask you for the password
in this period. The administrator is the user you created during the
installation.</p>

<p>I urge you to persevere a little, as once you have set everything up,
you will not be asked for the password unless system changes are
required. As you use Linux, you will (at least I did) realize that
Linux today is an easy, secure, and convenient solution for your
computing needs. Let us move on, to using Linux Mint.</p>

<h4>mintMenu</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/1.png" border="0" alt="the mint menu" width= "357" height="254"></p>

<p>Your primary interaction with your computer is the menu at the bottom
left labeled 'Bianca'. This menu (<em>mintMenu</em>) is unique to Linux
Mint, and I must say they have developed a very easy and efficient menu
system. The menu has been neatly divided into three sections: Places,
System, and Applications. 

<ul>

<li><p>The items under <strong>Places</strong> logically opens the file
manager, <em>Nautilus</em>, in the respective locations.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>System</strong> houses the Application Installer
(<em>Synaptic Package Manager</em>), the Control Center
(<em>mintConfig</em>), <em>Terminal</em>, Lock, and Quit dialogues. I
shall expand on some of these, later.</p></li>

<li><p>The <strong>Applications</strong> section, in true Linux
tradition, groups applications according to their use. This, in my eyes,
has always been a plus point for Linux over Windows: a very simple idea,
but very effective. Also, newly installed applications are automatically
placed in their respective categories. In keeping with simplicity, most
application names are simplified with their use in mind, e.g., <em>Movie
Player</em>, which is actually <em>Totem Movie Player</em>. <br>A
brilliant touch to <em>mintMenu</em> is the search field at the bottom.
When you enter text here, the list of applications is filtered, finding
what you are looking for. If you know what application you are looking
for, you could type its name, <em>Firefox</em>, for example. However, if you
don't know the name of the application, you could also type the task you
wish to perform! For example, typing <tt>hardware</tt> gives you
<em>Device Manager</em>, <tt>command</tt> gives you <em>Terminal</em>,
<tt>spreadsheet</tt> gives you <em>OpenOffice Calc</em>, etc. Although
it is not all-inclusive, it is a handy feature for newcomers.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/2.png" border="0" alt="search
application" width= "466" height="383"></p>

<p>Further, entering something and then hitting <tt>Enter</tt> opens the
search application and searches your home folder for the string you have
entered, even searching inside documents, logged IM conversations,
contacts, and more. This uses an indexing service called <em>Beagle</em>
that runs continuously in the background. I am not a big fan of such
non-essential applications that run continuously in the background, and
eliminate their need by organizing and naming my files properly. So, I
usually turn <em>Beagle</em> off and use the command-line interface
(CLI) -based search tool called <em>slocate</em>. However, I have seen
situations when it can be useful, and I have used it before. Point being
that it all boils down to <strong>choice</strong>.</p></li>

</ul>

<h4>Networking</h4>

<p>In today's world, a computer not networked is like an airplane without
wings: you're not going to get very far without networking. If your
network is a wired Ethernet one with <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHCP" target="_blank">DHCP</a>
(automatically assigned IP addresses), Linux Mint should have already
set everything up for you nicely. Some ISPs require you to configure a
static IP address. You will need the following information about your
connection: your IP address, Subnet mask, Gateway address, and DNS
server address.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/3.png" border="0" alt="network
configuration tool" width= "577" height="403"></p>

<p> Open the <em>Control Center</em>, and click on the
<tt>Networking</tt> button, which will take you to the page with the
network configuration tools. Select the first tool labeled
<tt>Networking</tt>. It will prompt you to enter the administrator's
password. The tool opens with a tab displaying all your networking
hardware. Select <tt>Wired connection</tt>, and click
<tt>Properties</tt>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/4.png" border="0" alt="enter
network settings" width= "250" height="166"></p>

<p>Set your connection as <tt>Static IP address</tt> from the drop-down
list, enter the settings appropriately, tick <tt>Enable this
connection</tt>, and accept the settings.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/5.png" border="0" alt="enter DNS
settings" width= "328" height="245"></p>

<p>Then, select the DNS tab, enter your ISP's DNS server address in the
first row, and hit <tt>Enter</tt>. Some ISPs may have more than one DNS
server, and you can add them by clicking <tt>Add</tt>, which will create a
second field for entering a DNS server. Repeat for other DNS servers.
Click <tt>Close</tt>, and you should be done! Fire up Firefox, and try
browsing your favorite Web site, or at least one that will be up for sure.
My default is the <a href="http://www.google.com"
target="_blank"/>Google homepage</a>. If it does not work, you could try
rebooting.</p>

<p>If you use a wireless connection, Linux Mint comes with a specialized
configuration tool, <em>mintWifi</em>, and a comprehensive guide to get
it working. Enter the following location in the <em>Firefox</em> address
bar <b>while in Linux Mint</b>, to access this guide
(<tt>file:///usr/lib/linuxmint/mintWifi/index.html</tt>). If you are
relying on an internal dial-up modem for Internet access, then the solution is
slightly more complicated: You can follow the <a
href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DialupModemHowto"
target="_blank"/>Ubuntu HowTo</a> to try and get it working. Linux's
problem in this area is not due to its shortcomings, but rather the
refusal of hardware manufacturers to provide drivers for them. This is
why the community is fighting for open-sourced drivers. The dedicated
Linux developers have even <a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/7636"
target="_blank"/>offered to make the drivers for free</a>! Slowly but
surely, the community is making advances in this field.</p>

<p>If you are still facing problems, do not hesitate to ask questions on
the multitude of community-supported help sites. There is a <a
href="http://www.linuxmint.com/forum/" target="_blank">forum</a> that is
supported by and dedicated to Linux Mint. See the links section at the
top right of my blog for <a href="http://www.linuxquestions.org"
target="_blank">my favorite Linux forum</a>. Friendly and helpful people
abound in the Linux community and it is on the shoulders of these giants
that Linux stands.</p>

<h4>Updating</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/6.png" border="0" alt="update
notification" width= "278" height="66"></p>

<p>I am sure by now you have seen a little orange square and a pop-up,
informing you that updates are available for Linux Mint. Until we got
the network up and running, there was no way to update your OS. Since
we've now got access to the Internet, we will proceed with updating.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/7.png" border="0" alt="update
manager" width= "275" height="377"></p>

<p>This is a no-brainer, and all it requires is clicking the orange icon
and entering your administrator's password. This opens the <em>Software
Updates</em> dialogue that shows you what updates are available,
categorizes them according to importance, and tells you how big the
download is. You have the option of deselecting updates, but, unless you
are restricted by your Internet connection, it would be unwise to do so.
Click <tt>Install Updates</tt>, and the application downloads, installs,
and configures everything just right.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/8.png" border="0" alt="reboot
dialogue" width= "212" height="91"></p>

<p>Sometimes, when core system updates are made, as is the case with the
first Linux Mint update, you will be required to restart your computer
for them to take effect. The <em>Update Manager</em> will inform you
when this is necessary, and the orange icon is replaced with a blue
reboot icon.</p>

<p>The beauty of the <em>Update Manager</em> is that it automatically
keeps track of available updates without any input from you. When
updates are available, you will get a visit from the little orange icon,
and will have to follow the same steps. So, your system is always fitted
with the latest versions of software, patches and fixes. As I said, it's
a no-brainer!</p>

<h4>Mounting Windows Partitions</h4>

<p>Here, I am writing pretty much blind and from speculation. This is
because I do not have Windows installed on my computer, as you may have
gathered from my first article. I suppose Linux Mint mounts your Windows
partitions during the install, and everything should be setup properly.
The default mount points for the partitions are <tt>/media/hda1,
/media/hda2</tt>, and so forth. Linux Mint also creates links to the
partitions on your Desktop labeled <tt>hda1</tt>, <tt>hda2</tt>, etc.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/9.png" border="0" alt="mintDisk"
width= "358" height="253"></p>

<p>However, if your partitions are not mounted, a tool is provided that
will enable you to do so. It is called <em>mintDisk</em>, and can be
found in the menu under <tt>Applications &gt; Administration</tt> or in the
<em>Control Center</em> under the <em>Hardware</em> tab. Once you start
<em>mintDisk</em>, you will be prompted for the administrator's password,
and <em>mintDisk</em> opens up. There are fields available for
configuring various options, but, unless you know what you are doing, it is
better to leave them alone and simply click <tt>OK</tt>. If the
partitions are not mounted immediately, they will be after the next
reboot. Again, I apologize but I have no way of testing this, first
hand.</p>

<p><em>mintDisk</em> will mount your NTFS and FAT32 partitions with read
and write permissions. Practically, what this means is that you will be
able to browse, open, modify, create, or delete files and folders in your
Windows partitions, i.e., you will have full access to them.</p>

<h4>Installing NVIDIA and ATI Graphic Card Drivers</h4>

<p>Both Windows XP and Linux Mint come with a wide range of drivers for
various graphic cards. While these will give you basic functionality, in
order to get the most out of 3D-accelerated cards you will need to
install the drivers provided by the manufacturer. As you may know, the
most popular graphic card manufacturers on the market today are NVIDIA
and ATI. You will have to know which one you have (NVIDIA or ATI), in
order to install the correct driver. If, like me, you have a low end
graphics card, you will <strong>not</strong> need to install any other
drivers as they are well supported with Open Source drivers. These 
low-end cards include SiS, Intel, and others that escape my memory 
right now - generally anything not NVIDIA or ATI.
<a href="#1"><strong>[1]</strong></a></p>

<p>Since I do not have an NVIDIA or ATI card, I cannot give you a 
first-hand account of what you should do, but, apparently it is as
simple as most of the other tools in Linux Mint, albeit a little
different. The tool in question is <em>Envy</em>. Linux Mint (at the
time of writing) comes with an older version (0.8.x). The newer version
is way too easy to ignore, so I'll guide you as far as I can using
that.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/10.png" border="0" alt="envy home
page" width= "600" height="450"></p>

<p>First, we will get the new version from the <a
href="http://www.albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html"
target="_blank">author's Web site</a>. You can read through the brief
description of <em>Envy</em>, to have an idea of what this brilliant tool
does. <em>Envy</em> was written for Ubuntu, but since Linux Mint is
dedicated to maintaining compatibility with Ubuntu, it will work fine.
The download section follows the description of <em>Envy</em> (as shown
in the screenshot). Linux Mint 2.2 Bianca is based on the latest version
of Ubuntu, which is Ubuntu "Edgy Eft" 6.10. Simply go with the latest
version of Ubuntu, since that is what Linux Mint is based on. Soon (April
2007), it will be Ubuntu "Feisty Fawn" 7.04.</p>

<p>There are many downloads available, but you are looking for the latest
<tt>*.deb</tt> file. At the moment, you will find it under <em>Package
for Ubuntu Edgy Eft 6.10</em>. The file name (now) is
<tt>envy_0.9.1-0ubuntu3_all.deb</tt>, but always go for the latest
<strong>stable</strong> version. Click on the download, and
<em>Firefox</em> will ask you what you want to do with it. Select
<em>Open with</em> <tt>Gdebi Package Installer</tt>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/11.png" border="0" alt="Gdebi
warning" width= "335" height="255"></p>

<p>Once Gdebi opens it (administrator's password required), it will
inform you that an older version is installed, and recommend you install
software from the Linux Mint <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repository"
target="_blank">repositories</a>. I would recommend the same, but we'll
make an exception, this time:  Close the dialogue, and click <tt>Install
Package</tt>. <em>Gdebi</em> will then provide you with a list of
required <a
href="http://www.answers.com/topic/coupling-computer-science"
target="_blank">dependencies</a>, which it will have to download. Accept
to do so. When the installation is complete, close <em>Gdebi</em>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/12.png" border="0" alt="envy" width= "419" height="347"></p>

<p>Now we run <em>Envy</em>. You will find it in the menu under
<tt>Applications &gt; System Tools</tt>, and it will require the
administrator's password. Select <tt>Install the NVIDIA driver</tt> or
<tt>Install the ATI driver</tt>, as appropriate for your graphics card.
Click <tt>Apply</tt>.  If I am not mistaken, everything should be
handled '<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/automagical"
target="_blank">automagically!</a>' I am not sure, because I do not have
the hardware, but <em>Envy</em> may ask you for some information such as
your screen resolution, monitor specifications like frequencies, and the
like. These you can get from your monitor's manual or run a quick Google
search. When <em>Envy</em> provides you the option of restarting the X
server, do so. This should take you back to the login screen, and you
should see the NVIDIA or ATI logo before the login screen (unless things
have changed since I had my Geforce2). If not, you could try
rebooting.</p>

<h4>Synaptic Package Manager</h4>

<p>New users to Linux usually try to do things as they would in Windows.
This is most often seen in program installation. Most go hunting on the
Internet for sites from which to download software they need. Usually,
they end up going to the project's homepage, downloading the tar.gz file,
and then usually get stumped on installing it from the command line. 
Many a time they also run into what is known as <a
href="http://www.answers.com/topic/dependency-hell"
target="_blank">dependency hell</a>. On the contrary, application
installation in Linux is meant to be painless, thanks to the plethora
package managers available. Linux Mint uses <a
href="http://www.debian.org/" target="_blank">Debian's</a>
<tt>apt-get</tt> package manager. <em>Synaptic Package Manager</em> is
one of the available <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface"
target="_blank">graphical user interfaces (GUI)</a> of this powerful
package manager.</p>

<p><em>Synaptic Package Manger</em> is in the menu under the
<em>System</em> section, and is labeled <em>Install Software</em>. To run
it, you will need the administrator's password.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/13.png" border="0" alt="Synaptic
Package manager" width= "600" height="450"></p>

<p>The interface is divided neatly into three fields: On the left, there
is a list of categories of software, grouped according to various
criteria. There are four grouping criteria, which can be selected by
clicking on the buttons on the bottom left: <em>Sections, Status,
Search Results</em>, and <em>Custom Filters</em>. The top-right field
contains the list of packages in the category selected in the left field,
and their status. The bottom-right field gives a short description of
the package selected in the top right field. <em>Synaptic Package
Manager</em> contains a database of all the packages available for Linux
Mint, including those not installed on your system. Browsing through the
database, you will see that the amount of free software available to do
almost any task imaginable is truly mind-boggling!</p>

<p>The easiest way to find a an application or package is to use the
search tool. Click the <tt>Search</tt> button, and a small dialogue opens
with a field to enter your search term and a drop-down list telling it
where to search. If you know what package you are looking for, select
<tt>Name</tt> from the list, and run the search. If you want to perform a
task but don't know what application you should install, select
<tt>Description and Name</tt> from the list, and run the search.</p>

<p>For example, I needed an image editor to crop and resize the
screenshots for this article. So I ran a search for <tt>image
editing</tt> in <tt>Description and Name</tt>. This gave me a
substantial list of matching packages. You will notice that some
packages also have the Ubuntu logo next to them. This indicates that
these packages are officially supported by Ubuntu, and will most probably
work perfectly. Among the officially supported packages in my search
result, the descriptions showed that the <tt>GIMP</tt> package is what
suited what I was looking for, the most. (I confess, I knew that
already....) Installing is just a matter of <tt>Right-clicking</tt> on
the package and selecting <tt>Mark for Installation</tt>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/14.png" border="0" alt="Synaptic
additional marked changes" width= "275" height="224"></p>

<p>If additional packages are required, a dialogue opens, informing you
what other changes are required for things to work properly. Click
<tt>Mark</tt> to accept the other changes. You will see the package
highlighted as marked for installation.<p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/15.png" border="0" alt="Synaptic
confirmation dialogue" width= "265" height="256"></p>

<p>Then click <tt>Apply</tt>. A dialogue will open, which will give you a
summary of changes to be made, including the total size of packages to be
downloaded and the space that will be used by the installed packages.
Click <tt>Apply</tt> again and wait for it to download, install, and
configure everything for you.<p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/16.png" border="0" alt="Synaptic
success dialogue" width= "299" height="136"></p>

<p>You will be informed when the installation is complete, and if there

<p> [1] <span class="editorial">Rick Moen comments</span>:  The utility
and necessity of ATI and Nvidia's proprietary drivers are frequently
overstated, innocently by most commentators, and less so by that
driver software's core constituency.  That core constituency has to date
comprised 3D gamers (majority), scientists and animators using 3D for
various types of 3D modeling (minority) and miscellaneous desktop users
experimenting with 3D desktop effects such as provided by the quite
flashy Compiz and Beryl 3D window managers (small minority).</p>  

<p>Utility:  As noted above.  It's important to note that no video chipset,
from any manufacturer, in any way requires proprietary drivers for
regular everyday X11 desktop functions, including all regular
applications including graphics, desktop publishing, etc.  A combination
of 3D-capable video hardware and 3D-capable drivers are required only
for the rather specialised uses described previously.</p>

<p>To be blunt, aside from having found Compiz/Beryl screen-rolling visual
effects cute and appealing for about the first half-hour, I personally
could go the rest of my life without 3D cabilities in my X11 sessions,
and not miss them at all -- and I strongly suspect that will likewise be 
true of almost all Linux users, for some time to come.  Also, avoiding having
some hardware manufacturer's un-auditable binary-only proprietary
drivers running in my systems' kernelspace leads immediately to a huge 
gain in system reliability and security.  (Note that the Linux kernel's
"taint flag" was developed in response to the Linux kernel mailing list
being swamped with bug reports ultimately traceable to buggy Nvidia
kernel drivers: deployment of the "taint flag" enabled kernel coders to
ignore problem reports from all such users, and they consistently now do
so.)</p>

<p>Necessity:  An increasingly significant number of graphics chips from
non-ATI/Nvidia manufacturers, notably the Intel i965 chip series, have
lately been able to achieve quite respectable 3D framerates using
entirely open source drivers/libraries (X.org and Mesa, or Xgl) -- 
because those manufacturers, unlike ATI and Nvidia, cooperate with the
open source community.  Additionally, and almost never mentioned by the
proprietary drivers' proponents, entirely open source 3D works for 
most ATI R2x0 and R3x0 chips, and a project is underway to do likewise
for Nvidia chips.  
See <a href="http://dri.freedesktop.org/">http://dri.freedesktop.org/</a> and
<a href="http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/">http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/</a>
for details.</p>

<p>Discussion of 3D on Linux was for years -- again, to be blunt --
relegated mostly to 3D gamers, especially during the 2000-2004 economic
downturn when gamers were practically the only people buying new
hardware. It's past time for the open source community to take the
subject back, and correct the misperception that proprietary drivers are
broadly necessary and desirable. They are neither.</p>

<h1>Measuring Congestion Windows of TCP Senders</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/pfeiffer.html">Ren&eacute; Pfeiffer</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
My last two articles (<a href="../135/pfeiffer.html">1</a>, <a
href="../136/pfeiffer.html">2</a>) described the mechanism of TCP
congestion control and how the Linux kernel implements it. In order to
gain access to the parameters of a TCP connection, I introduced a daemon
written in C that accepts a TCP stream's data and periodically writes
the parameters of the TCP connection to a file; that took care of the
receiver. The sender side, however, is still missing, so we'll turn our
attention to that last piece in the puzzle.  </p>


<h3>
Every Line Has Two Ends
</h3>

<p>
Everyone who has ever been involved in networking knows that a data
transmission such as a TCP stream has two ends: you always have a sender
and a receiver, regardless of how asymmetric your data transfer may be.
The receiver has to adjust its window in order to efficiently handle
data reception. At the same time, the sender has to estimate how many
packets can be sent without seeing any acknowledgement of proper
reception. These two TCP parameters do not necessarily change equally.
First of all, there might be different operating systems involved. This
means that two different TCP/IP stacks talk to each other, with both
sides having their own ideas on how to evaluate the quality of the data
link.  Then, there are the different TCP congestion algorithms, with some
of them being valid only for the sender, and not for the receiver.<br> 

We will now concentrate on the sender side, and insert some code to look
at the TCP connection. We do this in the same way we did for the
receiver. Our C program will get a lot easier, since we don't need to
write a daemon process - we just need a client that grabs some data,
opens a connection to the receiver, and starts sending packets.  </p>

<h3>
Writing a TCP Sender
</h3>

<p>
Again, before writing code, you should always have a rough idea what you
want to accomplish. Programming is nothing more than compiling a list of
things to think about (which also means that people thinking in very
complex ways may have to write more code). Investing some time into a
plan can save you a lot of frustrating hours, later, when coding your
ideas. Basically a TCP sender should do the following.  </p>

<ol>
<li> Open a TCP socket to the receiver.</li>
<li> Open a file to write the TCP parameters to.</li>
<li> Start a loop that sends the given data payload.</li>
<li> Periodically check the kernel's tcp_info structure and save interesting values.</li>
<li> Close TCP socket and close the output file.</li>
</ol>

<p>
There we go; it's a lot simpler than the last example code. With regard
to the data payload, you can either create the data in the program by
using random values (or counters), or you can read a file and send it to
the TCP socket. I decided to do the latter, since it's closer to real
life. Of course, this means that you have to take disk I/O into account,
when dealing with very fast network links such as gigabit Ethernet: if
the disk subsystem can't keep up with the network interface card, it will
most certainly have an impact on the performance of your TCP
transmission.  </p>

<p>
Just as in the daemon code, we will have to set a byte limit on the
chunks we put on the network.  This will also suggest the rate at which
we should copy the TCP parameters to our statistics file.  We'll read the
data in the tcp_info structure every <em>n</em> bytes.  </p>

<h3>
Connecting to the Receiver
</h3>

<p>
The connection consists of multiple steps. First of all, we need a TCP socket:
</p>

<pre>
tcp_socket = socket( PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP );
if ( tcp_socket == -1 ) {
    fprintf(stderr,"Could not open TCP socket: %s\n",strerror(errno));
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
</pre>

<p>
We will use this socket for our data transmission. In contrast to the
code of our receiver, we only need a single socket and some appropriate
options. There is one particular option that might make some sense; I
found it after doing some test runs of the code. Whenever the sender has
sent all the data but the receiver hasn't yet received all packets,
there is no reason for the sender to keep the TCP socket open: all
packets are managed by the kernel, and the application can't do much
other than waiting or checking the socket for errors. If you want the
socket to last a bit longer than the time needed to copy the payload to
the buffers, you can set the SO_LINGER option with a call to
<tt>setsockopt()</tt>. You'll also have to prepare a variable of 
type <tt>struct linger</tt>, and load it with the options used by
SO_LINGER. We'll enable the option, and set the timer to 13 seconds,
meaning the socket will close 13 seconds after the last packet was given
to the kernel for transmission.  </p>

<pre>
lingeropt.l_onoff  = 1;
lingeropt.l_linger = 13;
if ( setsockopt( tcp_socket, SOL_SOCKET, SO_LINGER,
                 (void *)&amp;lingeropt, sizeof(lingeropt) ) == -1 ) {
    fprintf(stderr,"Could not set SO_LINGER option: %s\n\\"
                   "Closing the socket will happen in the background.\n",strerror(errno));
}
</pre>

<p>
Note that we continue if this option cannot be set: I used it as an
example of how to properly set socket options. SO_LINGER isn't that
important for what we have in mind, so we'll make that option
optional.<br> 

Now we have all we need, and can connect to the server on a specific
port. How do we do that? The user could have provided the server's
address either as a numerical IP or as a name that has to be resolved
via DNS, so we have to convert this into something suitable for the call
to <tt>connect()</tt>.  Fortunately, the GNU C Library can do this for
us. The function <tt>gethostbyname()</tt> addresses all our needs: it
returns a pointer to a <tt>hostent</tt> structure containing the
server's address in decoded form.  </p>

<pre>
server = gethostbyname( opt_server );
if ( server == NULL ) {
    fprintf(stderr,"Could not resolve server name!\n");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
</pre>

<p>
The last thing we need to do is prepare and issue a call to
<tt>connect()</tt>. We do this by copying the data returned by
<tt>gethostbyname()</tt> to a structure of type <tt>sockaddr</tt>. The
only information still missing is the port number, so we convert it to
network byte order and write it to the structure. Now, we can connect to
the receiver.  </p>

<pre>
server_address.sin_family = AF_INET;
memcpy( &amp;server_address.sin_addr.s_addr, server-&gt;h_addr, server-&gt;h_length );
server_address.sin_port = htons(opt_port);
if ( connect( tcp_socket, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;server_address, sizeof(server_address) ) == -1 ) {
    fprintf(stderr,"Could not connect to server: %s\n",strerror(errno));
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
</pre>

<p>
The client is ready to send the data.
</p>

<h3>
Mapping a File to Memory
</h3>

<p>
The next step is to prepare the data payload. I already talked about
sending a file to the receiver; we have two options for this, after
opening a file descriptor.  </p>

<ol>
<li> Read <em>n</em> bytes from the file, copy them into a buffer, put them on the network and
     read the TCP parameters.</li>
<li> Map the file to a memory region, move along this region copying data to the network and
     read the TCP parameters every <em>n</em> bytes.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The second method is more convenient. Working with pointers to memory
regions is quite common in C code. Mapping a file to a memory region
saves you a lot of trouble compared to allocating a temporary buffer, and
lets you do fewer copy operations on the payload. The Linux kernel deals
with the memory mapping and the timely buffering of file content. The
only thing we have to tell the kernel is the file descriptor and the
size of the memory region in bytes. Both can be easily obtained. I wrote
a small function that returns the file size of the file belonging to a
descriptor.  </p>

<pre>
unsigned int get_filesize( int fd ) {
    struct stat s;

    if ( fstat( fd, &amp;s ) == 0 ) {
        return(s.st_size);
    }
    else {
        return(0);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
After the preparation of the descriptor and the size, the memory map can
be done by a simple call to <tt>mmap()</tt>.  </p>

<pre>
datafd = open( opt_data, O_RDONLY );
if ( datafd == -1 ) {
    fprintf(stderr,"Could not open file '%s'! (%s)\n", opt_data, strerror(errno) );
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
else {
    opt_counter = get_filesize(datafd);
    data = mmap( 0, opt_counter, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_NORESERVE, datafd, 0 );
    if ( data == MAP_FAILED ) {
        fprintf(stderr,"Can't map file '%s' to memory! (%s)\n", opt_data, strerror(errno) );
        close( datafd );
        close( tcp_socket );
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
You can tell <tt>mmap()</tt> what you intend to do with the memory
region; in our case, read operations are sufficient. That's why we set
PROT_READ as an 'advise' for the kernel and the Memory Management Unit
(MMU). MAP_PRIVATE creates a private region and makes sure that changes
to the mapped memory won't end up in the file - all we want to do is
read the file, but setting this option doesn't do any harm. Likewise,
the MAP_NORESERVE flag tells the kernel that the mapped region doesn't
need to be backed by swap space; we don't want to do write operations,
so we don't need any buffering for the memory pages. The <tt>data</tt>
pointer points to the start of the file mapped to memory; we can use
this as a starting point, and walk through the memory accessing the whole
file.  The Linux kernel reads the appropriate data blocks automatically.
If you want to make the kernel's job easier, you can tell it what you
intend to do with the mapped region - the <tt>madvise()</tt> function is
useful for this. We're not going to use it here, but you should look it
up in the man pages, since it's quite handy for other scenarios.  </p>

<h3>
Writing the Data Payload
</h3>

<p>
Everything is now set up. All we need to do is to move along the mapped
file, send data to the network, and log the TCP parameters. We'll reuse
the timer functions from the daemon code. (Good programmers are
<em>efficiently</em> lazy.) We'll also copy the same set of parameters
from the <tt>tcp_info</tt> structure, in order to make our result
comparable to the one from the daemon code.  </p>

<pre>
/* position is our pointer to the current position in the data buffer. This is
 * only important when streaming a file since we have to move along the mmapped
 * memory region in steps of opt_counter bytes.
 */
position = data;
/* Stopwatch time. */
get_now( &amp;time_start, 1 );
while ( bytecounter &lt;= opt_counter ) {
    /* Send first portion of data */
    if ( send( tcp_socket, position, opt_buffer, 0 ) == -1 ) {
        fprintf(stderr,"Error '%s' while sending %u bytes.\n", strerror(errno), opt_buffer );
    }
    /* Move the position pointer. */
    position += opt_buffer;
    bytecounter += opt_buffer;
    /* Measure time in order to create time intervals. */
    get_now( &amp;time_now, 1 );
    /* Get struct tcp_info and extract parameters. */
    tcp_info_length = sizeof(tcp_info);
    if ( getsockopt( tcp_socket, SOL_TCP, TCP_INFO, (void *)&amp;tcp_info, (socklen_t *)&amp;tcp_info_length ) == 0 ) {
        /* Write parameters to file. */
        if ( opt_debug &gt; 0 ) {
            fprintf(stdout,"Wrote line to log file after %u bytes sent.\n", bytecounter );
        }
        fprintf(statistics,"%.6f %u %u %u %u %u %u %u %u %u %u %u %u\n",
                time_to_seconds( &amp;time_start, &amp;time_now ),
                tcp_info.tcpi_last_data_sent,
                tcp_info.tcpi_last_data_recv,
                tcp_info.tcpi_snd_cwnd,
                tcp_info.tcpi_snd_ssthresh,
                tcp_info.tcpi_rcv_ssthresh,
                tcp_info.tcpi_rtt,
                tcp_info.tcpi_rttvar,
                tcp_info.tcpi_unacked,
                tcp_info.tcpi_sacked,
                tcp_info.tcpi_lost,
                tcp_info.tcpi_retrans,
                tcp_info.tcpi_fackets
               );
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
First, we copy the <tt>data</tt> pointer to a work pointer named
<tt>position</tt>. Next, we start taking the time in order to create
relative time stamps - just as we did in the receiver's code. The
<tt>send()</tt> function is used to copy a certain number of bytes to
the network; thanks to <tt>mmap()</tt>, we don't need to copy data from
and to different buffers - instead, we simply tell the function the
position and the number of bytes to transmit (stored in
<tt>opt_buffer</tt>). After that, we increment the byte counter and the
work pointer. We then add a constant value, which may lead to sending
more bytes than the actual size of the file. A cleaner way is to check
for the immediate end of the payload memory region, and increment the
counters by the number of bytes left until the end of the file. Keep
this in mind, when comparing the number of bytes transmitted and
received.  </p>

<p>
The remaining code deals with extracting the TCP parameters, and writing
everything to the log file. The call to <tt>fprintf()</tt> is the same
as on the receiver side. For your convenience, I've attached the <a
href="misc/pfeiffer/tcpshoot.c">full source</a>, the <a
href="misc/pfeiffer/tcpsnoop.h">header file</a> (which is the same as
for the daemon code) and a simple <a
href="misc/pfeiffer/Makefile">Makefile</a> to this article. The code
snippets above are only the crucial parts of the code; all the other
administrative operations such as parsing the options and allocating and
freeing resources are in the full source code. In addition, I have added
a part that uses pseudorandom numbers instead of the content of a file
as payload.  </p>

<h3>
Testing the Code
</h3>

<p>
Our little tool is now able not only to read the thresholds on the
congestion window size, but also to read the congestion window itself.
You can test this with almost any network connection. However, the
congestion window rises significantly only if there is a bottleneck
between sender and receiver.  Under "normal" circumstances, the
congestion window won't change much, and won't reach high values.  I used
my 512 kbit/s Internet connection at home for some test transfers to a
machine in the office.  The receiver should have a TCP sink running.
</p>

<pre>
luchs@receiver:~$ ./tcpsnoop -d -f tcpsnoop_receiver.log -p 12345 -b 4096
</pre>

<p>
You can then use <tt>tcpshoot</tt> for the data transfers.
</p>

<pre>
luchs@sender:~$ ./tcpshoot -b 4096 -c 512000 -f tcpshoot_sender.log -p 12345 -s 10.0.0.1
</pre>

<p>
I did this multiple times, and picked three transmissions for plotting
them with Gnuplot.  The blue graph is the transmission of the example
above, in which I wrote 512000 bytes to the receiver.  The green line
denotes the same command, but with 1048576 bytes (1 MB) of data. The
transfer take roughly double the amount of time. The window quickly
rises and falls again. The red line is the transmission of 512000 bytes,
again, but this time during a download of a 6 MB file.  You can see that
the congestion window rises more slowly and, of course, that the data
transfer takes longer.  <img src="misc/pfeiffer/tcpshoot.png"
width="640" height="480" alt="Graphs from data generated by tcpshoot">
</p>

<p>
Again, I'll emphasize this, just as I did in my last article: The graph
above doesn't prove anything beside the fact that my Linux kernel and my
Internet connection are working; it is intended as a simple demonstration
of two little tools we have written. It is now up to you to use them in
controlled setups with bottlenecks and TCP pipes that allow the TCP
algorithms to unfold their capabilities. If you find some interesting
behaviour of TCP streams, some setups worth sharing with the world, or
have created better graphs than mine, please let 
<em>Linux Gazette</em> readers know.  </p>

<h1>Rule-based DoS attacks prevention shell script</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/takefuji.html">Yoshiyasu Takefuji</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<h3> Introduction</h3>
<p>
In this article, I describe a simple rule-based DoS attack-prevention
shell script.  However, the proposed shell script is not a perfect tool
for preventing DoS attacks, but a powerful tool for alleviating DoS
attacks overheads of the Linux servers significantly.</p>

<p class="editorial">[ Dealing with dynamic threats and automatically
taking evasive action is very difficult to do and requires some thought.
The article focuses on text patterns and log files. There are other
methods that lead to similar results and are mentioned after the
author's conclusion. -- Ren&eacute; ]
</p>

<p>
In order to understand DoS or DDoS attacks, it is useful to see the log
files in /var/log.  In this article, an ssh DoS attack-prevention shell
script is mainly mentioned.  We have been observing the behavior of ssh
DoS attacks through three Linux servers in the last six months.  We have
been manually manipulating iptables commands for disabling the access
from specific IPs, after detecting DoS attacks.  The proposed shell
script is to automate the whole manipulated commands for DoS attacks
prevention.  If the proposed simple shell script detects DoS attacks
that match predefine rules in the shell script, then the DoS
attack IPs are added to the detected-IPs file and have their access to
the server disabled.  Since detecting DoS attacks is rule-based, it is
expandable.  Kernel-mode implementation of the proposed idea is
expected, for immediate DoS attacks prevention, instead of using crontab
in this article.</p>

<h3> How to detect DoS attacks from /var/log/secure file</h3>

<p>
In order to see /var/log/secure file, you have to be a root. In this
article, "grep", "awk", and "sed" commands are often used for building
rules in the proposed shell script.  The shell script is composed of a
part of DoS attack detection rules, a part of reducing redundant IPs,
and a part of disabling detected IPs.  The following is an example of
the typical ssh attack using the dictionary, where every second user name
is changed from root, delta, admin,,,, after the system did not receive

<p>
The following command sends the disabled IPs information from
/etc/sysconfig/iptables into tmp file.

<pre class="code">
grep DROP /etc/sysconfig/iptables|awk '{print $5}' &gt;tmp    
</pre></p>

<p>
If the system did not receive identification string from the specific
IPs, the machine access should be disabled.  The following command adds
the detected IPs to a temporary file. Detected IPs using rules will be added in
that file.

<pre class="code">
grep Did /var/log/secure|awk '{print $12}' &gt;&gt;tmp     
</pre></p>

<p>
A new rule can be added to the tmp file using the simple command.  The
dictionary attacks can be easily detected by "Invalid user" from
/var/log/secure.  If you misspell in ssh login name, you may not be able
to login any more from your machine.  In order to re-enable login from
the machine again, you must delete all the lines including your machine
IP from /var/log/secure file and flush the iptables by /sbin/iptables
-F.

<pre class="code">
grep "Invalid user" /var/log/secure|awk '{print $10}' &gt;&gt;tmp  
</pre></p>

<p>
Maximum login DoS attacks can be detected by the following command.

<pre class="code">
grep "Maximum login" /var/log/secure|awk '{print $7}'|sed 's/.*\[\(.*\)\])/\1/g' &gt;&gt;tmp       
</pre></p>


<h3>How to reduce redundant detected IPs from the temporary file</h3>

<p>
The following commands reduce redundant detected IPs from the temporary file, and
store the unique detected IPs in file ttt.  The variable "size"
indicates the number of lines in the tmp file.

<pre class="code">
size=`wc tmp|awk '{print $1}'`
i=0
while test $i -lt $size
do
      us=`sed -n 1p tmp`
      sed /$us/d tmp &gt;tmps
      echo $us &gt;&gt;ttt
      cp -f tmps tmp
      size=`wc tmp|awk '{print $1}'`
done     
</pre></p>

<h3>How to activate /sbin/iptables </h3>

<p>
DoS attack IPs are stored in file ttt.  The following simple loop
activates /sbin/iptables.  

<pre class="code">
size=`wc ttt|awk '{print $1}'`
size=`expr $size + 1`
/sbin/iptables -F
i=1
while test $i -lt $size
do
        ip=`sed -n "$i"p ttt`
        i=`expr $i + 1`
/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -s $ip -j DROP
done
</pre></p>

<h3>How to install the proposed shell script</h3>

<p>
You have to be root.  "crontab -e" command sets the crontab, where the
proposed shell script test is stored in /var/log in our system.  The
following setting means, that every five minutes, the shell script test is
activated, everyday.

<pre class="code">
0-59/5 * * * * /var/log/test 
</pre></p>

<p>
The entire shell script /var/log/test is as follows.

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash
rm -f ttt
touch tmp
# disabled IPs can be obtained from /etc/sysconfig/iptables
grep DROP /etc/sysconfig/iptables|awk '{print $5}' &gt;tmp
# ------------------------ DoS attacks rule -------------------------
#identity mismatch in secure
grep Did /var/log/secure|awk '{print $12}' &gt;&gt;tmp
#Invalid user
grep "Invalid user" /var/log/secure|awk '{print $10}' &gt;&gt;tmp
# Maximum login
grep "Maximum login" /var/log/secure|awk '{print $7}'|sed 's/.*\[\(.*\)\])/\1/g' &gt;&gt;tmp
#
# ------------------ reduce redundant IPs from tmp file -------------
size=`/usr/bin/wc tmp|awk '{print $1}'`
i=0
while test $i -lt $size
do
      us=`sed -n 1p tmp`
      sed /$us/d tmp &gt;tmps
      echo $us &gt;&gt;ttt
      cp -f tmps tmp
      size=`/usr/bin/wc tmp|awk '{print $1}'`
done
rm -f tmp tmps temp0 temp
#
# ------------------ activate detected IPs --------------------------
size=`wc ttt|awk '{print $1}'`
size=`expr $size + 1`
/sbin/iptables -F
i=1
while test $i -lt $size
do
        ip=`sed -n "$i"p ttt`
        i=`expr $i + 1`
/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -s $ip -j DROP
done   
# -----------------end of shell script test -------------------------                   
</pre></p>

<h3>Examine shell script</h3>
<p>
Before running the cron shell script, you must be root and should
examine the shell script by:

<pre class="code">
sh /var/log/test
</pre>

<p>
In order to see the current iptables, type the following command.

<pre class="code">
/sbin/iptables -nL
</pre></p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Since the proposed shell script is portable, it can be placed in every
server or router.  In order to share the blacklist of IPs, the shell
script must be placed in every router, and router-to-router
communication is needed to assemble the blacklist of IPs for the larger
framework of network security.</p>

<p class="editorial">[ The system described in this article relies on
predefined patterns that have to be extracted from the log files; this, of
course, requires that the syslog server on the machine not drop any log
messages. Both assumptions can lead to problems when log entries are
dropped or the text pattern of the failed login attempts isn't detected
properly. The author mentioned a way to do this automatically from the
kernel; the Linux Netfilter provides a module than can be used to
automatically deny repeated login attempts. There is an <a
href="http://hostingfu.com/article/ssh-dictionary-attack-prevention-with-iptables">article</a>
that describes this method. Whatever you decide to do, keep in mind that a
resilient security measure should not depend on less than fully-reliable
grounds. Parsing log files makes a fine part of your security measures;
just don't make it a cornerstone of your security considerations. --

<p>
Samuel Kotel Bisbee-vonKaufmann was born ('87) and raised in the Boston, MA
area. His interest in all things electronics was established early as his
father was an electrician. Teaching himself HTML and web design at the age
of 10, Sam has spiraled deeper into the confusion that is computer science
and the FOSS community, running his first distro, Red Hat, when he was
approximately 13 years old. Entering boarding high school in 2002,
Northfield Mount Hermon, he found his way into the school's computer club,
GEECS for Electronics, Engineering, Computers, and Science (a recursive
acronym), which would allow him to share in and teach the Linux experience
to future generations. Also during high school Sam was abducted into the
Open and Free Technology Community (<a
href="http://www.oftc.org">http://www.oftc.org</a>), had his first article
published, and became more involved in various communities and projects.
</p>

<p>
Sam is currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Boston University and
continues to be involved in the FOSS community. Other hobbies include martial
arts, writing, buildering, working, chess, and crossword puzzles.  Then there
is something about Linux, algorithms, programing, etc., but who makes money
doing that?
</p>

<p>
Sam prefers programming in C++ and Bash, is fluent in Java and PHP, and while
he can work in Perl, he hates it. If you would like to know more then feel free
to ask.

bit less stressed than I was before... though if it wasn't for my

think if I had asked anyone where I should go to look for a job,
they would have said "Try Ireland" <img src="../gx/smile.png"

I passed this on to a friend who edits scientific articles, and
this is her response:
<p>Q: How many copyeditors does is take to screw in a
lightbulb?</p>
<p>A: That sentence isn't clear. Does it mean to have sex in a
lightbulb, or to place a lightbulb in its socket? Please
clarify.</p>
<p>Suggest:</p>
<p>(1) Sentence as written is ambiguous. Does it mean to have
sexual intercourse inside of a lightbulb (in which case, pls
clarify size of bulb), or to place a lightbulb in its socket?</p>
<p>(2) The phrase "does it take" is messy. The anticipatory pronoun
has no reference. Who or what is doing the taking? Pls recast.</p>
<p>(3) The term "copy editor" is a not complex noun, and thus has
no excuse for being set as a single word. It is an adjective (copy)
and a noun (editor). A dress the color of mammalian blood is not a
"reddress"; it is a "red dress." Note also that, when set as two
words, "copy editor" does not take a hyphen, unless the phrase is
being used as a complex (non-predicate) adjective, as, for example,
"a copy-editor hissy fit."</p>
<p>(4) There is an obvious typographical error. Suggest you
proofread manuscripts before submitting them as final.</p>

Today
Mostly sunny. Windy. Patchy fog in low lying areas this morning. Highs
11 to 17. Wind chill readings 15 below zero to 30 below zero this

right near the foothills and near the Wyoming border.

I'm <em>so</em> glad that I'm leaving today... although I don't
know that Boston, where I'm going next, will be any warmer. I've

<p>So, we went out to do some chores, and stopped by a place where
Kat used to work. One of the businesses there is a used
car/boat/motorcycle dealership, and they just happened to have this
nice bike for a decent price - and I just happened to be in the market,
ready to trade in my Nighthawk 750 (which was getting a bit old and
tired). So, after a bit of horse-swapping, here's my new ride:</p>

Hi all, When considering on-line, community-published Linux
newsletters what comes to my mind is, of course, The Linux Gazette.
<a href="../index.html">http://linuxgazette.net/index.html</a>
Several of the Gazette's authors are local to Silicon Valley and
also members of SVLUG. But the Gazette's contributors and readers
are from all over our globe. Collaboration with the Gazette might
be useful to all and there is a existing body of knowledge in the
Gazette about how to produce newsletters. They are an excellent
outfit. Mark
<p>...snip...</p>
<pre>
&gt; Bill Ward has mentioned (and I agree) that this could be a cross-LUG effort,
&gt; with support coming from CABAL, EBLUG, PenLUG, even NBLUG and
&gt; LUGoD.
&gt; 
&gt; <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=
":-)"> I'm liking the positive energy.  A community-published Linux newsletter is a pretty compelling idea. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks everyone!

<b>Tue, 6 Mar 2007 07:13:01 -0800</b>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>One friend (Rahul Basu) forwarded a link to the Alcatel-Lucent
MP3 patent story and I found a blog that seems to have figured out
whats going on: <a href=
"http://www.edn.com/blog/1690000169/post/1200007120.html">http://www.edn.com/blog/1690000169/post/1200007120.html</a>
Now it's clear to most of us that software patents are absurd and
this story is a consequence of that absurdity.</p>
<p>... but (in the USA) you seem to have got an ever expanding
patent regime. Another friend (Rahul Siddharthan) forwarded this
blog:</p>
<p><a href=
"http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2006/10/tax_patents_a_w.html">http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2006/10/tax_patents_a_w.html</a></p>
<p>Today the USA, tomorrow the rest of the world.[*]</p>
<p>Einstein in the patent office was <strong>not</strong> a
mistake. We will need Einsteins in the patent office soon.</p>
<p>Q: Do you think Bekham and Roberto Carlos can patent their
free-kick techniques?</p>
<p>They do make money based on these techniques and they can
probably teach these techniques to others (for a fee!).</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Kapil.</p>
<p>[*] For example, there have been repeated attempts to change the
patent law in India at the behest of the multi-national pharma
companies.</p>

<p>I'm breaking out in bikes all over these days. Here's my newest
toy:</p>
<p><a href=
"http://okopnik.freeshell.org/img/1995_GSX750F.jpg">http://okopnik.freeshell.org/img/1995_GSX750F.jpg</a></p>
<p>(Mine doesn't have all the graphics, but everything else
including the color is right.)</p>
<p>Yep, I've sold the Triumph - too much of a cruiser for my blood,
and [cough] I can only stand so much British engineering. Seriously
- when the manual starts out with <em>cleaning</em> instructions,
and has lots of BOLD letters and exclamation points telling you how
<strong>crucial</strong> that part is and how it
<strong>must</strong> be done every single time... well, that's the
very definition of "not a bike for the Benster". [shrug] I made
money in trading in my old bike, I made more in selling this one,
<em>and</em> I got a damn good deal on the new one. And I got to
play with a bike that was completely different from anything I've
had before. I call that a win all around.</p>
<p>I rode the Katana home today and got off with a
<strong>huge</strong> smile. Hellllo, higher insurance
premiums...</p>

Jimmy is a single father of one, who enjoys long walks... Oh, right.

<p> Jimmy has been using computers from the tender age of seven, when his father 
inherited an Amstrad PCW8256. After a few brief flirtations with an Atari ST
and numerous versions of DOS and Windows, Jimmy was introduced to Linux in 1998
and hasn't looked back.

<p> In his spare time, Jimmy likes to play guitar and read: not at the same time, 
but the picks make handy bookmarks.

<p>
<p>"Foolish Things" is a now-and-again compilation we run based
on our readers' input; once we have several of these stories
assembled in one place, we get to share them with all of you. If
you enjoy reading these cautionary tales of woe, proud stories of
triumph, and just plain weird and fun things that happen between
humans and silicon, that's great; if you have some to share so
that others may enjoy them, even better. Please send them to

<h3>A Well-Grounded Understanding of Electricity</h3>

<p>
How's this for foolish - I once was trying to repair one of those old
all-in-one Mac Classics. Well, Computer A booted and made the nice little
"Happy Mac" startup noise, but no screen; Computer B didn't boot, but the
screen came up (well, it wasn't straight black, so I could tell it had power
and a retrace) - I decided to swap the power supply from one video board to
the other, and taking particular caution to note the "Big Rubberized Red
Wire" - well somehow the "BRRW" got in the bundle of wires that I was
chopping off. Imagine my surpise! (note: I was sitting indian style in
shorts, on a concrete floor, using a large rusty razor blade to hack
through the bundle.)

volts coming out of the flyback transformer, and color ones ran about 30 to

Brrrr. Reminds me of my own days in TV repair. -- Ben ]

<h3>Restarting From Less Than Scratch</h3>
<p id="by"><b>Mario Wolczko [unix-horror-story]</b><br></p>

<p class="editorial">[ Once in a while, I like to repost classic Unix
stories from the past here; I try to select ones that have educational,
interesting, and fun content. Hopefully, they will be of use to new
Linuxers, and provide entertainment (and perhaps fond, or even not-so-fond, 
recollections) for those who have been around for a while. In any case,
enjoy. -- Ben ]

Have you ever left your terminal logged in, only to find when you came
back to it that a (supposed) friend had typed "rm -rf ~/*" and was
hovering over the keyboard with threats along the lines of "lend me
a fiver 'til Thursday, or I hit return"?  Undoubtedly the person in
question would not have had the nerve to inflict such a trauma upon
you, and was doing it in jest.  So you've probably never experienced
the worst of such disasters...
</p>

<p>
It was a quiet Wednesday afternoon.  Wednesday, 1st October, 15:15
BST, to be precise, when Peter, an office-mate of mine, leaned away
from his terminal and said to me, "Mario, I'm having a little trouble
sending mail."  Knowing that msg was capable of confusing even the
most capable of people, I sauntered over to his terminal to see what
was wrong.  A strange error message of the form (I forget the exact
details) "cannot access /foo/bar for userid 147" had been issued by
msg.  My first thought was "Who's userid 147?; the sender of the
message, the destination, or what?"  So I leant over to another
terminal, already logged in, and typed
</p>

<pre>        grep 147 /etc/passwd</pre>

<p>
only to receive the response
</p>

<pre>        /etc/passwd: No such file or directory.</pre>

<p>
Instantly, I guessed that something was amiss.  This was confirmed
when in response to
<pre>        ls /etc</pre>
I got
<pre>        ls: not found.</pre>
</p>

<p>
I suggested to Peter that it would be a good idea not to try anything
for a while, and went off to find our system manager.
</p>

<p>
When I arrived at his office, his door was ajar, and within ten
seconds I realised what the problem was.  James, our manager, was
sat down, head in hands, hands between knees, as one whose world has
just come to an end.  Our newly-appointed system programmer, Neil,
was beside him, gazing listlessly at the screen of his terminal.
And at the top of the screen I spied the following lines:
</p>

<pre>
        # cd
        # rm -rf *
</pre>

<p>
Oh, shit, I thought.  That would just about explain it.
</p>

<p>
I can't remember what happened in the succeeding minutes; my memory is
just a blur.  I do remember trying ls (again), ps, who and maybe a few
other commands beside, all to no avail.  The next thing I remember was
being at my terminal again (a multi-window graphics terminal), and
typing

<pre>
        cd /
        echo *
</pre>

I owe a debt of thanks to David Korn for making echo a built-in of
his shell; needless to say, /bin, together with /bin/echo, had been
deleted.  What transpired in the next few minutes was that /dev,
/etc and /lib had also gone in their entirety; fortunately Neil had
interrupted rm while it was somewhere down below /news, and /tmp,
/usr and /users were all untouched.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile James had made for our tape cupboard and had retrieved
what claimed to be a dump tape of the root filesystem, taken four
weeks earlier.  The pressing question was, "How do we recover the
contents of the tape?".  Not only had we lost /etc/restore, but all
of the device entries for the tape deck had vanished.  And where
does mknod live?  You guessed it, /etc.  How about recovery across
Ethernet of any of this from another VAX?  Well, /bin/tar had gone,
and thoughtfully the Berkeley people had put rcp in /bin in the
4.3 distribution.  What's more, none of the Ether stuff wanted to
know without /etc/hosts at least.  We found a version of cpio in
/usr/local, but that was unlikely to do us any good without a tape
deck.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, we could get the boot tape out and rebuild the root
filesystem, but neither James nor Neil had done that before, and we
weren't sure that the first thing to happen would be that the whole
disk would be re-formatted, losing all our user files.  (We take dumps
of the user files every Thursday; by Murphy's Law this had to happen
on a Wednesday).  Another solution might be to borrow a disk from
another VAX, boot off that, and tidy up later, but that would have
entailed calling the DEC engineer out, at the very least.  We had a
number of users in the final throes of writing up PhD theses and the
loss of a maybe a weeks' work (not to mention the machine down time)
was unthinkable.
</p>

<p>
So, what to do?  The next idea was to write a program to make a device
descriptor for the tape deck, but we all know where cc, as and ld
live.  Or maybe make skeletal entries for /etc/passwd, /etc/hosts
and so on, so that /usr/bin/ftp would work.  By sheer luck, I had a
gnuemacs still running in one of my windows, which we could use to
create passwd, etc., but the first step was to create a directory to
put them in.  Of course /bin/mkdir had gone, and so had /bin/mv, so we
couldn't rename /tmp to /etc.  However, this looked like a reasonable
line of attack.
</p>

<p>
By now we had been joined by Alasdair, our resident UNIX guru, and
as luck would have it, someone who knows VAX assembler.  So our plan
became this: write a program in assembler which would either rename
/tmp to /etc, or make /etc, assemble it on another VAX, uuencode it,
type in the uuencoded file using my gnu, uudecode it (some bright
spark had thought to put uudecode in /usr/bin), run it, and hey
presto, it would all be plain sailing from there.  By yet another
miracle of good fortune, the terminal from which the damage had been
done was still su'd to root (su is in /bin, remember?), so at least
we stood a chance of all this working.
</p>

<p>
Off we set on our merry way, and within only an hour we had managed
to concoct the dozen or so lines of assembler to create /etc.  The
stripped binary was only 76 bytes long, so we converted it to hex
(slightly more readable than the output of uuencode), and typed it in
using my editor.  If any of you ever have the same problem, here's the
hex for future reference:
</p>

<pre>
        070100002c000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
        0000dd8fff010000dd8f27000000fb02ef07000000fb01ef070000000000bc8f
        8800040000bc012f65746300
</pre>

<p>
I had a handy program around (doesn't everybody?) for converting
ASCII hex to binary, and the output of /usr/bin/sum tallied with our
original binary.  But hang on---how do you set execute permission
without /bin/chmod?  A few seconds thought (which as usual, lasted a
couple of minutes) suggested that we write the binary on top of an
already existing binary, owned by me... problem solved.
</p>

<p>
So along we trotted to the terminal with the root login, carefully
remembered to set the umask to 0 (so that I could create files in it
using my gnu), and ran the binary.  So now we had a /etc, writable
by all.  From there it was but a few easy steps to creating passwd,
hosts, services, protocols, (etc), and then ftp was willing to play
ball.  Then we recovered the contents of /bin across the ether (it's
amazing how much you come to miss ls after just a few, short hours),
and selected files from /etc.  The key file was /etc/rrestore, with
which we recovered /dev from the dump tape, and the rest is history.
</p>

<p>
Now, you're asking yourself (as I am), what's the moral of this story?
Well, for one thing, you must always remember the immortal words,
DON'T PANIC.  Our initial reaction was to reboot the machine and try
everything as single user, but it's unlikely it would have come up
without /etc/init and /bin/sh.  Rational thought saved us from this
one.
</p>

<p>
The next thing to remember is that UNIX tools really can be put to
unusual purposes.  Even without my gnuemacs, we could have survived
by using, say, /usr/bin/grep as a substitute for /bin/cat.
</p>

<p>
And the final thing is, it's amazing how much of the system you can
delete without it falling apart completely.  Apart from the fact that
nobody could login (/bin/login?), and most of the useful commands
had gone, everything else seemed normal.  Of course, some things can't
stand life without say /etc/termcap, or /dev/kmem, or /etc/utmp, but
by and large it all hangs together.
</p>

<p>
I shall leave you with this question: if you were placed in the
same situation, and had the presence of mind that always comes with
hindsight, could you have got out of it in a simpler or easier way?
