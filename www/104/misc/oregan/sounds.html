<h2>Sounds of my teens</h2>

<p>
This is a list of some songs from various Irish bands I listened to when I was
in secondary school (high school for you Americans). MP3s of songs by these
bands can be found <a href="http://www.irishmp3s.utvinternet.com/">here</a> and
<a href="http://www.irishmusiccentral.com/">here</a>.

<p>
Some of my favourites:

<h3><a href="http://www.irishmusiccentral.com/juniper/reviews.html">Juniper</a></h3>
<!--
Weatherman: http://www.irishmp3s.utvinternet.com/music/Weatherman.mp3
-->
<p> I saw them play in Empire Music in Limerick, the day before my last exam in
first year, right after buying the bottle of tequila that lead to my failing
said exam :)

<h3><a href="http://www.interalpha.net/customer/memsom/news.htm">Kerbdog</a></h3>

<p>
Their first album was grunge/metal, their second was poppier. They later
became Wilt. Their singer had trouble signing on the dole (welfare) after the 
band split up, and had to produce the invoice for £1m from their record 
company :)

<h3>My Bloody Valentine</h3>

What can I say about them? Brilliant.

<!--
My Bloody Valentine - Glider: http://www.irishmp3s.utvinternet.com/music/glider.mp3
(Though that's just noise - "Only Shallow" is a great song)
-->

<h3><a href="http://www.irishmusiccentral.com/petlamb/index.html">Pet Lamb</a></h3>

<p>
Pet Lamb started as a noise punk band, but became a more standard rock band.
I preferred them as a noise punk band.

Baby I Love You: http://www.irishmp3s.utvinternet.com/music/babyiloveyou.mp3
-->

<h3><a href="http://www.cluas.com/music/features/revelino.htm">Revelino</a></h3>

<p> Revelino wrote some of the most achingly beautiful songs I've ever heard.

<!--
Happiness Is Mine: http://www.irishmp3s.utvinternet.com/music/happinessismine.mp3
(though I'd prefer Don't Lead Me Down)
I Know what You Want: http://www.irishmusiccentral.com/sounds--/revelino_-_i_know_what_you_want.mp3
-- Vim. Pfft.

<h3><a href="http://www.irishmusiccentral.com/scheer/index.html">Scheer</a></h3>

<p>
Metal guitars with pop vocals. Kinda.

<h3><a href="http://paradigm.asucla.ucla.edu/db/articles.asp?ID=6165">Schtum</a></h3>

<p>
Punky. "Skydiver" was a great song.

<h3><a href="http://gofree.indigo.ie/~nfallon/heretic.htm">Toasted Heretic</a></h3>

<p>An odd band. They released their first two (three?) albums as mail order
cassettes, recorded on a 4-track. Both of the albums I have by them have
parodies for cover art - Marlboros on "Mindless Optimism", and a letter on
"Charm and Arrogance".

<h3><a href="http://www.skynet.ie/~tooth/">Tooth</a></h3>

<p>Tooth were a Limerick band. The first time I went out in Limerick, with the
guys I was sharing digs with, we went to a pub to meet up with one of the 
guys class mates. A friend of theirs took a look at the length of my hair,
asked if I played guitar, and when I said "yes", told me to try out for his 
band. Naturally, I thought he was a nutter and didn't go. During the summer
holidays a girl took me to see a gig. And that guy's band, Tooth (Nero at the
time), were playing. Been kicking myself since...

<p> My friend's band, Red Tide, had a song appear on a CD with them.

<h3><a href="http://www.therapyquestionmark.co.uk/">Therapy?</a></h3>

<p>Therapy? were <em>the</em> band in 1994. Punk with a metal touch. Their web
site has videos as well as rare songs.

<h3><a href="http://www.irishmusiccentral.com/whippingboy/index.html">Whipping Boy</a></h3>

<p>
"Twinkle" is one of my favourite songs. The lyrics struck me as a typical love
song at first: "She's the air I breathe", "She's the only one for me"; until
I actually listened to them:

<p>
Waiting to be bled<br>
Turning tricks just like your mother<br>
Left my dreams for dead<br>
Getting off with every other<br>
She's the air I breathe not too pure for me<br>
She's the air I breathe not too cheap for me

<h3><a href="http://www.wilt.ie">Wilt</a></h3>
<!-- http://www.irishmp3s.utvinternet.com/music/openarms.mp3 -->

<p>Wilt were Kerbdog, a much better band. Then they recruited another 
guitarist, Derren, who used to be in Immodium, also a better band. Waste.

<h3><a href="http://www.classicspage.com/pepperhead/pepperhead/interview/fint17.html">Wormhole</a></h3>

<p> A truly odd band. Punky, but strange.
