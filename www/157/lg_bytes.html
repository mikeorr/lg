<h2>News in General</h2>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Red Hat Delivers 
Linux HPC Platform</h3>

<p>In October, Red Hat announced its integrated Linux-based High 
Performance Computing (HPC) platform with the Red Hat HPC Solution, an 
all-in-one stack to deploy, run, and manage their HPC clusters. First 
announced in collaboration with Platform Computing in November 2007, 
the HPC Solution is available through Red Hat Network with 24x7 
customer support services.</p>

<p>Historically, building and managing HPC clusters is a cost and 
expertise challenge for IT departments. Red Hat HPC Solution includes 
all of the components to build and manage a complete HPC cluster in an 
end-to-end solution that can be deployed in under one hour.</p>

<p>The Red Hat HPC Solution incorporates all of the components 
necessary to deploy and maintain HPC clusters, including Red Hat 
Enterprise Linux 5.2 and Platform Computing's cluster software 
framework, Platform Open Cluster Stack 5. The solution also includes 
device drivers, a simple cluster installer, cluster management tools, 
a resource and application monitor, interconnect support and Platform 
Lava, a powerful job scheduler.</p>

<p>"With our HPC Solution, we're enabling our customers to focus on 
their business goals and competitive advantage without needing to 
worry about the challenges of deploying and managing their HPC cluster 
- we're taking care of this for them," said Scott Crenshaw, vice 
president, Platform Business Unit at Red Hat. "We're delivering the 
first Linux-based solution that allows our customers to deploy a fully 
integrated high-performance computing environment in minutes rather 
than in weeks or months."</p>

<p>For deploying and managing HPC clusters, Red Hat, Dell and Platform 
Computing have also partnered to offer customers a comprehensive 
cluster computing package, Platform Open Cluster Stack (OCS), to ease 
cluster deployment, management and operation of the Red Hat HPC.</p>

<p>The Red Hat HPC solution is available from Red Hat with prices 
starting at $249 per node. For more information about the Red Hat HPC 
solution, visit <a 
href="http://www.redhat.com/hpc/">http://www.redhat.com/hpc/</a>.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Sun Updates Java 6, 
Supports  Java Widgets on Desktop</h3>
 
<p>Sun Microsystems announced availability of Java Standard Edition 6 
Update 10 (Java SE 6u10), which improves the usability and performance 
Java on desktop computers everywhere. It can be download at: 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp</a>.</p>

<p>This update is optimized with new features that include: a 
radically improved startup time for Java applications and applets, the 
ability to drag Java applets directly from the browser to the desktop 
and have them run as widgets, more powerful application graphics, and 
a new cross-platform look and feel. Java Quick Starter also 
significantly improves the start-up time for any Java application or 
applet. </p>

<p>Developers also benefit from the enhancements in Java SE 6u10. The 
built-in Deployment Toolkit ensures end users run the most recent 
version of Java SE. A new Java plug-in provides full browser 
independence, complete interoperability with Web 2.0 technologies and 
supports different versions of Java running at the same time on the 
same machine.</p>
 
<p>Java SE is present on over more than 800 million desktop computers 
- 91 percent of Internet-connected PCs worldwide, according to 
Sun.</p>

<h4>Java Kernel - Lighter Than a JRE</h4>

<p>The Java Kernel is a new method of getting Java software up and 
running faster. Instead of installing the full Java Runtime 
Environment (JRE(TM)), users download the Java Kernel, which includes 
the most commonly needed JRE components. Additional components are 
then downloaded by the JRE as they are needed.</p>

<p>Java SE 6u10 includes a brand-new implementation of the Java 
Plug-in that allows consumers to drag and drop applets that are 
running in their browser directly onto their desktop, which provides a 
widget-like experience for all of their Java applications and 
applets.</p>

<p>The graphics pipeline for Java on Windows has been rewritten to 
leverage Direct3D for everything from simple fills and copies, to 
translucency, gradients, arbitrary transformations and other more 
advanced 2D operations. This capability also improves the runtime 
performance of Swing applications.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">IBM Breaks Performance Records with SSDisk</h3>

<p>Engineers and researchers at the IBM's Hursley development lab in 
England and the Almaden Research Center in California have 
demonstrated groundbreaking performance results that outperform the 
world's fastest disk storage solution by over 250 percent.</p>

<p>The results were achieved using Flash solid-state technology coupled 
with IBM's industry leading, highly scalable storage virtualization 
technology. Under the codename "Project Quicksilver", IBM achieved 
groundbreaking results in transferring data at a sustained rate of 
over one million Input/Output (I/O) per second - with a response time 
of under one millisecond (ms). Compared to the fastest industry 
benchmarked disk system, Quicksilver improved performance by 250 
percent at less than 1/20th the response time, took up 1/5th the floor 
space and required only 55 percent of the power and cooling.</p>

<p>Quicksilver is part of IBM's focus on leveraging emerging systems 
technologies to deliver advanced data center capabilities. Performance 
improvements of this magnitude can have profound implications for 
business, allowing 2-3 times the work to complete in a given timeframe 
for classic workloads and creating opportunity for entirely new 
information warehouse and analytic solutions.</p>

with OpenChrome on Open Source Video Driver</h3>

<p>Support from VIA's software development team will enrich the 
OpenChrome driver's feature support for VIA IGP chipsets.</p>

<p>Building on the recent release of the VIA graphics driver available on
the VIA Linux Portal (<a
href="http://linux.via.com.tw">http://linux.via.com.tw</a>), VIA is
actively collaborating with the OpenChrome development team on their Open
Source graphics driver - initially assisting with multi-head support 
and RandR function.</p>

<p>"This cooperation between the community-based OpenChrome developers 
and VIA's staff developers will enable everyone to shift towards one 
code base, combining the features and strengths of both drivers," said 
Mr. Welte. "It also shows that VIA is not only releasing source code 
and documentation, but actively moving towards a much more open and 
collaborative driver R&amp;D process."</p>

<p>More information about the OpenChrome driver can be found here: <a

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">IBM and SUN Kick Off ODF Tools Initiative</h3>

<p>At the OpenOffice Conference (OooCon 2008) in Beijing, Sun and
IBM announced support for the Open Document Format (ODF) Toolkit Union 
and the new ODF Toolkit, an open source software project that will 
make productivity suites more versatile and useful.</p>

<p>Sun made the initial code contribution and IBM will followup in the 
Open Document Format Toolkit Union, a project to make it easier to use 
ODF.  </p>

<p>The ODF Toolkit seeds the ground for a new generation of applications 
and expands the potential of existing productivity suites. Starting 
with an initial code contribution from Sun, the ODF Toolkit is an open 
source software project that provides developers with an easy-to-use 
API for reading, writing, and manipulating ODF documents. </p>

<p>The ODF Toolkit lets developers:<br />
- Automatically create reports in response to database queries;<br />
- Index or scan documents to support search services;<br />
- Scan documents to support anti-virus services;<br />
- Scan documents for regulatory compliance, legal, or forensic 
purposes;<br />
- Convert data from one editable format to another;<br />
- Render data as audio or video in a unified communications 
document;<br />
- Import data from an Office document into a non-Office 
application (for example, import spreadsheet data into a 
statistical analysis application for business intelligence use);<br />
- Render and import documents for display and editing on mobile 
devices.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">AMD New Quad-Core "Shanghai" Opteron Processor Goes GA</h3>

<p>AMD has released an enhanced 45nm Opteron chip that offers better power
efficiency and up to a 40 percent increase in virtualization performance.
Among the new features in Shanghai family is a 6MB L3 cache with a shared
512KB L2 cache.</p>

<p>Going to a smaller die-size allows the new Opteron CPUs to offer up to 
35 percent more performance with up to a 35 percent decrease in power 
consumption at idle.  The new processors deliver faster "world switch" 
time, which enhances virtual machine efficiency, and feature improved 
Rapid Virtualization Indexing, AMD's innovation in AMD-V that reduces 
the overhead associated with software virtualization.</p>

<p>This will make the new chips competitive with the new "Nehelam" Intel 
Xeon processors, also released in November. AMD also plans to bring 
higher-performance and more energy efficient 45nm processors to the 
desktop PC market in Q1 2009 with the AMD platform codenamed "Dragon". 
This platform will be the second generation AMD quad-core desktop 
platform and is designed to leverage AMD 700 Series chipsets and ATI 
Radeon HD 4000 series graphics.</p>

<p>As a competitive comparison, AMD claimed that its Opteron Model 2380
processor only used 138W at Active Idle compared to the Quad-Core Intel
processor using 179W at Active Idle. The Quad-Core AMD Opteron Model 2380
had a <a href="http://www.spec.org/power_ssj2008/">SPECpower_ssj2008</a>
overall rating of 731 ssj_ops/Watt and 308,089 ssj_ops at 100% target
load. The Quad-Core Intel processor had a SPECpower_ssj2008 result of 561
overall ssj_ops/Watt and 267,804 ssj_ops at 100% target load.</p>

<p>For more information on the enhanced Quad-Core AMD Opteron processor

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">AMD and Red Hat on Virtual Machine "Live Migration"</h3>
<p>AMD and Red Hat demonstrated for the first time a "live migration" of 
a virtual machine across different chip platforms. Live migration 
enables the movement of running virtual machines (VMs) from one 
physical server to another without disrupting service, something that 
had only been demonstrated across systems based on one vendor's 
platforms. This  live migration demo in November moved a live VM from 
an dual socket Intel Xeon DP Quad Core E5420-based system to a 45nm 
Quad-Core AMD Opteron processor, utilizing Red Hat's high-performance 
open source virtualization software. See the demonstration on the AMD 
Unprocessed YouTube Channel <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuhU6jJjpAQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuhU6jJjpAQ</a>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Linux Foundation 
Hosts First End User Summit</h3>

<p>The first ever Linux Foundation End User Summit was attended by 
over 140 people, including end users of Linux, as well as kernel 
developers and commercial vendors, with the goal of providing new 
lines of communication between these groups.  The event was held 
during October in New York City, and allowed Unix users at many major 
financial institutions to attend.</p>

<p>The two-day event demonstrated a desire on the part of the end user 
community to understand how Linux works on a deep technical level and 
how their companies can participate more in Linux or benefit more from 
its features. Keynotes for the event included a discussion from 
Anthony Williams, author of <i>Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes 
Everything</i>, and Jonathan Corbet, editor of <i>Linux Weekly News </i> and 
creator of the <a
href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/Linux_Weather_Forecast">Linux Weather Forecast</a>.</p>

<p>The first day was marked by several panel discussions, which 
allowed attendees to get some specific questions answered, such as how 
Linux fits in current enterprise operations and how corporate end 
users can participate more in the Linux development process.</p>

<p>The second day of the conference was divided into four tracks of 
sessions: Legal/Business, Futures, Operations, and Performance. Many 
attendees also used the opportunity to get into smaller groups and go 
over their specific needs. Several Linux kernel developers, including 
James Bottomley, Andrew Morton, and Theodore T'so, were in attendance 
at the Summit.</p>

<p>By design, the event was invitation-only so end users were 
encouraged to be free about their concerns. No members of the Press were 
allowed to attend.  The Linux Foundation is planning another End User 
Summit in 2009.</p>

<p>Below, are links to slides from many of the sessions at the summit:

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Linux Foundation 
Helps Linux Distros Obtain IPv6 Certification</h3>
 
<p>The Linux Foundation's IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6) Workgroup is 
enabling the major Linux "distros" to meet the U.S. Federal 
Government's Department of Defense (DOD) mandate and certification 
requirements for the new Internet protocol. IPv6 is the 
next-generation Internet protocol designed to replace IPv4, in use for 
nearly 20 years. Due to the explosive growth of the Internet, it is 
expected that IPv4 addresses will be exhausted within just a few short 
years.  </p>

<p>To accelerate IPv6 migration, the U.S. Federal Government issued a 
mandate for all of its agencies to meet the next-generation Internet 
protocol requirements for any computing and networking equipment they 
acquire. </p>

<p>The Linux Foundation, with leadership from Venkata Jagana, Senior 
Technical Staff Member and Chief Architect of Networking within IBM's 
Linux Technology Center, formed a Linux IPv6 Workgroup to 
collaboratively address this major undertaking and enable Linux-based 
machines to be IPv6-ready out of the box. Other active workgroup 
participants included HP, Nokia-Siemens, Novell and Red Hat.</p>

<p>The Linux Foundation IPv6 Workgroup reviewed the mandate requirements 
and performed a detailed IPv6 gap analysis to identify where Linux 
needed to be adapted. As a result, existing Linux features, such as 
ICMPv6, DHCPv6, MIB support and IPSec for IPv6, are now updated to 
conform to the Department of Defense requirements.</p>

<p>"The IPv6 mandate and ensuing requirements are such major undertakings 
that it makes it difficult for any one company to deal with it all on 
its own," said Jim Zemlin, executive director at The Linux Foundation. 
"This is exactly the kind of work and collaboration that the Linux 
Foundation can facilitate, and which results in real technology 
advancements for the Linux operating system."</p>

kernel. GRUB has been updated to 0.97. It is hoped that this will 
resolve the problems a few users have reported with not being able to 
access a bootable CD.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">TrueCrypt Provides FOSSw Security to USB Drives</h3>
<p>TrueCrypt secures external disk drives, especially USB thumb drives.  
Now in its 6th release version, TrueCrypt shows how Open Source 
Software adds value to every day activities.  The software installs 
on a computer and offers choices about how to encrypt the external 
drive.  The basic choices involve selecting an encryption algorithim 
and then either creating an encrypted container on the USB flash drive 
(this is safest and easiest) or encrypting the entire drive (but 
losing the password effectively trashes the drive).</p>

<p>Here are the main features for version 6a:<br />
- Creates a virtual encrypted disk within a file and mounts it as 
a real disk;<br />
- Encrypts an entire partition or storage device such as USB flash 
drive or hard drive;<br />
- Encrypts a partition or drive where Windows is installed 
(pre-boot authentication);<br />
- Encryption is automatic, real-time (on-the-fly) and transparent;<br />
- Provides two levels of plausible deniability, in case an 
adversary forces you to reveal the password:<br />
1) Hidden volume (steganography) and hidden operating system;<br />
2) No TrueCrypt volume can be identified (volumes cannot be 
distinguished from random data);<br />
- Encryption algorithms: AES-256, Serpent, and Twofish;<br />
- Multi-core and multi-processor parallelized encryption and decryption.</p>

<p>And much more. For more information, please see:

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Free beta of Hot Copy for Linux</h3>

<p>R1Soft announced the release of a free beta version of its Hot Copy 
for Linux, a new command line utility that takes readable and writable 
snapshots of disks or volumes on any Linux server, without interrupting 
applications on busy Linux servers. As block level changes are made to 
the device, Hot Copy makes a backup copy of only the changed blocks 
instead of replicating the entire drive. These changed blocks are 
then efficiently stored in the unused space on the hard disk.</p>

<p>"Hot Copy is big news for anyone that has to maintain a Linux server. 
With Windows you have Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS). There is 
nothing really like VSS for Linux servers. It's a big missing piece 
for Linux Enterprise IT. You have LVM snapshots of course, and the 
challenge with LVM is that most servers don't run LVM, and even if 
they do the LVM volumes have to be configured ahead of time with spare 
disk space. Linux server admins need a simple command that allows 
snapshots on any Linux server at any time. This is what Hot Copy does. 
After installing the Hot Copy RPM or .deb package it's one simple hcp 
command and they have an instant point-in-time snapshot on any Linux 
disk," said David Wartell, Vice President of R1Soft, a division of BBS 
Technologies, Inc.</p>

<p>The free Linux Hot Copy beta version is scheduled for release in late 
November. Pre-registration
(<a href="http://www.r1soft.com/products/linux-hot-copy/linux-hot-copy">http://www.r1soft.com/products/linux-hot-copy/linux-hot-copy</a>) is 
available for those interested in downloading Hot Copy prior to the 
general release date.</p>

<p>"As SOA deployments expand, so does the need for more robust, 
automated monitoring and management techniques," states Sandra Rogers, 
Program Director for SOA, Web Services, and Integration research at 
IDC. "Tracking and ensuring service performance and policy enforcement 
at multiple levels, and across varied SOA infrastructure elements, is 
crucial for supporting more dynamic and complex configurations."</p>

<p>JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform is built from open source projects such 
as JBoss ESB, JBoss jBPM, and JBoss Rules. JBoss Operations Network 
provides enterprises with a customizable management tool set. </p>

<p>JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 4.3 and JBoss Operations Network 2.1 are 
expected to be available by the end of October 2008.</p>
