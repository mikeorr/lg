      <P>The objective of this document is to show you how you can automatically harden your IPTABLES based firewall in
      real-time which is a technique used by commercial firewalls to prevent
      invalid packets from reaching protected networks. The content has been
      tested against Linux Mandrake 8.0 with Kernel 2.4.3 and IPTABLES 1.2.1a.&nbsp;Mandrake
claim their distribution to be Red Hat compliant so the content in this article should be fully Red Hat
compatible.&nbsp;<u>I don't have any experience whatsoever with other distros</u>,
      but then, I live on the island of Mauritius which is a hell of a journey
      from civilisation, and all of us here are scantily clad Zulu
      warriors :-) For more info about Mauritius <a href="http://www.islandsoft.net" target="_blank">click
      here</a>.&nbsp;</P>
      <P>There are many books available on Linux Security. I like these ones.
</P>
      <P><a HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130281875/scubadivingtheis" target="_blank">Real
      World Linux Security (Intrusion, Prevention, Detection and Recovery)</a><br>

 </P>
      <P>Usually IPTABLES only logs messages via the SYSLOGD mechanism. Logs by themselves are fine for basic security but do not address advanced
      security issues. For advanced security you need to make your
      system run&nbsp;custom scripts as soon as illegal operations are logged by&nbsp;the
      firewall. Depending on the severity of the violations, you can program
      these scripts to perform various actions such
      as paging network admins or blocking offending IP addresses. All too often,
      firewall logs are checked once daily, or utilities such as
LOGCHECK are used in scheduled CRON jobs to inform network admins of anything 
      abnormal. By the time the logs are verified, the damage
      to your system is already 
      done.</P>
      <P>Linux SYSLOGD incorporates a neat feature which allows SYSLOGD to send
      the messages it receives to user defined pipes which can pass the message
      in turn to a script of your choice. The message flow is outlined
      below.&nbsp;</P>
      <P>IPTABLES &gt; SYSLOGD &gt; named pipe &gt; custom script</P>
      <P>&nbsp;In the following exercise, I will show you
      how to add a DROP command to
IPTABLES in order to block offending IP addresses in real-time as soon as a FIN scan is
      detected.&nbsp; You could of course
      program&nbsp; your scripts to do a multitude of other things as well.&nbsp;</P>
      <P>You can get the entire tarball for this exercise <a href="http://www.islandsoft.net/veerapen.tar.gz">here</a>.</P>
<P><b><u>Requirements for this exercise:</u></b></P>
      <P>Machine X (192.168.0.1)<br>
      Needs IPTABLES, SYSLOGD enabled, the C shell(csh) and Apache. This is the
      machine that we will be tinkering with and where you will need to install
      the demo scripts.</P>
<P>Machine Y (192.168.0.2)<br>
Install
      NMAP on Machine Y</P>
      <P>This is what we will be doing:</P>
      <P>(1) Create a firewall script using IPTABLES<BR>(2) Create a named 
      pipe.<BR>(3) Create a firewall hardening script.<BR>(4) Convey data from 
      the named pipe to the firewall hardening script.<BR>(5) Tell SYSLOGD to 
      echo messages to the named pipe.<BR>(6) Send SIGHUP to syslogd.<BR>(7) Use 
      NMAP to generate SYN/FIN scans</P>
      <P><b><font size="3">(1) <u>Create a Firewall Script using IPTABLES</u></font></b></P>
      <P>I have included the demo IPTABLES script as a <a href="http://www.islandsoft.net/iptables.sh.txt" target="_blank">text
      version</a> for you to download. Make the script executable and run it. Don't
      forget to be logged in as root.</P>
      <P><i>chmod 750 script_name<br>

# Its simply

#
# Revised on 1st of December 2001
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This is a very basic IPTABLES script which checks for TCP scans with
# only the FIN bit set. FIN never occurs on its own and is an indication
# that someone is probably scanning your firewall and up to no good.
#
# If a scan is detected, it gets logged and the firewall is hardened
# against the offending IP address. This is a base for much more
# complex operations such as intrusion detection, paging  network
# admins, etc.
#
# The hardening is performed via syslogd which echoes messages
# to a named pipe rather than the screen. The named pipe then conveys
# data from syslogd to a hardening script of your choice.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Q: How do I generate SYN/FIN scans?
# A: Get NMAP at http://www.insecure.org/nmap
#
# Q: How do I create a named pipe?
# A: mknod /path/named_pipe p
#    chmod 600 /path/named_pipe
#
# Q: How do I tell syslogd to send data to the named pipe?
# A: Edit /etc/syslog.conf
#    Look for an entry starting like
#	*.info;mail.none;authpriv.none
#    Change the line to look like
#	*.info;mail.none;authpriv.none |/path/named_pipe
#
#	Replace the space between .none and | with a TAB!
#
# Q: How do I convey data from the named pipe to my script.
# A: (/path/my_script &lt; /path/named_pipe)&amp;
#    Then send kill -1 to syslogd.
#
#	Unless you want to type in this command every time you restart your
#	system I suggest that it be issued on system startup.
#	I use Red Hat/Mandrake, so in my case I put it into /etc/rc.d/rc.local
