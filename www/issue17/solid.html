<h2>SOLID desktop for Linux offered free of charge to developers</h2>

<P>
Solid Information Technology Ltd today announced a campaign 
targeted at the community of Linux developers. Between March 
and September 1997 Linux enthusiasts will be presented with 
a free personal version of the robust SQL database engine 
SOLID Server. Numerous commercial and non-commercial web 
sites are joining Solid Information Technology Ltd in this 
program by letting their web visitors download the free 
SOLID Desktop from their site.

<P>
Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, comments on the initiative: 
"This generous offer from Solid is warmly welcomed in the Linux 
community, and I share the enthusiasm of my fellow Linux 
developers around the globe. Solid's campaign manifests the 
mutual benefits commercial and non-commercial groups may have."

<P>
"With this campaign we want to show our appreciation of the 
voluntary efforts that are so characteristic of the Linux 
community," states Artturi Tarjanne, President of Solid 
Information Technology Ltd. "In just a few years, Linux 
has grown from an academic exercise into a commercially viable 
solution. Today, some of the hottest software development 
projects on earth are Linux based. Those highly mission-critical 
systems need a robust, commercial database management system, 
and we've got it. And if anybody is in doubt regarding the 
care-free nature of SOLID Server, we offer free technical 
support until the end of April 1997."

<P>
The SOLID Desktop for Linux is offered free of charge for anyone 
to download from numerous web sites around the world. The licence 
is for personal and development use. Solid offers free technical 
support until the end of April 1997. Users can at any time choose 
to upgrade the software to the commercially available SOLID 
Server for client/server applications and SOLID Web Engine for 
web applications. SOLID Server is also available on other Unix 
systems and on all Windows platforms.

<P>
SOLID Server is a unique product by Solid Information Technology 
Ltd, a privately held innovator of breakthrough database 
technologies.  SOLID Server database components are in embedded 
use in web sites, diesel engines, elevator control systems, point 
of sale systems, travel agency systems, sales force automation 
systems, and many more.
