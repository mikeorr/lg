The strangest and silliest case of "which OS looks cooler" effects I did
was to run a copy of Windows For Workgroups 3.1 under DesqView, with WFW
running Norton Desktop for Windows and themed up to look as close to a Mac
as I could get.  (Which was actually <EM>very</EM> close, I'm a decent graphic
artists and rather sneaky about using my apps' splash screens)  I was
doing NDW tech support at the time;  Linux was so new we were using
Soft Landing Systems, and boy, was that a painful download.

There is a documented case, somewhere, of someone running <EM>5</EM> emulators
deep, though I no longer remember which ones they were.  I'm pretty
sure it involved a Windows em, a Mac one, and a Commie, but I no longer
remember the details.

In a later and less silly age I used Fvwm95 to good effect on <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A>
systems, to get folks with no Linux nor BSD experience to be able to use
our systems quickly.  All I had to make sure was that "Settings" menu
sorted out in the right order.  Nowadays better file managers would make
faking out the Control Panel pretty easy too.  In a modern day I'd probably
start with Icewm because someone else already did most of the work, and
Icewm works well with K and Gnome.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Ahh, but none of those were Linux.  My usual one-upsmanship call for a
UNIX derivate over an MSwin derivate, is that the Linux/UNIX philosophy
has many small parts that do things by operating together -- even in those
cases when things break down fairly badly, it's usually quite easy to slip
over to another console and merely 'kill -9' the offending process.  The
GUI is just one more piece in this sort of puzzle, and in fact X, the
graphical system, can be run without a window manager at all if you really
need to squeeze those resources.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
But the times when I've hung X fairly hard (hey, I was working with some
locally built stuff I'd wired up wrong, mea culpa) I was able to ssh in
from another terminal, kill -9 the process family responsible, and init
cleaned up the memory mess.  No nasty reboot necessary 
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">  It's <EM>possible</EM>
to dig yourself into trouble so deep only a reboot would escape, but <EM>much</EM>
more difficult.  The principle that not every app gets godly powers on the
whole disk helps this out a great deal...

The equivalent of the Windows BSOD is the Unix Panic.  (Or the Linux
Oops...)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
In <EM>20</EM> years of working with *nix boxen, I've seen...
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
10 panics.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
5 or 6 of those were my own machine, when the 1.0 kernel proved not to
be as resilient as the .99pl12f working with a WD 1007 ESDI controller.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<EM>All</EM> of the others were bad device drivers or bad hardware; I have
<EM>never in my life</EM> seen a Unix box lock up from userland software
problems.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Heather] 
I've seen about 12 or 15 "device wedge" conditions.  In themselves they don't
halt the system, but the wedged driver will never release its resources,
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Jay] 
Typically, this is a driver for a "fast" device, which turned out to be
slow.  Slow device drivers are interruptable.  "fast" ones aren't.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Heather] 
and the condition usually requires an exceedingly careful manual shutdown --
which you want to do, instead of let a UPS discover it can't shut you down
correctly.  Most especially you want to make sure the wedging condition isn't
part of the startup sequence or you are really in hot water.  The usual
reason for this is when am incorrect driver succeeds in loading anyway, much
to its dismay.  And mine.  (For our loyal readers, if anybody is willing to
<EM>believe</EM> me when I say I have a PCMCIA-LS120 that doesn't work, and willing
to help make it work, please let me know.  That kind of coding is not my
specialty.)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I've seen numerous "fatal embrace" conditions amongst 3 to 5 apps enough
times that I don't count them;  not because they're common, but because I've
been doing this long enough I have better things to count.  They can be killed
from other consoles -- the main reason X makes things a problem is that it
owns display and keyboard control -- thus it straddles userland and driver
space.  If the X server or the X window manager cannot come to the foreground
because other apps are locked up, your directly-connected keyboard may be
unusable... whether or not those two are members of the lockup.  Thus a quick
bout with 'ssh' and 'kill -9' is in order.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Occasional cases of someone passing incorrect hardware information to an app
which straddles userland and driverspace (PCMCIA, X, just about any emulator)
have led to frankly, expectable results.  Debugging the smoking crater in
your foot, yes.  D'oh!
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
In the scope of laptops only, poor quality APM or ACPI support on either end
of the hardware/driver equation has led many on mailing lists to wail that
resuming from suspend is a game of musical chairs for them (sometimes you
lose) or worse (tell me again about these journaling filesystems, I think I
really need that stuff) but I have only seen that for myself...  um, about
7 times.  But bear in mind that this includes that I played "musical chairs"
with resuming for about a month before I learned enough about APM to use it
correctly on my own laptop.  Ahh, that was a much younger me.  I was so
excited about everything else in my new distros.

Any tips for the rest of us out here who would like to do the same?  I
really don't use the suspend feature on my laptop, as the success rate is
only about 30% - 50%.

<blockQuote><ol>
<LI>I later learned that I succeeded so well at it ... translation, I didn't
   crash 92.3% of the time... because I had such decently good timing in my
   BIOS.  I love my little blue laptop.  It's great.

<LI>Once I actually built a kernel for myself with APM support turned on
   crashes changed from "fairly common" to "rare"

<LI>Once I actually loaded apmd as part of normal startup sequence (duh,
   how silly I feel now) the crashes went away entirely.  Nowadays I put it
   in the load sequence even if I think the kernel has no apm - it's safe to
   do that, it merely bails out with a note about it.
</ol></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
To expand on (2), there are a handful of minor options that relate to what
APM sub-features are turned on, off, or hit over the head with a stick. You
may need to mess with some of them until you get a machine that stops being
crashy.  Or <EM>mostly</EM> stops being crashy.  If it never gets perfect and it's
a fairly new box (year 2000+) it may be worth trying ACPI instead.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
SMP's APIC behaviors give APM a nasty-bad case of indigestion, and so you
should not turn on "APIC for Uniprocessor" even if your CPU can use it,
when you stick with APM.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
To expand on (3), of course it's this userland daemon that allows things
like it turning of the pcmcia ports when I want to go to sleep, so the
unpowered ports don't block the interrupt request and result in immediate
wake again.  Sound can do that too.  Heh.

Thanx a bunch.  Although I have apmd being called from the init scripts
and enabled in the (2.2.x) kernel, I was having a heck of a time with it.
However, it's been some time since I've tried it - (probably not since I
upgraded to 2.2.20), so it may be time to do some experimenting.

In general anything that crosses the blood/brain barrier, er, kernel and
userland space has potential to do "something wicked" (a real error message,
I saw it once) or scare an operating system ("Aieee! tried to kill init!").

Just switching fast between different screen resolutions X-screen textconsole
etc. will usually lock it hard at some point. Sometimes with running kernel
and network, but more often locked solid. Seems to happen with Matrox Mytique
graphic cards as well as a variety of more recent nvidia's.
When running <A HREF="http://www.dosemu.org/">DOSEMU</A> a long time agro (like 2-3 years) certain programs could
also lock me out completely because the keyboard was blocked. No ideas if the
net would have been still running.

While we mention odd documented cases, someone managed to get themselves
a situation where the stack was still active after they called for init to
halt ... and then abused this to their advantage by using their machine as
a router, whose only purpose for a userland at all was to establish his
packet filters before "shutting down".  Darn near bulletproof.  I don't
think you can do that anymore without hacking the kernel a teeny bit.

also starting vmware in fullscreen (with resolution change) locked an nvidia
card solid several times on the machine I'm just sitting at.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
All of these have one thing in common: direct hardware acess from more or
less userspace and hardware and/or keyboard locking going haywire. I try to
avoid that if at all possible. I also guess that dosemu by now is lots more
stable, but I somehow don't need it anymore.

Userspace people <EM>just are not</EM> as careful as the kernel hackers in

Some but not all distros also have some very smooth ways of keeping their
packages up-to-date;  MS is a little slow on the uptake with security
updates, and some of those are worse than the disease since they can't resist
adding new functions in with it.

What's more a decent <A HREF="http://www.winehq.com/">WINE</A> setup can run Windows apps within the Linux kit;
Mandrake's "gamers edition" has it all ready to go, plus Transgaming's

I dunno, I haven't run WINE in a while ... and it's come a long way baby,
but I dunno if that means it uses more or about the same resources as it
did when I messed with it.  Also for the record I've only seeing the
Transgaming stuff on other peoples' boxen, not my own.

I used a Pentium II.  I'm pretty sure 96 MB is enough if you're the only

<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">  "Reasonable" is totally subjective and
in my case is skewed heavily -- the only two remaining MSwin boxen around
here are a P130 laptop and a VMware session.  The VMware session is molasses

The P130 is reasonable.

On the flip side of one-upsmanship, so what if he wants to run MSwin?  I mean,
I wouldn't go near that license they've got on XP with a 20 foot pole and
hazmat gear, but Win2k might be okay as a desktop system.  I woldn't trust
it as a server, not because of the OS itself (others in the Answer Gang are
welcome to disagree, but I've no quibbles about proprietary bits here and
there in my life) but because many of the server apps are bug-ridden.  If
I'm going to use <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A> and Sendmail anyway (they've been ported there long
since, and some effort is made to keep them updated) then I'd rather use
them on platforms they were built for first.  In many contexts the BSD family
(<A HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</A>, FreeBSD, and for non-PC use <A HREF="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</A>) can do better than both of us,
so it really comes down to what you expect to <EM>do</EM> with a system, before you
decided what OS will be best for it.

Document compatability is a different problem, but Wordperfect, Applix (no
