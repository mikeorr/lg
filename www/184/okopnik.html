</pre>

<p>
First things first: this book is not about Linux. What it is about,
however, is the thing that for me is indistinguishable from Linux: a spirit
of exploration, of curiosity, of getting your hands into an interesting,
fascinatingly-complicated Thing and making it work - even if you have to
assemble it piece by piece. This book is a terrific catalyst for igniting
the imagination - and not only in kids, but in any adult with even a bit of
curiosity.
</p>

<p>
The thing that I found instantly appealing about it is the absence of what
I call "assumed stupidity" on the part of the reader. The Do-It-Yourself
(DIY) air throughout the book, the underlying assumption of intelligence,
caution, and ability in the reader is refreshing. Sure, there are plenty of
warnings about the various dangerous bits you're going to deal with - and
it says quite a lot for the author that even these are interesting to read!
- but... one of the projects is a "Ticklebox", a way to zap yourself and
your friends with a little jolt of electricity, while another is a
Marshmallow Gun, which drives its soft, fluffy projectile with (I kid you
not) <em>breath spray</em> exploded by the flash circuitry from a
disposable camera.
</p>

<p>
(If you're anything like me, the last sentence will have you running out
the door and to your nearest book store to grab this book RIGHT NOW. Go
ahead; I'll wait.)
</p>

<p>
The project list veers wildly, from an squid sock puppet to an
electric guitar that you can build for $10; in fact, most of these projects
can be built very cheaply, and the pages are packed with suggestions on
using scraps of this, bits of that, and cheap but strong goop to secure it
all inside an empty cigar box or maybe an empty can with its ends cut out.
The required factor here is a will to tinker and explore, not a pocket full
of cash.
</p>

<p>
And since you're off and building that guitar, you might as well build an
amp and a stomp box, too - oh, did I mention that this book gives you a
mini-education in practical electronics just so you can complete these
projects? Perfect example of the author's DIY mindset - and as a life-long
teacher as well as an electronics engineer, I admit to being quite
impressed by it. Very well done, and bursting at the seams with even more
"curiosity bait"; anyone who gets hooked on playing with soldering irons
and electronic components is left with lots of info resources which they
can use to expand their new-found skill.
</p>

<p>
All in all, I'm very pleasantly impressed by this book - and I am usually
not the kindest of reviewers. If I have any complaint to make, it is that
the author sometimes forgets that the readers don't have access to all the
info in his head: the section on musical instruments, for example, has very
little info on actually using them - you're more or less expected to know
all that stuff. To be fair, this is a very common and completely natural
failing: we're not always aware of everything we know as a learned skill,
because after a while it becomes "just the way the world is". But then, if
you're interested in music, this becomes just another avenue of learning
and exploration...

<p>
Ben is the Editor-in-Chief for Linux Gazette and a member of The Answer Gang.
</p>

<p>
<em>
Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became interested in electricity
at the tender age of six, promptly demonstrated it by sticking a fork into
a socket and starting a fire, and has been falling down technological
mineshafts ever since. He has been working with computers since the Elder
Days, when they had to be built by soldering parts onto printed circuit
boards and programs had to fit into 4k of memory (the recurring nightmares
have almost faded, actually.)
</p>

<p>
His subsequent experiences include creating software in more than two dozen
languages, network and database maintenance during the approach of a
hurricane, writing articles for publications ranging from sailing magazines
to technological journals, and teaching on a variety of topics ranging from
Soviet weaponry and IBM hardware repair to Solaris and Linux
administration, engineering, and programming. He also has the distinction
of setting up the first Linux-based public access network in St. Georges,
Bermuda as well as one of the first large-scale Linux-based mail servers in
St. Thomas, USVI.
</p>

<p>
After a seven-year Atlantic/Caribbean cruise under sail and passages up and
down the East coast of the US, he is currently anchored in northern
Florida. His consulting business presents him with a variety of challenges,
and his <strike>second brain</strike> Palm Pilot is crammed full of alarms,
many of which contain exclamation points.
</p>

<p>
He has been working with Linux since 1997, and credits it with his complete
loss of interest in waging nuclear warfare on parts of the Pacific Northwest.
