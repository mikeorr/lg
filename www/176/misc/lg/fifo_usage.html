I have come across this thing called FIFO named pipe. I can see how it
works, but I find no place where I can put it to good use (in a shell
script). Can someone give me a good application context where a shell
script would need to use FIFO ? I need a good and convincing example,
to be able to tell my students.

<p>
This is not an example but a proto-example.
</p>

<p>
Suppose you need to provide some way for people/accounts to send you data
AND you want to control (using unix permissions) who can send the
data.
</p>

<p>
In that case you can use a fifo with appropriate unix permissions
which people can write to. Your program then reads this data and
processes it.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example. You want members of the (unix) group 'fifo101' to
send you questions but they want to be sure that their submissions
are anonymous and you want to check that these are indeed questions
being submitted.
</p>

<p>
IF they understand the fifo AND they trust that there is no one
(including system administrator) who is peering over their shoulder,
then creating a fifo for them to dump their questions to is one easy
way to do this. Your program reads from the fifo and saves the data to
a file after checking that it is indeed a legitimate question (using
some kind of regular expression!).
</p>

<p>
Regards,
</p>

Kapil.

Hi, Partha -

<p>
FIFOs occupy an important but rarely-used niche in the *nix world. Most
of the time, you don't need them... but when you do, there's nothing
else that will work. You can think of them as the filesystem version of
sockets: a method for communicating between a running process and a
program, or between two running processes. The thing that makes FIFOs so
useful is that they act as a buffer: the "source" process fills the FIFO
by writing to it, while the "target" process or program empties it out
by reading from it (and blocks if there's no content, or until there is
content.) This allows you to do the data collection and processing
asynchronously.
</p>

<p>
Like sockets, FIFOs can be a little tricky to explain in simple words
(at least for me; I've met people who have managed to explain very
complex concepts in incredibly simple, punchy ways. I hold that kind of
skill - or is it a talent? - in awe.) I've rarely found any need to
explain them - from, say, a shell-scripting perspective, they're a
fairly advanced topic - but I believe that it's important to understand
them, for your own knowledge and competence at least.
</p>

<p>
I can give you a few examples of where I've used FIFOs in my own
scripting/programming; perhaps you can extract a minimal-length demo out
of these for your students, or come up with your own example.
</p>

<p>
1) Imagine the following situation: you have a 10GB file called
'mysql_data.gz', and you need to load its contents into a database on a
remote machine. You're pretty certain that your local machine does not
have enough diskspace left to hold the uncompressed version of this
file. What to do?
</p>

<pre>
# Fire up the reader process - MUST do this first!
mysql -h&lt;hostname&gt; -u&lt;username&gt; -p&lt;password&gt; &lt;dbname&gt;
	LOAD DATA INFILE '/tmp/loader.sql' INTO TABLE table;
 
# Create the named pipe
mknod -p /tmp/loader.sql
 
# Fire up the writer process
gunzip -c mysql_data.gz &gt; /tmp/loader.sql
</pre>

<p>
Assuming that you have a fast network, the reader process will be
emptying out the FIFO as the writer process is filling it. Even if the
writer is significantly faster, you're still going to gain a lot of
advantage, speed-wise, by doing it this way.
</p>

<p>
2) If you are running some sort of a dual conversion on a very large
file - say, you have a utility that converts SWF to MPG, and only allows
writing to an output file, but what you actually want as the end product
is an AVI - then you can avoid the huge intermediate files by using a
named pipe as the temporary "receiver" (the MPG file.) Sure, it will
"inflate" while the first process fills it up - but it will "deflate"
down to nothing when the second conversion process, MPG-&gt;AVI, reads it.
This is especially useful if you're using a script to convert multiple
files.
</p>

<p>
3) I wanted to run a tiny xterm window that displayed a filtered version
of the <em>new</em> content of /var/log/mail.info (this was my preferred
version of "biff"; it let me know when new mail came in, showed me the
subject, etc.) Initially, I tried implementing it as some version of
"xterm -e tail -f /var/log/mail.info", but I discovered that this was
too fragile: the xterm would "lose track" of the data from "tail -f" and
lock up (at least it wouldn't display any new information.) So, I made
the process much more robust by separating out the pieces and feeding
the data through a FIFO.
</p>

<p>
Here's the script, with (hopefully) enough comments to explain
everything. Note that you can also use 'mkfifo' to create these named
pipes; I tend to stick with 'mknod' because it's a bit more portable
(i.e., works with a variety of Unixen.)
</p>

(Ben) has fileld the FIFO. Now the reader (Partha) will read the FIFO.

I'm not certain that this is either a good or convincing example, but then 
again, named pipes (FIFOs) are an arcane part of Unix IPC and simple examples 
are usually neither good nor convincing.
</p>

<p>
As I said, named pipes are a part of Unix IPC, and that implies that there are 
two (or more) processes running. In the case of my example below, a 
single "server" process writes to the FIFO, while multiple "client" processes 
read from it. Here, the "server" generates passwords for users, while each 
client retrieves a single password; think of this as a simple "I need a new 
password" server and its clients.
</p>

<p>
The assumptions for this demo:
 - both server and client(s) are run in the same working directory
 - mkfifo is not a priviledged command, and can be run by non-root users
 - (at least) two shell sessions are running
</p>

<p>
First, for the server side:
In a separate shell session, cwd to the target directory and
  mkfifo PassWords
  while true ;
  do
    dd if=/dev/random bs=6 count=1 2&gt;/dev/null |  \
    mmencode 2&gt;/dev/null                       |  \
    tr '+/=' 'AZ9' &gt;PassWords
  done
</p>

<p>
Next, the client side:
In a separate shell session, cwd to the target directory and
  cat PassWords
</p>

<p>
Repeated attempts to cat PassWords will print single, random passwords.

Here's a hint. FIFOs block the writer when they're full. Back then IIRC 4kB

Boy, isn't <em>that</em> the truth? I've been teaching shell scripting for
years, have read what seems like every single book available on the
subject, and have <strong>never</strong> seen a good, simple example for a 'while'
loop. Having given it some thought, I've come to the same conclusion you
have: once you get to a certain level of complexity (and that might just
mean a simple but niche-specific function), good examples aren't simple,
and simple examples aren't good.
 
</p>

&gt;     tr '+/=' 'AZ9' &gt;PassWords
&gt;   done

<p>
Nice. For those who don't have emacs (and thus 'mmencode') installed,
this would work:
</p>

<pre>
while :
do
	perl -MMIME::Base64 -wne'read(ARGV,$a,6);
	($a=encode_base64($a,""))=~tr#+/=#AZ9#;
	print"$a\n"; exit' /dev/urandom&gt;/tmp/PassWords
done
</pre>

<p>
Come to think of it, you could (as root) set up a "password device" in
/dev by running the above in a system startup script - that would be a
rather cool thing - although you'd probably want to use /dev/urandom as
the entropy source.
