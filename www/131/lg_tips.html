<h3>2-cent tip: Finding clunky files</h3>

<strong>
<p>
What's eating up your hard-drive?
</p>

<p>
Most linux'ers familiar with the bash shell know that <code>df</code> is
good for finding out just how much space is being taken up in a
partition. They may also know that <code>du</code> lists each folder in
the current dir, and the size of all that folder's contents.
</p>

<p>
Those are neat commands, but not that informative. The latter inspired
me to come up with a more helpful shell one-liner that points out clear
as day the files which are sucking up your space. I keep it handy to
clean out my tiny 40GB hard drive every now and then. I also shared it
with someone who runs a 160GB personal server, and they were very
thankful. So if it's useful for me, and useful for him, I can be
moderately sure that it'll be useful for you, too. Here it is:
</p>

<pre class="code">
cd ~; du -Sa --block-size=MB | sed -r '/^0/d' | sort -nr | less
</pre>
<p>
You may have to wait a minute for it to get the size of all the files
(with my small HD, takes me about 20 seconds).
</p>

<p>
This is only to scan your home directory for big files. To scan your
root directory, change the <code>~</code> at the beginning to
<code>/</code> ... and while it's scanning, press Ctrl+C, and then 'q'
to quit. Or after it's done and the results are shown, just press 'q' to
leave the pager program and go back to your prompt.
</p>
</strong>

<p>
[Neil] - That's an interesting variation on the usual approach. Most people
use 'find' to pick out large files, which I find preferable, e.g.
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
  find ~ -size +250k -ls
</pre>
<p>
will list every file under your home directory larger than 250kB. If you
want 
it sorted 
</p>

<pre class="code">
  find ~ -size +250k -ls | sort -nr -k 7 
</pre>
<p>
will do that.
</p>

<p>
As the saying goes "there's more than one way to do it" and your approach 
works just fine. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
[Ben] - It may be that one solution is significantly faster than another
(although I rather doubt it); I'd certainly like to find out. I wish I
knew how to flush the page cache that 'find', etc. use to keep the
relevant info ('du' uses the same one); I'd have liked to compare the
speed of the two solutions, as well as perhaps '<code>ls -lR|sort -nrk5</code>'.
However, no matter what, Teal's is a good, useful approach to solving
(or at least reporting) a common problem. Heck, I just cleaned out a
bunch of thumbnails (187MB!) going back to... umm, given that I've been
just carrying my '~' structure forward all along, back to when I started
using Linux, probably.
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
ben at Fenrir:~$ time find ~ -size +250k -ls | sort -nr -k 7 &gt; /dev/null
real    0m45.453s
user    0m0.120s
sys     0m0.500s
</pre>
<p>
Maybe I'll remember to test one of the others when I next turn this
laptop on.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
[Rick] - Here's my own favourite solution to that problem:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
:r /usr/local/bin/largest20


#!/usr/bin/perl -w
# You can alternatively just do:  
# find . -xdev -type f -print0 | xargs -r0 ls -l | sort -rn +4 | head -20
use File::Find;
@ARGV = $ENV{ PWD } unless @ARGV;
find ( sub { $size{ $File::Find::name } = -s if -f; }, @ARGV );
@sorted = sort { $size{ $b } &lt;=&gt; $size{ $a } } keys %size;
splice @sorted, 20 if @sorted &gt; 20;
printf "%10d %s\n", $size{$_}, $_ for @sorted
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
[Ben] - [smile] Why, thank you. Nice to see it making the rounds. Original
credit to <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/">Randal Schwartz</a>,
of course, but I've mangled the thing quite a bit since then.
</p>

<p>
[Neil] - The advantages of the find solution are 
</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>It is somewhat more portable, the options to du used in teal's solution 
aren't available on some old distros I can't escape from.</li>
<li>It's easier to fine tune the file size threshold.</li>
<li>When sorted, it sorts in exact file size (but not exact disk usage).
The du 
based solution won't sort a set of 1.2MB, 1.8MB and 1.6MB files into order
of 
size.</li>
</ol>
<p>
In terms of speed, there may be an advantage in not having to remove small 
files from the initial list, but I would expect that difference to be lost
in the noise. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<strong>
<p>
[Nate (Teal)] -  Hrm... the 'du' tool can sort based on a smaller size,
you'd just
have to set the block-size to say, kb, or just stick with bytes like find
does, and you can fine-tune the files the 'du' tool shows based on size
with grep. But of course, neither of those are as intuitive or easy-to-use
the find solution, so 'du' is still worse in that aspect.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I have to say, I'm pretty humbled. It'd probably be better to just 
include the 'find' solution, or Moen's perl-based solution in the 
Gazette than my 'du' cruft.
</p>
</blockquote>
</strong>

<p>
[Ben] - Heck no, Nate. The point of all those tools in Linux is well
represented by the motto of Perl, "TMTOWTDI": There's More Than One Way To
Do It. It was nice to see someone else applying some brainpower to solving
a common problem in a useful way.
</p>

<strong>
<p>
[Nate (Teal)] - Good stuff, there.
</p>
</strong>

<p>
[Ben] - Yep. Yours included.
</p>

<p>
[Rick] - As Ben reminded me, he's one of the most recent people to polish
up that Perl gem ('largest20'):  I'm merely one of the many people passing
around variations of it -- and grateful for their craftsmanship.

<h3>2-cent tip: ethereal became wireshark</h3>

<p>
Old news to frequent ethereal users I guess, but back in July 2006 ethereal
became "wireshark". It seems that the company Ethereal, Inc. is keeping the
old name.
</p>

<p>
If you've been using the command line version tethereal, you're probably
wondering what to call it now. Well tethereal has become "tshark".

<h3>2-cent Tip: Annotating PDF</h3>
 
 <p>Kapil Hari Paranjape (kapil at imsc.res.in) 
 <br /> 
 Tue Sep 12 20:07:35 PDT 2006</p> 
 <em>Followed up by:  Ben</em> 
 
<strong>
<p>
Hello,
</p>

<p>
If you have ever wanted to do
	<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sudoku">the Guardian sudoku</a>
and not wanted to waste trees then you need to find a way to
annotate PDF files on your computer.
</p>

<p>
"flpsed" (FL toolkit PostScript EDitor) to the rescue.
</p>

<p>
Install "flpsed" and import any PDF file for annotation. The
interface is simple and intuitive.
</p>

<p>
This can also be used to fill forms which are not quite in the PDF
form format. More about that in the next tip.
</p>

<p>
It can also be used to annotate PS files of course.
</p>

<p>
Regards,
</p>

<p>
Kapil.
</p>
</strong>

<p>
[Ben] - That's a great tool, Kapil. I've needed something like that for
<em>ages</em> - many of the contracts that I get sent by my clients are in PDF,
and up until now, I've been converting them to PS, editing them in Gimp,
and reconverting them to PDF before shipping them back. This will save me
tons of time - thanks! I hope others will find it at least as useful.
</p>

<p>
[Kapil]  - Don't shoot (as in photograph) the messenger :)
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I too am extremely grateful to the author (Mortan Brix Pedersen
morten at wtf.de) of "flpsed".
</p>
<p>
Glad to have been of help.

<h3>2-cent Tip: Real editing of PDF Forms</h3>
 
 <p>Kapil Hari Paranjape (kapil at imsc.res.in) 
 <br /> 
 Tue Sep 12 23:49:11 PDT 2006</p> 
  
 
<p>
Hello,
</p>

<p>
"Real" PDF forms are quite common nowadays. How does edit them with a
"Real" editor like vi (OK also emacs :))?
</p>

<p>
"pdftk" (PDF ToolKit) to the rescue.
</p>

<p>
Suppose that "form.pdf" is your PDF form.
</p>

<p>
1. Extract the form information:
</p>
<pre>	pdftk form.pdf generate_fdf output form.fdf</pre>

<p>
2. This only gets the text fields to get an idea of all
   the fields do:
</p>
<pre>	pdftk form.pdf dump_data_fields output form.fields</pre>

<p>
3. Sometimes the field names are cryptic. It helps to also
   view the form:
</p>
<pre>	xpdf form.pdf</pre>
<p>
or
</p>
<pre>	pdftotext -layout form.pdf; less form.txt</pre>
		<p>
(if you insist on text-mode)
</p>

<p>
4. You can now edit the file form.fdf and fill in the fields marked with
   the string '\n%%EOF\n'.
</p>

<p>
   Once you have edited form.fdf you can generate the filled in form
   with:
</p>
<pre>	pdftk form.fdf fill_form form.fdf output filled.pdf</pre>
		<p>
or
</p>
<pre>	pdftk form.fdf fill_form form.fdf output filled.pdf flatten</pre>
		<p>
to get a non-editable pdf.
</p>

<p>
Some additional hints:
</p>

<p>
1. If your form.fdf file contains no '\n%%EOF\n' strings then you are
   out of luck---it means your PDF form is only a printable form and
   cannot be filled on the computer (but see the hint about
   "flpsed").
</p>

<p>
2. Checkboxes/buttons will not appear in the fdf file. You can use
   form.fields to find out what these fields are called and introduce
   entries in the fdf file as (here replace FN by the field name)
</p>
<pre>   	 &lt;&lt;/V (Yes) /T (FN) &gt;&gt; </pre>
   	 	<p>
or
</p>
<pre>   	 &lt;&lt;/V (Off) /T (FN) &gt;&gt; </pre>

<p>
3. It helps to have three windows open. One for editing, one for
   viewing the form.fields and one for viewing the filled pdf file.
</p>

<p>
4. You may also want to periodically update the filling of the form
   to see whether the filling works.
</p>

<p>
Remarks:
</p>

<p>
Clearly this is crying for someone to write a nice interface---why
don't I you ask? I will ... but don't hold your breath.
</p>

<p>
You can skip all of this and use Adobe's Distiller, but most readers
should be able to guess why I don't want to use that!

<h3>2-cent tip: Renaming music files</h3>
 
 <p>Benjamin A. Okopnik (ben at linuxgazette.net) 
 <br /> 
 Wed 27 Sep 2006 11:24:37 PDT</p> 
  
 
<p>
Much of the available CD-ripping software out there produces files with
names like 'trackname_01.wav' or '01_track.wav' instead of actual song
names. Yes, there's software available that will look up CDDB entries...
but what if your CD isn't in the CDDB, or you don't have a net
connection readily available?
</p>

<p>
'<a href="misc/tag/wavren.txt">wavren</a>' to the rescue. :)
</p>

<p>
This script, when executed in a directory containing the 'standard'
track names, takes the name of a file that contains the names of the
songs on that album and returns a paired list of the current track name
and the line in the file that it will be renamed to. It will exit with
an error message if the lists aren't the same length, and it will not
actually rename anything until you specify a '-rename' argument.
Example:
</p>

<pre class="code">
ben@Fenrir:/tmp/foo$ ls
01.wav  02.wav  03.wav  04.wav  05.wav  06.wav  07.wav  08.wav
09.wav 10.wav names
ben@Fenrir:/tmp/foo$ cat names
01. Hells Bells
02. Shoot To Thrill
03. What Do You Do For Money Honey
04. Given The Dog A Bone
05. Let Me Put My Love Into You
06. Back In Black
07. You Shook Me All Night Long
08. Have A Drink On Me
09. Shake A Leg
10. Rock And Roll Ain't Noise Pollution
ben@Fenrir:/tmp/foo$ wavren names
"01.wav" will be "01. Hells Bells.wav"
"02.wav" will be "02. Shoot To Thrill.wav"
"03.wav" will be "03. What Do You Do For Money Honey.wav"
"04.wav" will be "04. Given The Dog A Bone.wav"
"05.wav" will be "05. Let Me Put My Love Into You.wav"
"06.wav" will be "06. Back In Black.wav"
"07.wav" will be "07. You Shook Me All Night Long.wav"
"08.wav" will be "08. Have A Drink On Me.wav"
"09.wav" will be "09. Shake A Leg.wav"
"10.wav" will be "10. Rock And Roll Ain't Noise Pollution.wav"
</pre>
<p>
If the lineup isn't exactly how you want it, you can either renumber the
original files, or change the order of the lines in the "names" file. Also
note that you can rename mp3 files, etc., just by changing the 'ext'
variable at the top of the script to reflect the extension that you're
looking for.
