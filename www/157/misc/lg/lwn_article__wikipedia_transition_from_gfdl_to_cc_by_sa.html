  GFDL 1.3: Wikipedia's exit permit
  by Jonathan Corbet
  November 5, 2008
</p>

<p>
  [...]
  Members of the Wikipedia project have wanted to move away from the GFDL
  for some time.  [...]  The presence of the "or any later version"
  language allows Wikipedia content to be distributed under the terms of
  later versions of the GFDL with no need to seek permission from
  individual contributors. Surprisingly, the Wikimedia Foundation has
  managed to get the Free Software Foundation to cooperate in the use of
  the "or any later version" permission to carry out an interesting legal
  hack.
  [...]
</p>

<p>
  In other words, GFDL-licensed sites like Wikipedia have a special,
  nine-month window in which they can relicense their content to the
  Creative Commons attribution-sharealike license. This works because (1)
  moving to version 1.3 of the license is allowed under the "or any later
  version" terms, and (2) relicensing to CC-BY-SA is allowed by GFDL 1.3.
</p>

<p>
LWN articles become available to the general public after eight days, so
non-subscribers will be able to read the story starting Nov. 13.

Well heck, even Debian like CC-BY-SA 3:
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=445057">http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=445057</a>
(they also seem to like Affero GPL 3, but that has specific
GPL-compatibility written into it)
</p>

<p>
Anyway, they have a FAQ:
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3-faq.html">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3-faq.html</a>
<pre class='code'>
Q. What are the changes in FDL 1.3?
A. The primary change is the addition of section 11. This new
provision allows certain materials released under this license to also
be used under the terms of CC-BY-SA 3.0. For more information about
exactly what materials can be licensed this way, see the related
questions below. As part of this change, we also introduced a new
definition in section 1.
We also borrowed a couple of changes from GPLv3. The first is in
section 9, which explains how the license can be terminated when you
violate it. We now provide a means for violators to automatically have
their rights restored if they cure the violation. The second is in
section 10: now licensors can choose a proxy who is allowed to decide
whether or not a work can be licensed under the terms of future
versions of the FDL.
A Postscript file showing marked-up changes from FDL 1.2 to FDL 1.3 is
available for your review.
Q. What is the rationale behind these changes?
A. Section 11 has been added to allow wikis like Wikipedia to use
FDL-covered works under the terms of CC-BY-SA 3.0 if they choose to do
so. They have told us that they would like to explore this option, and
adding this provision gives them a clear path to do so.
Normally, these sorts of licensing decisions can and should be handled
by the copyright holder(s) of a particular work. However, because
Wikipedia has many copyright holders, the project needed some
alternative way to accomplish this, and we've worked with them to
provide that.
The other changes are minor improvements that were easy to make while
we were at it. They've met with wide approval in GPLv3, and they don't
change the license's fundamental permissions or requirements at all.
Q. Exactly what material can be licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0?
A. In order to license an FDL-covered work under CC-BY-SA 3.0, a few
conditions must be met:
The work must be available under the terms of FDL 1.3, which provides
you with this permission. If the work was released under the terms of
"the GNU Free Documentation License, version 1.2 or (at your option)
any later version," then it meets this criteria.
The work must not have any "Cover Texts" or "Invariant Sections."
These are optional features in all versions of the FDL.
If the work was originally published somewhere other than a public
wiki, it must have been added to a wiki (or some other kind of web
site where the general public could review and edit the materials)
before November 1, 2008.
All FDL-covered material added to Wikipedia before November 1, 2008
satisfies these conditions.

Found via that hyperlink, and highly recommended:
<a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Version_3#Debian">http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Version_3#Debian</a>
Page has very perceptive, enlightening, and diplomatic commentary 
by Creative Commons General Counsel Mia Garlick.  Among the insights is 
the complication added to any licensing problem by issues of
international law.
</p>

<p>
Concerning the general tenor of debian-legal members' comments on the
v. 2.5 releases of CC's Attribution and Attribution-ShareAlike licences, 
Ms. Garlick wrote:  "it seemed clear to Creative Commons that, for the
most part, minor amendments and clarifications to the licenses should be
able to address debian-legal's concerns".
</p>

<p>
I remember those seeing "concerns" at the time, having followed
discussion as (in general) a lurker on debian-legal, and being pretty
disgusted at the pigheadedness of the objections -- which (as you say)
do not in any way speak for the Debian Project but are often believed in
error to do so, and which often serve to remind observers that any ol'
Asperger's-victim net.random <em>can</em> post to debian-legal and that many do.
(There.  <em>That</em> should nicely balance out Ms. Garlick's courtesy and
diplomacy.  ;-&gt;  )
</p>

<p>
What particularly disgusted me was the biggest complaint, which
concerned the trademark disclaimer at the bottom of the 2.5 licence
pages -- which was not, itself, part of the licence.  It said, in part:
</p>

<pre>
   Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the
   Work is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark
   "Creative Commons" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons
   without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use
   will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark
   usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made
   available upon request from time to time.
</pre>

<p>
Various contributors to debian-legal claimed that this disclaimer
rendered Attribution 2.5 and Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 non-free,
showing utter cluelessness about the realities and nature of trademark
law:  They demanded that CC alter the page to eliminate the suggestion
of compliance with a trademark policy.  Of course, they <em>should</em> have
twigged to what "the limited purpose of indicating to the public that
the Work is licensed under the CCPL" refers to:  It's a rights grant
exactly sufficient to the needs of the licence, and ensures that CC's
trademark ownership would not be an obstacle.
</p>

<p>
Other debian-legal objections to the CC 2.5 variants were, in my
opinion, similarly deficient in clue (except for those to the anti-TPM 
clauses, which Garlick discusses at length).   Given that I'm a longtime
Debian sysadmin, that clue deficiency rather annoyed me at the time.
It's good that the 3.0 variants have placated the critics, anyway, even
though, in my view, in general the changes have constituted textual
workarounds to critics' inability to understand real-world trademark and
copyright law in context.
</p>
