<font color="green"> Software Patents </font></h3>
<p>
The proposed European Union directive on the patentability
of computer-implemented inventions (software patents
directive) is still in more or less the same limbo it was in
when last discussed here in November.  As mentioned in
November, Poland has expressed serious reservations about
the proposed measures and
<a href="http://www.heise.de/english/newsticker/news/55474">
has blocked the European Council of Ministers</a>
from adopting the relatively pro-patent proposal
currently before it.  This would have have occurred, for
reasons of expediency, at a 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/24/software_patent_poland/">
meeting of the Council of Agriculture and Fisheries</a>.
<P>
Tom Chance, writing at <a href="http://lwn.net/">LWN</a>,
has given 
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/121169/">
a clear and useful overview</a>
of how these developments fit within the decision making
structure of the EU.  He also presents a neat pr&eacute;cis
of the realpolitik which will likely lead to Poland shelving
its objections in order to achieve agreement on matters
closer to its economic self-interest.  Should this happen,
meaning the measure is adopted by the Council, it could
again be rejected by a Parliament keen to reinstate its
original amendments.  However, under the relevant voting
rules this would require two thirds of all MEPs to vote
accordingly.  This is unlikely to occur.
<P>
Parliamentarians, and citizens, concerned about the adoption
of this controversial directive have
<a href="http://www.ffii.org/~jmaebe/reso/resolution_55_4.pdf">
called for the entire process to be restarted from
scratch</a>.  Since the processing of this directive has now
spanned a European Parliament election, 
<a href="http://www.heise.de/english/newsticker/news/54947">
there are grounds for this to occur</a>
under the auspices of 
<a href="http://www2.europarl.eu.int/omk/sipade2?SAME_LEVEL=1&LEVEL=1&NAV=X&HNAV=Y&DETAIL=&PUBREF=-//EP//TEXT+RULES-EP+20040720+RULE-055+DOC+XML+V0//EN">
Rule 55 of the Rules of Procedure of the European
Parliament</a>.  However, it is likely that many Eurocrats
will be loath to restart the legislative process given that
this would open the EU institutions to accusations of
inefficiency and indecisiveness.
<P>
As we approach the time when decisions on the future of this
directive will be made, many individuals and organisations
are attempting to raise their political representatives'
awareness of these matters.  Although it is valuable in this
process to achieve some understanding of the issues and
consequences of the proposed policy, it is perhaps even more
useful to impress on elected representatives that they will
be called to account in their own countries for their voting
and policy in Europe.
