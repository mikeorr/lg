<h1>Shelling your Linux box with Festival</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/john.html">Maxin B. John</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>Do you want a bit more "humanized" version of your computer? If
you are ready for this adventure, all that you need is a computer
with Linux operating system and a little bit of time to download
and install the required programs. Now let us have some fun with
bash and Festival TTS (<u>T</u>ext <u>T</u>o <u>S</u>peech)
software.</p>

<h3>My setup</h3>

<p>I am using a Pentium 4 (1.6 GHz) machine with 128 MB of RAM and
Redhat Linux 9 installed. The system has an onboard soundcard,
which is quite sufficient for this venture. 
<!-- 20050501 dsrich - Details? ALSA or OSS - What comes with
RH9 and how is it installed? -->
If you want some privacy with your system, I would also recommend a
pair of headphones.</p>

<h3>Software installation</h3>

<p>The software that we are going to use is the Festival speech
synthesis system &mdash; a Text to Speech program developed by the
University of Edinburgh. The power of shell scripting can harness
the full potential of the Festival program. Festival comes bundled
with Redhat 9 and Fedora distributions. If you don't have it
installed, you can download it from <a href=
"http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/downloads/festival/1.95/">http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/downloads/festival/1.95/</a>
or install from its rpm package using the usual rpm command.</p>

<h3>Let's begin</h3>

<p>Just like every C language book begins, let us start with a
"Hello World" program. For this type</p>

<pre>
echo  "Hello World"| festival --tts 
</pre>

<p>at the command prompt. If everything is working, we should hear
"Hello World" through the speakers.</p>

<h3>The "Salute" Program</h3>

<p>Now let's write a script to play something like "Good morning
Sir" whenever we log on to the system. The sound output will
dynamically change based on the login time. The shell script goes
like this:</p>

<pre class="code">

#!/bin/bash

dat=`date +%H`
morning=12
afternoon=15
evening=24

if [ $dat -le $morning ] 
then
        echo "Good morning sir" |festival --tts

elif [ $dat -gt $morning ] &amp;&amp; [ $dat -le $afternoon ]
then
        echo "Good afternoon sir"|festival --tts

elif [ $dat -gt $afternoon ] &amp;&amp; [ $dat -le $evening ]
then
        echo "Good evening sir"|festival --tts
fi

</pre>

<p>Save this file as <code>salute.sh</code> in your home directory,
then edit <code>.bash_profile</code> in your home directory and add
<code>. ~/salute.sh</code> to it. 
<!-- 20050501 dsrich - Deleted "If you log in as root, write /root/salute.sh in your
.bash_profile file."  This sort of misbehavior should not be encouraged! -->
Now whenever you login to your system, you will hear the "sweet
salute."</p>

<h3>Create a "Virtual Personal Assistant" with cron</h3>

<p>Festival can be used along with the cron to create a personal
assistant who reminds you about your appointments. Cron is used to
schedule programs in Linux. If it is not already running, start the
cron deamon by running <code>service crond start</code> as root.
Now create your sound alerts &mdash; put the following lines into
tea.sh in your home directory:</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
echo  "Don't forget to drink tea at 6.30 "| festival --tts
</pre>

<p>Now schedule this as a job in the cron with specified date and
time. To remind you of this every day at 6.30 P.M , create a file
and name it <code>test</code>. In it insert the line given
below</p>

<pre>
30 18 * * *  sh ~/tea.sh
</pre>

<p>and run the command</p>

<pre>
crontab test
</pre>

<p>to schedule the event. To check that the job is correctly
scheduled, run <code>crontab -l</code>. The system will speak the
message at the specified time. You could even program your parents
PC to wish them happy birthday and surprise them.</p>

<h3>Get really hot news from BBC World website</h3>

<p>Curious to know what is happening around the world? You can
create a News reader to fetch the hot news from the BBC world
website and read it for you. For this purpose, we are going to use
the RSS feed of that website.</p>

<p>Really Simple Syndication (RSS) is a technology for sharing
information on the web. It simple and well-established XML format
used to syndicate headlines. Once a website creates an RSS file
they have created a means to allow others to retrieve their
headlines. Popular news sites like Yahoo!, BBC News, The New York
Times along with tens of thousands of personal blogs and
independant media sites all publish RSS feeds that we can use.</p>

<p>This shell script will fetch the RSS feed from the BBC World
website and then process its headlines and contents. The output is
then piped to the Festival program so we can hear the hottest news
happening around the world.</p>

<pre class="code">

#!/bin/sh
#Shell script to fetch and read the hottest news from BBC world using Festival
                                                                                                 
#Here we specify the url
url="http://news.bbc.co.uk/rss/newsonline_uk_edition/world/rss.xml"
                                                                                                 
#specify the proxyserver here, if you have one
proxy="151.8.18.40:6588"
                                                                                                 
headarg="-10"  # default is five headline, change it to increase the no of feeds
                                                                                               
#specify the proxy with -x option in curl program, if you
#don't use one, then remove the '-x "$proxy"' part
curl --silent -x "$proxy" "$url" | grep -E '(title&gt;|description&gt;)' | \
  sed -n '4,$p' | \
  sed -e 's/&lt;title&gt;//' -e 's/&lt;\/title&gt;//' -e 's/&lt;description&gt;/   /' \
      -e 's/&lt;\/description&gt;//' | \
         
#Here we pump the output to Festival
   head $headarg | fmt|festival --tts
exit 0
</pre>

<p>Save the code as <code>rss.sh</code> and run it as</p>

<pre>
sh rss.sh
</pre>

<p>Make sure that you are connected to internet before running this code,
since the <code>curl</code> program needs to contact the bbcworld website
and fetch the contents.</p>

<h3>The god of small things</h3>

<p>Sometimes I wish I could hire somebody to read me books or
boring man pages. Nowadays I don't read man pages &mdash; I just
listen to them! For example, to hear the man page of cron:</p>

<pre>
man cron | festival --tts  
</pre>

<p>Curious to know the name of people logged on to your system?</p>

<pre>
 who | awk " print {$1};"| festival --tts

</pre>

<p>There are lots of things you can have read to you - give them a
try!</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The power of Festival combined with shell scripting is huge
&mdash; the sky is the limit.</p>

<p>I haven't discussed the theory behind the text to speech as it
is out of the scope of this article. If you are curious, visit
