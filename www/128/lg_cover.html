<h3>Ride the X11 Bus</h3>

<p>This one's inspired by Tavis Ormandy of <em>#fvwm</em> on freenode, realising that one of 
his nearby bus lines to Uni really <strong>is</strong> the <a
  href="http://edulinux.homeunix.org/busx11.html">X11 bus</a>. He took a pic
to share - I asked him what he thought of my silly idea - the rest, as they
say, is history. </p>

<p>You can't really see who's the driver, but hey, most people don't care 
what the Window Manager is anyway, as long as the keyboard works.</p>

<b>Xteddy</b> - a Gund "Tender Teddy" - was born in 1983, fell in love with
<a href="http://www.itn.liu.se/~stegu/xteddy/">Stegu's</a> monitor in the
90's sometime, and since 1998 or so has been faithfully using Unix, though
he has been seen <a
href="http://www.windowsmarketplace.com/results.aspx?bCatID=215&amp;av=14-65848">on
a Windows system</a> now and then and even <a
href="http://www.aquafiles.com/cgi-bin/aquafiles/jump.cgi?ID=330">with a
Macintosh</a> once in a while.  Lately he has been hanging out a lot in
#fvwm on freenode, baking cookies, memorizing people's screenshots so as
to be helpful, and indulging in a mocha now and then.  The regulars there 
call him a little hug daemon - a ready source of hugs for all processes.
Our Weekend Mechanic is one of his biggest fans.
</em>

<p>Our regular readers may recall that Xteddy featured in our second cover
art picture over a year ago (back in <a href="../111/lg_cover.html">issue
111</a>). His good pal <a href="../111/misc/cover/bear-mini.png">bear</a>
has also stood in for him on occasion.</p>

fleshing out bug reports, and when he really gets into gear, polishing his
shiny white taskbar.  He and his girlfriend plan to visit Kiagara Falls
sometime later this year, and enjoy the purple mists.

<p>For the uninitiated, "Kiagara Falls" is one of the finer wallpapers in
the KDE collection.  Consider taking a look at <a href="http://kde-look.org"

Heather got started in computing before she quite got started learning
English.  By 8 she was a happy programmer, by 15 the system administrator
for the home... Dad had finally broken down and gotten one of those personal
computers, only to find it needed regular care and feeding like any other
pet.  Except it wasn't a Pet: it was one of those brands we find most 
everywhere today...  

<P> Heather is a hardware agnostic, but has spent more hours as a tech in
Windows related tech support than most people have spent with their computers.
(Got the pin, got the Jacket, got about a zillion T-shirts.)  When she
discovered Linux in 1993, it wasn't long before the home systems ran Linux
regardless of what was in use at work.

<P> By 1995 she was training others in using Linux - and in charge of all the 
"strange systems" at a (then) 90 million dollar company.  Moving onwards, it's
safe to say, Linux has been an excellent companion and breadwinner... She 
took over the HTML editing for "The Answer Guy" in issue 28.

<P> Here's an autobiographical filksong she wrote called
<A HREF="../issue67/misc/tag/filksong-programmers-daughter.txt">The Programmer's Daughter</A>.
