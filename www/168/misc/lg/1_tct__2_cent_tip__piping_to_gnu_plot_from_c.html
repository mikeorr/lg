Hello TAG:
</p>

<p>
Can this be a possible 2-cent tip?
</p>


<p>
Couple of things first up:
</p>

<p>
    * GNU plot supports piping, So, echo "plot sin(x)" | gnuplot will
plot the sin(x) function.
</p>

<p>
    * However, the plot disappears even before you could see it. For
that echo "plot sin(x)" | gnuplot -persist , is useful. It persists
the GNU plot main window
</p>

<p>
The usefulness of the second point is that, if you have a "pipe
descriptor" describing a pipe to the open GNU plot instance , you can
plot more plots on the first plot, without opening a new GNU plot
instance. We shall be using this idea in our code.
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#define GNUPLOT "gnuplot -persist"
 
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
        FILE *gp;
        gp = popen(GNUPLOT,"w"); /* 'gp' is the pipe descriptor */
        if (gp==NULL)
           {
             printf("Error opening pipe to GNU plot. Check if you have it! \n");
             exit(0);
           }
 
        fprintf(gp, "set samples 2000\n");
        fprintf(gp, "plot abs(sin(x))\n");
        fprintf(gp, "rep abs(cos(x))\n");
        fclose(gp);
 
return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
The above code will produce a comparative plot of absolute value of
sin(x) and cos(x) on the same plot.  The popen function call is
documented at <a href='http://www.opengroup.org/pubs/online/7908799/xsh/popen.html'>http://www.opengroup.org/pubs/online/7908799/xsh/popen.html</a>.
This code/idea should work on GCC and Linux and any other language and
OS that supports piping.
</p>

<p>
Utility: If you have a application which is continuously generating
some data, which you will finally plot, then you can plot the data for
every new set of data- that gives a nice visualization about how the
data is changing with the iterations of your application. This is a
perfect way to demonstrate convergence to the best solutions in
Evolutionary Algorithms, such as Genetic Algorithms.
</p>

<p>
Best,
Amit

Or just use a named FIFO at the shell:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
mkfifo /tmp/gnuplot
while :; do (gnuplot -persist) &lt; /tmp/gnuplot; done
</pre>

<p>
Then you need only do:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
echo "plot sin(x)" &gt; /tmp/gnuplot
</pre>

<p>
... for as many times as you like.  And as it's at the shell, you could even
use a heredoc, etc.

Cool.  Thanks for adding to it!
