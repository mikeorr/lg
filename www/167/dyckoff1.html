<h1>Away Mission - SecureWorld Expos</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>

<p>
The SecureWorld Expo series of regional conferences has become an
annual event in many parts of the US. SecureWorld aims to foster
communication between security professionals and technology leaders on
issues of best practices, and to encourage a public/private
partnership with government. These are vest-pocket security
conferences, with many local speakers and a small vendor expo.  They
are held in multiple regions, one or two a month, organized by
SecureWorldExpo.com in Portland, OR.
</p>

<p>
2009's Secure World was the fourth one held in the Bay Area.
The first SecureWorld Expo was held in Seattle in 2001.
</p>

<p>
Close to 50% of conference attendees, not the expo attendees, hold a
CISSP certification or a similar professional security credential.
</p>

<p>
The current list has 9 Expos in the spring and fall, and they will add
another region to their calendar later this year:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Bay Area, September 16 - 17, 2009
<li>Detroit, September 29 - 30, 2009
<li>Seattle, October 28 - 29, 2009
<li>Dallas, November 4 - 5, 2009
<li>Houston, February 10 - 11, 2010
<li>Boston, March 23 - 24, 2010
<li>Atlanta, April 27 - 28, 2010
<li>Philadelphia, May 12 - 13, 2010
<li>Washington, D.C., April 13 - 14, 2010
</ul>

<p>
The event is structured into keynotes, presentation sessions and
panels, invitation-only sessions (see pricing section below), and Expo
breaks with the afternoon snacks.  Here are links to the agendas for
2008 and 2009:
</p>

<p>
2008: <a href="http://secureworldexpo.com/events/conference-agenda.php?id=255">http://secureworldexpo.com/events/conference-agenda.php?id=255</a><br>
2009: <a href="http://secureworldexpo.com/events/conference-agenda.php?id=269">http://secureworldexpo.com/events/conference-agenda.php?id=269</a>
</p>

<p>
These agendas have a good mix of topics, and some very qualified
speakers. Unfortunately, presentation materials are hard to come by.
The organizers at the conference say that presenters are not required
to post their slides. They also do not commit to a schedule of
posting materials, but say that attendees will eventually get an
e-mail with the location of those materials they have.  Although I
could find several conference e-mail reminders from 2008, I did not
find an e-mail with info on the 2008 conference slides.  That was
disappointing.
</p>

<p>
I actually wrote to JoAnna Cheshire, the Director of Content at Secure
World Expos to get the scoop on this. She explained: "Due to our
privacy policy with our speakers, we do not post any of the archived
slides. If an attendee is interested in a slide presentation, we
encourage them to e-mail us, and we will contact the presenter directly
to obtain the slides for them. It is up to each individual presenter
whether or not to provide the requested slides."
</p>

<p>
I did like the presentation this year on WiFi vulnerabilities and
hacker/cracker attacks.  It was actually titled "What hackers know
that you don't" and presented by Matt Siddhu of Motorola's AirDefense
group (purchased by Motorola in the past year), and I suspect you
could e-mail him for a copy or search the AirDefense web site.
</p>

<p>
Siddhu gave a good summary of the problems with wireless access
points, especially rogue APs with makeshift directional antennas
having ranges of 100s to 1000s of feet. He also included a good
summary of rogue AP detection. This includes traffic injection, SNMP
look-up, and RF fingerprinting. A security professional may need to
use a combination of wired, wireless, and forensic analysis plus the
historical record of traffic when detecting rogue traffic. He
recommended the use of wireless ACLs for both inside and outside
access, including the possibility of jamming specific rogue APs with
TCP resets and also jamming clients who use outside APs.
</p>

<p>
The closing session was a presentation by FBI Cyber Division
Special Agent John Bennett on the work of Federal agencies in
opposing cyber-crime.  Federal agencies opposing cyber-crime and
terrorism include the FBI, the Secret Service, ICE, and Inspectors
General at varied agencies like NASA.
</p>

<p>
Bennett discussed botnets and national security attacks by state actors.
(He was sorry that his slides could not be released without filling out
dozens of forms.) He said that new targets now include smaller financial
institutions and law firms that generally hold large amounts of
confidential information in unsecured and unencrypted states.
</p>

<p>
Beside the normal attack vector list that includes cross-site
scripting (XSS) and SQL injection, Bennett noted an increased use of
steganography (hiding data in data), which is being seen more on VOIP
streams as a means of leaking data invisibly.
</p>

<p>
2009's Bay Area event was significantly smaller than 2008's, both in
attendance and in vendor participation.  There also were fewer
folks at the end of expo prize drawings - the so-called "Dash for
Prizes" - during the afternoon break.
</p>

<p>
I saw fewer than 200 people at the lunch and AM keynotes. I think
there were closer to 300 at the 2008 event.  With 8 vendors and 10
prize items, chances seemed fairly good. So why didn't I win
something?
</p>

<p>
As in 2008, there were several invitation-only sessions, some by
professional associations or for industry verticals. In fact, local
ISSA and Infragard chapters were local partners and held meetings.
The sessions for "standard" attendees were fewer this year, and didn't
run as late in the day.
</p>

<p>
The conference was still priced below $300 - in fact, $245 this year and
$195 last year - except for "SecureWorld +" attendees, who had more
in-depth sessions during both days' mornings. "SecureWorld +" attendees
could go to the professional group events, and were charged $695 both
this year and last year.  They also could also receive 16 CPE credits.
</p>

<p>
There was a discount code sent by e-mail for $200 off the "plus" rate,
making it $495.  In any case, these are bargain conferences,
especially considering the hot lunch buffets included.
</p>

<p>
As I've said, this is a small conference at a small price, so you have
to accept the lack of certain amenities. To hold down costs, there are
no conference bags, no CDs of presentation slides,  and... no
conference WiFi.
</p>

<p>
I think every other conference I've attended at the Santa Clara
Convention Center has had free WiFi, and that goes back over a decade.
Instead, there was a stack of 2"x4" papers explaining how to
sign-up for a day pass on the paid network. That was $13.95 this year.
</p>

<p>
I also asked JoAnna Cheshire about the WiFi issue and got the
following reply: "We find that the number of attendees who ask for
wi-fi at our conference are a very small percentage, and for us to pay
for WiFi to cover the entire conference would impose a significant
cost on us."
</p>

<p>
I think it would have been better if the daily conference e-mail,
preceding each of the two days of SecureWorld, had mentioned this fact.
I could have printed out a list of nearby WiFi cafes and libraries. So
I had to be resigned to not having an e-mail tether, which isn't all
that bad.  Of course, your situation may differ.
</p>

<p>
In summary, the conference is useful for security professionals, and
should grow again after the economic downturn. I was a bit
disappointed that there was little conference material on
virtualization security, something I expect to change in the future.
Cloud computing security was discussed in a keynote and a panel.
However, if you attend an upcoming Secure World, be prepared to pay for
WiFi or get a cellular card from your cellphone provider.  I'd also
recommend carrying business cards to request copies of any presentations
you may want: They won't be archived after the conferences.
