Linux Control Panel

<P> <B> 
To: <a href="mailto:ggonzale@ix.netcom.com">ggonzale@ix.netcom.com</a>

</B><p><B>I have recently installed RedHat Linux ver 4.2 on my pc . My problem is
that I cannot get the control-panel to work when I run startx or XDM .
The panel comes up but I am unable to activiate any buttons in
control-panel . I don't know what I did wrong or what to check ! Please
help...

</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	Are you running it as root?
	Are there any interesting error messages in /var/log/messages?
	Are there any interesteing error messages back on the text
	console from which you ran "startx" (you can switch out
	of XFree86 with {Ctrl}+{Alt}+{Fx} -- where {Fx} is the 
	function key that corresponds to any of you other virtual
	consoles).  Are you sure you installed the Python and
	related libraries (last I heard all of the Red Hat GUI
	control panel stuff is written in Python).

<p>	As I've said several times -- I'm not a Red Hat specialist
	(although that is what I'm running here at the moment) and
	I barely use X (since I vastly prefer old fashion text mode).

<p>	Have they ever gotten a support line running that can 
	answer questions that are specific to their code?  (Hey!
	I wouldn't even object to a paid support line -- if it 
	was good).

<P><B><img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
 
Thank you for responding to my question I will look into the areas
you suggested . However I have one other question that is how would I
activate my modem from a Linux command line? I thought I needed the
xwindow to do that in the first place.

</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">


	One of the virtues of Unix is that you don't need X Windows
	to do anything except run X applications -- there are other
	ways to access graphics (SVGALib, MGR) use your mouse (GPM)
	do cut and paste (GPM/select, 'screen'), provide task/session
	switching (virtual consoles, and 'screen'), do screen management
	('splitvt', emacs) etc.

<p>	In answer to your question regarding modems:

	There are a number of programs that are included with the 
	typical Linux distribution that may use your modem: 

 		<p>pppd is the PPP daemon -- it usually uses the 'chat' 
		command to talk to the modem.

		<p>minicom is a vaguely Telix like ncurses terminal emulation
		package (Telix is a popular shareware MS-DOS program).  
		It provides a fullscreen, color interface.

		<p>'cu' is a "call utility" usually associated with UUCP.
		It uses the UUCP configuration files for information 
		about your modem -- if you have those configured.  It's
		a very limited communications package -- that's only
		virtue is that it is small.

		<p>UUCP is a suite of programs -- of which the uucico
		program actually talks to the modem.  You almost certainly
		are not planning on using this.  However UUCP was (and
		still is) used as a mail, file, and netnews transport
		protocol for years before TCP/IP existed.  I still use it
		for my mail.

		<p>C-Kermit is a communications package from Columbia 
		University.  You can fetch it freely -- but it can't be
		included with Linux (or other) CD-ROM collections of 
		software due to it's licensing model.  If you decide you 
		like it you should buy a copy of the C-Kermit book by
		Frank da Cruz (the program's principal architect and 
		head of the project since it's foundation).

	<p>	C-Kermit is also a scripting language and can be used
		as a telnet or rlogin client, and Kermit is a file
		transfer protocol which can be used by C-Kermit over 
		any communications channel that it can establish.  I 
		wrote an article for SysAdmin Magazine on the subject
		just a couple of months ago.

	<p>	There are other program that access your modem if 
		you want to use them, There's a SLIP package which
		usually controls the modem via 'dip' -- there's 
		a variety of different "getty" implementations which
		"Get a tty" (terminal) so that you can log in from a 
		terminal, or another system running a terminal package.

	<p>	I use mgetty which not only allows incoming dial-up
		data connections but adds support for FAX and even
		voice/DTMF with some modems.  That package also includes
		"sendfax" -- a program for outgoing faxes. efax is 
		another package for support FAXes under Linux.

<p>	Judging  from your earlier    question regarding the  Red  Hat
	Control   Panel  I suspect  that   you're  just interested  in
	configuring   your system  for  PPP  access  to  your Internet
	service provider (ISP).  There is a script floating around (on
	http://sunsite.unc.edu somewhere)  called 'pppsetup'.  I think
	this will allow  you to setup   your PPP configuration  from a
	text  console  (I used  plain    old 'vi'  and  made  my   own
	configuration files -- so I've  never used this -- though I've
	seen it recommended many times).

<p>	There are several HOW-TO's on configuring PPP (and SLIP) which
	can be found at <a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/">http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO</a> Look for the
	ones that refer to "PPP" and "ISP."

<p>	Hope all of that helps.

</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	This new information about your situation suggests two
	possibilities:

<p>		1)	Your HD is bad -- possibly it has some bad
			sectors that the drive electronics haven't
			mapped out, or possibly it's something more 
			subtle.

<p>		2)	Your controller (IDE) is incompatible with your
			HD and/or the combination of your HD and CD drive. 
			

<p>	Some notes:

<p>	Any IDE drive that's over 540Mb requires an EIDE (enhanced IDE)
	controller/BIOS.  There have been cases where specific IDE 
	devices weren't compatible with one another -- where a particular
	combination of devices couldn't share the same IDE channel.

<p>	So, try getting a new EIDE controller and disabling the 
	interface on the motherboard (or configuring the new on as
	a "secondary" IDE channel.  Try running  the two devices on the
	new EIDE controller if you can get it installed as the primary
	(but don't blindly trust the motherboard documentation -- I've
	heard that some of the "disable me" settings on some boards just
	don't work). Then try running the CD-ROM drive and the hard disk
	on separate channels (controllers).

<p>	If you can get a copy of Spinrite or the Norton Utilities for 
	DOS then you might install a small DOS partition and run that on
	your Fireball.  It might be able to map out any bad sectors.

<p>	If you get a new controller (which will be less expensive then 
	buying either of the software packages I just mentioned) I'd 
	try a a QuickPath Portfolio or a GSI brand multi-funtion card with 
	4 high speed (16550 UART) serial ports.  The QuickPath is an ISA
	card (rather than taking up one of your PCI slots for a set of 
	relatively slow interfaces) and is what I'm using in a couple of 
	my machines here.  It combines floppy, four serial, two parallel, 
	two IDE channels and a game port (for 13 devices in all).

<p>	Hope that helps.  Unfortunately the diversity and cheapness
	of PC hardware results in a diversity of inexplicable 
	incompatibilities and a common "cheapness" in quality that's
	imposed by the competition.  So, as much as I hate to recommend
	"black magic" experiments in new hardware -- it's frequently the
	most effective approach.

No, disk fragmentaion is a particular problem of the DOS FAT file system

X-Windows is Crashing

From: Gerramie Dinsel<a href="mailto:gerr@weaveworld.unix.net">gerr@weaveworld.unix.net</a>

 
</B><p><B>Hello. I am searching all over for an answer or a pointer to this
problem:

</B><p><B>I upgraded my memory from 18 megs to 48. Now, X-Windows crashes on me
when I load FVWM2.. Odd, because XDM loads fine and will sit there,
waiting, without crashing for as long as you want. Also, console mode
works wonderfully...

</B><p><B>Can you offer any help?
Gerramie Dinsel

</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	
	The first guess might be that the new memory is bad --
	and that you normal (console) usage -- and the overhead of 
	xdm just doesn't "land" on the bad chips.

<p>	One way to test this would be to do something from
	console mode that will use *a lot* of memory.  make's
	-j switch (to parallelize as many gcc processes as 
	memory allows) is a good way to test for this sort
	of thing.  Just make a new kernel (no need to even to
	an install of it -- just the make is fine).

<p>	If that runs O.K. than we have linked the problem 
	X -- possibly to any graphical use of the card beyond
	xdm's.  So we try to run X with no window manager and
	a minimal configuration file (no setting of special 
	root images like xli, xloadimage, or xsetroot, no 
	-16bpp or any of that).  

<p>	It could be that your video card uses a region of 
	address space (a video frame buffer).  Look carefully
	in the configuration settings, or call the manufacturer's
	tech support.  That's the most likely problem.

<p>	If you have access to another, simpler video card -- try swapping
	it in and seeing if that helps.  If it does than you need to
	reconfigure that video card or use one that's better behaved.

<p>	If that doesn't help then it's just anyone's guess what's
	happening.  Try rearranging the adapters in your card cage -- it
	may be that the video card is emanating some noise or crosstalk
	that's affecting your RAM.  Re-arranging adapters used to be
	a time honored sport among PC technicians.  I think it's more
	rare in the PCI era -- but you don't even mention what sort of
	bus your using -- and I have no information about your hardware.
	Besides -- it can't hurt.

<p>	If it still doesn't work try switching to 32Mb.  This might 
	be some weird chipset bug on your amount of RAM.  More systems
	work with 16 or 32Mb of RAM than with 24 or 48Mb.

<p>	There are a plethora of parameters you can pass to the 
	kernel for excluding specific memory address ranges from 
	its use.  They might help -- but I'd hate to have to experiment
	with them.

	You're probably having problems with the shared libraries
	or devices that are typically required by the ls command.
	Some version of ls require that you have a /dev/null and/or
	a /dev/tcp in order to work properly.  Most versions of ls
	require some shared libraries and all of them require the
	existence of some of /etc/passwd and /etc/group files (even

<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	You use the "masquerade" feature in your local sendmail
	configuration.  I recommend that you use the m4 macro
	package to reate a new sendmail configuration.

<p>	First copy the old configuration. I like to use RCS --
	the revision control system to track changes to my 
	configuration files.  Here's how you'd do that:

<p>	(As root)
<pre>		# cd /etc
		# mkdir RCS		
			(unless you already have one)
		# ci sendmail.cf	
			(checks the cf file into the RCS directory)
		# co -l sendmail.cf
			(checks it back out, locked for editing)
</pre>
<p>	Now you want to create a sendmail "mc" file.  This is a file
	that uses sendmail specific macros -- which is then processed
	by the m4 program to generate the full sendmail.cf.  A typical
	sendmail.cf is over a 1000 lines long -- a typical "mc" file
	is less than 20.

<p>	Under my Red Hat installation the sample "mc" files are located
	in /usr/lib/sendmail-cf/cf/.  You can put yours there, or
	you might use /usr/local/lib/sendmail (and perhaps add a symlink
	under the other path).  This helps maintain the separation between
	your local changes and the distribution's files "as shipped."

<p>	I name my "mc" files after my hostnames -- so mine is "antares.mc."
	It looks like this:
<pre>
divert(-1)
include(`../m4/cf.m4')
VERSIONID(`@(#)antares.uucp.mc	.9 (JTD) 8/11/95')
OSTYPE(`linux')

FEATURE(nodns)
FEATURE(nocanonify)
FEATURE(mailertable)
FEATURE(local_procmail)
FEATURE(allmasquerade)
FEATURE(always_add_domain)
FEATURE(masquerade_envelope)

MAILER(local)
MAILER(smtp)
MAILER(uucp)

MASQUERADE_AS(starshine.org)
SITECONFIG(uucp.antares, starshine.org, U)

define(`UUCP_RELAY', a2i)
define(`UUCPNAME', starshine)
define(`UUCPNODES', a2i)
define(`RELAY_HOST', a2i)
define(`RELAY_MAILER',uucp)
define(`SMART_HOST', uucp-dom:mailer)
define(`PSEUDONYMS', starshine|antares|antares.starshine.org|starshine.org)
undefine(`BITNET_RELAY')
</pre>

<p>	I've seen some of these that end each line with a 'dnl' --
	which is a macro to "do newline" -- I don't bother with that.

<p>	You'll want to ignore all the UUCP references and my 
	SITECONFIG line (mine is also a UUCP reference -- so yours
	will be different -- preserve whatever is in the samples that
	mathc your current configuration).

<p>	What your interested in here is the various "masquerade" lines.
	Now you'd just 'cd' to the directory where you've created this
	"mc" file and issue a command like:

	<pre>	m4 < $MYFILE > /etc/sendmail.cf
</pre>
<p>	(where you replace $MYFILE with whatever you named your "mc"
	file, of course).

<p>	It's also possible to to simply add a line like:

<pre>DMisp.com</pre>

<p>	... directly to your /etc/sendmail.cf.
	DM "defines masquerading" to be for "isp.com" (from your
	earlier example).  This is easier, on the one hand --
	but learning the m4 configuration method will serve you 
	well if you ever have to do upgrades to your sendmail --
	and it's a valuable skill if you ever have to administer
	Unix systems as (or as part of) your work.

<p>	There are a variety of HOWTO's on configuring your mail
	to work well with your ISP.  I don't have my PPP connection
	up at the moment -- but you should search the SSC web site
	(http://www.ssc.com) for the the HOWTO archive and look for
	the strings "ISP" and "mail."

</B><p><B>First I'd like express my gratitude for your great work on the Linux

But for the Linux/Unix Emulator, I think you're somehow wrong. Actually
there do exist at least one such product as far as I know. When I was
staying in Japan, I've learned there're quite some people there use a
software called BOW (namely BSD on Windows ), which is a BSD emulator for
Windows. Check out <a href="http://www.ascii.co.jp/pb/superascii/bow">http://www.ascii.co.jp/superascii/bow</a> if you do know
Japanese.  In short, this is a BSD kernel emulator for 4.4BSD-Lite based
BSD Unix program. It's said most BSD binaries (x86 certainly,character
mode applications only, no X, no debuggers like gdb) can be run
unmodified.

	Actually, there has been quite a bit of work on supporting
	Unix under NT.  Cygnus Support (http://www.cygnus.com) has

<a href="http://nentug.org/unix-to-nt/">UNIX to NT Resource Center</a>

</B><p><B>	There was also a paper presented at the Anaheim USENIX

<ul>
        <li>Title: Porting UNIX to Windows NT

</B><p><B>The advantages are, you have the rich development environment from Unix,
and the nice( ? ) UI from Windows as well as lots of Windows applications
around all at the same time. It's said BOW Version 1.5 which is Windows95

	Again, in the article to which you refer I was asking
	what the original person was asking for.  Many Unix packages
	have been ported to NT, Windows '95, and DOS (emacs, perl,
	awk, most of the simple commands like grep, cp, find, and 
	a couple of shells: Korn, bash) -- and it would certainly be
	possible to host some binaries under (ELF, iBCS).

LILO Concerns
</h3>
<P> <B> 

Date: Sun, 10 Aug 1997 03:50:35 -0700<br>
From: Tibs <a href="mailto:tjf1@acpub.duke.edu">tjf1@acpub.duke.edu</a><br>

</B><p><B>I have been looking all over for an answer to my linux question...nobody 
seems able to help so I thought I'd ask you (liked the LG web stuff very 
much).  I am about to take the plunge and install linux but I am 
concerned about how LILO will work on my system.  I have two IDE drives 
on my system.  The first is 1 gig and I have DOS, Win95, etc. on it and 
that's what I boot to.  The second is divided into two 1.5 gig 
partitions, and 1 500 meg partition.  I planned on putting linux on that 
last 500 meg partition.  


</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	First:  you'll want to learn how to use paragraphs.
	Break your question down into short steps so we can 
	read it (particularly when we're doing the reading at
	3:30 in the morning after hacking all day)

<P><B><img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">

....   The problem is that in order for my computer to 
recognize the full 3.5 gig capacity of the second hard drive, the hard 
drive installation floppy (it's a Maxtor) installed something called 
EZ-BIOS.  So booting to DOS or Win95 now works and my BIOS recognizes all 
3.5 gigs of the space.  When I boot to a floppy I have to use the EZ-BIOS 
"boot to a:" option otherwise I can only access the first partition on 
the second drive.  So when I install linux and add LILO, will LILO start 
doing stuff after the EZ-BIOS stuff loads?  If so then it is not a 
problem but if LILO starts before EZ-BIOS does it's thing, then I don't 
think I'll be able to access my 500 meg partition.  And since that's 
wherelinux would be, that would be a bit of a problem.


</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	You're using an alternative master boot program which 
	will be incompatible with any other boot software. 

<p>	You should use LOADLIN and forget all about LILO.

<p>	I've written about LOADLIN several times in this column --
	so please look back through some of the pack issues for details.
<P><B><img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">

So I guess my question would be:
1. do you know anything about this EZ-BIOS stuff and it's compatibility 
with linux (the Maxtor people aren't helping with linux questions)


</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	The EZ-BIOS and the old Ontrack Disk Manager and similar
	drivers were originally created to allow DOS to see larger
	partitions (which they did by hooking into the BIOS Int 13H
	disk access routines before DOS was loaded -- by replacing the
	MBR).  They have always been a bad idea.

<p>	Now that DOS supports partitions larger than 32Mb these
	programs have a different purpose -- to allow older 
	systems to see IDE drives that are larger than 512Mb.
	The BIOS interface only supports a maximum of 1024 cylinders
	of up to 64 sectors each.  A typical drive is less than 16 heads.
	This "geometry" gives a maximum of about 528Mb.  It's possible
	to "lie" to some BIOS' and double the number of heads -- or
	even go up do 255 "virtual heads" -- the drive electronics will
	simply translate for you. 

<p>	Essentially this is how SCSI and EIDE drives give you access to
	larger disks (up to about 9Gb).

<p>	Your other alternative is to get an EIDE controller and get
	rid of the non-standard software (sofware which isn't supported 
	under OS that I know of, Linux, any Unix, FreeBSD, NT,
	OS/2 or anything other than DOS).

<B><P><img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">

2.  is there some workaround that would still let me use linux if EZ-BIOS 
would be a problem (like using a boot floppy everytime I wanted to use 
linux, or something like that)

</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	You can probably just use LOADLIN.  However you might have to 
	cook up some weird boot time parameters (you can store them
	in the bathc file that invokes LOADLIN) to tell the kernel what
	the drive geometry really is -- so it doesn't step on anything.

<p>	Here are the two HOWTO documents you want to read:

<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	There is a library function named "crypt" which is technically
	a "hash" rather than a cryptographic function -- it's used to 
	compute the hash of a password for comparison to that which is
	stored in the second field each entry in the /etc/passwd file.

<p>	I've heard that the program named 'crypt' varies from one Unix 
	implementation to another.  I think its currently not included
	in many Linux distributions to the export (U.S. ITAR and related)
	restrictions to which I alluded earlier.  Since many of the 
	companies that produce these distributions are U.S. they would
	have to ensure that their products were for "domestic use" only
	if they were to include this on their CD's and in their FTP sites.

<p>	Here are a few sites I picked off of Yahoo!
	
<a href="http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/FAQ.shtml">International PGP FAQ</a>
<a href="http://www.serve.com/nimrod/pgp.html">Guida Pratica a PGP</a>

<a href="ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/crypto/cryptanalysis/cbw.tar.gz">Cryptographer's
WorkBench</a>.

<p>	There are other strong cryptographic products available 
	internationally for other purposes.  I think the new Linux
	"TCFS" (transparent cryptographic filesystem) is being done
	in Italy.  TCFS is apparently similar to Matt Blaze's research
	on CFS -- it allows a Linux admin to create filesystems that 
	are encrypted in such a away that users can have confidence that
	no other user access their files.  Given its design is should be
	difficult even for the root user to compromise the cryptographic
	integrity of any local user -- and it should be impractical for 
	remote systems.

<p>	Here's some more links for that:

<a href="http://www.globenet.it/~ermmau/tcfs/tcfs-faq.html">TCFA FAQ
v1.7.7</a>

<p>	Come to think of it STEL (a secure telnet) was also done in
	Italy.  Seems that a lot of work on cryptography is coming out
	of your country.  Obviously your government hasn't been 
	interferring in this work.  If you'd like to look at the sources
	for STEL I'd FTP over to ftp://idea.sec.dsi.unimi.it/cert-it/

<p>	Another set of useful cryptographic resources are in Eric A. 
	Young's free implementation of Netscape's SSL (secure sockets 
	layer) specification and a set of related applications 
	(like ssltelnet and sslftp):

Apache 1.2.1

From: Alf Stockton <a href="mailto:stockton@acenet.co.za">stockton@acenet.co.za</a><br>

 
I am playing with Apache 1.2.1 and have it running well except that it
won't run cgi scripts.

If I give the full path in the command line of the browser the CGIs run
fine but the server cannot/does not run these CGIs when I expect it to.
Where can I turn for help? The Apache team don't appear too interested.
I suspect that one of my config files is wrong but don't know enough to
tell which.



</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	I wouldn't necessarily say that the Apache team isn't 
	"interested."  However, they far more interested in 
	providing the software than in answering questions about 
	it.

<p>	It sounds like you don't have your "ScriptAlias" set up
	correctly -- or you're trying to access a CGI script that
	isn't stored in one of the proper "ScriptAlias" directories.

<p>	Here are links to the relevant documentation pages at the 
	Apache site (http://www.apache.org):

<p>	   Apache: Configuration: ScriptAlias

<a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_alias.html#scriptalias">http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_alias.html#scriptalias</a>

<a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html#CGIoutsideScriptAlias">http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html#CGIoutsideScriptAlias</a>

<p>	Another possibility is that you have built it with no CGI
	support.  Apache has many compile-time configuration options
	-- include a large list of "modules" that can ben enabled or
	disabled.  However I'm sure that it would take some work to
	build Apache with no CGI support -- so I think this possibility
	is remote.

</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	I notice that you haven't told me *which version* of Red Hat
	you're working with.  However I've used 3.03, 4.0, 4.1, and
	4.2 -- and I think I remember playing with an earlier one before
	3.03 and I never saw this behavior from gcc.

<p>	I did get it from my original copy of minicom anytime I was
	running in an extended video mode and trying to use the 
	dialer (and not when issuing the same dialing function as
	a direct ATDT command from the terminal window).  In this
	case I suspect there was a bug in the ncurses calls being 
	made by minicom.  In any event I switched to CKermit and 
	forgot all about it.

<p>	In your case the signal 11 (SEGV) is probably not caused
	by curses/ncurses calls.

<p>	Do you have a swap partition or file?  If so, have you tried 
	disabling it (possibly creating a new one temporarily)?  If 
	you have a defect on the disk you could get a SEGV from some
	piece of data/code that gets swapped out, read back in
	(with errors) and subsequently used by the running process.

<p>	If you don't have a swap partition or file you might just be
	running out of RAM completely.  gcc does use up quite a bit
	of memory -- so I'd suggest at least 32Mb virtual memory 
	(RAM + swap) available when running it (you could certainly
	ask the FSF for more specific recommendations -- this is 
	just my unsubstantiated and untested suggestion).

<p>	When you installed, did you let Red Hat's install routine
	perform thorough block checking while it was making filesystems?
	If not, try re-installing and enabling that (in case you hit
	some bad spots on your disk and you have corrupted gcc 
	binaries).

<p>	This is extremely unlikely to be related to your distribution,
	but you could try installing Slackware to see if its gcc
	works on this system -- or you could try booting up in 
	single user mode and just run a few test "make's" from 
	a simple shell line (no emacs M-x shell mode, no X Windows,
	no "integrated dev. environment" nothing else running).

<p>	If you still get SEGV's then, you want to find some other
	sort of memory intensive program to run as a test -- to see
	what else will die.  It may be worth extracting the RAM and
	taking it to a good hardware tester -- and/or removing any
	ethernet cards or unecessary adapters for other tests.

<p>	These sorts of things can be very frustrating to track down
	regardless of OS.  If you have a copy of DOS and an old copy
	of Norton Utilities (version 8 or later) you could boot that
	up and run NDIAGS.EXE.  There are several other diagnostics
	packages that were available before it -- but NU is still my
	personal favorite untill the Linux crowd does up a suite of
	them.  Unfortunately the results of any software diagnostics 
	package aren't definitive -- they can detect trouble -- but 
	they can't "prove" that there isn't any hardware problem.

<p>	I suppose, for some systems, particularly some 386's and
	386SX's, you might also try twiddling the CMOS "wait states"
	settings.  Those used to make a difference -- particularly 
	with earlier generations of "3-chip" SIMM's.  Apparently 
	in the early attempts to use SIMM's with three chips
	(two four bit chips and a parity bit chip) there were some
	slight timing differences between the "signal settling" 
	characteristics -- so the parity bit wouldn't "settle" 
	before the system was trying to read the memory.  This resulted
	in parity errors if the systems were set for "zero wait states"

<p>	(I've never heard of a Pentium system or any system using

<p>	I hope some of this helps.

PPP and Internet MCI
</h3>
<P> <B> 

From: Demosthenes <a href="mailto:radams@capaccess.org">radams@capaccess.org</a><br>
Subject: Re: PPP and InternetMCI 
 
</B><p><B>Hey there, I've been reading through your column from August in the
Linux Gazette, and ran across the gentleman's question regarding GTE's
internet services.

</B><p><B>I'm trying to switch over to MCI from a local ISP, and I'm having some
of the oddest connection problems. I use PAP currently with my local
ISP, and MCI is supposed to use PAP/CHAP (one, the other, or both
:P). I beleive i have everything setup properly, as I don't get any
rejections from PAP/CHAP, but after a few seconds of modem activity
with the server, MCI just hangs up. I did misspell something before,
and got a PAP rejection, and I've got full debugging logs regarding
the connection, but I can't make much sense of them. I know the server
isn't asking for MS-CHAP (chap 80, vs chap 05). It looks like it dies
during the configuration. I'm not sure.

</B><p><B>Do you have any information regarding connecting to InternetMCI via
Linux? MCI tech support is clueless, and I can't even get someone that
knows how their own software works on the phone.

</B><p><B>Any help would be highly appreciated, and I'd be more than glad to
share my debugging logs if you think they will help.

</B><p><B>Thanks again!

	My first impulse is to say "vote with your feet."
	Fire off a polite, assertive, note to their VP of Customer
	Service and go find a Linux/Unix friendly ISP with quality
	tech support (and maybe spend a little more in the process).

<p>	My provider isn't the cheapest -- and isn't even the friendliest
	-- but they understand Unix and they provide quality service 
	(refusing to structure their rates to "compete" with an 
	unreasonable "quality of service" -- i.e. I get few busy signals).

<p>	That bit of non-technical advice aside I'd ask:

		What are your MTU and related parameters?

<p>	You could send the logging output -- but it would probably
	be as incomprehensible to me as it is to you.  I've never
	set up a PAP/CHAP system (yet).  However I'll look at them
	and suggest some experiments.

Enabling Automounter on a Linux Notebook
</h3>
<P> <B> 

From: Dennis Dai <a href="mailto:gqdai@intergate.bc.ca">gqdai@intergate.bc.ca</a><br>

 
</B><p><B>Hi, Jim

</B><p><B>I think I need to ask you for help. My problem is:

</B><p><B>Originally I have a 1.6G HD. Last month I bought a new one (3.2G) in
order to accommodate linux and NT. I placed the swap partition in the
very last part of the new harddisk (it seems that this is a bad idea,
isn't it?) which is hdc8 and initialized it without problem. After a
while, I made a new NTFS partition for NT which resides in front of the
swap partition (I installed NT system on one of my original HD's
partition which is hda7), then I moved some of my data on the new NTFS
partition. But after I booted up to linux, I realized that the swap
partition didn't initialized properly, so I issue a command like this:

</B><pre><B>mkswap /dev/hdc8</pre>

</B><P><B>And this was how I screwed up things. Actually the new NTFS partition
became hdc8, and the original swap partition became hdc9. Now I can't
access the new NTFS partition from NT!
 
</B><p><B>Immediately after I issued that command, I realized that I made a big
mistake so I issued a "free" command and it showed that the swap
partition (which is my NTFS partition) was not used.

</B><p><B>So I think I still have hope to retrieve the data on my NTFS partition.
I know they are still there, just I can't get them out.

</B><p><B>I posted this to linux newsgroups, and received some kind response that
suggested me to use linux fdisk to change the partition type to NT one.
But I did check that, it is still NTFS (actually HPFS under linux
fdisk). Others suggested me to zero out the first 512 byte of that
partition as part of the recovery, but since I am not quite familiar
with that I didn't dare to do that.
 
</B><p><B>So I hope you can get me out of the hole.
Thanks in advance.

	Well, I haven't done regular data recovery for a few
	years (since I left Symantec' Peter Norton Tech Support
	Department).  It's not something that I can do via e-mail
	(or for free) -- and I don't know diddly about the internals
	of NTFS (or HPFS or ext2fs for that matter).

<p>	You best bet, of course, is to have recent backups from
	which you can recover.  I don't know why they were suggesting
	that you blast the boot record (the first 512 bytes of a 
	partition is the "logical boot record" or "superblock" while
	the first 512 bytes of a drive is the "master boot record"
	or MBR).  Perhaps they believe that NT will be able to 
	recover from this.  If I was to do anything with the LBR
	I'd go to a different machine, create a new NTFS partition
	that was indentical in size and configuration to the one you
	think you've damaged, and use a disk editor (or a Linux 
	dd command) to cut and paste that from the other machine onto
	the allegedly damaged partition.

<p>	Before doing much of that I'd suggest do a dump to tape
	of the entire raw device (using 'dd').  This may allow you
	to return to the current state of brokenness after you've 
	made unsuccessful attempts at repair.

<p>	I don't recommend these procedures (disk surgery) unless
	the data on that drive is very important to you (and otherwise
	unreproducable) or you really like playing with hex editors.

<p>	If it's of considerable financial value to you -- I'd suggested
	making a dump tape, extracting the drive from the system and 
	sending it to a data recovery specialist.

	Ultimately this issue of restricting specific classes
	of users to specific services on a system is goes 
	way beyond the particular services you pick.  PAM
	(the pluggable authentication modules) is supposed
	to solve this problem eventually.  That is already 
	included with recent versions of the RedHat distributions
	(and with recent Solaris releases).  However it is 
	still evolving -- so few of us have any idea how to 
	"do it right."  (A fact which leads to an understandable
	lack of confidence in recommending it).

<p>	So, getting back to the original question:  

<p>		What POP daemon supports a user/password
		database that's distinct from the one used
		by other Unix services (/etc/passwd)?

<p>	I've heard the rumor that this can be done in qpopper
	but I'd like to confirm that.  So I go to Yahoo! and
	issue the "+qpopper +account" search and get:

<p>	There is:

<a href="http://www.hdshq.com/fixes/mail_patch/">http://www.hdshg.com/fixes/mail_patch/</a>

<p>	... which is supposed to be a patch to qpopper to 
	allow this.  However I couldn't connect to  and I 
	couldn't find any mirror of it even after several 
	hours of trying.

<p>	I traversed a number of links searching on strings
	like "+pop3 +passwd +passwd +separate" and various
	permuations.  This was the only firm reference I found.

<p>	Another approach would be to create a custom chroot
	environment.  This isn't as hard as it sounds.  The
	hard part is making your binary statically linked or
	including the necessary libraries.  The other thing
	you'll have to consider is whether you want the POP-only
	accounts to use their own "virtual mail host" (requires
	an IP alias or an additional interface) or whether you
	your smtpd to run in the same chroot "jail" -- then 
	requiring any local account holders to also use 
	POP (perhaps using the fetchmail client to the 
	"localhost" target).

<p>	Here are some of the links that have more information
	on mail and POP in general.

	You should consider putting the I/O base address, the 
	IRQ, and any DMA or memory address information into
	this append clause in place of those zero's.

<p>	You can test these by entering them at the LILO prompt
	(interactively, during boot) before editing the /etc/lilo.conf

</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">

	This depends on which distribution you're using and
	how closely you want to stick to their configuration 
	conventions.  Minimally all you need is a script file 
	(typically located under /etc/rc.d/ and invoked by the
	rc.local) with calls to the 'ifconfig,' and a 'route add'
	command or two.  Under Red Hat's SysV init system you'd 
	leave your rc.d files alone and edit some file under
	your /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ directory (ifcfg-eth0,
	and ifcfg-eth1 if I recall correctly -- it should be obvious
	by browsing through those files).

	It is possible to use a serial terminal as a console
	for Linux -- given some patches.  With some PC hardware
	you'll have to leave the video card in their -- though 
	you don't need a monitor attached.

<p>	Unfortunately I don't remember where I saw these patches.
	I'd so a search on "+Linux +serial +console"  (using the
