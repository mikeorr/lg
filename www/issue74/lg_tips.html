Hello Gang,
</P>
<P>
I figured out why my ftp client, on my Windows95 machine, did not appear to
work using my Linux machine with IP masquerading.  I had to type the
following command on my Linux machine that was doing the masquerading:
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>insmod ip_masq_ftp
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
I found this information at the URL:

	>http://netfilter.samba.org/ipchains/HOWTO-7.html</A>

<P>
It had all kinds of other stuff for using ipchains.

I've actually had direct experience with this problem.  Newer Linksys
cards don't work with the Kernel module that was included in the 2.2
Kernel tree.  I was helping friends install Linux on their machines, and
had to do some scrambling of my own.
</P>
<P>
What I did to solve to problem was to download the latest 2.4 tree onto
their windows partitions, then perform the <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> install, unpack to
tree to <TT>/usr/src/linux</TT> and recompile (a person should always compile
their own kernels IMO).  The card worked beautifully after that.

I think Carlos needs to use:

<P>
in his smb.conf file on a per share basis

That way any samba user who access to that share can write to any other

<FONT COLOR="navy">Recovering from MySQL table problems</FONT></H3>

<BR>Mike Orr (<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net?subject=%20Re%3A%20%5BLG%2074%5D%202c%20Tips%20%234"><em>Linux Gazette</em> Editor</a>)

<P>
Somebody on another list had a problem with MySQL losing tables.  Since the
answer is good for troubleshooting various MySQL table problems, I'm
submitting it as a 2-Cent Tip.
</P>
<P>
I've never seen MySQL lose tables without a specific DROP command.
First, be sure you're looking in the correct database?
</P>
<ol>
<li> Look in the MySQL data directory (maybe <TT>/var/lib/mysql</TT>).  There
should be one subdirectory for each database, containing three files
for each table (tablename.MYD, tablename.MYI, tablename.frm).
Do the file sizes look plausable or are they "really small"?
<li> Check file ownership/permissions.  The user the MySQL server is
running under must have read/write access to all data files, and
read/write/execute access for directories.

<blockquote><pre>cd /var/lib/mysql
chown -R mysql.mysql /var/lib/mysql
	# Or 'nobody' or whoever the MySQL server runs as.
chmod -R u+rwX /var/lib/mysql
	# Or 'ug+rwX' or 'ugo+rwX' for less security.
mysqladmin -u root -pPASSWORD flush-tables
</pre></blockquote>
Something on your system may have reset the ownership to root.root.  If
MySQL doesn't have read access, I think it <EM>will</EM> say the table doesn't
exist.
<li> Do a MySQLdb query of "SELECT DATABASE();".  Does it return the
correct name?
<li> Use the 'mysql' interactive utility.  Do "USE mydatabase",
"SHOW DATABASES;", "SHOW TABLES;", etc.  If it can't find the tables, none
of MySQL can.
<li> Do you have two copies of MySQL installed and two data directories?
Maybe it's looking in the wrong directory.  Run "mysqld --help" and it
will tell you where it thinks the data directory is.
</ol>

<P>
I recently read an article from your site: "SysAdmin: User
Administration: Disabling Accounts-From Glenn Jonsson on 05 Aug 1998"
</P>
<P>
It spoke of placing an * in the password field of the <TT>/etc/passwd</TT> file.
This doesn't restrict the account on my system(Solaris 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT="8)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">.  Could you
have meant placing the * as the first character in the password field of
/etc/shadow.
</P>
<P>
thanks for any feedback
</P>
<P>
Eric
</P>

<P>
<em>
Definitely.  That trick only works when placed in the passwd field which
is actually going to be </EM>used<EM> ... and since most Linux systems now
support shadow files, that means <TT>/etc/shadow.</TT>   In 1998 those were a
bit less common.  -- Heather

I am currently trying to write html which will insert page breaks
for printing, which is [CSS2 and] not implemented in mozilla.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Is any anyone aware of any solutions to this using HTML/CSS1
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I don't think so, but if your HTML qualifies as well-formed XML, you could use XSLT (XML stylesheet and transformation language) to transform it into something that can be printed. The W3C spec at www.w3c.org does a pretty good job of describing the language.
</P>
<P>
If your source is valid (i.e. passes through an SGML parser without complaints from the parser), you can use DSSSL to convert it to a printable format. The beginnings of some how-to docs are at <A HREF="http://www.mulberrytech.com/dsssl/dsssldoc"
	>http://www.mulberrytech.com/dsssl/dsssldoc</A>
</P>
<P>
If I had to do this, I would use Sablotron (a free XSLT processor from www.gingerall.com) and write a stylesheet to transform XHTML to groff for printing. It's not as convenient as printing directly from Mozilla, but much more flexible and easier to control.
</P>
<P>
Hope this helps,
</P>

I refuse to install IIS to use OWA (w/exception to being fired that is).
I've downloaded <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A> for wintel, printed all the "how to's" and plan to

<P><STRONG>
I've been to <A HREF="http://horde.org/imp"
	>http://horde.org/imp</A>;  (per advise of
another). They offer imap &amp; pop3 web mail access.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The problem is I haven't any Apache knowledge, and limited mail knowledge in
general. I used your search engine (in addition to other Linux based sites)
but I haven't found what I need.
Would you please clue me so I may tackle this task and hopefully justify
bringing Linux in-house. One small step for penguin......
</STRONG></P>
<P>
We use IMP here at CCIL at <A HREF="http://webmail.ccil.org"
	>http://webmail.ccil.org</A>.  If you use <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>, it
simplifies the install process.  Although we did have a problem on the
last security update of IMP that broke it.  We just set it up on another
box until we had time to fix it in a couple of days.  CCIL is a
non-profit freenet and all volunteer work for the techs anyway, we have a
part time paid Executive Director as of 2 months ago.

There are <EM>lots</EM> of webmail apps;  Debian definitely makes some of them
easier to install (aeromail comes to mind).  Most distros come with Apache
set up alright for a single domain... a lot of webmail apps are perl based
or PHP based.  If you don't like IMP and its fellow apps in The Horde, you
could try Squirrelmail (<A HREF="http://www.squirrelmail.org"
	>http://www.squirrelmail.org</A>) or Phorecast
(<A HREF="http://phorecast.org"
	>http://phorecast.org</A>) both of which have been updated recently...
or type "webmail" into the search gadget at 
<A HREF="http://www.freshmeat.net/">Freshmeat</A> and see what suits
your fancy.
</P>
<P>
For a recent client of mine, his tastes were simple and we found ourselves 
very happy with 
<a href="http://www.openwebmail.org/">OpenWebMail</a>.  
However, it doesn't do IMAP, just POP. -- Heather

Do not use kernel 2.4.11, especially on <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A>  Instead, use any earlier
or later versions. -- Mike
</P>
<P>
2.4.11 had a nasty error which Linus almost immediately regretted...
many of the 2.4.x series have had significant improvements while
occasionally mangling something rather ordinary (e.g.  loop.c, needed for
loopback mounting, didn't work in 2.4.14 ... I check my fresh-cut CDs that
way, argh... it appears that unnecessary "deactivate_page" lines were the
culprit.  I can't say I discovered that on my own, but it seemed to work,
anyway).
</P>
<P>
The kernel maintainers are still fussing over having a working virtual memory
handler - Andrea Arcangeli with a new one which Linus accepted, while Alan
Cox and Rik Van Riel worked towards improving (some might say repairing)
the original VM.  Although Alan eventually agreed that Andrea has an ok
design, the new VM's <EM>very</EM> new vintage and limited comments in the code
still have a few people favoring Rik's VM, and Rik continuing to improve it.

<P>
OK, so Answer Gang discussions get me thinking - even if it's a question I
asked first. 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> Heck, in some circles, thinking's not only acceptable,
people actually do it regularly! And nobody laughs at'em, either.
</P>
<P>
Anyway... my question was "how do you print a sign ('Welcome!', for
example) big enough to cover a sheet of paper without using a GUI?" In
effect, I wanted some utility that would work like this:
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>printbig -size 1024x768 'Welcome!'
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
Well, the closest thing was a TeX solution by Karl-Heinz... great stuff for
those that know TeX (which I find obscure, complex, and just Too Darn Big
for the occasional dinky little "fancy printing" jobs I need to do), but I
was looking for something simpler still. Then, I remembered a set of tools
that came with a tarball I'd downloaded a while ago, "libungif-4.1.0" (I
would imagine it's been through a few versions since then, but it worked
for me).
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>echo 'Welcome!'|text2gif -c 128 0 0|gifrsize -s 12 &gt; welcome.gif
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
This gives a rather blocky-looking output, with the text magnified 12X
(think of the Courier font at about 150 points or so) and a red foreground
(the color is optionally set by the "-c R G B" switch.) For much more
flexibility in conversion - anti-aliasing, blurring, drawing boxes around
the text, convolving, embossing, and many, many other options, try using
"convert" (part of the ImageMagick utilities) after the "text2gif" has done

This one gives a beautiful "lace fringe" effect to a softly rendered

We have just switched our network from a Novell server to a <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> Linux
server. However, one of the most missed features was the ability to
receive a pop-up indicating that a print job sent to the network printer
had successfully completed.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
We would like to do the following:
</STRONG></P>
<strong>
<ol>
<li> Notify the workstation when a print job, sent to the network printer,
arrives.
<li> Print a type or cover page identifying the origin of the print job.
(We have many a stack of papers on the printer waiting for the owner!)

You don't mention any specifics about how your handling our print
requests, etc.  Assuming that you're using samba and that you're running
MSW clients, you can run winpopup on the client, and send a msg to it
using smbclient with the appropriate command line option - see the
smbclient man page.  Sorry I can't give specifics, as really haven't set
up samba to do much printing.  It would probably involve writing one or
two bash or perl scripts.  -- John Karns
</P>
<P>
The sheets announcing what user has the print job are called "burst
pages" in the UNIX world.  In 'lpr' you would take "sh" out of the
printcap entry, and (if you like these seperators <EM>after</EM> the print job)
maybe add "hl".  For the notification you'd have to abuse the print
accounting system, I think... have that shell script send email, that'd
be the easiest.  But, there are other print spooling systems, all of
them much newer. I'd look at a lot of stuff at <A HREF="http://www.linuxprinting.org"

<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">Can somebody who uses DHCP modify this script so that it can be used in both
static and dynamic situations?
 -- Mike</font></blockquote>
<P>
If you can't get your IP Masquerading working, try this "simple" script.  If
it works from the command line, put it in your boot sequence somewhere or
reference it in your startup scripts (see "man init").
</P>
<P>
Remember to set the variables at the top of the script.
</P>
<P>
It works on kernels 2.4 and 2.2 only, using iptables on 2.4 and ipchains on
2.2.  Your kernel must have the appropriate firewall/masquerading/forwarding
compilation options enabled.
</P>
<P>
It tries to allow all connections initiated by the internal network, while
prohibiting connections to the internal network from outside.  This is
minimal security, you can add iptables/ipchains commands to block certain
ports on the gateway if you wish.
</P>
<P>
For FTP, IRC, RealAudio, etc, you may have to load additional modules.
</P>
<P>
This script assumes you have a static IP.  If you have a dynamic IP (DHCP),
you'll need to determine your current public IP and plug it in.  You can run
ifconfig to see the "inet addr:" manually, or modify this script to
automatically determine the current IP.
</P>
<P>
See the iptables/ipchains manual pages for more information, and the
firewalling/masquerading HOWTOs.

</P>
<P><STRONG>
Hi,
<br>We are using mailman for our freenet support, CCIL Help Desk Team
&lt;<A HREF="mailto:help@ccil.org"
	>help@ccil.org</A>&gt;, and often the users reply to only the 
individual who
originally answered the question.  As much as I don't want to munge the
header with a reply-to it would be be better than our problem of users not
replying to the list.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I took a quick look at the msg_footer and Python's string formatting
rules, but its not giving me the clues to figure out how you are changing
the reply-to to the list and the user, or the header containing "Original
question from: user".  How did you do that?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
A wrapper.  I'd threatened to post details, and since
you ask, I'll do so.
</P>
<P>
It was a quick hack.  Improvements and generalizations
happily accepted.
</P>
<P>
The list begins by delivering to a procmail recipe.  In
/etc/aliases:
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>linux-questions-only:
<br>  "|/usr/bin/procmail -m /etc/procmailrcs/linux-questions-only"
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
Because of the location and ownership of the procmailrc,
mail is delivered as the user which owns the procmail
recipe <TT>/etc/procmailrcs/linux-questions-only.</TT>  In our case
we have it owned by "list" which has permission to write to
the temporary directory <TT>/var/lib/mailman/tmp/.</TT>
</P>
<P>
After several procmail recipes irrelevant to the present thread,
the final delivering recipe says:
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>:0
<br>|  /usr/lib/mailman/localbin/hdrs.sh
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
If you don't need procmail and you can deal with Sendmail's smrsh,
or if you're using exim, postfix, qmail, mmdf, etc, you could deliver
directly to hdrs.sh over <TT>/etc/aliases.</TT>
</P>
<P>
Next, hdrs.sh:
</P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/tips/hdrs.sh.txt">hdrs.sh.txt</a></tt></p>
<p>and then, hdrs.py:</p>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/tips/hdrs.py.txt">hdrs.py.txt</a></tt></p>
<P>
The data file <TT>/var/lib/mailman/localdata/linux-questions-only</TT>
is generated by script run from a cron job:
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>#!/bin/sh
<br>
<br>/usr/lib/mailman/bin/list_members linux-questions-only &gt;/var/lib/mailman/localdata/linux-questions-only
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
The membership of the list doesn't change very fast, so we
run this nightly.
</P>
<P>
An' that's it.

I don't know where to start.  I have used (and been frustrated by) Windows
for a long time.  Linux seem to be a blessing from above.  However, the
practical matter is that some things don't work as advertised.  There are so
many, I don't know where to begin.  Lets start with the Genome Calendar.  I
am running Redhat 6.0 and using the Gnome desktop.  I have read the
instructions about the Calendar application, but when I set an appointment
it never notifies me of it's passing.  I leave the user logged in and the
application running and minimized on the desktop.  The date and time of the
appointment comes and goes and nothing happens.  Additionally I don't know
where to look for further help.  Can you suggest something?

I have a problem that occurs with telnet on my linux machines. the only fix

and then the same problem recurs.  the issues is that when i try and telnet
into the machines, i get the first part of the prompt

issue, but thus far i haven't been able to keep him out nor keep telnet
running.  any suggestions on how to make it work again without reloading
the OS would be appreciated.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
My first suggestion would be to turn off telnetd permanently.   The
thing's a horrible security risk, and nobody should use it any more
except within a network containing only trusted hosts.
</P>
<P>
Instead, use Openssh (<A HREF="http://www.openssh.org"
	>http://www.openssh.org</A>) which may be available
as .rpms for your Red Hat, someplace.
</P>
<P>
Get OpenSSH-2.9.9p1 or later.
</P>
<P>
If not available, you can build it from source.  You'll need to
build OpenSSL and zlib first, as openssh depends on libraries
from these.

It's certainly worth your while to download putty's scp program
too.  Even if you continue to use telnet in some places, putty is
a better telnet client than the one that comes with MSwin. -- Heather

If someone has cracked your system and messed with <TT>/usr/bin/login</TT> (it's a
binary file rather than a directory - on my <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A>7.1 system, it's
<TT>/bin/login</TT>) then it would be worth your while, even mandatory to reload
the OS.  There's no way to tell to what degree your system has been
compromised, and what kinds of trojan horse binaries may have been
planted.

<P>
If you're going to stick with RH6.0, then after re-installing you should
visit the RH site and update all the rpm's which were updated for security

Many users want to keep a little of reminder information for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Take me for example. Sometimes I want to remind myself of installing a
software package, compiling some code, playing a particular game or
simply to do my homework.
</P>
<P>
What I want is a little reminder display at login.
</P>
<P>
I' m working most of the time in X so I put the following line in my
.xinitrc file BEFORE launching the window manager.

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>test -f ~/.ToDo &amp;&amp; xmessage -center -file ~/.ToDo -buttons Discard:0,Keep:1 &amp;&amp; rm ~/.ToDo

<P>
This one checks if the reminder file ($HOME/.ToDo) exists. If yes, the
file is displayed with the xmessage command centered on the screen
giving the choice of either discard it or to keep it. If I want to
keep it, I click on "Keep", if not, the rm command will remove it.
</P>
<P>
To be able to edit the file, I use two methods. First of all I have a
shortcut to my favourite editor loading the ToDo file in my
window managers menu.
</P>
<P>
Second I have the following lines at the very end of my .xinitrc file:

<P>
This block asks me at session end if I want to create a TODO file but
only when this file is non existent. Substitute xjed with your
favourite text editor.
</P>
<P>
Using the console? Simply put the following line in your .profile or
.bash_profile file:
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>test -f ~/.ToDo &amp;&amp; cat ~/.ToDo
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
This will simply type the ToDo file on your console at login. With a
little more of shell programming you can achieve a deletion of the
ToDo file at logout as well.
</P>
<P>
Experiment a while with these - it is a nifty feature and you do not
need any extra software. Simply Linux standard packages that come with
all Linux distros.

I am having a bit of a problem with suse linux 7.2. My problem is on the

The process inetd (process id 83

program (that also uses TCP) but the address that the SMTP program wants
is already in use by someone else.
</P>
<P>
My guess is you're running an email program like sendmail and also
running another SMTP program (read: mail) from inside of inetd.  Check
to see what's uncommented in <TT>/etc/inetd.conf</TT>, cross reference that with
<TT>/etc/services</TT> and see if anything uses port 25 (which is listed in
<TT>/etc/services</TT>).

<FONT COLOR="navy">Setting up a web-based archive for a mailing list</FONT></H3>
Tue, 06 Nov 2001 11:01:13 +0200 (EET)
<BR>Peter Georgiev (<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net?cc=peterg@mail.bg&subject=%20Re%3A%20%5BLG%2074%5D%202c%20Tips%20%2324">peterg from mail.bg</a>)

<P>
Hiya everyone at the Gazette,
</P>
<P>
Great job again with Issue 72. I especially liked "PDF Service with
Samba" by John Bright.
</P>
<P>
Well I'd like to comment on "Setting Up a Web-based Archive for a Mailing
List" by Lawrence Teo.
</P>
<P>
Let's assume we've already set the mailing list as described in the
previous article -- "A Quick and Easy Way to Set Up a Mailing List" and
also compiled and installed hypermail. So we're at item 2.2. -- Creating
a dummy account, which IMHO has some drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
Well suppose our project has about 20 researchers enlisted in the
mail-list. They also want to share file attachments via e-mail e.g.
drawing charts, spreadsheets, tarballs of source code, whatever. So our
mail traffic is pretty high. It will soon result with a dummy user mbox
several hundred Mbytes of size which will keep growing. Hypermail has to
parse the whole mbox to re-index the archive. On P200 128MB RAM it takes
30 sec to parse a 5 MB mbox and 2 min to parse a 25 MB mbox. Suppose you
have a 500 MB mbox and cron starts hypermail every 2 min -- despite
hypermail's locking mechanism soon you will end with an endless queue of
hypermail processes waiting to be executed or if you switch locking off --
even bring the box down to it's knees.
</P>
<P>
Well all the above may be a bit too far from the real-world situation,
neither have I tested it thourougly.
However there is a way to go around it and it's actually easier to setup.
</P>
<P>
What we have to do is as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li> <TT>/path/to/hypermail -v &gt; /path/to/projarch.conf</TT>

<br>
This command will dump a sample config file for hypermail which we'll
have to edit. It's pretty self-explanatory so I won't discuss it in
detail.
However look at the "mbox =" option. It sets the mbox to read messages
in from. Giving this option a value of NONE will set hypermail to read
messages from standard input.
<li> Open <TT>/etc/aliases</TT> in your favorite editor and create an alias for
projarch (this we shall use for our archiving purposes)

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>projarch:  "|/path/to/hypermail -c /path/to/projarch.conf"
</font></code></blockquote>

This will pipe each incoming message for <A HREF="mailto:projarch@mybox.example.com"
	>projarch@mybox.example.com</A>
into hypermail. Save <TT>/etc/aliases</TT> and issue the

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>/usr/bin/newaliases
</font></code></blockquote>

command. Do not forget to set the output directory for hypermail
archives somewhere under the web server document root (Option "dir ="
in <TT>/path/to/projarch.conf</TT>). Create the output directory e.g.

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>/var/www/html/projarch
</font></code></blockquote>

and give the user sendmail runs under (usually user mail) write access
to it.

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>chown mail:apache /var/www/html/projarch; chmod 750 /var/www/html/projarch
</font></code></blockquote>

Pay attention to possible values of the "dir =" option in the config
file (man hmrc). Using substitution cookies, you can tell hypermail to
archive messages in different directories by the date they were
received.

<li> Test hypermail sending a message to your mailing-list. If sendmail
bounces it back with an error message like:

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>sh: hypermail not available for sendmail programs
<br>554 5.0.0 |"/path/to/hypermail"... Service unavailable
</font></code></blockquote>

it means sendmail uses smrsh (Sendmail restricted shell) to execute
binaries. In this case do the following:


<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>ln -s /path/to/hypermail /etc/smrsh/hypermail;
</font></code></blockquote>

Then restart sendmail


<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>/etc/init.d/sendmail restart
</font></code></blockquote>

Test hypermail again sending a message to the mailing list and
pointing your web browser to:

<BLOCKQuote>
<A HREF="http://mybox.example.com/projarch"
	>http://mybox.example.com/projarch</A>
</BLOCKQuote>

It should be all set up.
</ol>
<P>
With this setup of hypermail we do not have to create a dummy user --
hence no multi-Mbyte mbox to parse. We process messages one by one
straight as they arrive and update the web archive this very instant - so
we don't need no cron job, and we don't need extra setup of <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A>.
</P>
<P>
No need to mention you will need root access to the system but you will
need it in the first place -- setting up the mailing list. And note
your environment paths may differ from above examples depending on the
distribution you use, which is well explained in the original article.
</P>
<P>
Hope this helps,
<br>Peter

I wonder if one can dig up a short of whitepaper on
crypto file systems(also AES perhaps).
</STRONG></P>
<P>
AES (Advanced Encrytption standard) is the new encryption standard after DES
and the US government finally decided to use the Rijndael algorithm.
This is available with a "free" license and open source.

which is the official US gov site anouncing Rijndael as chosen AES algorithm
along with details on the algorithm, links to source and executables as well
as links to the Rijndael developers and more material.

put "crypto File system" in the search filed of www.google.com and the 4th

	>Running an X program on a remote display</h4>
<p>
Use <tt>ssh -n</tt> to run an X program from one computer on another.  
</p><p>
For example,

</p><p><code>
ssh -n frodo gimp &amp;

</code></p><p>
will run the GIMP on the host frodo, but display locally.

</p><p>
Using ssh for this is much easier and more secure than setting it up
in X manually.

	>Replicating a Debian system</h4>

<p>
How many times have you installed some cool software on one of the
systems at your office, gotten used to running it, then one day tried
to run it from a different system only to find it wasn't there?

</p><p>
Now there's an answer. Jablicator for Debian:
</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/testing/admin/jablicator.html"
	>http://packages.debian.org/testing/admin/jablicator.html</a>
</blockquote>

</p><p>automatically
builds a package file based on your current software load. Apt-get
that package on all your other hosts, and they'll keep in sync.

	>Color inkjet printers</h4>

<p>
Color inkjet printers vary widely in their support under Linux.
Vendors make these family-oriented units as dumb as possible to keep
the cost down. (Think of a color inkjet printer as an in-home display
unit to sell you color inkjet cartridges.) As in a Winmodem, all the
decisions get made in the driver, and some vendors offer decent
drivers for Linux while others don't.

</p><p>
You might find the same printer gives you photo-quality prints from a
proprietary OS and a faded, blurry image under Linux. Visit
LinuxPrinting.org:
</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.linuxprinting.org"
	>http://www.linuxprinting.org</a>
</blockquote>

</p><p> for up-to-date reports on printers and
drivers, so you don't get stuck taking your printer back.

</p><p>
For business or even home office use, a reconditioned laser printer
with network interface is less hassle than a parallel port inkjet and
much cheaper per page.  Unless you really want color.
</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>
Your Editor had to replace his color printer recently, and I got an
Epson Stylus C80 based on the evaluations of the Linux Printing site.
It works great from the Gimp with the Gimp Print driver, once I realized
the latest Debian Gimp package is "gimp1.2" rather than "gimp".  Still
not working with LPRng/Ghostscript, but that's a configuration issue rather
than a capability issue.  My current Debian Ghostscript works fine with 
my laser printer but doesn't contain the Gimp Print driver for the C80.
I tried installing a binary version of Ghostscript with that driver, but
that screwed up my LPRng configuration and my other printing.  So I can't
print directly from Netscape.  For now, I'm just opening pictures a second
time in the Gimp, which is time-consuming but it works.  -Iron.

	>How to include attachments when forwarding mail from mutt</h4>

<p>
Mutt doesn't forward messages with MIME attachments by default. To
give yourself the ability to include MIME attachments when forwarding
a message, set mime_fwd in .muttrc. In our humble opinion this is the
most useful setting; it allows you not to include attachments by
default but to include them when you want.

</p><p><code>
set mime_fwd=ask-no
</code></p>
