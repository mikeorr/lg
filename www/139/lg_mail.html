<p>
Dear list,
</p>

<p>
I am using debian with devfs. I have a usb based removable microsd drive.
I have no problem to access the drive through usb but the problem is with
non-static device node. Like I have checked through log that the devfs has
assigned node /dev/sda1 for that device.
</p>

<p>
so I have added in my /etc/fstab
</p>

<pre>
/dev/sda1       /media/microsd      vfat    rw,user,auto    0       0
</pre>
and I have no problem to work with it. but next time when I again plug
in the device it has a device node called /dev/sdb1  and then I have to
modify the corresponding entry in fstab. So is there any way to assign
static device node in devfs.
</p>

<p>
thanks
</p>

Hello Gang
</p>

<p>
I'd like to know if there's some kind of "reference guide" for Linux 
console-based applications, or perhaps a web site / community of people who 
enjoy doing everything via command line and ncurses-based apps, without 
setting up graphical desktop environments.
</p>

<p>
I've already encountered several apps, e.g., for working with e-mails 
(Mutt), browsing the web (Elinks), playing music (Moc), chatting over MSN 
(Pebrot), and so on, but I'd like to try more options on each of those 
activities, and do other things such as recording and playing CDs and DVDs, 
sharing files over p2p, resizing partitions, reading PDFs and word documents 
or converting them to text, chatting over VoIP, reading RRS feeds, editing 
audio, etc etc.
</p>

<p>
Thank you very much and congratulations for your work on Linux Gazette, my 
favourite magazine.
</p>

</p>

<p>
I was looking at some tablature programs today, and found that there's
an extension to MIDI called "Rich MIDI Tablature Format" to represent
some guitar specific things. A few Windows programs support it, but
none of the open source programs do.
</p>

<p>
I was wondering how to even go about finding out the differences
between this format and regular MIDI (without having to find out too
much about MIDI), when Perl (or, more specifically, Perl's MIDI
module) came to the rescue: it has an option to dump everything as a
series of events.
</p>

<p>
Take this short piece of Lilypond:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
\header {
  title = "Flowers"
  dedication = "Ona wie"
  subtitle = "1 January 2005"
}
 
\new TabStaff {
  \repeat volta 2 {
  d'4\4 b'8\3 d'\4 a'4.\3
  e'8\4 e'\4 fis'\4 g'\4 e'\4 fis'\4 g'\4 a'4\3
  d'4\4 b'8\3 d'\4 a'4.\3
  e'8\4 a'\3 g'\4 fis'\4 e'\4 d'2\4
  }
 
  \repeat volta 2 {
  a4\5 e'8\4 fis'\4 g'4.\4
  e'8\4 e'\4 fis'\4 g'\4 e'\4 fis'\4 g'\4 a'4\3
  a4\5 e'8\4 fis'\4 g'4.\4
  e'8\4 g'\4 fis'\4 e'\4 b'\3 a'2\3
  }
 
  \repeat volta 2 {
  a8\4 d\4 fis\4 g\4
  e\5 a,\5 cis\5 d\5
  d\5 cis\5 b,\6 a,\6
  a,\6 cis\5 e\5 g\4
  a8\4 d\4 fis\4 g\4
  e\5 a,\5 cis\5 d\5
  d\5 cis\5 b,\6 a,\6
  a,2\6
  }
}
</pre>
I recreated the first 4 bars in one of the Windows tablature programs,
and with this command:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
$ perl -MMIDI -e 'my
$o=MIDI::Opus-&gt;new({"from_file"=&gt;$ARGV[0]});$o-&gt;dump({"dump_tracks"=&gt;1});'
flowers-rtmf.mid
</pre>
I got this output:

Hey all,
</p>

<p>
I'm fairly new to C programming but am familiar with most programming
principles from Java and Perl. I understand what pointers are in C,
but I have lots of problems knowing when best to use them, since many,
if not all tasks, can be obtained just from passing parameters into
function directly.
</p>

<p>
Are there any good tips for knowing when or when not to use pointers?

Hi Everyone,
</p>

<p>
Does anyone remember how Fedora Core 4 let the user specify trusted devices (e.g. eth0, sit0,
nlv0) through the system-config-securitylevel tool?  That feature seems to have gone away with
Core 5.  I always liked that feature because it let me open up just the nlv0 device for VPN.  With
that feature gone, I have to open up a lot more it seems.
</p>

<p>
Does anyone know of a workaround?  Or did the feature just get moved somewhere else?  Thanks in
advance.  Oh, and I did find the ASCI version of the tool, system-config-securitylevel-tui - it
knows  that eth0 can be set as a trusted device, but that's it.  Even when nlv0 is up (as
confirmed by ifconfig), system-config-securitylevel-tui only lists eth0 as a device that can be
set as trusted.

<h3>Switching VT Remotely?</h3>

<b>Fri, 04 May 2007 15:34:39 -0600</b>
</p>

<p>
Is there a way to switch the VT of a linux box remotely?
</p>

<p>
Specifically, I have X running on my desktop, and have trained my wife 
to click the KDE "switch user" to log in herself (and get her email), 
which allocates another VT for her.
</p>

<p>
This works really well -- I can leave myself logged in on VT7, and she 
can use VT8.  Unfortunately, she doesn't know how to switch it back to 
VT7 when she's done (Ctrl-Alt-F7).
</p>

<p>
I have a VNC server installed as an X module, that allows me to remotely 
VNC to my X session (on VT7), but due to X quirks, I can only VNC to it 
if VT7 is "selected" -- ie, if she's left the machine sitting on VT8, I 
can't VNC in.
</p>

<p>
So, I would like to know if there is a way for me to switch which VT is 
"selected" remotely (ie, SSH in, su to root, and do something to switch 
VTs).
</p>

<p>
Thanks in advance! ;-)
</p>

</p>

<p>
I deleted most of this thread from my mailbox.  Please could you get this 
email to the right place in the thread?
</p>

<p>
I just noticed you have posted our long discussion of lpr and user in the 
April edition.  There is one piece missing.  Karolis found the solution to 
the eznet problem.  Eznet (which our little linux uses as a front end for 
pppd) changes file permissions while it is being used, which is why the 
devices needed to dial kept reverting to not being user-accessible.  So in 
order to dial as user, one would need to use pppd directly without eznet.
</p>

<p>
I am trying to keep things simple, and eznet is very simple to set up.
I am totally incapable of rewriting eznet to behave properly.
</p>

<p>
Would it make a big difference in security if the user dialed as root, 
then logged in and did everything else online as user?
</p>



<p>
I can now print as root (and hopefully as user) with gs 8.54, which I 
compiled with default device deskjet, at default resolution 300 dpi, on 
default letter size paper:
</p>

<pre>
gs -sOutputFile=/dev/lp0 filename.pdf
</pre>
I put together a package with a bit of documentation.  Init files are 
compiled into the executable, and it works without added fonts.  I 
included only the older deskjet and laserjet printers and devices needed 
to view with an svgalib viewer and to convert ps &lt; &gt; pdf.  2.7MB 
standalone executable.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://keesan.freeshell.org/bl/gs-8.54-HP-noX.tgz">http://keesan.freeshell.org/bl/gs-8.54-HP-noX.tgz</a> (glibc 2.2.5)
Compiled without x11 (use svgalib 1.9.25 and svp to view, also posted at 
my site as packages).
</p>

<p>
Since it does not require x11, it should work with libc5 BL3.50 (whose X 
is not compatible with glibc X) as well as later linuxes.
</p>

<p>
There is now a basiclinux BL3.50 with a nicer wm that does not require a 
mouse, and a more complete menu that makes life easier for beginners.
It still uses eznet.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://distro.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/distributions/baslinux">http://distro.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/distributions/baslinux</a>
</p>

<p>
Added to the 5MB of BL3.50, along with a few extra libraries, Opera 8, and 
Abiword (each about 12MB), this gs should make for a nice 50MB linux that 
browses, does word processing and prints, works with some cameras, and 
might run off a flash drive if you first boot from a 1-floppy USB-capable 
linux and chroot to the flash drive.  (I did something similar with 
camera-linux, 8MB of files needed to download photos from my camera and 
display them on any computer with a floppy drive and USB 1.0 port, in a 
loop file in a DOS directory on the camera memory card).

<p>
Hi tag,
</p>


<p>
I'm trying to write a perl progam to automatically record internet
radio. The current setup uses at to start a recording process which
checks the radios webpage, filters the proper straming adress and wget
it for wget'able streams -- otherwise mplayer is used to dump the
stream. 
</p>

<p>
My increasing problem is, that the recording process exits prematurely.
What I currently do in perl is a main routine which does all the
webfetching and then forks out two processes:
</p>

<p>
* the recorder
* the killer -- waiting and then killing the recorder after preprogrammed time
</p>

<p>
main program exits. This protects mplayer from any input on stdin as
this immediately kills mplayer (a problem if perl program is started
by atd as I had to find out).
</p>


<p>
Now I tried to setup a signal handler for SIGCHLD in the main part  and
then let the main go to sleep instead of exiting. On receiving a
SIGCHLD it checks if this was because of the killer (time up, killer
exited) or if the time is not yet up and the recorder exited too early.
In the latter case I restart the recorder, kill and restart the killer
for the new recorder-pid  and then I want back in main, set the
sighandler and go to sleep as before.... but I seem unable to get out
of the sighandler. So this restarted recording exactly once -- but not
again. 
</p>

<p>
Is something like the above possible? Or do I have to switch to a
loop in main checking regularly on the status and react actively
without the use of sighandler to get any number of restarts? 
</p>

<p>
I'm not too worried of too fast forking as wget/mplayer takes a while
till they decide to fail -- but just in case a small delay and restart
counter (or count/time) could be calculated and watched in case network
is down and wget/mplayer are exiting to quick. 
</p>

<p>
Since I would very much like to learn how the sighandlers are supposed
to work and how to use them I would find the first strategy more
interesting.....  
</p>

<p>
As reading material I've the perl CD bookshelf including Programming
perl and the cookbook (Advanced Perl Programming doesn't have much on
forking and signal handlers). Both are not too deep into what's to do
once the sighandler was activated and I don't just want to terminate
after some cleaning up.  
</p>
