Hey, another fvwm user!  BAC, Thomas, have you experimented with running
windowmaker applets under fvwm?  I really like a lot of the applets WM
offers, (e.g., wmmount), but can't seem to get it to work inside of
the fvwmbutton module.
</STRONG></P>

Yes, I have. If you're running them from within FvwmButtons, that puts a
slightly yet subtle slant on how things are done, since you'll have to
ensure that a few conditions are set.
</blockQuote>
<P><STRONG>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"

That seems a much better way than having small 48x48 pixel windows
scattered around the root window.  One alternative might be to use the
WM docking window (if that's the right term), but I would still prefer
the fvwm buttonbar (or whatever it's called).  Might there be some
other nice(i.e., esthetic) way to gather them?
</STRONG></P>

Because the WMapplets are from another Window Manager, the hints they
use are somewhat alien to Fvwm pure. Hence, the freedesktop.org people
define EWMH (extended window manager hints). These essentially allow you
to run embedded apps like WMapplets, the <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> kicker, etc.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
But I cannot be anymore specific than that since you don't say what is
happening. I'm not even sure if WM* apps use EWMH.
</blockQuote>
<P><STRONG>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> 
Thanks for the pointer.  I'll browse their site when I get the time.
From reading the fvwm docs, I don't really understand the concept of
hints, from what you're saying here.  My understanding was that they
are window properties containers (of sorts) which pertain to such
minor things as border shadowing.
</STRONG></P>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

	> [Thomas] 
Kind of. EWMH hints are an unofficial extension of ICCCM 2.0 which the
freedesktop.org team have developed. Essentially, this implies the use
of KDE and <A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</A>, and allows for their own 'embedded' features to be
used with Fvwm if needed, since Fvwm is EWMH-compliant.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
But what are EWMHs? They simply allow the interaction between
window managers, applications and the utilities that form part of a
desktop environment. This was originally written to replace Gnomehints.
And as such it has been implemented in GNOME &gt;=2 and KDE &gt;=2
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
AFAIK, WM* apps are not. Indeed, you can check this for yourself. If you
want to know whether an application uses EWMHs then do:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>[n6tadam@station n6tadam]$ xprop | grep _NET_WM_STRUT
_NET_WM_STRUT(CARDINAL) = 0, 0, 0, 2
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Here, the numbers indicate the screen space that the application in
question is using. Thus, you can "filter" out that area of the screen so
that an application window doesn't obscure it when maximising it. To
achieve that, one can use:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
EWMHBaseStructs 0 0 0 2
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
In their ~/.fvwm2rc file. Why am I telling you this? I don't know
really, but it is just useful, since it can also be applied to
FvwmButtons.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
To go back to your original question though, "hints" are just that --
properties of windows that can be configured or acted upon in some way.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Indeed, You can use a combination of things. It really depends
on <EM>how</EM> you want them gathered. You can define an IconBox for icons
minimised, with will place them in a region of the screen.

Also, since I installed <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> 9 on this laptop (fvwm2 ver 2.5.7), the
buttonbar no longer works with swallowed apps.  Have you run into any of
that?  I still haven't visited the
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Lately I read the fvwm stuff from issue #3 and discovered a few things
that had escaped me, and a few I'd forgotten about, like the ability to
drag windows between VD's via the pager.
</STRONG></P>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

FvwmPager can do more than you probablu realise. As you say, you can
drag windows to other VD's and pages without even seeing the window
directly.
</blockQuote>
<P><STRONG>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> 
Also, from what I could gather by reading the fvwm man pages, it
seemed to me that they state that buttons in the buttonbar are pretty
limited in functionality, (e.g., toggled state like coolmail).  I hope
I'm simply misunderstanding the issue, and that it is possible to put
a fairly complex applet like wmmount inside of the buttonbar.
</STRONG></P>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

But of course! One can quite literally do <em>  anything  </em> with fvwm.
Ironically, what lets it down is the sheer volume of all the possible
things it <em>  can  </em> do.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
As an example, if you wanted to have wmmount swallowed by FvwmButtons,
and then issue a command to it such that clicking on it mounted a
device, and then umounted it, you can do something like the following,
assuming you have the icon/applet swallowed:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>AddToFunc ToggleMount
+ None (Mount, CirculateHit) Exec exec xterm -T Mount -n Mount -e mount $0
+ I Iconify
+ I Next (Mount, CirculateHit) Close
+ I Exec exec umount $0
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Then from within FvwmButtons:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>*FvwmButtons: (Action ToggleMount)
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
This might be long-winded, and indeed, the facility of wmmount might
even provide this mechanism, but it demonstrates what can be done. I
should point out that I haven't tested it, but it ought to work.
</blockQuote>
<P><STRONG>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

As old as it is, from my
viewpoint, there are still some aspects to fvwm that other wm's never
caught up to.  IMO, it's a good compromise between lightweight and the
heavier DT environs like KDE and Gnome.  However, the cfg process is
pretty much manual via edit of .fvwm2rc
</STRONG></P>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Thomas] 
And I hope it stays manual. There are some 500+ style options for Fvwm.
There is no way one can enumerate this for a GUI. You wouldn't be able
to convey the options to the user efficiently.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I did look, and even suggest this at one point, but I have come to the
arrangement that it really is not a viable thing to do. There is always
the dotfile generator, but this is <EM>hideously</EM> out of date, and I really
do not suggest you use it.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
John, if you like, upload your ~/.fvwm2rc file (or send it to me via
e-mail) and I will have a look at it and fix it for you. I'll also
change the syntax to conform to 2.5.X should there be any discrepencies.

<P><STRONG>

Thanks, I'll probably take you up on the offer.  I've spent 3 or 4
hours trying different things, without success.

Then I am more than happy to go through it. I'll even throw in some
comments and explanations en route.

Ok, I'm late to the thread, but I concur there are some very cool things
you can do with this stuff.  For a push in the right direction, I'm
including my own configuration, which Thomas helped me with, because a
lot of the tricks I was using on my own are from Ye Olden Fvwm 1.0 days,
and it needed a nice touch-up.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
All of these parts go in a .fvwm directory under my home, which happens
to be <TT>/home/heather.</TT>  So you'll find yourself going into these files and
changing at least that burned in location... unless your username happens
to be heather.  The dotfile really has to be a dotfile, and take the
.txt extension off, of course.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Now for the warning label.  I have great color vision and my monitor is
<EM>really</EM> bright, so my config is very dark.  If you vision isn't as good
as mine, or your monitor isn't as vibrant, consider replacing the darker
blue with the rgb.txt named color NavyBlue or MidnightBlie.  They just
weren't Navy or Midnight enough for me

I use a simple starfield
background.  I actually cooked this one up years ago, back when I still
lived fulltime on (gasp!) Windows95.  There was this great poster I
liked, and I kind of took a look at it then did a starfield of my after
the manner of it, except of course mine didn't have any things flying
around in front of it like theirs did, and mine tiled in a friendly
fashion, and for the sake of memory, didn't have that beautiful range of
gradient color.  Feel free to go get your own bit of darkness from an
astronomy site, if you prefer.

Everything is based around the .fvwm2rc file. In older flavors of fvwm
that was expected in your homedir, but now it's expecetd in ~/.fvwm
directory instead, to support you having a batch of extra parts.

The sneakiest thing in this is the trick to make the button which
invokes sticky status, change appearance permanently for a stuck window,
and change back if it's unstuck.  My thanks to Thomas for showing me the
events interface.

I do some seriously strange things with my buttons layout.  Seems like
every distro I ever looked at has a giant googly pair of Xeyes chasing
the cursor around, but I think they need to not be so huge.  I do like
having a load monitor, but it doesn't look good if it doesn't cover the
full height.  So some juggling is called for,
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The buzzword for making "live" apps like Xeyes and xload stay involved is
a swallowed app - it doesn't need to be designed as an applet, it just has
to submit safely to having its geometry resized.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I love
icons but frankly I can find better things to do with some of my screen
estate, so maybe I want a few, but for some common tasks I use smaller
icons than others. I like a system load check but not taking too much
space, and I really abuse multiple pages, definitely preferring that
instead of multiple workspaces (though Fvwm supports those too).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Caveat for those with fancy video cards - you want workspaces (like K
desktop favors) or pages (like I do), not bigger virtual screens (controlled
in XF86Config-4).  Sliding around looking for where the <EM>real</EM>
center of the screen is and wondering where you lost your control corner
or iconbox are not the way to spend your workday.  My pages have a 2x4
layout, for 8 pages total, and this has generally been plenty for me.

Unless I configure that darn pager explicitly, though, it comes out
pasty white.  Agggh!  My poor vampiric eyeballs.  Again, if your color
vision likes brighter colors, or you hate purple, pick something
brighter from the named colors in rgb.txt.  I used here, the "brighter"
NavyBlue, because the pages are tiny enough I wanted better contrast.
You might want them brighter yet, and make it just plain Blue.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
There's a nice app named xcolors that will show all the colors for
you, i but you have to launch it with extra window page space already
available below ypur active window, because the window is too tall
(showing <EM>every</EM> color takes some space) and it's too stupid to have
a scrollbar.  There's a gtk app that does a cleaner job of showing the
colors but I forget what it's called.

The sparkling touch of color on my active window is thanks to me using s
few tiny pixmaps instead of MWM-like vector corners.  For the inactive
window I still use the vectors - they're faster, and they don't look
bad (I do wonder if I should do something cuter for sticky, but I've
been lazy).  I got these from the fvwm95 icons kit, but for sanity and
portability, I copied them into .fvwm/icons, a directory.

Sticky means, it will "go" with me.  I like that, bad puns in a tiny

Last but not least, I have a couple of personal menus.  One gives me
access to a number of differently colorized Xterms; I use them so much
color helps me recall which one's which even when I forget to retitle
them.

The other makes it easy to pop up web browsers, since I like to view the
world from different angles sometimes. "Netscape" on there is the
somewhat ancient Netscape 4.77 -- Netscape 7 and Mozilla don't seem to
be good neighbors, they keep stepping on each other's config files.  I
use NS4 to spot buggy HTML code, because it has just horrid rendering when
the code's wrong  and it sticks out like a sore thumb.  Lynx I just
happen to like 'cuz it's speedy.

Did I miss anything?  Oh of course.  A
<a href="../misc/tag/fvwm-spiffy.png">screen shot</a>
It's a bit on the large side, but I told you I had a big monitor.
That dark shot of the GIMP is also a goodie of mine, a GTK theme I
whipped up for myself which I call DarkGems, because I stole gemlike
features from a half dozen E and GTK themes.  But this is about Fvwm,
not about GTK, so I'll save that for another time.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I also applied a minor hack on fvwm to not stipple my sticky title bars.
For most folks I think it'd be more a pain to recompile fvwm just to
leave that out, and then want to keep up to date, so I'll leave that out
too.  It was in icons.c and the borders.c if you feel adventuresome.
