<p>
...a most sincere "thank you"!
</p>

<p>
This month, a number of new volunteers came aboard - and, in a word,
<em>revitalized</em> LG. Some came in and cleaned up the dusty phrasing,
straightened up the crooked grammar, and replaced the broken spelling;
others brought their technical expertise and poked into the complicated
corners of articles. Yet others looked at LG with fresh eyes and pointed
out a few broken phone cords and the bumps under the carpet (which
turned out to be broken stuff hastily swept under in the past.) All who
contributed have left their mark.
</p>

<p>
As Editor-in-Chief, I took great pleasure from seeing all this activity;
in coordinating all of this [1], I got to meet a number of smart,
energetic, <em>capable</em> individuals - people whom, as a group, I'm proud to
know, and ones whom I hope I may come to call my friends.
</p>

<p>
Because of all of you, - even during this first month while everybody
"settled in" and got familiar with the tasks needed to keep LG moving -
my end of the production process has shifted focus, in large and
positive ways. Just in case anyone missed it, this month we published
the largest Mailbag (mailbag, talkbacks, and 2-cent tips) ever, by a
large factor (over 620k, as contrasted against, say, 45k in LG#113.) In
large part, this is due to our fearless Mailbag Editor, who also happens
to be my fearless wife <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> - but in part, it is due to the fact that I
had the time and the energy to 1) rethink the Mailbag process and
presentation, and 2) write a script which automated/relieved a great
percentage of the drudgery that Mailbag used to be.
</p>

<p>
My best hope for the future is to revisit and revise every part of LG to
shift that work/fun ratio toward the fun end by leaving the repetitive
work to the machines as much as possible - and leaving the fun,
interesting, challenging efforts to us humans.
</p>

<p>
I'm very, very glad that all of you are here to share this with me.
Thanks again, and I hope that our interaction continues and improves
with time.
</p>



<p>
[1] To the extent that a herd of cats can be coordinated, of course. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
Part of my enjoyment in all of this was seeing people indepently grab a
hunk of work and make it by-damn <strong>behave</strong> without much input from me.
</p>

<p>
I'd mentioned, in an email exchange with Ren&eacute; Pfeiffer, that I don't
<em>want</em> to tie people down to process details. I've written or tweaked
every LG FAQ to define <em>results;</em> the implementation is mostly left
undefined, or stated in general terms. What I want is for everyone to do
their piece the way the think best; if they get stuck, I'm always here
to troubleshoot the process along with them. The way <em>I</em> do things is
only <em>my</em> way; it's not <em>the</em> way - and if you do them better than I do,
then I'll happily learn what you have to teach. That, to me, is one of
the best benefits that cooperation offers.

<p>
I've just added a routine to extract all the email addresses out of the
TAG mailbag, look them up in the LG bios, and pull up the names
associated with those addresses; the folks for whom this chain 1) exists
and 2) matches will be credited with participating in the monthly
madness (the credits will be listed at the top of the generated Mailbag
page.)
</p>

<p>
Since I really like rewarding people who do good work to whatever extent
I can, I'd appreciate it if everyone would make sure that 1) they've
sent me a bio (preferably with a ~200x200px pic included) and 2) their
bio contains the email address that they're using to post to TAG. This
would satisfy my itch <em>and</em> credit you for your brilliant flights of wit
and wisdom... sounds like an all-around win to me. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<h3>Issue with evolution on FC6</h3>
<p>
<b>Dale A. Raby [daleraby at tds.net]</b><br />
<b>Tue, 07 Nov 2006 19:22:41 -0600</b>
</p>

<p>
Hello,
</p>

<p>
This one is an irritation and a puzzle... need I mention that I do not
like puzzles?
</p>

<p>
I purchased a DVD of Fedora Core 6.  After a few minor repartitioning
issues, I got it installed, though the default resolution was 1024 x
768.  This displays text a bit small for my old eyes, so I changed the
display to 800 x 600, which is what I usually use on my vintage machine.
</p>

<p>
The problem is with the Evolution groupware package.  For some reason,
the default window is larger than my desktop.  When I unmaximize the
window, I can move it over so I can access the scroll bar, but then I
cannot see the mailboxes on the left side of the window.  This window
will not resize.
</p>

<p>
When I change the resolution to 1024 x 768, everything works as it is
supposed to, except that I get eyestrain after ten minutes.  All other
applications seem to work fine at either resolution.
</p>

<p>
I would like Evolution to display correctly at 800 x 600.  Does anyone
have a suggestion for me?
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
</p>

<p>
Dale

<h3>Get HW and SW inventary</h3>
<p>
<b>ada * [adalex81 at gmail.com]</b><br />
<b>Wed, 22 Nov 2006 11:04:03 +0100</b>
</p>

<p>
Hello everybody:
</p>

<p>
I'm a spanish girl in her last year at University studing computer
engineering.
I'm starting to look into linux to develope my end-degree project. The
project deals with the managing of a heterogeneous net, this means that from
a client (administrator)  I have to get a Hardware and Software inventary of
every computer and device in the net. The problem is that I just don't know
where linux keeps such information (Windows keeps it in the register). Could
any of you give a helping hand?
</p>

<p>
I mean to design the interface using J2EE tecnology, so I'll have to
interrogate computers using java (neither how to do this yet).
</p>

<p>
Another question I'd like to ask is the best linux distribution to work
with. I'll work with virtual machines so high requiriments do not represent
huge problems.
</p>

<p>
hoping someone reads this (and spends sometime answering it ;) ),
Galax

<h3>Stuck at April 2005 on Debian Etch</h3>

<b>Riccardo Tritto [riccardo.tritto at gmail.com]</b><br />
<b>Thu, 23 Nov 2006 19:35:23 +0100</b>
</p>

<p>
Hi there,
I have installed lg-all and lg-subscription on my Debian Etch, but I
only have issues 1 to 113 (April 2005) when pointing my browser
to /usr/share/doc/lg/index.html (or <a href="http://localhost/lg/">http://localhost/lg/</a>).
</p>

<p>
Is it normal that I miss issues 114 to 132 (as of today)?
</p>

<p>
Is perhaps the maintainer of the Debian packages still packing all those
missing issues?
</p>

<p>
Or perhaps something is wrong in my system?
</p>

<p>
Thanks for answering.

<h3>To split DVD video stream according to DVD menu - how ?</h3>
<p>
<b>Wladimir Mutel [mwg at mwg.dp.ua]</b><br />
<b>Sun, 19 Nov 2006 15:14:50 +0200</b>
</p>

<p>
Dear people,
</p>

<p>
	I have a DVD with several short films glued together into one
	big video-stream (and of course then split into 1GB VOBs).
	There is a menu on this DVD, which buttons trigger play of
	this stream from certain offsets (starts of separate shorts).
	On the ending of a short, playing continues into next one.
</p>

<p>
	My problem now is how to split this DVD structure back into
	separate mpeg/avi files, one for each short ? I.e., first, to
	read starting point data out of DVD menu buttons, next, sort
	these points in advance order, and last, extract resulting
	pieces/intervals from big DVD stream.
</p>

<p>
	I would prefer to solve this problem by using free software
	(transcode/mplayer/mencoder/mjpegtools/xine/wharever).
	I also would not mind writing a little program myself in
	C/Perl/shell if there are no existing command-line utilities to
	achieve this goal. And I would appreciate some initial
	directions from you. What is better to read and learn before
	I start ? I found out that DVD menu is plain MPEG2 file, but no
	great details about these buttons/actions. May be I should use
	libdvdnav ? What good examples to look into ?
</p>

<p>
	Thank you in advance for your reply.
</p>

<h3>Debian install gui</h3>

To: luv-main@luv.asn.au
From: Rick Moen &lt;rick@linuxmafia.com&gt;
Subject: Re: Debian install gui
</pre>
Quoting Peter McMullen (peter@mcmullen.net.au):
</p>


<p>
<pre>
&gt; There was a thread running a while ago about the alleged difficulty of
&gt; installing Debian, and much was mode of the lack of a GUI installer. 
&gt; 
&gt; Actually it does exist, and has for a while. It has been updated for
&gt; the Etch RC1, but its a bit of a secret. If you burn the install iso
&gt; and boot, it looks the same as it always has, but if you type
&gt; installgui instead of just hitting enter you get the new install
&gt; interface. 
&gt; 
&gt; Its a direct mapping of the old dialogue, so if you expect it to hook
&gt; gparted to help with partitioning, get used to disappointment. The
&gt; only significant difference, so far, is that it does sometimes ask
&gt; multiple questions on one page - e.g. for password verification.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
This illustrates yet again that, when less-technical users say "your
Linux distribution needs [foo]", they often mean something else entirely
-- or aren't really sure what they mean -- and have a bizarre tendency
to express themselves using code phrases.
</p>

<p>
That is, the code phrase "GUI installer" in this context usually turns
out to really have very little to do with graphics.  The speaker really
means "I want an OS installer that asks me very, very few questions and
does extensive hardware autoprobing."  I.e., (they believe) they want
completely automated installers, or as close as possible.
</p>


<p>
Old-timers may recall the antique debate point used by MS-Windows and
Macintoy OS users for years:  "Linux needs more applications."  After
hearing this for many years, I sat down with one of them, a longtime
Windows user, at a Linux desktop box and typed:
<pre>
$ grep Package: /var/lib/apt/lists/*Packages | wc -l
</pre>
I pointed out that the return value of 17,511 was the number of
currently available software packages, in that distribution.  Mr.
Windows said:  "Um, desktop productivity software, I mean."  So, I
showed the guy a list of the roughly dozen different full "office"
suites that were then available for x86 Linux systems.
<pre>
RM:  A dozen.  How many are enough office suites?  Two dozen?  A hundred?
Mr. Windows:  Well, I <em>thought</em> there weren't any at all.
RM:  And <em>why</em> did you think that?
Mr. Windows:  Well, I looked on the shelves in my corner software store.
RM:  So, because you can't conceive of getting software any other way
     than in a separate, extra-cost retail package, you simply 
     <em>assumed</em> that Linux "needs more applications".  By the way,
     how many office suites do <em>you</em> use?
Mr. Windows:  {face turning red}  One.
</pre>

Hello everyone

I've come across a small annoyance lately when I try to boot my PC.
When it tries to load GRUB, it tells me: 
<pre>
GRUB Disk Error 
</pre>
I can boot, the livecd which I installed from (Freespire BTW) has a boot
from hda1 option that I find quite useful right now, so I can boot.
I've tried re-installing GRUB from the commandline, and from the GRUB
shell, but to no luck at all.  From the commandline, I get told that
(paraphrasing) the drive has no bios disk.
</p>

<p>
Any help would be appreciated.

Subject: [conspire] Puzzle: How do you sort IP address lists?
</pre>
There's a maintenance task I have to do occasionally, that is very much
The Wrong Thing over the long term, but necessary in the sort term:  
I keep a blocklist of IP addresses that my SMTP server shouldn't accept
mail from.  SVLUG's server, on which I'm interim sysadmin, has a list
just like it.  Since I maintain both lists, it's logical to combine
them, run them through 'uniq' (to eliminate duplicates), and sort the
result -- to benefit both sites.  
</p>

<p>
That's where the 'puzzle' bit comes in.  But first, why it's The Wrong
Thing:
</p>

<p>
Security author Marcus J. Ranum has a dictum that 'enumerating badness'
is dumb (<a href="http://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/dumb/):">http://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/dumb/):</a>
<pre>
  Back in the early days of computer security, there were only a
  relatively small number of well-known security holes. That had a lot
  to do with the widespread adoption of "Default Permit" because, when
  there were only 15 well-known ways to hack into a network, it was
  possible to individually examine and think about those 15 attack
  vectors and block them. So security practitioners got into the habit
  of "Enumerating Badness" - listing all the bad things that we know
  about.  Once you list all the badness, then you can put things in
  place to detect it, or block it.
 
  Why is "Enumerating Badness" a dumb idea? It's a dumb idea because
  sometime around 1992 the amount of Badness in the Internet began to
  vastly outweigh the amount of Goodness. For every harmless,
  legitimate, application, there are dozens or hundreds of pieces of
  malware, worm tests, exploits, or viral code. Examine a typical
  antivirus package and you'll see it knows about 75,000+ viruses that
  might infect your machine. Compare that to the legitimate 30 or so apps
  that I've installed on my machine, and you can see it's rather dumb to
  try to track 75,000 pieces of Badness when even a simpleton could track
  30 pieces of Goodness.  [...]
</pre>
So, in keeping blocklists of IP addresses that have been zombified and 
used for mass-mailed spam, 419-scammail, etc., I'm aware of doing
something a bit <em>dumb</em>.  It's a losing stategy.  I'm doing it on
linuxmafia.com because the site is badly short on RAM and disk space
in the short term (still need to migrate to that VA Linux 2230), and
so software upgrades are deferred.  Similarly, the SVLUG host has a
scarily broken package system, and is therefore to be migrated rather
than worked on in place, as well.  So, we limp by on both machines with
some long-term losing anti-spam methods because they're short-term
palliatives.
</p>


<p>
Getting back to the puzzle, you'd think that GNU sort would be easily
adaptable to a list like this, right?  Consider this 11-address chunk
of linuxmafia.com's blocklist:

<h3>USB Drive Bad Sectors</h3>
<p>
<b></b><br />
<b>Fri, 27 Oct 2006 17:04:01 -0400</b>
</p>

<p>
Greetings,
</p>

<p>
I have Linux (2.6.15.6) booting from a USB drive.  My application is
machine control and I wanted to use something solid-state.  A USB stick
seemed like a good idea because it is cheap and readily available and
reasonably fast.
</p>

<p>
My problem is that I get file system corruption and "bad sectors" some
times, presumably due to an unclean shut down.  I am using an ext2
filesystem with the thinking that a journal would just wear out the
drive in a certain spot.  Maybe that's not correct -- I am not sure if
the drive has a wear-leveling algorithm implemented or not.
</p>

<p>
Questions:
</p>

<p>
1. Is ext2 the right choice?  Or would reiserfs be better? Vfat??
</p>

<p>
2. Is their a quick way to detect bad sectors?  I tried running e2fsck
-c but it has been 45 minutes so far!
</p>

<p>
I am thinking if I can detect the corruption, I can just reformat the
partition and restore it from another read-only partition.  The kernel
seems to report them:
<pre>
sd 5:0:0:0: SCSI error: return code = 0x08000002
sdb: Current: sense key=0x3
    ASC=0x11 ASCQ=0x0
end_request: I/O error, dev sdb, sector 598730
</pre>
I guess I could grep the messages log, but I don't think that is a
conclusive check.
</p>

<p>
Any pointers would be appreciated.
</p>
