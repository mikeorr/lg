Chez Moen is in the middle of a polity (Estados Unidos de Norte America)
that just had a minor election.  Taxonomically, we're in:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">[no city]</div>
<div class="line">County of San Mateo  &lt;- a corporation established by the state</div>
<div class="line">State of California  &lt;- smallest sovereign entity in this stack voting precinct #3402</div>
<div class="line">BushCo Empire (or whatever it's called, these days)</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>...plus six miscellaneous special districts, each with its own tax
authority.</p>
<p><strong>[Breen]</strong>
Thanks for the reference!</p>
<p>I worked this election the other day. I was at a precinct in 
Redwood City. The polls were open 13 hours and we had 79 voters.</p>
<p><strong>[Rick]</strong>
28% turnout, according to the <em>S.F. Chronicle</em>, a record low for
California.  I was one of the few people I checked with who voted
(though some had gotten stuck at work, and didn't make the polls in
time).</p>
<p>And thank you for helping the election effort, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>[Breen]</strong>
The precinct numbers are assigned by the counties - according to
the SecState <a class="reference" href="http://www.ss.ca.gov/elections/hava_introduction.htm">http://www.ss.ca.gov/elections/hava_introduction.htm</a>
there are about 25,000 precincts in the state.</p>
<p><strong>[Rick]</strong>
Incredible.  I would never have thought that our little county, alone,
would have over 4000.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Breen]</strong>
Dunno where the numbers come from, but the returns (in <em>Wednesday's</em>
Chron) showed 519 of 519 precincts reporting.</p>
<p>We're apparently due to replace the current tabulating machines with
something new next election. I don't know how fast those returns will
come in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>[Breen]</strong>
Note that although we have 5 supervisorial districts, everybody
in the county votes in all races.</p>
<p><strong>[Rick]</strong>
Yes, I had to double-check that a few times, myself.</p>
<p><strong>[Breen]</strong>
I'd never come across that 
before moving to San Mateo county. According to 
<a class="reference" href="http://uncorked.wachob.com/node/45">http://uncorked.wachob.com/node/45</a> we're one of two California 
counties that does this.</p>
<p><strong>[Rick]</strong>
For a while, I've felt sheepish over <em>not knowing</em> all the governmental
bodies I'm asked to vote on, what offices exist, what their terms of
office and expirations are, etc.  So, I decided to fix that, for my
household with this reference page:</p>
<p><a class="reference" href="http://linuxmafia.com/~rick/household.html">http://linuxmafia.com/~rick/household.html</a></p>
<p>Prepended at the top of the page is a quick-reference list of emergency 
contact telephone numbers, of various sorts.  Please ignore that.
(That's the part that's printed out and taped to the wall of the
kitchen.  No, I <em>don't</em> expect people to fire up Firefox following a
major earthquake.)</p>
<p>Having completed this labour, I'm struck by a couple of things:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>That's a very large number of people to vote on.  Ye gods!
The American mania for voting on everything yet lives.</li>
<li>Notice the ethnic diversity among surnames:  Chinese, Hispanics, 
Irishmen, Scandinavians, Slavs, Frenchmen, Scots, Assyrians, 
Armenians, Japanese, Englishmen, Italians, Germans (and one noted 
ex-Austrian), Welshmen, Jews.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have no larger point, but, for those of you who live in distant parts
of the world, my page might be of anthropological interest.  ;-&gt;</p>
<p><strong>[Breen]</strong>
Most extreme example of this I've heard of was a friend in Chicago
who had to vote up or down on some 200 judicial races in Cook 
County a couple of years ago.</p>
