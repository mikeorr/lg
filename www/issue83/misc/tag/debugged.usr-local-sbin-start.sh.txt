# Purpose: provide shortcut command to system init scripts
#       in /etc/init.d
#
# Note: I would prefer this to be a shell alias rather than a script.
#  However, aliases won't expand command line parameters.

# echo "command = /etc/init.d/$1 $0"
CMD=`basename $0`
# echo "CMD = $CMD"
/etc/init.d/$1 $CMD

exit 0
# All done
