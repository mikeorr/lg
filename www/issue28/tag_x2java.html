<p><strong>From Sheldon E. Newhouse on Tue, 31 Mar 1998 on the [linuxprog] 
	<a href="http://linux-lists.home.ml.org">mailing list</a></strong></p>

<P><strong>Are there any tools available to convert 
standard C code with X displays to java displays?  Basically, we have a 
long program which is written in C and does low level X output.  We would 
like to port it so that the number crunching part works on a back-end 
server and users can view output on java clients.  The part of the program 
that does the display is fairly short, but intimately connected with the 
X libraires.  Any ideas or references would be appreciated.  
<br><br> 
TIA,
<br>-sen</strong></p>

	align="left" border="0">I'm not sure about a "Java X Server" per 
se.  However there has been some work done on execution of remote X 
applications through a web browser interface.

<br><br>
 I have yet to use any of this stuff (I barely use X) --- so I can only 
 rely on hearsay and a bit of web searching.
   
<br><br>
 The first technology to consider is the latest release of X Windows 
 itself.  There was an initiative by the X Consortium (*)
 called "Broadway" --- this eventually became the widely accepted 
 code name (possibly widely excepted as well -- but we won't get into that) 
 for the entire X11R6.3 release.
<br>
<ul><li>(Formerly at <A HREF="http://www.x.org">http://www.x.org</A> 
	this now appears to be part of The Open Group at 
	<A HREF="http://www.opengroup.org/">http://www.opengroup.org/</A>)
</ul>
<br>
 Since I don't know most of the details it's probably best for me to
 just refer you to some online articles that discuss it:
<br>

<dl>
<dt>Broadway/Xweb FAQ
<dd><A HREF="http://www.broadwayinfo.com/bwfaq.htm"
	>http://www.broadwayinfo.com/bwfaq.htm</A>

<dt>Can X Survive on the Internet?  By Brad Weinert
<dd><A HREF="http://www.sigs.com/publications/docs/xspot/9609/xspot9609.d.execbrief.html">http://www.sigs.com/publications/docs/xspot/9609/xspot9609.d.execbrief.html</A>

<dd><A HREF="http://www.sigs.com/publications/docs/xspot/9603i/xspot9603.d.edit.html">http://www.sigs.com/publications/docs/xspot/9603/xspot9603.d.edit.html</A>
</dl>

<ul>
<li>Both of these articles at sigs.com seem to be
	  a bit out of date, now that ``Broadway'' has been
	  released.  However they offer a pretty quick 
	  preview of what X Web is supposed to be.
</ul>

<br>
 Note that the constraint of this approach is that it seems to require
 that you actually have an X Server on the clients.  This is great if
 you have just about any sort of Linux/Unix clients --- but may be
 prohibitive if you intend for Windows (NT, '95, or 3.x) or MacOS
 clients to access your applications.

<br><br>
 You might be able to deploy the MI/X server (a freely available X Server
 for Windows and MacOS)  but I don't know if it supports the X11R6.x
 "Broadway" features.  You can find out more about MI/X at
 <A HREF="http://tnt.microimages.com/freestuf/mix/"
	>http://tnt.microimages.com/freestuf/mix/</A> and read MicroImages 
Inc.'s FAQ at <A HREF="http://tnt.microimages.com/freestuf/mix/mix-faq.htm"
	>http://tnt.microimages.com/freestuf/mix/mix-faq.htm</A>.  

<br><br>
 A quick perusal of that suggests that it won't support the Broadway
 set of extensions (since the FAQ says that it doesn't support LBX --
 the "low bandwidth X" which is apparently a key part of Broadway).

<br><br>
 I don't know what commercial X Servers for Windows or the Mac will
 help --- but I needn't spend any more space on that issue since I
 you don't specify that as a requirement. Hummingbird's Exceed 
 (<A HREF="http://www.unipres.com/hbird/exceed/"
	>http://www.unipres.com/hbird/exceed/</A>) is a likely candidate.

<br><br>
 Another approach might be to provide your clients with VNC ---
 which was listed in Linux Weekly News 
(<A HREF="http://www.eklektix.com/lwn/">http://www.eklektix.com/lwn/</A>)
 a few weeks ago.  This has nothing to do with Java and almost nothing
 to do with X Windows.  However it does allow you to view X Windows 
 displays from Windows and Mac clients and vice versa --- using an 
 alternative to the X communications protocols.

<br><br>
 The potential advantage is that it sounds much easier to install and 
 configure than a Windows or MacOS X server.  Take a look at at the 
 "Olivetti and Oracle Research Laboratories" 
	(<A HREF="http://www.orl.co.uk/vnc/">http://www.orl.co.uk/vnc/</A>)
 for more on that.  Another advantage of this over MI/X would be that it 
 is open source available under the GPL --- MI/X is free to use but the 
 sources are not available.

<br><br>
 The two approaches that are more directly suggested by your 
 question are:
<br><blockquote>

	An Xlib to Java awt cross compiler (or class or library)

</blockquote><br>
 ... or:

<br><blockquote>
	An X Server for the Java virtual machine (a class that implements
	Xlib).

</blockquote><br>
 I suspect that both of these are feasible --- though the performance 
 costs of the latter may not make it palatable and I'm sure that the
 portability issues in each would be significant.

<br><br>
 Despite my search engine efforts I was unable to find any information
 on any work being done on either approach.  However,  I'm not an expert
 in Java and I don't keep up on it much.  So, maybe someone else here
 will help us out.

<br><br>
 I did look in several likely places at 
<A HREF="http://www.developer.com/directories/"
	>http://www.developer.com/directories/</A>
 (formerly the Gamelan archives).  The closest I found is a JXTerm ---
 allegedly an 'xterm' in Java.  This includes telnet and cut and paste
 features.  There are several Java terminal emulators including VT100,
 VT220, ANSI-BBS, TN3270 and TN5250 applets.  

<br><br>
 Meanwhile I've been hearing snippets of SCO's 
	(<A HREF="http://www.sco.com/">http://www.sco.com/</A>)
 "Tarantella" for the last year or so.  This apparently does act as
 an X Windows to Java gateway, providing a sort of "web desktop" or
 "webtop" as their marketing copy refers to it. It appears that you'd 
 have to install a SCO OpenServer system to either run your application 
 or to act as a gateway between your applications server and your clients.
 (I doubt sincerely that SCO will make Tarantella available for Linux
 --- and it doesn't seem to be written <em>in</em> Java).  I'm really curious
 as to how this works.

<br><br>
	(While I was writing this I installed a new copy of the Netscape
	RPM from my Red Hat CD -- this is a new system that I just built 
	from parts, it's running S.u.S.E. -- started an X session, started 
	Navigator, pointed my browswer at 
	<A HREF="http://tarantella.sco.com/">http://tarantella.sco.com/</A> and
	tried to access their demo.  It gets to some point before showing
	my anything like X or it's "webtop" with some complaint about a
	Java Security violation in some class or another.    Exiting and
	retrying got me further along.  Hint:  don't try 'Tarantella'
	during your first Navigator session.  Eventually I was able to
	get it running ...err... walking ...err... limping along.  
	It might be faster over a T1 or an ethernet -- I happen to be
	using the 28.8 PPP connection at the moment).

<br><br>
 If you're curious, go try the demo yourself.  You can also find a
 set of slides from a presentation by Andy Bovington (?) on:
<br><dl>

<dt>Controlling X/Motif apps from Java and Javascript. 
<dd><A HREF="http://www.sco.com/forum97/tarantella/presentations/bov/"
	>http://www.sco.com/forum97/tarantella/presentations/bov/</A>

</dl><br>
 In typical "big company" fashion SCO doesn't tell you how much this
 product costs. They expect you to fill out a survey and have their 
 sales critters call you.  

<br><br>
 I suspect that this circumlocution may result in more converts to 
 open source software than all of the other "freedom" arguments we can 
 muster.

<br><br>
 Meanwhile, my wife, Heather, found a couple of promising links 
 (she's the <em>real</em> search engine wiz in the family).

<br><br>
 Here's the most promising:

<br><dl>
<dt>Eugene O'Neil's XTC, the X Tool Collection
<dd><A HREF="http://www.cs.umb.edu/~eugene/XTC/"
	>http://www.cs.umb.edu/~eugene/XTC/</A>

</dl><br>
 ... which appears to be at the early alpha stages but, in his own 
 words:

<br><blockquote>
   ... is an implementation of the X Window Protocol, written in pure
   Java. It does not require any native C libraries, such as Xlib:
   instead, it is intended as a complete replacement for Xlib, written
   from the ground up to be flexible, object-oriented, and
   multi-threaded.

</blockquote><br>
 (Wow!)

<br><br>
 There was also some work done by a Mr. Igor Boukanov at:

<br><dl>
<dt>Pure Java X client
<dd><A HREF="http://asfys3.fi.uib.no/~boukanov/java.doc/lib.x.html"
	>http://asfys3.fi.uib.no/~boukanov/java.doc/lib.x.html</A>

</dl><br>
 By far the best technical information I found on X Windows in my
 search was:

<br>
<dl>
<dt>Kenton Lee's: Technical X Window System and Motif WWW Sites
<dd><A HREF="http://www.rahul.net/kenton/xsites.html"
	>http://www.rahul.net/kenton/xsites.html</A>
</dl><br>

 Kenton has the best set of links on the subject, and apparently has
 written articles for 'X Advisor Magazine' and several others.
