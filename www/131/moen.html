<h1>On Qmail, Forged Mail, and SPF Records</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/moen.html">Rick Moen</A></b></p>

<p>
Here's an object lesson in how <em>not</em> to do e-mail, with the role of 
global village idiot played by Prof. Daniel J. Bernstein's (DJB's) 
popular proprietary SMTP server package, qmail.
</p>


<h3>I. Qmail Follies</h3>

<p>
The trail starts with a virus-infected MS-Wind0ws box in Ireland on an
Eircom dynamic IP, which evidently has been energetically pumping out
copies of the MyDoom worm and sending them everywhere its tiny little
mind can think of, via Eircom's "smarthost" MTA boxes.
</p>

<p>
In one case, the forged malware mail was sent out addressed to TAG, 
with a claimed sender address of "MAILER-DAEMON@lists.linuxgazette.net", 
i.e., my own MTA's mail-housekeeping mailbox.  The Eircom host duly 
accepted this forgery and attempted delivery to my machine
(in its guise as lists.linuxgazette.net) -- which said very emphatically
"No" in its "550 Unsolicited spam" permanent-reject message.
</p>

<p>
Eircom tossed this result around its network, and eventually a different
Eircom host's "qmail-send" process was thus left holding the bag, and
had to decide whom to notify.  It decided to lob my MTA's reject notice
across the Internet to the forged claimed sender,
"MAILER-DAEMON@lists.linuxgazette.net", wrapped up inside an e-mail from
the null sender ("&lt;&gt;").
</p>

<p>
I can't really complain about the latter phase of this process, in
fairness:  Eircom's second MTA had no clue about the message's real
provenance, and had only forged header data to act on.  In that context,
it did the right thing.
</p>

<p>
The actual problem was at the <em>first</em> qmail instance, when that
program's qmail-smtpd module accepted the forgery in the first place.  
qmail-smtpd is a deliberately stupid program capable only of accepting
all incoming port-25 SMTP traffic without prejudice, handing the
received bytes over to the qmail-queue module for instantiation on-disk,
making an entry in a logfile, and closing the connection.
</p>  

<p>
DJB's admirers call this deliberate stupidity a feature, pointing out
that qmail's sparsity and modularity make it easier to deal with public
data safely.<a name="1_back"></a><a href="#1">[1]</a>  This is true, but
it comes at an excessive cost, namely the qmail-smtpd module's
designed-in helplessness to detect and reject forged and otherwise
aberrant mail: all incoming mail gets accepted and the connection
closed before its header or contents can even be looked over at all.
This is in stark contrast to its main open-source competitors, Postfix,
Exim, and sendmail -- all of which can intelligently inspect incoming
mail <em>before</em> saying yes or no to delivery.
</p>


<h3>II. Forgeries</h3>

<p>
qmail is thus distinctively guilty of one of this decade's leading
technological sins: generation of "backscatter spam" -- unwanted mail
sent to innocent parties whose sending addresses were forged in bulk
e-mail sent out by spammers and/or malware.  It's important to stress
that this is a <em>design</em> deficiency, one that's not curable without
redesigning and rewriting qmail's qmail-smtpd module (at minimum).
(And, if you're going to go to all that trouble, it's smarter to 
just switch to a good <em>open-source</em> MTA such as Postfix, instead.)
</p>

<p>
As I think I've mentioned before, mailing lists (as the leading modern
example of mail forwarders) are ground zero in the Internet's junkmail
wars, being frequently caught between spam/malware senders trying to
pump out junk and vigilant mail admins trying to reject it.  The MyDoom
malware e-mail concerned here was a case in point, having been
deliberately crafted to implicate "MAILER_DAEMON@lists.linuxgazette.net"
as an apparent sender -- a ploy called "Joe Job" mail after its first
known target, Joe Doll of joes.com (Joe's Cyberpost), against whom a
Chicago-area spammer launched a pernicious and clever "revenge spam"
attack on January 2, 1997, trying to punish Doll for the commendable
act of throwing the spammer off his free hosting service.<a
name="2_back"></a><a href="#2">[2]</a>
</p>

<p>
If Eircom had used a less deliberately stupid MTA, it <em>could</em> 
in theory have taken steps to determine that
"194-125-179-235.as1.mgr.mullingar.eircom.net" (one of Eircom's <em>own</em>
dynamic-IP addresses!) was an extremely doubtful source host for
"linuxgazette.net" mail.  However, there are also things <em>we</em> can do to
help such efforts:
</p>


<h3>III. SPF</h3>

<p>
We at Linux Gazette really need to get around to limiting the
<em>potential</em> for abuse by adding SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
<a name="3_back"></a><a href="#3">[3]</a> records to
the linuxgazette.net DNS for domain "linuxgazette.net" and subdomain
"lists.linuxgazette.net" -- records that specify for all other mail
systems <em>which</em> specific MTA hosts are solely authorised to originate
SMTP mail from our mail-handling hostnames (aka authorised to be our MX
or mail exchanger hosts).  Basically, an SPF record is a reverse-MX
record, in the same way that a PTR (reverse DNS) record is the mirrored
half of a forward-lookup "A" record -- which, if checked during mail 
delivery, permits rejecting forgeries.
</p>

<p>
To my knowledge, <em>only</em> kayos's host and mine legitimately handle our
outbound mail.<a name="4_back"></a><a href="#4">[4]</a>  Thus, a
suitable pair of SPF records would be as follows -- with each record
comprising a hostname, an SPF version number, and a list of "mechanisms"
(suggestions on what to do with mail from specified sets of hosts):
</p>

<pre class="code">
linuxgazette.net. IN TXT "v=spf1 a mx a:lists.linuxgazette.net -all"
lists.linuxgazette.net. IN TXT "v=spf1 a mx -all"
</pre>

<p>
Parsing the first one by parts:
</p>

<pre>
  linuxgazette.net.  #Identifies domain this is for.

  IN TXT  #INternet-style record of type TXT = freeform text, that being 
          #where SPF records are stored for lack of a dedicated SPF
          #reference record type assigned by the IANA, so far.  
          #(A dedicated record type has been applied for.)

  v=spf1  #Implementing SPF protocol version 1.

  a       #Honour as valid any "linuxgazette.net" mail arriving from our "A"
          #record host, which happens to be genetikayos.com, IP 64.246.26.120.

  mx      #Honour as valid "linuxgazette.net" mail arriving from any other 
          #host listed as type "MX" for that domain.  There aren't any, 
          #but this will allow for future ones.

  a:lists.linuxgazette.net  #Accept as valid "linuxgazette.net" mail 
          #from my host, too (just in case it's ever necessary for
          #my host to handle some).
  
  -all    #"all" is a catchall mechanism that matches if none of the foregoing
          #keywords do.  Modifier "-", here, advises receiving MTAs that they 
          #should hardfail all matching mail ostensibly from the 
          #"linuxgazette.net" domain, i.e., reject any such mail received from 
          #any SMTP host not enumerated above.
</pre>  

<p>
(The second SPF line, published for subdomain/host lists.linuxgazette.net, 
should be pretty easy to parse, being slightly simpler but generally similar.)
</p>

<p>
There are two alternatives to "-all":  The wishy-washy "?all" (neutral 
recommendation) is what, for example, aol.com and google.com publish,
and means "We're sort of <em>considering</em> SPF deployment, but for now are
saying nothing definitive about which hosts should be considered valid
mail exchangers."
</p>

<pre>
  $ dig -t TXT aol.com +short
  "v=spf1 ip4:152.163.225.0/24 ip4:205.188.139.0/24 ip4:205.188.144.0/24
  ip4:205.188.156.0/23 ip4:205.188.159.0/24 ip4:64.12.136.0/23
  ip4:64.12.138.0/24 ptr:mx.aol.com ?all"
  "spf2.0/pra ip4:152.163.225.0/24 ip4:205.188.139.0/24
  ip4:205.188.144.0/24 ip4:205.188.156.0/23 ip4:205.188.159.0/24
  ip4:64.12.136.0/23 ip4:64.12.138.0/24 ptr:mx.aol.com ?all"
  $
</pre>

<pre>
  $ dig -t TXT google.com +short
  "v=spf1 ptr ?all"
  $
</pre>

<p>
The slightly more confident "~all" (softfail recommendation) implies
"We're in transition to SPF, so please consider <em>doubting</em> the
authenticity of mail from mail exchangers other than the ones we're
listing here" -- but we advise against rejecting it out of hand."  
sendmail.com is using that model:
</p>

<pre>
  $ dig -t TXT sendmail.com +short
  "v=spf1 ip4:209.246.26.40 ip4:209.246.26.45 ip4:63.211.143.38
  ip4:209.246.26.36 ip4:209.246.26.12 ip4:209.246.26.24 ip:209.246.26.25
  ip4:209.246.26.10 ~all"
  $
</pre>

<p>
The fully unequivocal "-all" (hardfail recommendation) catchall (which I
recommend) means "Please consider this list of allowed hosts truly
definitive; we'd <em>prefer</em> that you summarily reject all mail purporting
to be ours but arriving from anywhere we don't list here."  The District
of Columbia-area tux.org LUG collective publishes that sort of record,
for example:
</p>

<pre>
  $ dig -t TXT tux.org +short
  "v=spf1 mx ptr -all"
  $
</pre>

<p>
Assuming I hear no serious objections, I'll be asking kayos to add the
hardfail-type lines specified above to our domain records, going
forward.
</p>

<p class="editorial">[ Objections? What objections? If I had a complaint,
it would be something like "why didn't <em>I</em> think of this a year ago?"
Thanks for taking care of it, Rick! -- Ben ]</p>

anti-spam activists on the Usenet news.admin.net-abuse-email newsgroup
whom the spammer attempted to lure into revenge-attacking Joe Doll,
through flamebait mail sent to me directly, forged so as to fool me
into thinking Doll had sent it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="3"></a><a href="#3_back">[3]</a> SPF is an oft-misunderstood
technical mechanism, very easy to add to one's published DNS records 
and with a bit more difficulty to SMTP servers, that makes it possible
for mail servers to determine at the moment of receipt if a piece of
mail's claimed sender is forged. The idea is for you as a domain
owner to declare (in special SPF reference records in your DNS) which
specific IPs/hostnames are the sole authorised sources of mail from your
domain.  Thereafter, any system receiving mail claimed to be from your
domain has the means to verify that assertion, checking the "envelope
From" and Return-Path headers' domain against your published SPF record.
</p>

<p>
If you care about your, your domain's, and its users' reputations, then 
<em>you should add</em> an SPF record to your DNS.  It's that simple --
and it's something you can easily do once, and never have to revisit
unless you move, add, or retire SMTP servers.
</p>   

<p>
Objections to SPF divide generally into "It doesn't achieve [additional 
desired goal foo]" and "It might interfere with my favourite way of 
relaying mail through multiple SMTP servers" categories (see whitepaper, 
below) -- all of which miss the point that publishing an SPF record is
<em>absolutely</em> in the interest of any domain owner. If you haven't
created one yet, what are you waiting for?
</p>

<p>

Note also the "SPF Setup Wizard" CGI at <a href="http://www.openspf.org/">http://www.openspf.org/</a>, that 
you can use to write prototype SPF records for domains.
</p>

<p>
How best, if at all, to implement the MTA (SMTP server) end of SPF,
i.e., the checking of SPF records at the time of receiving mail, is 
a separate discussion, another point commonly missed in discussions of
this subject. You as the sysadmin of an MTA always have within your
sole control whether your server will act at all on SPF information, and
whether it should follow particular SPF records' recommendations or not.
SPF is just published information: you can ignore it, implement it, 
do the exact opposite of its suggestions, or anything else you can dream
of. SPF does not break mailing lists (because they rewrite the 
"envelope From" and Return-Path headers) -- and there do exist ways to
implement other forms of mail-forwarding that don't trigger
unauthorised-MX suspicions. (Publishing SPF records isn't useful if, for
some strange reason, you cannot determine what SMTP hosts are supposed
to be legitimate senders of your outgoing mail -- but then, I'd say you
have bigger problems.)
