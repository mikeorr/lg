Patents are a recurring theme here, and there is a lot of good commentary on the net related to this topic.  
A recent development that has stirred some further debate is the release of a report by 
<a href="http://www.osriskmanagement.com/">Open Source Risk Management</a> outlining their reading of the patent
issues surrounding Free and Open Source Software.  OSRM has a business model built around selling legal support and
indemnification to clients in the Open Source community.
Some criticism of the report has focused on the 
<a href="http://linuxtoday.com/developer/2004080602926OPLL">
	potential it has to create feelings of uncertainty among businesses operating in this arena</a>.  While this is a valid concern,
it is not a reason to avoid discussion of these matters.  Indeed, as pointed out in Linux Weekly News,
these matters of patents and possible infringements
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/96870/">
affect proprietary software developers just as much as open source software developers</a>.
A useful 
<a href="http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2004/08/06/kernel_patent_risks.html">
	article at O'Reilly's linux devcenter</a> gives a good overview of some of the issues raised by the report,
and also includes responses from OSRM's Dan Ravicher to some of the criticisms and queries prompted by his work.
<P>
One way or another, discussion and debate around this issue is a good thing.
<!-- ========= --><p></p><hr><P></P><h3><img alt=" " src="../gx/bolt.gif"><font color="green"> Voting </font></h3><p>
LinuxWorld.com.au has 
<a href="http://www.linuxworld.com.au/index.php/id;537673802;fp;2;fpid;1">
reported on the fortunes of Free software in the implementation of Australian e-voting</a>.
Encouragingly, the initial system implemented was released under the GPL, however Software Improvements, the company
behind the software, has decided to release future versions under a more restrictive licence that will only
allow officials to view the code.  This is particularly disheartening since the Australian Capital Territory Electoral commission
had ordered that the software be open source.  To see the deal reneged on (in spirit if not in the legal sense) 
is a setback for open source software, and for
<a href="http://www.eff.org/Activism/E-voting/">e-voting</a> in general.

The Linux Terminal Server Project has announced the release of
<a href="http://www.ltsp.org/ltsp-4.1.html">LTSP 4.1</a>.
It includes the following: 
<ul>
<li>
 New installer 'ltspadmin'. This new installer makes it much easier for us to update packages, and for you to install them. The installer will know which version of the packages you have installed, and it will query the package repository to see if there are updates available. 
</li>
<li>
 Change from XFree86 to Xorg. LTSP is now using the Xservers and libraries from the Xorg project, rather than the XFree86 project. 
</li>
<li>
 Local CD-Rom and Floppy support. Using Supermount and Samba on the client, and the auto-mounter on the server, we can now make the CD-Rom and floppy drives available to the users. 
</li>
<li>
 Sound support with esd and nasd. The client-side sound daemons are now included for esound and nasd. 
</li>
<li>
 snmpd agent. We now have an snmpd agent on the client. You just need to enable it in lts.conf, with the following entries: 
</li>
<li>
 New kernel, based on 2.4.26. Also, the kernel is now installed via the ltspadmin utility, as part of the ltsp installation procedure. 
</li>
<li> Lots of bug fixes.
</li>
</ul>

Originally hailing from Ireland, Michael is currently living in Baden,

<p> Before this, Michael worked as a lecturer in the Department of
Mechanical Engineering, University College Dublin; the same
