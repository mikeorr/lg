<h1>Holiday Greetings to Everyone!</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/okopnik.html">Ben Okopnik</a> and <a href="../authors/tanaka-okopnik.html">Kat Tanaka Okopnik</a></b></p>

<h3>A Note from the Editor</h3>

<p>
<img src="misc/lg/Tux_NewYear_2008a.png" align="right" valign="top" alt="Tux in New Year's garb" />

Dear readers:<br>

This month, we at the Linux Gazette are taking a break. Frankly, we're
short of articles - and since it's the holiday season, your editor didn't
feel like fighting the tide. LG has been running non-stop since 1997 -
that's quite a record for an all-volunteer publication!
</p>

<p>
Wishing you and yours all the joys of the new year, whatever your
calendar of preference, and looking forward to maybe seeing some of you at
<a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/">SCaLE 6</a>. (Ben and Kat are
tentatively planning a westward excursion to <a
href="../authors/okopnik1.html">Michael's</a> first <em>ex utero</em> Linux
conference!)
</p>

<p>
Ben is the Editor-in-Chief for Linux Gazette and a member of The Answer Gang.
</p>

<p>
<em>
Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became interested in electricity
at the tender age of six, promptly demonstrated it by sticking a fork into
a socket and starting a fire, and has been falling down technological
mineshafts ever since. He has been working with computers since the Elder
Days, when they had to be built by soldering parts onto printed circuit
boards and programs had to fit into 4k of memory. He would gladly pay good
money to any psychologist who can cure him of the recurrent nightmares.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>
His subsequent experiences include creating software in nearly a dozen
languages, network and database maintenance during the approach of a
hurricane, and writing articles for publications ranging from sailing
magazines to technological journals. After a seven-year Atlantic/Caribbean
cruise under sail and passages up and down the East coast of the US, he is
currently anchored in St. Augustine, Florida. He works as a technical
instructor for Sun Microsystems and a private Open Source consultant/Web
developer. His current set of hobbies includes flying, yoga, martial arts,
motorcycles, writing, and Roman history; his Palm Pilot is crammed full of
alarms, many of which contain exclamation points.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>
He has been working with Linux since 1997, and credits it with his complete
loss of interest in waging nuclear warfare on parts of the Pacific Northwest.

<em>
<p>
Kat likes to tell people she's one of the youngest people to have learned
to program using punchcards on a mainframe (back in '83); but the truth is
that since then, despite many hours in front of various computer screens,
she's a computer user rather than a computer programmer.
</p>

<p>
When away from the keyboard, her hands have been found full of knitting
needles, various pens, henna, red-hot welding tools, upholsterer's shears,
and a pneumatic scaler.
