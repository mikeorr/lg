<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Wolfram|Alpha Launches Computational Knowledge Engine</h3>

<p>In May, Wolfram Research released Wolfram|Alpha, the world's first
computational knowledge engine, which free on the web.  Alpha, while
not exactly a search engine, is considered a new paradigm that could
challenge Google and other leading search engines.</p>

<p>Wolfram|Alpha draws on scientist Stephen Wolfram's groundbreaking work
on Mathematica, the world's leading technical computing software
platform, and on the discoveries he published in his
book, "A New Kind of Science."</p>

<p>The long-term goal of Wolfram|Alpha is to make all systematic
knowledge immediately computable and accessible to everyone.
Wolfram|Alpha draws on multiple terabytes of curated data and
synthesizes it into entirely new combinations and presentations. The
service answers questions, solves equations, cross-references data
types, projects future behaviors, and more. Wolfram|Alpha's example
pages and gallery show a few of the many uses of this new technology.</p>

<p>Finding Wolfram|Alpha Easter eggs has become a popular topic on
Mashable, the social media news guide and Facebook users have been
helping each other suggest and correct inputs.</p>

<p>"Fifty years ago," said Stephen Wolfram, the founder and CEO of
Wolfram Research, "when computers were young, people assumed that
they'd be able to ask a computer any factual question, and have it
compute the answer. I'm happy to say that we've successfully
built a system that delivers knowledge from a simple input field,
giving access to a huge system, with trillions of pieces of curated
data and millions of lines of algorithms. Wolfram|Alpha
signals a new paradigm for using computers and the web."</p>

<h4>Four Pillars of Wolfram|Alpha</h4>

<p>Wolfram|Alpha is made up of four main "pillars" or components:</p>

<p>* Curated Data: Wolfram|Alpha contains terabytes of factual data
covering a wide range of fields. Teams of subject-matter experts and
researchers collect and curate data, transforming it into computable
forms that can be understood and operated on by
computer algorithms;</p>

<p>* Dynamic Computation: When Wolfram|Alpha receives a user query, it
extracts the relevant facts from its stored computable data and then
applies a collection of tens of thousands of algorithms, creating and
synthesizing new relevant knowledge;</p>

<p>* Intuitive Language Understanding: To allow Wolfram|Alpha to
understand inputs entered in everyday language, its developers examine
the ways people express ideas within fields and subject matters and
continually refine algorithms that automatically recognize these
patterns;</p>

<p>* Computational Aesthetics: Wolfram|Alpha also represents a new
approach to user-interface design. The service takes user inputs and
builds a customized page of clearly and usefully presented computed
knowledge.</p>

<p>Wolfram|Alpha has been entirely developed and deployed using Wolfram
Research Inc's Mathematica technology. Wolfram|Alpha contains nearly
six million lines of Mathematica code, authored and maintained in
Wolfram Workbench. In its launch configuration, Wolfram|Alpha is
running Mathematica on about 10,000 processor cores distributed among
five colocation facilities, using gridMathematica-based parallelism.
And every query that comes into the system is served with
webMathematica.</p>

<p>The Wolfram|Alpha launch process has been broadcast live on Justin.tv
and documented on the Wolfram|Alpha blog and on its Twitter and
Facebook accounts. During the testing period leading up to the launch,
Wolfram|Alpha processed 13.7 million queries.</p>

<p>For more information on the launch of Wolfram|Alpha, see the blog at:

<h2>Software and Product News</h2>

<p>Red Hat has announced the availability of JBoss Enterprise Business
Rules Management System (BRMS), an open source business rules solution
that enables easier business policy and rules development, access, and
management and allows customers to update applications and processes
with business rules and policies. Automating business decisions with
JBoss Enterprise BRMS can enable business process stakeholders to
rapidly implement change.</p>

<p>Business rules are parameters that describe how an organization
performs work. Best practices require business rules to be maintained
separately from the software applications and services they govern in
order to maximize agility. If business rules are duplicated or
scattered across many applications, updates are costly, error prone,
and take weeks or months to implement. With JBoss Enterprise BRMS,
enterprises can update their business rules to reflect the day-to-day
business and regulatory environment as quickly as in a few hours.
Additionally, a BRMS enables non-technical staff to manage business
processes without programming.</p>

<p>"The combination of tight budgets, the increasing maturity of the
BRMS, and the continual improvement of open source technologies
creates a nearly perfect disruptive storm in the BRMS market," said
Stephen D. Hendrick, Group Vice President for Application Development
and Deployment Research at IDC. "Open source BRMS products that get
rule authoring, processing, and management right combined with a
significantly lower TCO will receive a strong positive reception in
the market."</p>

<p>JBoss Enterprise BRMS is an enterprise-ready open source business
rules management system which can be deployed with other JBoss
Middleware such as JBoss Enterprise SOA and Portal.</p>

<p>Key JBoss Enterprise BRMS features include: a Business Rules Engine
which can be updated through a range of tools, from editors and
spreadsheets to Eclipse; Web 2.0 Rules Authoring and Management Tools
with a Rich Internet Application (RIA) user interface; and a BRMS
Repository which enables version control of business rules artifacts,
including fact models, enumerations, functions, domain specific
languages (DSL) definitions, rules and tests.</p>

<p>JBoss Enterprise BRMS adds to Red Hat's overall portfolio of
middleware products that help application development, deployment and
integration.</p>

<p>Additional information on the JBoss Enterprise BRMS is available
online at <a href="http://www.jboss.com">http://www.jboss.com</a>.

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">rBuilder Becomes a Free Public Download</h3>

<p>At the end of April, rPath released its free version of rBuilder, a
solution for automating the packaging and management of applications.
rBuilder creates a self-contained package that includes an application
and all the components necessary for it to run in any bare metal,
hypervisor or cloud environment.</p>

<p>rBuilder captures all the configuration information and dependencies
between the components within the packaged system. The entire system
definition, including components and dependencies, are managed within
a version-controlled repository, which enables automated delivery of
updates and patches to the running system. The move gives companies a
way to reduce the cost and complexity of deploying and maintaining
enterprise applications. rBuilder is available for public download at
www.rpath.com/corp/free-rbuilder.</p>

users can install and run behind their enterprise firewalls and
integrate with existing development and systems management tools.
Unlike the commercial version, this free public download is limited to
20 running system instances in production. Once users reach this
threshold, they're obligated to establish a commercial relationship
with rPath. Additionally, support for this version is through the
community only. rBuilder Online is a community site for creating
public and private virtual appliance projects.</p>

<p>rBuilder features a dynamic user interface and wizard-driven
processes that guide users through the creation of a complete,
self-contained and ready-to-run system. rBuilder features include:</p>

<p>* Automated dependency discovery. rBuilder introspects the
application to identify and resolve the full breadth of dependencies
the application requires to run;<br />
* Automated update. Deep dependency tracking and version control
allow users to automatically and safely deliver updates and patches to
running systems;<br />
* Multiple platform options. Users can select between any of a
number of Linux options as the foundation for their appliance and can

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Ixia Provides Testing Solution for Virtualized Data Centers</h3>

<p>Ixia a provider of IP performance test systems, has announced the IxVM
product suite that enables data center managers to assess virtual
infrastructure performance and capacity. IxVM builds on Ixia's
industry-leading library of layer 2-7 performance test tools.</p>

<p>Ixia's new suite of IxVM products can test layer 2/3 virtual network
resources and layer 4-7 virtual applications. IxChariot VM, a
component of IxVM, uses software endpoints - small software components
that run on each virtual machine - that send and receive test traffic,
while measuring performance. This makes it possible to source traffic
from virtual servers in the same manner as the supported applications.
IxExplorer VM uses software endpoints to generate layer 2/3 traffic to
test features such as VLAN and QoS.</p>

<p>"In our rush to cash in on the benefits of virtualization, we seem to
have overlooked the problems associated with assessing the end to end
performance of virtualized networks," said Zeus Keravala, Senior
Analyst at Yankee Group. "IxVM provides the vantage points for
emulating and measuring system performance down to the virtual
component. Ixia has demonstrated strong leadership and claimed first
mover advantage by filling this gap with their virtualization test
initiative."</p>

<p>IxVM allows:<br />
* performance testing of thousands of VMs simultaneously with real
world application traffic;<br />
* independent measurement and convergence testing of VM migration;<br />
* tuning of virtual resources such as servers and NICs;<br />
* measurement of key performance indicators like delay, jitter or
packet loss through virtual switches;<br />
* testing of network performance variances when running
applications over different operating system.</p>

<p>IxVM presents an aggregated performance view. Integrating with VMware,
IxVM automatically discovers the components of the virtualized
architecture. Pre-deployment testing can compare and contrast
performance from alternative configurations or evaluate performance
when applications are moved between virtual machines and could uncover
dynamic bottlenecks that may be unanticipated.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">WSO2 Data Services 2.0 Offers Componentized SOA Framework</h3>

<p>WSO2, an open source SOA company, has launched WSO2 Data Services 2.0.
The completely re-architected open source WSO2 Data Services product
is now based on WSO2 Carbon, a componentized service-oriented
architecture (SOA) framework.</p>

<p>The modular WSO2 Data Services 2.0 product enables database
administrators (DBAs) and database programmers to create and manage
WS-* style Web services and REST-style Web resources using enterprise
data. It is based on the WSO2 Carbon framework, in which all major
features of WSO2 SOA middleware products have been developed as
pluggable Carbon components. Users no longer need to deploy WSO2 Data
Services 2.0 and the WSO2 Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) 2.0 as separate
products. Instead, users can simply add the WSO2 mediation component
to WSO2 Data Services.</p>

<p>"WSO2 Data Services addresses the demand among enterprises to quickly
and easily take data from a wide variety of sources and expose it as
Web services within their SOAs,"said Dr. Sanjiva Weerawarana, founder
and CEO of WSO2.</p>

<p>Customization can range from simply reformatting the Data Services
logs into a preferred format to writing a bridge application that
allows the Data Services server to be remotely managed--and even
restarted--via a mobile phone.</p>

<p>Other new features in WSO2 Data Services 2.0 include:<br />
* Enhanced administration user interface;<br />
* WS-Policy Editor to configure services using the W3C standard;<br />
* Support for event-driven architectures (EDA);<br />
* One front-end server to be used to administer several back-end
servers simultaneously.</p>

<p>WSO2 Data Services supports access to data stored in relational
databases such as Oracle, MySQL and IBM DB2 (virtually any database
accessible via JDBC), as well as the comma-separated values (CSV) file
format, and Excel spreadsheets. Services can be authenticated,
encrypted and/or signed using the WS-Security and HTTP security
standards, and support for WS-ReliableMessaging provides
enterprise-level reliability.</p>

<p>WSO2 Data Services 2.0 is now part of the WSO2 Carbon SOA framework,
based on the OSGi specification, that provides all WSO2 Carbon SOA
components with enterprise-class management, security, clustering,
logging, statistics, tracing, and a "Try-It" wizard that makes it
simple to instantly test data services. Additionally, WSO2 Data
Services uses the graphical unified management console, which supports
all Carbon components and provides enhanced administration. Any
components added to WSO2 Data Services 2.0 are automatically
recognized by the core Carbon platform and unified management console</p>

<p>WSO2 delivered its online course "Introduction to Data Services"for
free in May. As a special promotion, the usual $199 course fee was
waived. Check <a href="http://wso2.com/training/">http://wso2.com/training/</a> to see if the course is free
again in June or July.</p>

<p>As a fully open source solution released under the Apache License 2.0,
WSO2 Data Services does not carry any software licensing or
subscription fees.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Citrix Synergy Product News</h3>

<h4>Enhanced Citrix Cloud Center</h4>

<p>At Citrix Synergy in May, Citrix Systems announced a variety of new
offerings for its Citrix Cloud Center (Citrix C3) product family to
further equip service providers with the infrastructure and product
licensing needed to deliver successful clouds services to their
customers.</p>

<p>The updates to the Citrix C3 product family enable service providers
to create secure multi-tenant cloud infrastructure environments in a
cost effective manner.  New capabilities include:</p>

<p>* Citrix XenApp and Citrix XenDesktop - The addition of these two
products into Citrix C3 enable service providers to take their
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offerings to a new level and even
deliver Windows Desktops as a Service (DaaS);<br />
* The CSP program - The CSP program is designed for service providers
who provide hosted software services to end-user customers who are not
the licensee. The CSP program extends to service providers the "right
to use" Citrix products as a monthly "active subscriber". Service
providers only pay for actual end-user usage;<br />
* Citrix NetScaler VPX - A virtual appliance version of Citrix
NetScaler, the new Citrix NetScaler VPX will be added to Citrix C3,
enabling service providers to run multiple NetScaler instances
simultaneously and provide cost-effective multi-tenancy web
application delivery. In addition, service providers can use "cloud
balancing," which allows load balancing across multiple cloud
infrastructures;<br />
* Citrix XenServer - XenServer will soon be enhanced with a new
distributed virtual switch add-on to enable secure, multi-tenant
public clouds.  The switch will partition network traffic on a
per-application basis, with resource and security guarantees, and
offer full visibility into and control over inter-VM traffic within a
server and virtual network overlay.</p>

<p>Citrix is now providing Citrix C3 Lab Blueprints, giving IT
professionals a set of common scenarios to test, architectural
overviews, deployment guides, tips and tricks and discussion forums.</p>

<p>Citrix C3, with XenApp and XenDesktop, and a technological preview of
NetScaler VPX are available for free download from Citrix.com.  A
technological preview of XenServer virtual switch for XenServer 5.5
will be available for free download from Citrix.com on June 1, 2009.
Access to the Citrix C3 Lab and Citrix C3 Lab Blueprints is available
now at: <a href="http://community.citrix.com/display/cdn/Citrix+C3+Lab">http://community.citrix.com/display/cdn/Citrix+C3+Lab</a>.</p>

<h4>Citrix Announces C3 Lab Built on Amazon Web Services</h4>

<p>Citrix Systems announced a new cloud solution called Citrix C3 Lab
that allows companies to use Amazon Web Services (AWS) as part of
their technology infrastructure.  This announcement comes in response
to the growing demand by organizations to use virtualization
technologies to deploy, maintain and access business applications and
desktops in more flexible and efficient ways through the Internet.</p>

<p>Based on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Simple
Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Citrix Cloud Center (Citrix C3)
technologies, this new cloud-based lab environment allows IT
professionals to prototype future cloud projects today.</p>

<p>Citrix C3 Lab is designed to provide an inexpensive, preconfigured
environment for IT professionals to prototype solutions and includes
technical components required to create a robust application delivery
center in the cloud.  Initially, lab users will have access to Citrix
XenApp alongside key Citrix C3 technologies such as Citrix Access
Gateway and Citrix Repeater in the AWS cloud environment. Citrix is
also providing Citrix C3 Lab Blueprints.</p>

<p>Citrix C3 Lab is available immediately and there is no additional
charge for running Citrix C3 Lab instances in Amazon EC2 - all a
Citrix customer needs to do to get started is create an AWS account.
Citrix C3 Lab will also be made available for public use as a set of
Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) within Amazon EC2. Amazon EC2 is an on
demand, utility-priced service, with charges based on the size and
capacity of the virtual server.</p>

<h4>Citrix Dazzle and Receiver Simplify Virtual Apps</h4>

<p>Citrix Systems introduced an on-demand service for enterprise
applications called Citrix Dazzle. For the enterprise customers
already using Citrix XenApp and Citrix XenDesktop, Dazzle supports
self-service IT by giving users simple access to apps and IT services
in web model like the iTunes store.</p>

<p>Dazzle is fully integrated with Citrix Receiver, a new universal
software client that makes it easy for users to access corporate apps
and desktops from any device they choose. Dazzle also interfaces
directly with Citrix Merchandising Server, a new head-end management
system that allows for IT to actually "merchandise" apps to users, not
just deliver them. With Merchandising Server, for example,
administrators can set up a list of "recommended apps" in Dazzle that
highlights applications they want to promote to employees - or even
post "advertisements" for new or under-utilized IT applications.</p>

<p>Citrix Receiver allows IT organizations to deliver desktops and
applications as an on-demand service to any device in any location.
Following an initial download and installation, Receiver sits quietly
in the background and "listens" for signals from the corporate
"delivery center". This allows IT to deliver any app or desktop from
Citrix Delivery Center head-end controllers like Citrix XenApp and
Citrix XenDesktop, to any device with a Receiver installed. Should
employees want to access their work environment from a home PC or Mac
laptop, they simply go to a URL given to them by IT and download a
Receiver for that device as well. As long as Citrix Receiver is
installed on a device, IT has complete control over security,
performance, and user experience, allowing them to deliver IT services
on-demand.</p>

<p>Receiver is an enhanced display agent for applications hosted on
backend servers.</p>

<p>Under the hood, Citrix Receiver is a lightweight universal software
client with an extensible browser-like "plug-in" architecture.
Receiver comes standard with a variety of plug-ins that communicate
with head-end infrastructure in the Citrix Delivery Center product
family such as XenApp, XenDesktop, Citrix Access Gateway and Branch
Repeater. These plug-ins support functionality such as online and
off-line app usage, virtual desktop delivery, secure access control,
password management, app acceleration, multimedia acceleration,
service-level monitoring and voice communications.</p>

<p>Citrix Receiver is free and is available immediately for PCs, laptops,
netbooks and thin clients. Citrix Receiver for Apple's iPhone is also
available immediately as a free download from the Apple App Store.
Citrix told Linux Gazette that it is partnering with Open Kernel Labs
to extend reciever to other smart phones and their first effort will
be phones based on the Android mobile Linux operating system.</p>

<p>Citrix Merchandising Server is also available at no charge. Both
Receiver and Merchandising Server require infrastructure products from
the Citrix Delivery Center product family to complete their
operations.</p>


<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Xen 3.4 Hypervisor Now Available</h3>
