<h1>Notes from Linux World 2005 - San Francisco: Linux World goes Enterprise</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>With a deluge of product announcements and a heady debate on the
future of software patents, the Linux World Conference and Expo
(LW2005) sailed into San Francisco in early August. Debian
announced its intention to go more commercial, and Darth Vader and
representatives of the Evil Empire up north made an appearance as
well.</p>

<p>This was fun as always, but some of the flavor of past LW
conferences was missing.</p>

<p>To some extent, this was less a Linux World conference and more
an Open Source Software conference, with many major companies
showing off their Open Source credentials. Just look at the keynote
presenters, starting with Oracle, HP, and IBM, (See the <a href=
"http://www.linuxworldexpo.com/live/12/events/12SFO05A/keynotes">conference
website</a>) then there were the Red Hat and Mozilla presentations.
Certainly there were good panels, like the one OSDL presented on
software patents, but the 500 pound gorillas dominated.</p>

<p>Of course, IDG, the conference organizer, did say that the
"prevailing theme of this summer's conference program will be Linux
in the enterprise." They did emphasize that the "conference program
will illustrate how enterprises are reaping the business benefits
of Linux and Open Source," so there were presentations on Grid
offerings and on calculating the ROI of using Open Source Software
in the Enterprise.</p>

<p>Many alumni I spoke with noticed the change in emphasis and were
wistful for the older, Linux bad-boy attitudes and the give and
take of technical presentations where peers openly disagreed. To be
sure, there was some of that, but there were more suits and better
shoes at LW2005, and that boosted attendance at both the conference
and the expo. Perhaps this is the inevitable fallout of getting
corporate elephants to dance...</p>

<h3>Strong set of conference tutorials</h3>

<p>Linux World had an opening day of tutorials organized into 1 or
2 sessions of 3 hours, followed by three days of conference
sessions and the Expo. I did see a few folks who went just to a
tutorial and then the Expo, even though the keynote speeches were
open to all.</p>

<p>The topics spanned included Samba and its administration,
hardening Linux systems (taught by Bastille Linux creator Jay
Beal), a Linux cluster hands-on lab, Xen and other Virtualization
Techniques, a session on the Novell kernel debugger, and a detailed
look at Google APIs and utilities. There was also a 2-part Linux
system administration track. Each tutorial had a book of slides and
some additional reference material. Since they were priced fairly,
this was a good deal.</p>

<p>Jay Beal's system hardening materials were based on material
from <a href=
"http://www.bastille-linux.org/jay/security_talks.htm">his security
talks website</a>, which includes links to an earlier BlackHat
presentation on locking down Solaris and Linux that was shrunk a
bit for his LW2005 tutorial. Of course, many of his points are
incorporated in the <a href="http://www.bastille-linux.org/">Bastille Linux</a> scripts, which
also offer good explanations for its many security options. Use
those scripts and check out the <a href=
"http://www.bastille-linux.org/jay/security_talks.htm">security
talks</a> link.</p>

<p>The tutorial for web developers on using Google utilities and
APIs was taught by Deryck Hodge of the Samba team. It covered
custom searches, using the Google API as a Web Service with Perl
and Python, gcli as an interactive "shell" for Google searches,
GMail tricks, XML parsing, and building custom maps for display. He
promised to have "code and tutorial stuff" available on <a href=
"http://www.devurandom.org/googledevel/">his updated
website.</a></p>

<p>There also was a 3-day, conference-long session on Linux System
Administration in a large room that was open to any full conference
participant. That tied in very nicely with the 'free' (as in beer)
Linux certification exams offered by LPI, the Linux Professional
Institute &mdash; Expo attendees were offered the exams for only
$25 instead of the usual $100, so a newbie could (with some outside
reading) attend part or all of the 3-day session and have a good
shot at the basic certification.</p>

<h3>Good track of security presentations</h3>

<p>Several of the security presentations were led by Jay Beal (who
presented the Linux hardening tutorial), but many other presenters
rounded out the topic. The first session, "Linux Security Report",
was presented by Coverity creator Seth Hallem. He advocated using
static code analysis to find as many potential bugs as possible, and
his tool (Coverity Prevention, a spinoff from a grad project at
Stanford University) is very good at finding those static bugs. 
 His main point was that good
static analysis will run down more code paths than test cases can,
and will check all variables, working toward a goal of zero
compromising defects. Large software vendors like Oracle, Cisco, and
Sun seem to have joined the Coverity static analysis camp.</p>

<p>He presented a lot of statistical data: security vulnerabilities
go up with more code (but Linux seems to mostly reverse this),
developers spend about 40% of their time on reworking buggy code,
the vast majority of security flaws are from detectable bugs not
caught by limited test cases, etc. One key result: Linux was very
good in comparison with commercial software of its size and
complexity.</p>

<p>Another key result: over half of the bugs in Linux were in the
device drivers, with only 1% in the kernel (and most of these due
to the addition of new features). That's especially good, since
many Linux installations will not use the problematical drivers.
They discovered 1,008 defects in other parts of version 2.6.12 
outside of the file system and kernel. Below is a pie chart of
those defects.

vulnerabilities go up with more device driver code):

<h3>Evil Empire at LW2005</h3>

<p>Among the surprises at LW2004 was the appearance of Microsoft in
sessions and in the vaulted Golden Penguin Bowl contest. This year
had Microsofties competing with Google geeks, who won handily, but
the crew from Redmond performed fairly well, actually listing
almost as many UNIX variations as the winning Google team in the
final round. In the spirit of the occasion, the MS trio came
dressed as 2 Imperial Storm Troopers and Darth Vader (where did
they get those great outfits?!!).</p>

<p>That was fun, but is this the proverbial "wolf in sheep's
clothing" syndrome? Is MS trying to put on an Open Source party
hat while surrounding and assimilating Linux as just a better Unix
that's easier to manage with MS tools and utilities? Or are they
genuinely turning over a new leaf?</p>

<p>Bill Hilf, Director of Platform Technology Strategy at
Microsoft, presented one of the more surprising sessions, S42:
"Managing Linux in a mixed environment... at Microsoft?: A look
inside the Linux/Open Source Software lab at Microsoft". His
biography showed a long history of open source credits, including
being a senior IT architect at IBM and leading Linux technical
strategy for their global markets organization. He was one of the
storm troopers, answering most of the Penguin Bowl questions. Unfortunately, his
on-line LW2005 slides consist only of the title slide. He was
also interviewed the day before <a href=
"http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/08/08/1247220&amp;tid=109&amp;tid=11&amp;tid=106">
on Slashdot.</a></p>

<p>Hilf said that MS wanted a real expert on Linux and Open Source
software, "...not someone to kill the penguin." He also noted that
his team regularly uses "over 40 different flavors of Linux and
BSD, plus several commercial Unix" products.</p>

<p>Hilf spoke the language of the audience and certainly had the
right credentials; it felt like a peer was addressing the
audience. Hilf gave us spins and feeds, diagrammed a very large
test data center of over 300 clients and servers, and showed us
real Linux servers running Open Source software at the evil empire.
He also explained how reluctant MS co-workers were eventually won
over (after uncovering SMB errors with a Samba SMB Torture suite)
and became interested in his lab as an integration test bed. But he
gradually tempted everyone present with current or beta integration
tools based on MS tech, especially the MS Virtual Server. He said
it was a full product (minus a box) worth $1000 and most attendees
made sure to get the software as they left.</p>

<p>His last (and most persuasive) effort, was a demo displaying the
ease of scripting in Monad/MSH, a kind of .Net enhanced Bash shell
with POSIX features. And it's good, very good. Its a familiar shell
environment that also leverages the .Net infrastructure and can
control services in both the Linux and Windows spheres. It's also a
trail of honey to win some mindshare among system administrators
and younger Linux users. Here's <a href=
"http://www.developer.com/net/article.php/3286851">more on
MSH.</a></p>

<p>All this will make it easier to integrate Linux and Windows - in
fact, any Unix work-alike - yet it seems specifically planned to
favor managing the integration from the Windows side.</p>

<p>After LW2005, at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco,
Microsoft announced its upcoming Virtual Server upgrade would
support the virtualization of both Linux and Solaris operating
systems on Windows servers. Is this a new strategy to surround and
'assimilate' Linux? (Remember that magazine cover before the Web
showing <a href=
"http://images.slashdot.org/topics/topicms.gif">Bill Gates as a
Borg?</a> What will another year or two bring?)</p>

<p>Just after LW2005 there were articles about a potential deal
with OSDL and Microsoft to do so-called independent research on the
prospective advantages of Windows and Linux. Was this the camel
getting its nose in the tent, or is this just a continuation of the
rapprochement started with Sun in the last year? After all, back in
July, OSDL leader Stuart Cohen said he could "...see Microsoft
participate in software that runs on top of Linux in the
future."</p>

<p>Is a deal with OSDL good for Linux and the community? While
truly independent research helps us all, there is probably no way
that the results would not be exploited by Microsoft (and they
probably expect to pick up some points with their latest version of
WinServer). As I finish this article, there seems to be a <a
href="http://www.osdir.com/Article7121.phtml">complete rejection</a> of the
joint study by OSDL. It seems that OSDL asked MS to release its Office
Suite on Linux as a test and MS balked. Figures...</p>

<h3>Keynotes and press conferences -- DCCA is born</h3>
There were many press announcements but among the most significant
was the announcement of the Debian Common Core Alliance. Although
there isn't a clear consensus on whether or not this is the best
thing for Linux, most long term Linux users at the conference
seemed accepting if not enthusiastic about the development, along
with large doses of skepticism. Several sources suggested that a
common core may be the best that the Debian community can muster
since so many organizations and individuals are involved. But the
needs of the large base of Debian users makes this move necessary.

<p>One commenter opined that having a common core (supported by
less than 70% of the Debian organizations) would not actually
create more Debian forks, but also may not significantly reduce the
current number of Debian forks.</p>

<p>Ian Murdock, co-creator of Debian Linux, introduced the the DCCA
at a press conference on the first day of LW2005. Key among the
goals for the first common core release is full Linux binary
compatibility, which means supporting the LSB Linux Standards Base
(DCC will be compatible with LSB packages which use the RPM format
by using the 'alien' tool to translate the package into native
Debian format, since LSB specifies the format, not the RPM suite). A
major secondary goal is having more regular release cycles. DCCA
hopes to track LSB releases, roughly an 18 month cycle. Beyond
that, the goal is to create a 100% Debian core that can support
enterprise business users and their applications and accelerate
acceptance of Debian.</p>

<p>DCC is not a Linux distribution. Its better thought of as a
software repository with common fixes and updates. Individual
distros will use that core and also contribute to it. ISVs would
also certify applications to that core. Among the initial DCCA
founding members are Xandros, Knoppix, Linspire, Mepis, and SunWah.
More Debian distros and some hardware vendors are expected to join
by year end.</p>

<p>The first DCC release is expected in mid-September. It will be
based on Debian 3.1 and should be certified to LSB 3. DCC version
numbers are based on the major version of LSB.</p>

<p>Bruce Perens of Open Source Labs spoke favorably about DCCA at
the initial press conference and also the next day at panel of
Linux/Open Source software authors linked with the PTR/Perens
publishing project. Check out the <a href=
"http://www.phptr.com/promotions/promotion.asp?promo=1484&amp;redir=1&amp;rl=1">
PTR site</a> for downloadable books.</p>

<p>According to Bruce, the DCCA will provide a way to "certify to a
Linux distribution, [while having]... multiple support providers
who... differentiate themselves at a higher level up the stack." He
also noted that globally Debian Linuxes have 2-3x the installed
base of SUSE Linux, and this will expand that base.</p>

<p>I spoke with Ian Murdock just before the article submission deadline,
and he said "We're in heads-down mode, working on DCC 3.0, the first
version of DCC, based on the 2.6.12 kernel... On the engineering front,
it's going well." Ian commented on the partner certification program,
"...at the end of the day our goal is to have a core that ISVs, etc., can
certify to... An ISV would certify once and that would be it."</p>

<p>Ian added, "Debian is a community project. We are also becoming
active as the DCC in other Linux projects. For example, we don't
want to define our own standards; we want help LSB to define
formal standards that will be used for all Linux versions, such as
package-name issues, and then we'll do a specific implementation
for Debian. We want to be additive to existing projects, not
reinvent anything."</p>

<p>"I'd love to see DCC play a role on the LSB project; standards
with implementation associated with them are always more successful
than generalized standards. If DCC could become a reference
implementation, it would make LSB and DCC stronger and also make
the whole Linux world stronger."</p>

<h3>Freeing Up Software Patents</h3>

<p>Open Source software and the future of software patents were
touched on by 2 different keynotes, one by RedHat deputy general
counsel, Mark Webbink, and also in a panel moderated by Stuart Cohen,
CEO of Open Source Development Labs, as well as the author panel.
Webbink spoke about the innovation-crushing effect of software
patents and called on Microsoft to refrain from using software
patents against users and individual developers. (Software
Protection and the Impact on Innovation)</p>

<p>Software patents are more contentious than copyrights and
hardware patents, which cover a single object or entity. Software
patents typically try to patent ideas, processes, sequences, and
even appearances. A pharmaceutical patent would typical cover a
single formula or drug family, specified fairly precisely. Software
developers run afoul of software patents more often because they
are more vague and there have been too many granted for trivial or
non-unique 'inventions'.</p>

<p>There currently are over 150,000 software patents, growing at
about 10,000 a year. Webbink noted patent searches often cost $5000
each. Searching and analyzing even only 3000 patents would cost
$1.5 million. He added that MS alone plans to file 1000-2000
software patents a year.</p>

<p>"What if Dan Bricklin had patented VisiCalc? that would have
locked up spreadsheet software through the year 2000." Webbink said
many current software patents are not that significant. He noted
that MS has a patent for adding and removing white space in a
document.</p>

<p>He stridently criticized the patenting of software code alone.
Patents should be applied only to unique inventions. He concluded
by saying that software patents are used primarily to block
innovation by competitors.</p>

<p>OSDL hopes to create a patent repository that will support the
Open Source software community and not to restrict innovation. This
would be accomplished by major ISVs, like IBM, Oracle, Novell, Red
Hat, etc. giving their intellectual property to OSDL or another
non-profit to administer.</p>

<p>Perens, at the author panel, noted that "... every large Open
Source software project infringes on some patents, but these are
bad patents," adding that "we need significant patent reform in the
US". He was also skeptical of the OSDL patent pooling idea, as many
of those patents may be encumbered by cross-licensing agreements
and won't be that useful in defending Open Source software. "This
is spitting in the wind", he added, and not reforming existing
law.</p>

<p>Diane Peters, general counsel for OSDL, recently offered more
detail on the OSDL Patent Commons project. See <a href=
"http://www.itbusinessedge.com/reports/los20050823.html#3Q">this
report</a> for OSDL's position.</p>

<p>Eben Moglen, Chair of Software Freedom Law Center, spoke at the
OSDL panel keynote and supported the project. "OSDL is the ideal
steward for such an important legal initiative as the patent
commons project... there is strength in numbers and when individual
contributions are collected together it creates a protective haven where
developers can innovate without fear."</p>

<h3>Of Swag and Collateral</h3>

<p>The Expo had a lot of vendors and a lot of freebies, including a
program of free sessions on each day. Among the best freebies were
Linux penguins, cloth creatures from Sun Wah and Novell, both cuddly. There
was also the 10-inch Dilbert doll from EMC. My fiancee loved all of
them!</p>

<p>VMWare, as part of its efforts to contribute to the Open Source
software community, brought attention to itself by giving full user
licenses to VMWare desktop for all Expo visitors who registered at
the booth. (but it has been about 30 days and I still haven't
gotten my license yet). This one does not expire...</p>

<p>Besides several CDs of software and collateral info, IBM also
passed out a flashlight with a bright white LED. The interesting
part is that this one is recharged by a USB port. (So if the power
fails, you can find your way out of your cubicle...)</p>

<p>Besides its ubiquitous red baseball hats, Red Hat also handed
out thousands of 4 oz. chocolate "Shadow" bars, which were tasty
and included a slip under the wrapper with an offer code for $100
off any Red Hat class for the rest of 2005 (extra sweet... BTW, the
code # is 458551W).</p>

<p>Novell also offered green SUSE hats at their booth, some of
which were later found on the "Pike 'O Shame" at the Fedora booth,
along with a few skewered cuddly SUSE lizards (the announced Open
SUSE will have some proprietary Novell code which is encumbered by
cross-licensing deals for now - but they intend to 'open' that
soon, but apparently not soon enough for Fedora loyalists). See,
this still is a colorful community!</p>

<p>Oracle ran its annual Linux install-fest on two "Birds of a Feather" (BOF) evenings
(thanks to Kurt Hackel for organizing it so well) and participants
at this BOF got trial SUSE and Red Hat software CDs and NEW Oracle
10g <em>R2</em> CDs plus a light dinner. And I think that was the only
food at the BOFs.</p>

<p>Of course, there were several great BOFs, including an open
session with the notorious CmdrTaco of Slashdot. And that may have
kept too many people up too late.</p>

<h3>News and Press Releases</h3>
I received more PR emails about product announcements for
LinuxWorld 2005 than all the other conferences I registered at for
that last year. Some were major and some were minor. Here are a
couple of bullets on a few:

<ul>
<li>Red Hat is adding a new Global File System to Fedora Core 4 and
its Enterprise Linux line, under GPL.</li>

<li>Oracle clusters on Linux will support that RH Global File
System.</li>

<li>EnterpriseDB won Best Database Award; Beats MySQL, Oracle and
IBM for Top Honors.</li>

<li>Novell will resell MySQL Network, an enterprise service
package.</li>

<li>IBM announced its Grid and Grow turnkey virtualization offering
using IBM's BladeCenter platform.</li>

<li>Bastille-Linux group released version 3.0.7, for Fedora Core 4
as well as RH Enterprise 4.</li>
</ul>

<p>(Some of these may appear in the <a href=
"lg_bytes.html">NewsBytes</a> section of the Linux Gazette. Here's
a more complete list at the <a href=
"http://www.virtualpressoffice.com/media/show/display.jsp?showId=1098910860748">
LW2005 Press site</a>, But a few new efforts should be noted:</p>

<p><b>Splunking, anyone?</b>
</p>

<p>Although Google and MS may provide some competition, an SF
startup is targeting the search and virtualization of Data Center
logs and other info sources. The idea here is to allow systems
administrators, support staff, and developers to diagnose and
resolve problems faster by having needed meta data in one
place.</p>

<p>Splunk finds and organizes multiple files in search databases
and provides a report language. Data can be entered by reading files
in specified directories, tailing live files, or listening to
messages sent via named pipes. Currently, searches are by key word,
time and specified text strings. The Splunk server has software
that tries to discover event relationships across network and
machine domains.</p>

<p>For now, you can get the free Splunk Personal Server from
<a href="http://www.splunk.com">splunk.com</a>, get a public beta
of their new product, or go to the <a href=
"https://splunkforge.org/">project pages</a>.</p>

<p><b>Open Source Hardware?</b>
</p>

<p>OpenGear demonstrated very cost-effective KVM consoles with
remote access features. Not very dramatic, except OpenGear is
participating in the 'okvm project' (see the <a href=
"http://okvm.sourceforge.net">project page</a>) which is developing
Open Source console and KVM management software and is hosted as a
SourceForge project. And okvm also is developing plans for open
source KVM hardware. This stuff...</p>

<p>OpenGear currently sells an 8-port KVM for only $500 and a 48
port unit for only $1500 retail. A <a href=
"http://www.itworld.com/nl/unix_insider/06302005/">review in
ITworld</a> was very favorable. Visit <a href=
"http://opengear.com">opengear.com</a> for more info on their KVM
over IP products and the move to Open Source hardware.</p>

<p><b>Make the move</b>
</p>

<p>Resolvo Systems offers its MoveOver product in desktop and
enterprise editions. The idea here is to automate the transfer of a
user's Windows desktop settings, files, and environment to Linux.
Resolvo makes a limited edition available free to individual users
and has contributed source code to the new <a href=
"http://openmoveover.sourceforge.net/#diff">OpenMoveOver
project</a> on SourceForge.</p>

<p>As part of an LW2005 promotion, Resolvo is also offering its
Quro Linux management product free to new registrants. It acts as a
domain controller and LDAP server. Check that out at <a href=
"http://www.resolvo.com">Resolvo.com</a>.</p>

<p>Resolvo is partnering with CodeWeavers for migration to the
CrossOver office suite and Moveover Enterprise was a Best
Integration Solution Finalist for this year's LinuxWorld.</p>
