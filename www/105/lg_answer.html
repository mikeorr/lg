<!-- begin hgreeting -->
<p>
Greetings, everyone, and welcome once more to the world of The Answer Gang.
Please pardon our dust;  the buzz saws of open sorcery have been busy and there's floor clippings from the busy Editor's Scissors, too.
</p>

<p>
Still, we sincerely hope you enjoy the bits we have for you this time around - juicier than watermelon (hey, now there's a good name for a window manager), bigger than a double burger.
</p>

<p>
I'm really looking forward to Linux World Expo this month (what am I saying? this <em>week</em>) as I'll get to see a lot of friends there.  In addition to the obvious parties and Dot Org Pavilion, I'll be keeping my eye out for the booths with a spirit of fun in mind, who's really solving problems that face the enterprise scale (now that I've worked with larger clients this last year), and who's really helping the utter newbie.
</p>

<p>
People switching to Linux during site upgrades are probably the largest growing aspect of Linux use now that thare are so many flavors of MS Windows they're just as confusing as the wide variety of distributions we've got.  In the last year I've been seeing ads for Linux on ordinary television, too - it's even led to some clients here and there.  So just in case anyone was wondering, Tux is going places.  Whether any of those places are what the analysts want to see... ah well, this is what worldwide expos are for, to tell the analysts what to look for.
</p>

<p>If any of you would like to send in your own views of how things went at the LWE (I understand there's one going on in the UK too?  Any more big events out there?) ... oh yeah!  Birthday party time.  I almost forgot about the Linux Picnix, and considering it's right in my area, there's no way I'm gonna miss that.  <em>*ahem*</em>  If anyone wants to send us some reports on how they've enjoyed <em><strong>any</strong></em> Linux events this month, I'd love to put together a thread about 'em.  If you're going to the same ones I am... look for my red straw hat!  I'll see you there!
</p>

<p>
More next month about what Tux has been up to during his Summer vacation.
