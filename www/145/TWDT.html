I'm trying to change the CMOS battery in the above old notebook that I 
use with my ham radio station (old is good around a lot of RF).  Does 
anyone know the secret to getting this thing apart?  It seems to be held

Hi there,

I'm looking for info on how to fix my login after performing dist-upgrade.
I'm running Deb. Etch. I can sign on a root via term. 
</p>

<p>
However I get errors like...
</p>

<p>
Could not open Network Socket, make sure dcopserver is running. And this one....
</p>

<p>
Could not start kstartupconfig. check your installation. When signing onto my user account.
</p>

<p>
I opened Kuser and crated a new login and that works. But I'd like to fix my old one.
</p>

<p>
 
Thanks,

<p>
So far, issues of LG have been compressed using tar and gzip. Is there
any intention to use tar with bzip2 for future issues? Since most of
the files in each issue are text files, bzip2 is more efficient (in
terms of the size of the compressed file) than gzip. Here is a
comparison of bzip2 and gzip using the current issue; i.e. November
2007 (#144):
</p>

<pre>
1028042 lg-144.tar.bz2
1045337 lg-144.tar.gz
</pre>
IMHO, providing a bzip2 compressed format of LG issues would save some
download time.

I have SUSE 10 on my PC and installed Ubuntu which has partitioned my
hard drive. I want to reformat the hard drive to allow a clean reinstall
of Ubuntu 7.10 only from a desktop CD. I've tried using "fdisk" but get
the error message "Unable to open /dev/hda" which suggests a problem
somewhere, yet Ubuntu currently runs with out any problems. Do I
continue with fdisk? If so, how? Or try something else? Once
reformatting is successful, will the PC boot directly off the CD or do I
need to make a boot disk of some kind? Many thanks for any tips.

Hi All,
</p>

<p>
                   I'm trying to use Stunnel to create an encrypted
tunnel into my LINUX box from another LINUX box and as much as I hate to
admit it, I know relatively little about SSL implementation. I would
like to set up connection from a relatively dumb test client application
which requests of my test server to send out the contents of a file
which I specify to it. This is done by firing up my server and having it
listen to requests on specific port number which I have chosen, accept
the connection and respond with the data over the socket. I have
recently found Barry O'Donovan's article in the Linux Gazette which
seems to specify how to set up Stunnel-4.XX to create an SSL aware
server. That much seems reasonable. But my question is "How do I setup a
similar scheme for the client?"  I've found other articles, but they
seem to be for older versions of Stunnel using flags that do not seem to
apply to Stunnel-4.XX. So here I am with half the solution I need. Now
what? Help!!!!
</p>

<p>
                          Many Thanks for serious replies,
</p>

It means that you don't have CONFIG_X86_CPUID enabled in the kernel (that' s in
the 'Processor type and features' section).

  CONFIG_X86_CPUID:   
  This device gives processes access to the x86 CPUID instruction to

If you want to use x86info, you'll also need to enable CONFIG_X86_MSR.

<p>
yep.
</p>

<p>
You can thank a large part of Virtualbox's robustness on it's mature
underpinnings. It's one of a large number of VM solutions based on Qemu
code.
</p>


<p>
Other Qemu family members...
</p>

<p>
<strong>qemu-launcer</strong> -- gui to launch and manage qemu virtualization machines
</p>

<p>
<strong>qemu</strong> -- the original
</p>

<p>
 
<strong>kvm</strong> kernel modules and kvm application -- turns the Linux kernel into a
hypervisor, userland portion is a hacked qemu. This takes advantage of
the virtualization featues of newer AMD and Intel CPUS.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Win4Linux</strong> -- commercial application for running Windows on Linux. 
</p>


<p>
<strong>Kqemu</strong> -- Accelerator for Qemu. Originally closed source kernel, it's
open source ransom was paid by the Win4Linux folks and is now GPL.
</p>


<p>
The performance of KVM vs Kqemu vs Virtualbox vs Vmware vs Xen (running
with full virtualization. Xen's paravirtualization approach is still
easily the fastest)
</p>


<p>
It's good for not only desktop stuff, like virtualbox, but it can be
very good for server stuff also. 
</p>

<p>
It's not up to the same level as true hypervisors-based virtualization
like with Vmware ESX or Xen (although as hardware vm support matures KVM
is going to be big), but if you have a need for a couple servers and you
don't have any spare space.. then Qemu (with KVM or Kqemu) is your man. 
</p>


<p>
For example.. Qemu has a mode of operation were you can run it headless
with the -nographic switch. Instead of a GUI box it will turn your
console into a serial terminal. If you configure your host environment
to use the serial console and then use Lilo's serial console support
then you can effectively run your servers headless. 
</p>

<p>
Then use screen to launch the VM and you can have multiplexed serial
consoles for all your VMs on that machine. 
</p>

<p>
Then there are lots of other clever things you can do with it like use
LVM logical volumes as block devices for harddrives rather then loopback
files and advanced networking with switching/router/firewalling.
</p>

Hi,
</p>

<p>
          Talking about Linux Epson stylus 660 problems.  It has worked and
I printed an Open office letter to my sister okay.  But I was having
problems with gnome type and other apps.  This printer was fine under win 98
and since I have updated the HW I decided to get with modern software too.
Only hick my printer may or may not work.
</p>

<p>
          One of the frustrations is too many cooks and no chief.  Lots of
willing helper but not exactly plug and play. I have junked foomatic and
ghostscript and just have cups and gutenprint and Ubuntu.   All the detailed
stuff about sending this that and the other to the printer is a waste of
time.  The printer is stuck in the middle of a job despite canning all jobs
form both gnome and the Firefox type interface.  Even switching off/on the
printer seems to keep the job active somewhere.  I exited a terminal window
that I was using to send escputil stuff and the printer started up.  It's
really strange.  Previously the gnome and Firefox interface could not detect
the printer or parallel port.  The color ink led was on and I even changed
the ink cartridge to no avail.  There was nothing wrong with the original.
</p>

<p>
          Using the Firefox interface I have a choice of several drivers and
no idea what to use.  My printer prints the commands that it receives and
does not do what the software is telling it.  I am not really able to stop
printing and have a clean start.  Any ideas would be a great help as would
be a reset button for both SW and HW.
</p>

<pre>
&gt; I am not very experienced at all with OpenLDAP so that is where the thrust
&gt; of my questions lay. I am trying to use your article and supplied
&gt; configurations as a template and modifying as needed.
</pre>

<p>
OpenLDAP isn't easy to set up, so you are in good company. This is not
due to the software but to the concepts used in LDAP.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; In your tree design you show
&gt; cn=webmail,ou=system,ou=accounts,dc=example,dc=net as a webmail account to
&gt; do lookups but it is not referenced at all in the slapd.conf. How is that
&gt; portion used.
</pre>

<p>
slapd.conf only configures the basics of the OpenLDAP server process.
You can define the directory where the LDAP tree is stored, the root
account for the whole tree, the object class definitions to be used,
SSL/TLS keys/certificates, indices and access rules. All this
information is only used to start the server and then initialise the
LDAP backend storage.
</p>

<p>
An entry such as "cn=webmail,ou=system,ou=accounts,dc=example,dc=net" is
really a branch of the LDAP tree. This branch can either be a container
for more branches or be an object of its own. The notation alone doesn't
tell you what it is. You have to look for the object class of this
entry. In my case I used
"cn=webmail,ou=system,ou=accounts,dc=example,dc=net" as an example for
an account object holding the password for access to the OpenLDAP
server. The subsystem could connect to the OpenLDAP server, provide
"cn=webmail,ou=system,ou=accounts,dc=example,dc=net" as a kind of login
und authenticate with the password contained in the object referenced by
"cn=webmail,ou=system,ou=accounts,dc=example,dc=net" in the tree.
</p>

<p>
That's what I meant by LDAP being a bit difficult to understand. You
have branches which can be objects of classes and which can hold a
variety of data. If the OpenLDAP servers sees that an object has a
password attribute, it will allow a login with this password.

Suppose you have recorded your console session with "script" command. 
And then you want to display it via simple "less" command. But wait, you 
see: (note: by default ls use coloring scheme via command aliasing, so 
if you don't have it, simply use ls --color)
</p>

<pre>
ESC]0;mulyadi@rumah:/tmp^GESC[?1034h[mulyadi@rumah tmp]$ ls
ESC[00mESC[00;34mgconfd-doelESC[00m ESC[00;34mvirtual-mulyadi.Bx4b1XESC
</pre>
How do you make these "strange" characters to appear as color? Use less 
-r &lt;your script file&gt; and you'll see colors as they originally appear.

<h2>News in General</h2>

<h3>Xen gets pumped by Oracle and Sun</h3>

<p>At Oracle OpenWorld, new VM management suites based on Xen's
virtualization technology were spun out by the respective CEOs of Oracle
and Sun. Both claimed their tools offered the kind of monitoring,
management, and migration capabilities only available from VMware until
now. Both VM suites are free to download.
</p>

<p>First up was Oracle's Kevin Phillips, VP of Sales, who took the wraps
off Oracle VM (or OVM) at the first Oracle OpenWorld keynote. Larry
Ellison also spoke about OVM in his keynote.
</p>

<p>OVM is based on the Xen hypervisor and includes a Web-browser-based
management console that links to the Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM)
product. OVM is free to download, but Oracle was not
clear on whether or not the source code would be available.
</p>

<p>OVM has support for Linux and Windows guest operating systems,
including Oracle Enterprise Linux 4 and 5; RHEL3, RHEL4, and RHEL5;
Windows 2003, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP. The Sun xVM
offering, described below, supports RHEL, SUSE, Windows, and Solaris as
guest operating systems.
</p>

<p>Customers who obtain paid support for Oracle VM receive access to
patches, fixes, and updates via Unbreakable Linux Network (ULN) and
24x7 global support. Pricing for enterprise-class support for
Oracle VM system with up to two CPUs is priced at $499 per year per
system and a system with unlimited CPUs priced at $999 per year.
</p>

<p>Beyond the Oracle DB and Application Server, only the following Oracle
Applications are "supported" with Oracle VM at this time:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Oracle PeopleSoft Enterprise 8.4.x and 9.0;
<li>PeopleTools 8.49.07 and above;
<li>Oracle Siebel CRM 8.0;
<li>Oracle's Hyperion 9.3.1
</ul>

<p>For more info, go to: <a href="http://wiki.oracle.com/page/Oracle+VM%20and">http://wiki.oracle.com/page/Oracle+VM
</a> and <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/virtualization/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/virtualization/index.html</a>
</p>

<p>Sun also got into the Virtualization act at Oracle OpenWorld with
announcement of its xVM FOSS project at Jonathon Schwartz's keynote 2
days later. He demonstrated two upcoming products at the core
of Sun's virtualization offerings: Sun xVM Ops Center, a unified
management infrastructure; and Sun xVM Server, an enterprise-grade
bare-metal hypervisor. Sun xVM will combine enhancements to Sun's
existing technology portfolio with new offerings that will help
customers to increase efficiency, while simplifying management and
saving money. Additionally, Sun will launch www.openxvm.org, an open
source community for developers building next-generation data center
virtualization and management technologies.
</p>

<p>The end-to-end software consists of Sun xVM Server and Sun xVM Ops
Center. Sun xVM Server is based on the open-source Xen hypervisor, and
is an open, cross-platform, high-efficiency, open-source hypervisor
family of servers capable of hosting Windows, Linux, and Solaris OS
guest instances. For the first time, Windows guests will be able to
benefit from built-in Sun technologies like predictive self-healing 
and the ZFS file system. Sun xVM Ops Center is the management
component -- a scalable management environment for the provisioning of
thousands of physical and virtual machines running across multi-vendor
x64/86 and SPARC systems.
</p>

<p>Also significant is that xVM is released under GPL v3. "We
are going to advance... with the GPL community, and this is an
important part of our strategy..." said Sun VP Rich Green at OpenWorld.
</p>

<p>From "Jonathon's Blog" on 11/14:

<blockquote>"...our xVM hypervisor is a very lightweight kernel that inherits
proven virtualization technologies
(like ZFS, FMA, Dtrace and Crossbow) from the Solaris kernel - while
supporting Linux, Windows and Solaris
as guests - imbuing guest OS's with the properties of the host
hypervisor. </blockquote>

<p>We also announced a variety of partners today, most importantly Red
Hat, who'll offer reciprocity with their hypervisor, like Microsoft."
</p>

<p>From the Sun press release on xVM:
</p>

<blockquote>"Red Hat and Sun are collaborating on virtualization and...
customers seeking a free and open source virtualization platform that
ensures interoperability and avoids proprietary vendor lock in, can look
to Sun and Red Hat solutions. Sun supports Red Hat's Linux Automation
strategy and Red Hat supports Sun's xVM strategy, both of which extend
the reach and value of open source. Red Hat and Sun will ensure
customers mutual certification and customer support across [their]
virtualization offerings. In addition, Sun and Red Hat are committed
to...  libvirt (www.libvirt.org), an open source community project for
cross-platform virtualization management."</blockquote>

<p>Some of the Oracle presenters thought that Sun was a bit insensitive
and had sprung the xVM announcement on Oracle organizers. But a
follow-up discussion with mangers from the Oracle Linux group revealed
that Sun had discussed xVM announcement before Oracle OpenWorld had
begun, and that it was no surprise. Wim Coekaerts of Oracle felt that
the Xen community would get to see both VM offerings and would get to
decide which features should be included in the Xen source tree.
</p>

<p>Sun intends to invest about $2 billion in developing and marketing vXM.
Sun said that its Ops Center, expected in December, has already been
validated on hundreds of system configurations.

<h3>Red Hat EL 5.1 Enables Broad Server Virtualization</h3>

<p>Red Hat has released Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.1, with integrated
virtualization. This release provides the industry&rsquo;s broadest
deployment ecosystem, covering standalone systems, virtualized systems,
appliances and Web-scale "cloud" computing environments.
 Fedora 8 was also released at the same time. (See Distros section.)
</p>

<p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtualization includes the ability to perform
live migration, allowing customers to seamlessly move running
applications from one server to another, maximizing resource
utilization in the face of changing business requirements. Red Hat
Enterprise Linux's Advanced Platform includes high-availability
clustering, storage virtualization, and failover software to provide
enhanced levels of application availability, for both physical and
virtual servers. Red Hat worked closely with AMD and Intel to
provide support for the new hardware performance features such as Nested
Page Tables in the new release.
</p>

<p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux's deployment flexibility uniquely allows
customers to deploy a single platform, virtual or physical, small or
large, throughout their enterprise by providing one platform that
spans the broadest range of x86, x86-64, POWER, Itanium, and mainframe
servers, regardless of size, core count, or capacity. Customers can gain
dramatic operational and cost efficiencies when compared to proprietary
solutions, and fully integrated virtualization is included at no
additional cost, which amplify its benefits. Notably, Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 5.1 provides enhanced support for virtualization of Microsoft
Windows guests, providing significant performance improvements for
Windows XP, Windows Server 2000, Windows Server 2003, and Windows 2008
beta guests.
</p>

<p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.1 is immediately available to customers via
Red Hat Network, Red Hat's management and automation platform. Red Hat
Network provides customers a common platform for managing both physical
and virtual servers, eliminating the need for organizations to acquire,
manage and train their staff on new tools to manage virtual servers.
Red Hat Network allows customers to  monitor and manage their
servers throughout the entire lifecycle.
</p>

<p>Red Hat also announced the release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.6, the
6th update to its Red Hat 4.x product line. This release
includes: OS package updates and install-time support for new hardware;
availability of updated Extras ISO images with third party package
updates; kernel features including: added getcpu system call on ia64
and added /proc NUMA maps support. Read the release announcement and
release notes for further details. The ISO images of Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 4.6 are available to existing RHEL subscribers via Red Hat
Networks.
</p>

<h4>RHEL On Demand on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</h4>

<p>Red Hat announced in November the beta availability of Red Hat
Enterprise Linux on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), a Web
service that provides resizeable compute capacity in the cloud. This
collaboration makes all the capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise Linux
available to customers on Amazon's proven network infrastructure and
data centers. 
</p>

<p>The idea is to provides everything needed to develop and host
applications. Amazon provides the hosting infrastructure and
RH provides the OS and support, all on a usage basis.
</p>

<p>This also demos RH's virtual appliance technology and also is a major
foray into the SAAS (Software as a Service) market.  The SAAS model is
appealing to small and new businesses and non-profit organizations, and
could represent a significant revenue opportunity for Red Hat.
</p>

<p>According to the Amazon Web Services home page
(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=3435361">http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=3435361</a>):
</p>

<blockquote>"This collaboration between AWS and Red Hat marries all the
capabilities of both RHEL and EC2. Now developers can pay as they go
for resizeable compute capacity in the cloud while accessing the Red Hat
Network management service, world class technical support, and over
3,000 certified applications."</blockquote>
</p>

<p>RHEL on Amazon EC2 is currently available as a restricted beta but will
go public in December or January. Server use prices are $19/month per
user and $0.21, $0.53, or $0.94 for every compute hour used on Amazon's
EC2 service, depending on compute instance size chosen - small, large,
or extra large - plus bandwidth and storage fees.
</p>

<p>More information about the joint service is available at
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/solutions/cloud/">http://www.redhat.com/solutions/cloud/</a>.

<h3>Distros</h3>

<h4>Community Welcomes Fedora 8</h4>

<p>Fedora 8 enhancements include the expanded ability for users to create
custom spins or appliances, increased security features, a new look and
feel, and numerous technical advances.
</p>

<p>First established in Fedora 7, the ability to create custom spins or
appliances that allow users to create a combination of specific
software to meet individual requirements has been expanded in Fedora 8.
Fedora 8 marks the debut of three new spins: Games, Developer, and
Electronic Lab spins offer prepared customization for users with 
specific interests in gaming, development, and electronics applications,
respectively. The new Fedora spins exemplify the easy customization of
the Fedora Project's newest distribution and demonstrate the freedom,
ability, and desire of the community of developers to remix Fedora in
the ways most useful to them.
</p>

<p>Fedora 8 offers both GNOME- and KDE-based Live CDs and a general-purpose
installable DVD for workstations and servers. It also includes improved
Live USB support, making it possible to install, boot, and run the
entire distribution off of a USB key without touching the computer's
hard disk at all.
</p>

<p>Fedora 8 incorporates a wide array of technical advances. This
distribution becomes the first to enable PulseAudio, a sound server
that acts as a proxy between all of a user's sound applications by
default. With PulseAudio, users can enjoy features such as different
volumes for different applications, hot-plugging support for USB sound
devices, and support for audio over the network. Fedora 8 additionally
includes improved graphical tools for firewall configuration, enhanced
printer management, and an update for Bluetooth integration. Network
Manager, the easy-to-use wireless configuration tool written by Red Hat
and adopted by many prominent Linux distributions, has also been
updated.
</p>

<p>Fedora 8 boasts an entirely new default look and feel on the desktop,
all based on community artwork. The Fedora 8 theme of "infinity"
includes a default background that changes shades, growing brighter or
darker in accordance with time of day.
</p>

<p>For more information on Fedora 8, to download the distribution, or to
join in this community effort, please visit

<h4>MEPIS 7</h4>

<p>A GA release of MEPIS 7 is expected by mid-December. 
</p>

<h4>FreeNAS Beta</h4>

<p>The second beta release of FreeNAS 0.686, a FreeBSD-based operating
system providing free Network-Attached Storage (NAS) services is
available for testing. Beta 2 includes support for USB drives
and many bug fixes.
</p>

<p>FreeNAS is available here: <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/freenas/FreeNAS-i386-liveCD-0.686b2.iso">FreeNAS-i386-liveCD-0.686b2.iso</a> .
</p>

<h4>Fourth release candidate for NetBSD 4.0</h4>

<p>NetBSD 4.0 Release Candidate 4 has been updated to handle RAID volumes
larger than 4GB. This RC also has several bug fixes, including a
transition mechanism from Sendmail to Postfix, a security issue in
OpenSSL, a bug in MTRR handling causing a reboot on amd64 when starting
the X server, a security issue in FAST_IPSEC, and a heap corruption in
rpc.lockd.
</p>

<p>The RAID changes use bio(4), and this can cause a compatibility break
on 32-bit platforms. If you are using bio(4), you need a new bioctl
utility for the RC4 kernel. If you have updated only the kernel, either
rebuild bioctl after updating the headers in /usr/include, or use a new
binary from the release build. This does not affect upgrading from
previous releases of NetBSD, as no former release has bio(4).
</p>

<h3>Products</h3>

<h4>Dell to sell Servers with Solaris Installed</h4>

<p>Dell announced that it had formally certified Sun's Solaris on its
servers. By Spring of 2008, Dell will offer its servers pre-installed
with RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux), SLES (SUSE Linux Enterprise

<h1>New Use for Old Hardware: Network RAID Backup</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/howell.html">Edgar Howell</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
Long unused, the old P166 PC seemed like it ought to have some use left in
it.  Then I remembered the 2nd hard drive wasting time in the other PC; the
combination of the old PC and a 2nd drive seemed like a good candidate for
a RAID, to be used as backup storage over the network.  As it turns out,
that was perfectly realistic and not too much work, at least if you know
what you are doing. I learned a lot.
</p>
<p>
In the following I describe my actions in detail -
but there is no reason for you to follow this too closely.
E.g., the distro needn't be SuSE 8.0.
Because the machine was so old and only had 32MB of memory,
I wanted software as old as reasonably possible -
but the kernel of 7.0 seemed to need a patch for RAID, so 8.0 it was.
In retrospect something like Damn Small Linux might have been a better choice.
</p>
<p>
For the other machine, Knoppix is not mandatory either -
but using it has the advantage of forgetting everything the next
time you boot, thus giving you a clean slate for the next attempt.
This is very important for me because I do a lot of experimenting.
In particular, SSH settings don't need to be retained, so it doesn't
bother me particularly to enter passwords.
</p>
<p>
In all probability the necessary software is already available
due to a normal GNU/Linux installation -- other than the RAID tool,
'mdadm', perhaps. Certainly Knoppix includes everything that's needed.
It is up to you to ensure that the required packages have been installed.
E.g., if you don't want NFS, then don't install it.
</p>
<p>
There are 4 major parts to this article: Network Installation, RAID, SSH,
and NFS.  They can be read pretty much independently from each other.  In
particular, if you don't need to do a network installation, you can skip
that part, which overlaps somewhat with NFS.
</p>

<p>
Although not a prerequesite for understanding, in conjunction with this
article you should read <a href="../140/pfeiffer.html">
"Encrypted Storage with LUKS, RAID and LVM2"</a> by Ren&eacute; Pfeiffer in
Linux Gazette #140. The two articles complement each other, the common
element being RAID. There, the emphasis is on encryption and file systems; here,
I focus on network access.
</p>

<h3>
Network Installation
</h3>
<p>
I hadn't intended to do a network installation, thinking that it would be
great to let a CD version of Knoppix live in the drive.  But the drive
refuses to open once Knoppix is booted, and besides, how could Knoppix
survive in 32MB?  There was no other feasible way to get an operating
system on the machine.  Certainly having the OS installed improves
performance but in this case performance is not that important.
</p>
<p>
In spite of possible first impressions, a network installation is not
significantly different from installing from a CD or DVD.  The only catch
is that the installation program must give you the opportunity to tell it
to use the network rather than the usual device.
</p>
<p>
The most time-consuming part was to make the partition with the OS as small
as possible and then during installation omit as much software as possible
- not at all a trivial task. Note that both drives had been partitioned in
advance.
</p>
<p>
The following steps made the CD-drive on the 2nd PC available over the LAN:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Boot Knoppix (I used v5.0.1)
<li> Check the name of the CD-ROM mount-point in "/etc/fstab",
in this case "/media/cdrom"
<li> Add it to "/etc/exports" along with the IP-address to be used by the 1st PC:
<pre class="code">
	/media/cdrom 192.168.0.101(ro)
</pre>
<li> Include the IP-address in /etc/hosts.allow:
<pre class="code">
	portmap: 192.168.0.101 : ALLOW
	mountd: 192.168.0.101 : ALLOW
</pre>
<li> Start the network file system:
<pre class="code">
	/etc/init.d/portmap start
	/etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server start
</pre>
Note: if this produces a segmentation fault, just try it again.

<li> Put the SuSE 8.0 CD 1 in the CD-Drive and let Knoppix mount it.
<br>
If this produces an error similar to this one --
<pre>
	mount: can't find /dev/hdc in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
</pre>
then just do it manually:
<pre class="code">
	mount /dev/cdrom
</pre>
<li> Bring up the network:
<pre class="code">
	ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.102 up
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
Once the CD-drive is available on the 2nd PC,
installation can begin on the 1st one.
</p>

<ul>
<li> Insert the SuSE 8.0 boot diskette and boot the PC
<li> From the menu select the following items:
<ul>
<li> "Installation"
<br>
If offered a manual choice of installation device, select it;
if not, the procedure will be unable to find an installation device and
will activate manual selection anyhow.
<li> "Kernel modules (hardware drivers)"
<li> "Load Network Card Modules"
<br>
Insert the modules diskette and then select "rtl8139"
<li> "Start Installation / System"
<li> "Start Installation/Update"
<li> "Network"
<li> "NFS"
<li> "Automatic configuration via DHCP?"
<br>
Respond "no", then enter the following as requested
<pre class="code">
	IP-address	192.168.0.101
	netmask		255.255.255.0	(default)
	gateway		192.168.0.101	(default)
	name server	&lt;ESC&gt;
	NFS server	192.168.0.102
	directory	/media/cdrom
</pre>
The directory entry must match the mount-point in /etc/fstab on the 2nd PC
and, of course, the entry in /etc/exports there.
</ul>
<li> When YaST complains about not enough memory and wants to
activate swap --
<br>
"Please choose the swap partition"
<br>
choose "hdc1".
<li> At this point YaST starts reading from the CD on the 2nd PC
and installation proceeds as usual, except that as little software
as possible should actually be selected for installation.
</ul>

<p>
If YaST asks for CDs beyond the first one, on the 2nd PC
</p>
<pre class="code">
	/etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server stop
	umount /dev/cdrom
</pre>
<p>
Remove the CD and insert the next as usual, then
</p>
<pre class="code">
	mount /dev/cdrom
	/etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server start
</pre>

<h3>
Post-Installation Adjustments
</h3>

<p>
Once the installation as such is finished,
we need to make a couple of changes to let the PC boot unattended
and permit remote access to it.
</p>
<ul>
<li> In /etc/inittab change the default runlevel from
<pre>
	5  Full multiuser with network and xdm
</pre>
to
<pre>
	3  Full multiuser with network
</pre>
<li> In /etc/init.d/network after "start)" add
<pre class="code">
	/sbin/ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.101 up
</pre>

<li> Add to /etc/hosts.allow
<pre class="code">
	sshd: 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 : ALLOW
</pre>

<li> And then, finally,
using YaST add a user for remote access (logon from another machine).
</ul>

<h3>
RAID Setup
</h3>

<p>
Once an operating system is available, setting up the RAID storage
on the 1st PC is actually fairly straight-forward.
During partitioning the partition type 0xfd had already been set in both
/dev/hda2 and /dev/hdc2.
</p>
<pre class="code">
	Disk /dev/hda: 32 heads, 63 sectors, 4238 cylinders
	Units = sectors of 1 * 512 bytes

	   Device Boot    Start       End    Blocks   Id  System
	/dev/hda1            63    465695    232816+  83  Linux
	/dev/hda2        465696   8543807   4039056   <b>fd</b>  Linux raid autodetect

	Disk /dev/hdc: 15 heads, 63 sectors, 8894 cylinders
	Units = sectors of 1 * 512 bytes

	   Device Boot    Start       End    Blocks   Id  System
	/dev/hdc1            63    262709    131323+  82  Linux swap
	/dev/hdc2        262710   8404829   4071060   <b>fd</b>  Linux raid autodetect
</pre>
<p>
For details beyond the scope of this article see the
<a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-RAID-HOWTO.html">RAID HOWTO</a>.
</p>
<p>
Before you go any further, you can make sure that your kernel
supports RAID (almost certainly the case).
If toward the end of the output of
"dmesg | less"  you see something like the following,
you should be in good shape:
</p>
<pre class="code">
	SCSI subsystem driver Revision: 1.00
	request_module[scsi_hostadapter]: Root fs not mounted
	request_module[scsi_hostadapter]: Root fs not mounted
	md: md driver 0.90.0 MAX_MD_DEVS=256, MD_SB_DISKS=27
	md: Autodetecting RAID arrays.
	 [events: 00000000]
	md: invalid raid superblock magic on hda2
	md: hda2 has invalid sb, not importing!
	md: could not import hda2!
	 [events: f6928712]
	md: invalid raid superblock magic on hdc2
	md: hdc2 has invalid sb, not importing!
	md: could not import hdc2!
	md: autorun ...
	md: ... autorun DONE.
	NET4: Linux TCP/IP 1.0 for NET4.0
	IP Protocols: ICMP, UDP, TCP, IGMP
</pre>
<ul>
<li> If not already available, download the mdadm tool as referenced
in the HOWTO and install it
<pre>
	rpm -hUv mdadm-2.6-1.src.rpm
</pre>
<li> Create /etc/raidtab
<pre class="code">
	raiddev /dev/md0
		raid-level	1
		nr-raid-disks	2
		nr-spare-disks	0
		persistent-superblock 1
		chunk-size	4
		device		/dev/hda2
		raid-disk	0
		device		/dev/hdc2
		raid-disk	1
</pre>
<li> Prepare the RAID
<pre class="code">
	mkraid /dev/md0
</pre>
<li> While mkraid is running (this may take quite a while,
depending on the size of the RAID partitions) create a mount-point
<pre class="code">
	mkdir /DATA
</pre>
<li> Make it accessible by everyone
<pre class="code">
	chmod a+w /DATA
</pre>
<li> And add it to /etc/fstab
<pre class="code">
	/dev/md0 /DATA ext2 defaults 1 2
</pre>
<li> Once mkraid is done, create a file system
<pre class="code">
	mkfs.ext2 /dev/md0
</pre>
</ul>

<h3>
SSH Access
</h3>

<p>
At this point the RAID storage can be used for simple backup.
However, to enable network access to the network backup PC
/etc/hosts.allow on it must always permit sshd
(see the entry under NFS Access, below)
or at least '/etc/hosts.deny' must not prevent sshd.
</p>

<p>
Assuming that the network is functional and
sshd is up on the network backup PC,
the following will copy a file to it from some other PC:
</p>
<pre class="code">
	scp /tmp/junk.exe web@192.168.0.101:/DATA/throw_this_away_now
</pre>
<p>
The very first time you do this, you will be asked whether you trust
this connection and if you approve, the host key will be <b>permanently</b> stored
on the local PC (thus my preference for Knoppix when experimenting).
Every time you use any ssh command you will have to enter the
password of the remote user, unless you have gone to the trouble
to set up appropriate keys on both machines.
At <a href="http://linuxmafia.com/ssh/">Linuxmafia.com/ssh</a>
you can find <b>lots</b> of references to SSH including an FAQ.
</p>
<p>
It is just as easy to retrieve a file from the network backup PC
</p>
<pre class="code">
	scp web@192.168.0.101:/DATA/throw_this_away_now /tmp/junk.exe
</pre>
<p>
You don't even really need a keyboard or monitor on that PC, since
everything can be done through SSH; just log on as the remote user. After
entering the password, as usual, you can switch to root:
</p>
<pre>
	knoppix@4[knoppix]$ ssh -l web 192.168.0.101
	The authenticity of host '192.168.0.101 (192.168.0.101)' can't be established.
	RSA key fingerprint is 87:5f:41:fb:4d:32:9d:d3:f9:e4:d1:9d:6f:23:4a:fb.
	Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
	Warning: Permanently added '192.168.0.101' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
	web@192.168.0.101's password:
	Last login: Sat Nov  3 13:48:43 2007 from 192.168.0.102
	Have a lot of fun...
	web@linux:~&gt; su
	Password:
	linux:/home/web # cd
	linux:~ # ls
	.   .bash_history  .gnupg  .viminfo  bin      nfs_on
	..  .exrc          .mc     .xinitrc  nfs_off
	linux:~ # pwd
	/root
	linux:~ #
</pre>

<h3>
NFS Access
</h3>

<p>
The following steps performed on the network backup PC
will enable access to a directory on it from another machine on the LAN
as if it were a directory local to that machine.
For details beyond the scope of this article see
the <a href="http://nfs.sourceforge.net/nfs-howto/">NFS HOWTO</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Initially only the portmapper is active
<pre class="code">
	rpcinfo -p localhost
	   program vers proto   port
	    100000    2   tcp    111  portmapper
	    100000    2   udp    111  portmapper
</pre>
<li> Add to /etc/hosts.deny
<pre class="code">
	ALL : ALL
</pre>

<li> Add to /etc/hosts.allow
<pre class="code">
	sshd: 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 : ALLOW
	portmap: 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 : ALLOW
	lockd: 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 : ALLOW
	mountd: 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 : ALLOW
	rquotad: 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 : ALLOW
	statd: 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 : ALLOW
</pre>
<li> Add to /etc/exports
<pre class="code">
	/DATA 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0(rw,root_squash,sync,insecure)
</pre>
<li> Then start portmap and NFS
<pre class="code">
	/etc/init.d/portmap restart
	/etc/init.d/nfsserver restart
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
To access the network backup PC from another PC
</p>

<ul>
<li> If the network has not yet been brought up locally, do so
<pre class="code">
	ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.102 up
</pre>
<li> Verify communication
<pre class="code">
	knoppix@4[knoppix]$ rpcinfo -p 192.168.0.101
	program vers proto   port
	100000    2   tcp    111  portmapper
	100000    2   udp    111  portmapper
	100024    1   udp   1027  status
	100024    1   tcp   1026  status
	100003    2   udp   2049  nfs
	100003    3   udp   2049  nfs
	100021    1   udp   1028  nlockmgr
	100021    3   udp   1028  nlockmgr
	100021    4   udp   1028  nlockmgr
	100005    1   udp   1029  mountd
	100005    1   tcp   1027  mountd
	100005    2   udp   1029  mountd
	100005    2   tcp   1027  mountd
	100005    3   udp   1029  mountd
	100005    3   tcp   1027  mountd
	knoppix@4[knoppix]$ 
</pre>
<li> And then mount the network drive locally
<pre>
	mount 192.168.0.101:/DATA /mnt
</pre>
</ul>
<p>
At this point, all data in the directory /DATA on the network backup PC
can be accessed as if it were physically present on the local
mount-point /mnt.
</p>
<p>
By the way, this is not only the case with the Knoppix environment we have
been using here; if rpcinfo shows that NFS is functional, both Mandriva
2007 and Debian 4.0 XFce behave as described - and if the mount-point used is
defined in a VirtualBox host as a "shared folder", it is available to a VM
under that host.
</p>

<h3>
Trust is Good, But ...
</h3>

<p>
For the skeptics in the crowd and to satisfy my own idle curiosity,
I dug out an ancient boot diskette, HAL 91 from 2001, with a kernel
that doesn't know about RAID (2.0.39) and booted the machine.
Here's what "fdisk" and "ls -l" had to say about the drives:

<p>
Indeed, unaware of what partition ID 0xfd means, this kernel
just shows the contents.
It does seem that the redundancy is working quite nicely!
</p>


<p>
Ahh, but what about behavior in failure-mode, an emergency?  At least in
this environment that would be a bit difficult to check out with any degree
of certainty.  I'm not about to open the PC and destroy one of the
hard-drives just to make sure...  However, for the curious, <a
href="misc/howell/dmesg.txt">here</a> is an excerpt from what "dmesg"
reports immediately after a power-failure.
</p>
<p class="editorial">
[ You can check for the state of the RAID valumes by looking into
the <tt>/proc</tt> filesystem. <tt>/proc/mdstat</tt> shows all
active RAID devices and their states. An "U" means "up", a "_" denotes
a missing device. --- Ren&eacute; ]
</p>


<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>

<p>
For my purposes this is an optimal solution to my backup problem.
At no further expense, it is now possible to back files up either
via ssh or NFS - and the backup is doubly safe due to the RAID.
</p>
<p class="editorial">
[ Make sure you have the disks of your RAID device connected to
different controllers if using PATA hardware. There are situations
when the kernel might deactivate the whole bus system of a single
controller. This means both master and slave device will be unavailable.
A RAID1 will be gone and a RAID5 will be invalid and required manual
recovery (which may not always work as intended). --- Ren&eacute; ]
</p>
<p>
Certainly this is not something any large organization would want to
consider; old hardware is not as energy-efficient as modern equipment.
Also, the drives are much closer to that feared MTBF than something you'd
want to rely on in a commercial environment.  Besides, while fine for
parking a tarball, if you want to use this as a file server, you'll have to
give some thought to UID/GID conflicts, etc. - at least if the operating
systems involved have differing algorithms, as is the case with SuSE 8.0
and Knoppix 5.0.1.
</p>
<p>
But in this limited environment, where all the equipment gets shut down at
the end of the day, none of that matters.  Indeed, the RAID backup server
doesn't even have to be turned on unless there is a need to back something
up securely.
</p>
<p class="editorial">
[ One last note about secure storage for backups: bear in mind that your
backup usually holds a copy of your important data - and is thus a juicy
target for break-in attempts. Someone getting hold of a backup system with
an unlocked, unencrypted disk partition doesn't need any cracking expertise to
get to the interesting details. --- Ren&eacute; ]

<h1>Linux on an ARM based Single Board Computer</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/john.html">Maxin B. John</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
GNU/Linux is fast becoming the <em>de facto</em> Operating System for embedded
devices - mainly due to the efficient and portable design of the Linux kernel.
The ARM Linux port effort, headed by Russell M. King, also makes life a bit easier
for people who run (or want to run) Linux on their embedded devices.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>Armadillo 9</strong> board is a small Single Board Computer the
size of an floppy disk, marketed by <a
href=http://www.atmark-techno.com/en/products/armadillo/a9/>Atmark Techno,
Inc</a>. Though it is small, it provides Compact Flash support, USB 2.0, LAN, and
video output interfaces. Above all, the GNU cross development toolchain, Kernel (2.4
and 2.6 series) and Filesystem are already provided by the board vendors to reduce
"product development time". Low power consumption and a small form factor
(90.2 x 95.9 mm) makes it ideal for observation and monitoring devices, kiosk
terminals, or, with a GPS module and proper software like 'gpsdrive',
a Linux-based car navigation system.
</p>

<h3> Armadillo 9 specifications </h3>

<p>
<img src="misc/john/armadillo9.jpg" align="left">
The Armadillo 9 SBC contains:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Cirrus Logic EP9315 200 MHz Processor</li>
<li> 64 MB SDRAM</li>
<li> 8 MB FLASH memory</li>
<li> 10/100 Ethernet Controller</li>
<li> RS232 Serial Interface</li>
<li> JTAG interface for debugging and flash programming</li>
<li> USB 2.0 type A connector</li>
<li> Compact Flash interface</li>
<li> 12 bit GPIO</li>
<li> Video Output.Connector type: D-sub15 pin (mini)</li>
<li> IDE Interface</li>
</ul>
Armadillo 9 board uses 'hermit' as the bootloader program.
</p>

<h3> Development Setup </h3>

<p>
The standard development setup should be similar to the one shown in <a
href="misc/john/setup.png">this picture</a>. The Linux box that I'm using runs a
Fedora Core 6 distro with all the standard hardware bells and whistles,
like a 1.6 GHz processor, 256 MB RAM, and an 80 GB HDD. The serial port
connector can be made by soldering two DB9 male connectors and some
commonly available wire.
<br>
<pre class="code">
(pin to pin connection)

DB9 -1           DB9 - 2 
2         &lt;-&gt;       3
3         &lt;-&gt;       2
5         &lt;-&gt;       5
</pre>
We'll use a serial communication program, 'minicom', to connect to the board.
Let's connect the serial port of Armadillo board to our development machine using
the serial cable. At the Bash prompt, enter
<pre>
minicom -m -s /dev/ttyS0 
</pre>
If you are using the first serial port in your machine (i.e., 'COM1:' in Windows),
configure the minicom serial port setup as follows:
<pre>
 A -    Serial Device      : /dev/ttyS0    
 B - Lockfile Location     : /var/lock   
 C -   Callin Program      :         
 D -  Callout Program      :        
 E -    Bps/Par/Bits       : 115200 8N1    
 F - Hardware Flow Control : No     
 G - Software Flow Control : No        
</pre>
Now, let's logon to the Armadillo board using the default username and
password:
<pre>
username: root
password: root
</pre>
</p>

<h3> Installing the GNU/Linux Toolchain and related software </h3>

<p>
One of the attractive features of the Armadillo 9 board is its support for the
GNU/Linux operating system: the GNU cross development environment for Armadillo is
available on the CD provided with the board. The latest version of the
toolchain is available at the <a
href="http://download.atmark-techno.com/armadillo-9/">atmark-techno website</a>.
<br>
The Armadillo 9 gives us the choice of using RPM, DEB, or tar.gz packages
as sources for the toolchain. The following software is required for a
minimal development system for Armadillo 9:
<pre>
binutils-arm-linux
gcc-arm-linux
libc6-arm-cros
</pre>
These can be installed in the Linux box by issuing the following commands:

<pre class="code">
# For RPM based systems: "rpm -ivh software_name". E.g.:
rpm -ivh binutils-arm-linux.rpm

# For Debian/Ubuntu like systems: "dpkg -i software_name". E.g.:
dpkg -i binutils-arm-linux.deb

# For distro-independent installation from source:
tar zxvf binutils-arm-linux.tar.gz
cd binutils-arm-linux
./configure
make 
make install
</pre>
Other software required for the Armadillo 9 development - e.g., shoehorn,
hermit, etc. - will be installed in the development system using the same
method.
</p>

<h2> Hello, Armadillo! </h2>

<p>
Once we have an Armadillo 9 board with "Linux inside",
let's say "hello" to it by running the famous "Hello, world!"
program (we'll call it "hello.c"):

<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(){
	printf("hello, world\n");
	return 0;
}
</pre>

We'll compile it using the cross compiler for Armadillo board:
<pre>
arm-linux-gcc hello.c -o hello
</pre>

Now, let's run the 'file' command to see what the it has to say about 'hello':

<pre>
file hello
hello: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, version 1 (ARM), for GNU/Linux 2.2.0, dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.2.0, not stripped
</pre>

The executable 'hello' can run on the Armadillo board as it is cross-compiled for
the ARM architecture - so we need to upload the binary to the Armadillo board to run
it. A number of methods - FTP, NFS, etc. - are available for this, but here
I am going to use HTTP (via the 'wget' program).

<br>
First, start the Apache server on the host machine.
<pre>
/etc/init.d/httpd start
</pre>
Now, copy the 'hello' binary to the DocumentRoot of Apache webserver.
<pre>
cp hello /var/www/html
</pre>

Next, invoke minicom and log on to the Armadillo board. From the board, 
invoke the following command (192.168.0.1 is the IP address of my web
server):

<pre>
wget http://192.168.0.1/hello
Connecting to 192.168.0.1[192.168.0.1]:80                                     
hello                100% |*****************************|  9475       00:00 ETA

# Give executable permission to 'hello' 
chmod +x hello

# Now run it
./hello
hello, world 
</pre>

It works! 
</p>

<h3> A Simple kernel module for Armadillo9 </h3>

<p>
The latest kernel source can be obtained from the Armadillo site.
<pre>
wget http://download.atmark-techno.com/armadillo-9/source/linux-2.6.12.3-a9-10.tar.gz 
#untar the source for compiling the kernel module
tar zxvf linux-2.6.12.3-a9-10.tar.gz
cd linux-2.6.12.3-a9-10
#now create a .config preconfigured for the armadillo 9
make armadillo9_defconfig
</pre>
Next, let's explore the kernel space with the help of a simple module,
'simple.c'.

<pre class="code">
#include &lt;linux/kernel.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/module.h&gt;

int init_module(void){
	printk("hello, armadillo!\n");
	return 0;
}

void cleanup_module(void){
	printk("bye, armadillo\n");
}
</pre>

and compile the module using this Makefile.

<pre class="code">
# On my machine, I keep the uncompressed Linux source at
# /root/arm/linux-2.6.12.3-a9-10. Modify this for your setup. 
obj-m:=test.o
all:
        make -C /root/arm/linux-2.6.12.3-a9-10 M=`pwd` modules
clean: 
        make -C /root/arm/linux-2.6.12.3-a9-10 M=`pwd` clean
</pre>
After running make, we will have a "simple.ko" module in the directory.
Now, let's follow the previous method to copy the module to the Armadillo
board.
<pre>
cp simple.ko /var/www/html
</pre>
Use 'minicom' to connect to the development board, and
upload the module.

<pre>
wget http://192.168.0.1/simple.ko

# Insert the module using insmod
insmod simple.ko

# This will show 'simple' as one of the loaded modules
lsmod 

# Unload the module 
rmmod simple
</pre>

We will see the "armadillo" messages at the end if we run the 'dmesg' command.
</p>

<h3> Moving further... </h3>

<p>
The possibilities are infinite in the ARM Linux world. One of the new
trends in the Embedded Application Development is "Debootstrap". The
Debootstrap lets a developer install a Debian-based distribution on the ARM
board. If we have a Compact Flash disk with enough memory to run a minimal
Debian distribution (a 256 MB or 512 MB CF Card is more than enough), then
the application develpment for the Armadillo9 board becomes as easy as:

<pre>
apt-get install application
</pre>

We will explore more details of Debootstrapping the Armadillo 9 
in the next part of this article.

<h1>Generating Postscript graphs using PyX</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/john.html">Maxin B. John</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>Postscript is an interpreted language which is highly oriented toward
graphics and typography. It is a device-independent, stack-based page
description language used in the desktop publishing area.</p>

<p>As Don Lancaster of <a href=
"http://www.swtpc.com/mholley/RadioElectronics/TV_Typewriter.htm">TV
typewriter</a> fame comments, "Postscript is an underappreciated
yet superb general purpose computing language. In its spare time, PostScript
also excels at dirtying up otherwise clean sheets of paper."<br>
PyX is a Python package which can be used to generate publication-ready,
high-quality PostScript files. It combines an abstraction of the PostScript
drawing model with a TeX/LaTeX interface.</p>

<h3>A prelude to PostScript</h3>
<p>PostScript is an object-oriented, interpreted, dynamically-typed,
stack-based language which follows the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">Reverse Polish
Notation</a> syntax. PostScript treats images and fonts as a
collection of geometrical objects rather than as bitmaps. As it is an
interpreted language, it needs an interpreter that executes PostScript
instructions. Ghostscript is the most famous PostScript interpreter
which runs on Linux, Windows, and Mac Operating Systems. Since PostScript
is dynamically typed, its variables do not have a declared
type and can contain any kind of value.<br>
As any other programming language, it works with various types of data such
as numbers, characters, strings and arrays. These are referred to as
PostScript 'objects'. It manipulates data using variables
and also using a special entity called a 'stack'. The stack is a piece of
memory set aside for data to be used by PostScript. Like any ordinary stack, it
is a 'last in, first out' type data structure. The operator and operand
handling of a PostScript interpreter can be demonstrated using this small
example:

<pre>
1 2 add
</pre>
The operands 1 and 2 are pushed on to the stack and then the add operator
replaces them with their sum. That is, the 'add' operator removes the top
two numbers from the stack, adds them, and pushes the sum back onto the
stack. The same is true for the 'sub', 'div', 'mod', and 'mul' operators.
</p>

<h3>Let's get our hands dirty with some PostScript snippets</h3>
<p>If I say that PostScript is the world's best programming language to "Just
let it out what is in your heart", it won't be an exaggerated
statement. Imagine the situation where you have a crush on the human being
sitting next to you. You can't use any other language as those languages can
either provide only console based black and white things (totally unromantic) -
or if you managed to get a romantic output, the code will take
several pages. But just think of PostScript - and in 6 lines, you can express
your feelings to the person you care for. See the code in <a href=
"misc/john/heart.ps">heart.ps</a> for example. The recipient will have to invoke a PostScript
interpreter to see the what's in your geek heart, though.</p>
<pre>
gv heart.ps
</pre>
<br>
<img src="misc/john/heart.png" border="1">
<br clear="all">
<br>
<pre>
%!ps                                % Every PostScript program should start with this line.
1 0 0 setrgbcolor                   %sets the color as red (rgb)
250 210 moveto                      %sets the initial position
270 170 100 100 200 275 curveto     %draws the two curves 
400 170 100 100 200 275 curveto
fill
showpage
</pre>
<br>
<br>
<p>A "Hello, world!" program in PostScript is available here [see <a href=
"misc/john/helloworld.ps">helloworld.ps</a>]. It's simple: just issue the
string to be displayed, in parentheses, after setting the font and position
of the text:

<pre>
/Helvetica findfont    % Get the basic font
30 scalefont           % Scale the font to 30 points
setfont                % Make Helvitica the current font
250 450 moveto         % Text positioned at (250,450)
(Hello World !)
show
showpage
</pre>

This will show "Hello World !" in the specified position. Another string
manipulating program which contains a 'for' loop is given here [<a href=
"misc/john/LG.ps">LG.ps</a>]. Another simple program to understand the
graphical nature of PostScript is the drawing of a square using
<strong>lineto</strong> [<a href="misc/john/square.ps">square.ps</a>].
</p>

<h3>A Simple PostScript program using PyX</h3>

<p>
Generally the PostScript programs are generated by other applications.
So from now on, instead of writing by hand, we are giving the
resposibility of generating PostScript programs to a great graphical package
available in Python programming language - <strong>PyX</strong>.<br>
PyX is available for download at the <a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=45430">SourceForge
Download Page</a>. It can be installed just like any other Python module.

<pre class="code">
tar zxvf PyX-0.10.tar.gz
cd PyX-0.10
python setup.py install
</pre>

A complete installation of Tex should be present in your system as PyX
depends on it. As Tex is usually distributed with almost all the standard
distributions as part of authoring and publishing, it can be easily installed
using the "Add/Remove Software" option in your distribution. If it is not
present, another way to install TeX support in your system is:
<pre>
yum install tetex           # on Redhat/Fedora distributions
apt-get install tetex-latex # on Debian/Ubuntu distributions
</pre>
Now let's try a small Python program to dive into the PostScript world using
PyX [see <a href="misc/john/hello.py">listing5</a>].

<pre class="code">
from pyx import *

c = canvas.canvas()
c.text(10, 10, "Hello, world!")
c.writePSfile("hello")
</pre>

Run this program as <strong>python hello.py</strong> 
</p>
<p>This will create a file "hello.ps" in the present working directory. To
see the output, you can use Ghostview (gv), Gimp, or 'evince' as these programs can also
display the PostScript output.</p>

<h3>Some more PostScript graphs</h3>

<p>
A graph is generally used to depict the relationship between two or more
variables with a discrete or continuous value range. It is very useful in
visualizing collected data. One of such data sets that I collect daily is the
blood sugar count of my mother who is a diabetes patient. This helps us to
regulate her insulin injection volume as well as managing her diet. Last
week's data is [<a href="misc/john/diabetes.dat">diabetes.dat</a>]:
<pre>
Sunday    260
Monday    242
Tuesday   245
Wednesday 228
Thursday  282
Friday    232
Saturday  254
</pre>
<p>
<img src="misc/john/diabetes.png" border="1">
<br clear="all">
The Python program to visualize
this data is [<a href="misc/john/diabetes.py">diabetes.py</a>]:</p>
<p>
<pre>
from pyx import *

g = graph.graphxy(width=8, x=graph.axis.bar())  # creates a graphxy instance
g.plot(graph.data.file("diabetes.dat", xname=0, y=2), [graph.style.changebar()]) # reads data from diabetes.dat 
g.writePSfile("diabetes") # generates the PostScript file
</pre>
<br clear="all">
</p>
<p>
The output of this program is [<a href="misc/john/diabetes.ps">diabetes.ps</a>]. PyX
can generate graphs based on the functions also.
</p>
<p>
<img src="misc/john/sine.png" border="1">
</p>
This program draws the sine function graph [<a href="misc/john/sine.py">sine.py</a>].
<pre>
from pyx import *

g = graph.graphxy(width=8)
g.plot(graph.data.function("y(x)=sin(x)", min=0, max=10))
g.writePSfile("sine")
</pre>
The output of this program is [<a href="misc/john/sine.ps">sine.ps</a>]. The PyX
package supports the generation of 3D graphs with the help of the
'graphxyz'
instance. Exploring the features of PyX will be a truly rewarding experience
if you want to 'visualize' the particular data that you are interested in.
<br clear="all">
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Apart from being the worldwide leader in printing and imaging standard,
PostScript is the champion of platform-independent documentation
standards as well as excellent output quality.<br>
PyX provides a very sophisticated PostScript graph generation mechanism using
the Python language. It provides full access to the PostScript features and helps
the programmer to generate high quality graphs without much effort.

%T   "User Interface Design for Mere Mortals: A Hands-On Guide to User Interface Design Software Independent Approach!" 
%S	 For Mere Mortals
</pre>
<hr>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
I approached this book with high expectations. I've thought for a long time
that User Interface Design has been an under-appreciated part of software
development, especially in the Open Source community: code geeks abound,
but documentation and interfaces have lagged behind until recently. Could
this book be the gateway to a new enthusiasm for the red-headed stepchild
of the development process?
</p>

<h3>Contents</h3>
<p>
Ironically, the book suffers from a number of the very flaws that good user
interface design should avoid. The back cover starts with the quotation,
"The key to any successful application lies in providing an interface users
not only enjoy interacting with but which also saves time, eliminates
frustration, and gets the job done with minimal effort."
</p>

<p>
Considering that this was a book on usability, I found the design of the
book somewhat disappointing. In the introduction, page <em>xxiii</em> features an
overview of the chapters and their contents - but by choosing to bold the
chapter numbers and set the chapter titles off only with quotation marks,
the information of most interest to the user is buried in the same block of
text as the chapter content. Given this beginning, I was dubious about the
usability of this book. Shouldn't a book on user interface design have a
good user interface, itself?
</p> 

<pre>
Brief Histories
Concepts and Issues
Making the Business Case
Good Design
How User Behave <em>[sic]</em>
Analyzing Your Users
Designing a User Interface
Designing a Web Site
Usability
</pre>

<p>
As you can see from the chapter headings, there's an inconsistency in the
naming scheme for the chapters, as well as a typo/grammatical error ("How
User Behave"). It's also hard to predict at a glance what is covered in
"Good Design" vs. "Concepts and Issues". Why is there a chapter at the end
called "Usability"? Is it an overall summmary? It would be better to have
more explicit chapter names, such as "Elements of Good Design" (goals,
constraints, documentation) and "Testing Usability".
</p>

<h3>"Mere Mortals"</h3>
<p>
I checked the <a href="http://www.formeremortals.com/">Web site</a> for the
"Mere Mortals" series, and found that the home page was titled "Home Page".
"Mere Mortals" indeed! The site could be used as a textbook case study of
inadequate design. The image names for the navigation elements are
uninformative, and the bulk of the page is taken up by a large picture
labelled "Book Circle" - which of course is a simply an image and not
significant content or a navigational image map. I hoped this was only a
splash page issue, but discovered that the site's contents are also images
devoid of any text as well. Truly disappointing for a site devoted to an
educational series.
</p>

<p>
(Is anyone surprised to learn that the site was created in Front Page?)
</p>

<p>
Author Eric Butow explains in the preface that this book owes its origins
to a usability course he redesigned in 2005 for California State University
Sacramento.  It certainly reads like a textbook - and that is not a
compliment. It has a somewhat pedantic, almost boring tone, and chapter-end
quizzes (there is an answer key in the back.) I found myself becoming
annoyed with the continual "tell 'em what you're going to tell them, then
tell them, then tell them what you told them" - especially when the word
'important' was repeated three times within two pages. Each chapter begins
with a meticulous explanation of the content to be covered, and ends with a
wordy summary that reminded me of elementary school book reports. I would
have preferred a bullet-point list.
</p>

<p>
This is evidently a feature and not a bug in the "For Mere Mortals" series,
which purports as part of its philosophy to "respect the reader's intellect
and capacity for learning". I conclude that I may not be the sort of Mere
Mortal they're aiming for.
</p>

<h3>Software Independence?</h3>
<p>
The book promises a "software independent approach". Perhaps it delivers on
that promise by not suggesting specific applications for the UI designer,
but some combination of the author's main experience with Wind0ws
environments (his author bio contains mainly Wind0ws titles) or the
preponderance of Micr0s0ft exposure in the expected readership leads to
many more examples drawn from that realm.
</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
Despite the plodding tone, the book does fulfill its promise to be a
primer, a grounding, and a beginning to the field. I suspect most readers
will find it far more useful after a careful pass with a highlighter
marker. This will get you to a passing familiarity with the terms and
concepts of UI Design, but it lacks the stellar design and execution
essential to a classic. Don't expect to learn <i>how</i> to design well
from it; do expect to learn <i>why</i> good design is necessary, and how to
sell the need for good design.

Kat likes to tell people she's one of the youngest people to have learned
to program using punchcards on a mainframe (back in '83); but the truth is
that since then, despite many hours in front of various computer screens,
she's a computer user rather than a computer programmer.
</p>

<p>
When away from the keyboard, her hands have been found full of knitting
needles, various pens, henna, red-hot welding tools, upholsterer's shears,
and a pneumatic scaler.
