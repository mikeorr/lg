If all you need is the ability to telnet into your Linux
box, there is a simpler way (assuming your ISP gives you a
Web site with CGI).  First, create a script on your site
called "updateIP.cgi":
<PRE>
#!/bin/bash
echo $REMOTE_ADDR >latestIP
</PRE>
and another called "telnet.cgi":
<PRE> 
#!/bin/bash
echo Location: telnet://`cat latestIP`
echo
</PRE> 
(Don't forget to make the CGI scripts executable.) Set up a
cron job that will do "lynx -source
http://www.example.com/~foo/updateIP.cgi >/dev/null 2>&1"
every 15 minutes (or whatever).  (Replace
http://www.example.com/~foo/ with the URL of your site, of
course.) Now you can set yourself a bookmark for
"http://www.example.com/~foo/telnet.cgi"; when you go to it,
your browser will be redirected to the telnet: URL and will
(should) fire up a telnet session.
<P>
No need to pay somebody for Dynamic DNS or a domain name.
If your ISP doesn't support CGI, you can probably hack up
something with FTP instead.

Another way to make it boot SCSI first is to install the IDE drive
on the *secondary* IDE controller, not the primary.  Whether this
works or not depends on the BIOS and the SCSI card.

This is a problem with the net-tools used. The /proc/net format changed
during 2.1.x development and old net-tools just can't grok it. The 2.1.x
Documentation/Changes file states version and location of the net-tools
you need to get correct results: for 2.2.0-pre4 it's v1.49.
<P>
It's generally a Good Thing to check Changes after patching the kernel
tree. There are more things you need to consider when running a 2.[12].x
kernel on a 2.0.x distribution, and Changes has the details.

Triple booting

<P>
I read your article about booting linux and NT.  I have a triple booting
solution for you.  I read this in the Jan99 PC@uthority so I can't claim the
credit on this much
<P>
I recently saw a suggestion for triple booting  NTFS, FAT32 and linux.  Well
here's a quick tip: Linux can be put into the NT boot menu.  To do so, run
lilo to create a boot sector of your linux partition, then run:
<PRE> 
	dd if=/dev/hdc1 of=/dev/hda/bootsect.lnx bs=512 count=1
</PRE> 
Replace /dev/hdc1 with your linux partition and /dev/hda/ with your
mountpoint of your "C:" drive under NT.  This copies your linux boot sector
to a file  which NT reads as C:\BOOTSECT.LNX.  Then append C:\boot.ini with
<PRE> 
	c:\bootsect.lnx="linux"
</PRE> 
Reboot, and linux should work off the NT boot menu.
<P>
this is the article I saw word for word and found that it didn't work so
here is a version that does.
I did this before converting Win98 to FAT32
First make sure that the "C:\"partition is mounted
<PRE> 
	mount -t msdos /dev/hda1 /mnt/win98
</PRE> 
then reference it /mnt/win98 in the place of the /dev/hda1, so the line
should look like this
<PRE> 
	dd if=/dev/hdc1 of=/mnt/win98/bootsect.lnx bs=512 count=1
</PRE> 
I found that is worked.
<P>

Here is a two cent tip that I have been meaning to submit for a long long
time now.
<P>
If you have a large stack of CD-ROMS, finding where a particular file
lies can be a time consuming task.  My solution uses the locate program
and associated utilities to build up a database of the CDs' contents that
allows for rapid searching.
<P>
First we need to create the database, the following script does the
trick nicely.
<PRE> 
   #!/bin/bash
   onedisk()
   {
      mount /mnt/cdrom
      find /mnt/cdrom -maxdepth 7 -print | sed "s;^/mnt/cdrom;$1;" > $1.find
      eject -u cdrom
   }
   echo Enter name of disk in device:
   read diskname
   while [ -n "$diskname" ]; do
      onedisk $diskname
      echo Enter name of next disk or Enter if done:
      read diskname
   done
   echo OK, preparing cds.db
   cat *.find | sort -f | /usr/lib/findutils/frcode > cds.db
   echo Done...
</PRE> 
Start with no CD mounted.  Run the script.  It will ask for a label for
the CD, a short name like "sunsite1" is best.  It will then quickly scan
the CD, eject it and prompt for another.  When you have exhausted your
collection just hit enter at the prompt.  A file called cds.db will be
done.  To make it simple to use copy cds.db to /var/lib (or anywhere
else, that is where locatedb is on my system).  Now create an alias like
<PRE> 
       alias cdlocate="locate -d /var/lib/cds.db"
</PRE> 
Now if I type "cdlocate lyx" I get
 <PRE> 
debian20_contrib/debian/hamm/contrib/binary-i386/text/lyx_0.12.0.final-0.1.deb

</PRE> 
In order to prevent locate from warning you that the database is old try
touch -t 010100002020 /var/lib/cds.db to set the modification date to
January 1 2020.

My English is terrible,so feel free to correct 
if you decide to publish...
<P>
Hello,i am a French linuxer and here is my two cent tips.
If you have many CD-ROMs and want to retrieve
this_file_I'm_sure_i_have_but_can't_remember_where,
it can helps.
<P>
It consist of 2 small scripts using gnu utilities:
<B>updatedb</B> and <B>locate</B>.
Normally 'updatedb' run every night, creating
a database for all the mounted file systems and 'locate'
is used to query this system-wide database.But you can
tell them where are the files to index and where to
put the database.That's what my scripts does:
<P>
The first script (addcd.sh) create a database for the
cd actually mounted.You must run it once for every cdrom.
<P> 
The second ( cdlocate.sh ) search in the databases
created by addcd.sh and display the cdname and full path
of the files matching the pattern you give in parameter.
So you can search for unmounted files !
<P>
  To use:
<ul>
<li>create a directory and copy in it the 2 scripts
<PRE> 
        mkdir /home/cdroms
        cp addcd.sh cdlocate.sh /home/cdroms
</PRE> 
<li>mount the first cdrom you want to index
<PRE> 
        mount /mnt/cdrom
</PRE> 
    ( if your mount point is different , you must adapt
      the script )
<li>run addcd.sh with a fully descriptive name for
    this cdrom as parameter (this description will
    be used as part of the database name ,don't use space):
<PRE> 
        ./addcd.sh Linux.Toolkit.Disk1.Oct.1996 
</PRE> 
    It will take some time to updatedb to create the
    databases specially if the cdrom contain many files.
<li>umount the cdrom and go to step 2 for all
    the cdroms you want or every time you've got
    a new one(I have more than 70 databases created
    this way).
<li>you can now use cdlocate.sh,to retrieve files
<PRE> 
    ./cdlocate.sh '*gimp*rpm'
</PRE> 
</ul>
Beware that locate's regular expressions have some
peculiarities, 'man locate' will explain.
<P>
Hope this help and happy linuxing !

Yes, all of these are supported in various ways.  Animated formats (AVI,
MOV, animated GIFs, etc) are supported through the xanim program, along with
a host of other tools (xanim just has the widest range of animation format
support). Xanim also has support for playing some types of audio embedded in
the video file (such as audio that accompanies an AVI file).  Sound formats
(WAV, AU, etc) are supported via the "sox" program (that plays these
formats) and the Linux sound drivers (which you can get either in the Linux
distributions or a commercial version which supports a wide range of sound
cards and is available from 4Front Technologies for about $20US).  Static
formats for graphics images (JPEG, GIF, TIFF, TGA, etc) are supported by
lots of tools:  the GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program, which is similar
to Photoshop), xv (which is like LView), ImageMagick and NetPBM (which are
both a collection of graphics viewer/manipulation tools).  There are lots of
tools for viewing/listening to multimedia files.  You can try the Linux
Multimedia Pages (I've forgotten the URL but I think its listed on SSC's
Resources pages) and my Linux Graphics pages at
www.graphics-muse.org/linux.html.
<P>
Multimedia on Linux is probably not quite what you're used to on Windows as
far as how you use them, but the support for most of the well known and well
used formats is available.  What you can't do (at least I doubt you can) is
run multimedia programs from CDs that are Windows specific programs.  Those
programs won't run (well, they might under WINE but I've never tried them)
but their support files may be readable by some of the Linux/Unix programs
I've mentioned above.

The distinction between Linux and UNIX is, at this point, only in name.
UNIX is a trademark of the X/Open Group and requires a fee for branding
a product as a flavor of UNIX.  Some vendors have considered getting
UNIX certification for their particular brand of Linux, but I haven't
heard of any of them actually doing it.
Linux does, however, support the POSIX standards and others required for
the UNIX branding, so it could be considered a flavor of UNIX even if it
isn't quite official.

you asked:
<blockquote> <font color="navy">
I am a 2nd year computer science student. I have looked everywhere
for the answer and found only basic answers. My question is what
exactly is the difference between Linux and UNIX, excluding size and
speed. I would appreciate it if you could just send me a few of the
differences.
</font></blockquote> 
<P>
For all intents and purposes Linux *is* Unix -- ie. it is another unix
variant.  UNIX is not a single operating system, anyway.  It is now a
brand managed by the Open Group.  That means that Operating System
vendors (or Linux distribution vendors) may apply for Unix
certification and branding.  They pay money and TOG runs a bunch of
tests and basically says, "ok, that's unix."
<P>
Of course, there are other relevant standards, such as POSIX.  No
standard fully covers the differences between branded or unbranded
Unix implementations.
<P>
My question to you is, which unix variant are you referring to?  There
are so many, Solaris, HP-UX, Digital Unix, AIX, SCO, and BSDI, to name
some common ones.  SCO is sometimes thought of as the main UNIX as it
is the direct descendent of AT&T's original System V source.  
<P>
Of course, the BSD (Berkeley) derived variations play a pivotal role
in Unix history as well.  All of the Unix variant's mentioned above
including Linux incorporate functionality and ideas from both primary
Unix flavors as well as incorporating their own ideas.  
<P>
System V (SCO) style unix, for example, has a different boot structure
than BSD.  Most recent Linux distributions use System V style boot
scripts.  But Linux systems also incorporate BSD style printing
mechanisms.  The GNU command-line tools used on Linux systems are much
enhanced and extended versions of their System V and BSD
counterparts.  GNU ls has many more options than what many unix
vendors may ship.  To further confuse the issue, GNU tools can be used
to replace vendor-supplied commands if desired.
<P>
Are we having fun yet?  
<P>
Your best bet is to read up on Unix history to understand why unix
(small u) is not one Operating System but a family of Operating
Systems with similar characteristics.  Filesystem structure and
permissions, basic commands, process sheduling, boot method and dozens
upon dozens of other characteristics add up to define an OS as "unix".
Linux falls quite handily into this family despite the lack of
(expensive and arguably meaningless) Open Group unix branding.

Well, the short answer is "yes." :)
There are a number of Linux applications that can view and/or edit these
types of files.
<P> 
The Gimp ( http://www.gimp.org/ ) can edit almost every graphics format
known to man, and could be considered a good alternative to Photoshop.
You can see quite a few others at
http://core.freshmeat.net/appindex/x11/graphics.html
<P> 
In regards to the video formats, XAnim ( http://xanim.va.pubnix.com/ )
can view most of these without any problem.
<P> 
As for sounds, there are a plethora of programs for doing almost
anything you could think of that involve sounds.  For starters, take a
look at http://core.freshmeat.net/appindex/console/sound.html and
http://core.freshmeat.net/appindex/x11/sound.html for a few of the
available sound apps.
Have fun.

There's another HOWTO at
http://eunuchs.org/linux/ip_masq/ip_masq_content.html
I haven't tried setting up IPMasq myself, so I'm not sure how much this
good this will do, but I hope it helps a bit.

Re: Netscape help

This one's pretty easy.
If you're lucky, your settings are only corrupted.  This is fixed by
removing the ".netscape" (or just "netscape", without a leading dot, I'm
not sure which offhand) directory from affected users' home directories.
<P>
If Communicator itself is broken, you can remove the /usr/local/netscape
directory and reinstall Netscape from the .tar.gz file that I assume you
downloaded.  If you installed it from an RPM or some other sort of
package, I would read the manpage for the package manager and remove it
using rpm or dpkg or what have you.
Good luck.

I noticed in your mailbag several letters talking about errors on network
devices.
<P>
The correct answer is to upgrade the net-tools package.  The format of
many /proc files has changed. In particular, those used by ifconfig.  I
recommend browsing through linux/Documentation/Changes for everyone.  I
would even suggest it be mandatory reading. =)

You wanted to get rid of "Start" in fvwm95. Edit your .fvwm95rc like
this: 
<PRE> 
*FvwmTaskBarAutoStick
# here I changed Start to Linux
*FvwmTaskBarStartName Linux
*FvwmTaskBarStartMenu StartMenu
*FvwmTaskBarStartIcon mini-exp.xpm
*FvwmTaskBarShowTips
</PRE> 
You might want to have a look at an article I wrote a few months ago:
<P> 
<A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/issue21/fvwm.html">
http://linuxgazette.net/issue21/fvwm.html</A> 
<P> 
Regarding the virtual desktop issue, have a look into your
/etc/X11/XF86Config. In the screen section look for the keyword
virtual. Change it to
<PRE> 
        Virtual     0 0
</PRE> 
to switch off the virtual screen.
<P>
