I have done a fair bit of my own "second guessing of the user" in the 
past, and where it comes to the g++ folks they generally get it right.  
Be that as it may, there is a rather irritating  and dangerous 
compile-time warning in g++ version 4.1.2.  that is to me, an ideal 
example of where acting with the best intention to protect the user from 
his own stupidity can backfire.
</p>

<p>
A pure virtual base class, or interface class definition is used when 
one would like to use the class definition without having access in any 
way to the implementation.  Typically, a factory function creates 
objects of this type, and another factory function may be used to 
destroy them.  One cannot use the 'new' keyword to create, or the 
'delete' keyword to destroy objects of this type, as the object 
definition has no public constructor or destructor, and no base 
implementation for the virtual methods.  However, one may call the 
objects methods; since they are all pure virtual declarations, one is 
guaranteed of their implementation in the subclass.
</p>

<p>
The following header is used to provide a pure virtual interface class 
and functions to create or delete instances of the class:
</p>

<pre>
class abc {
  public :
     virtual void if_method1()=0;
     virtual long if_method2()=0;
     virtual bool if_method3()=0;
     ...
};
 
abc *abc_factory_new();
void abc_factory_delete(abc *);
</pre>

<p>
when compiled, this emits the warning:
   ``  warning: 'class abc' has virtual functions but non-virtual 
destructor''
</p>

<p>
which is only partially true, as there is no declaration for a 
destructor at all (either virtual or non-virtual).  One might expect the 
following code to emit warnings both for the attempt to create an 
instance of 'abc' as well as the attempt to delete 'abc':
<pre>
int main() {
  abc *a = new abc();
  delete a;
}
</pre>

<p>
As it happens, we are warned when we try to create an instance of 'abc' 
(because of all the pure virtual functions) , but not warned at all when 
we delete the object directly.  It would appear that g++ assumes that 
the coder has made a mistake, and creates a default (public non-virtual) 
destructor for the class anyway, regardless that we excluded definitions 
for the destructor to prevent accidental deletion.  To add insult to 
injury, g++ then warns the coder that his [automatic] destructor is not 
virtual.
</p>

<p>
Just as well that it does warn you, since the destructor it 
automatically creates is not virtual, and therefore invoking delete 
against the virtual base class (which should have failed with a compiler 
error) would result in a potential memory leak.
</p>

<p>
The above warning is not a new one, and previous versions of the 
compiler would emit the warning when a destructor was declared as 
non-virtual in a class with virtual method declarations.  For example,
</p>

<pre>
class abc {
  protected :
    ~abc() {};
  public :
     virtual void if_method1()=0;
     virtual long if_method2()=0;
     virtual bool if_method3()=0;
     ...
};
</pre>
will also  emit the above warning, but at least fails with the 'delete' 
keyword, emitting the additional warning:
<pre>
error: 'abc::~abc()' is protected
filexx:yyy: error: within this context
</pre>

<p>
Now, I for one have an absolute fetish about eliminating warnings.  I 
can't stand them.  When I see a warning, I just <em>have</em> to try to 
eliminate it to get a "clean" compilation.
</p>

<p>
There are a few problems with the prior definition of class 'abc', 
though.  In the first place, the class is no longer 'pure virtual', in 
that it includes the potential for code associated with what should be a 
simple interface definition.  In order to eliminate the warning 
altogether one would define the class as:
</p>

<pre>
class abc {
  protected :
    virtual ~abc()=0;
  public :
     virtual void if_method1()=0;
     virtual long if_method2()=0;
     virtual bool if_method3()=0;
     ...
};
</pre>
which compiles cleanly, and gives you what you want.  There is one more 
problem though, which only rears it's head when you subclass the virtual 
base class.
</p>

<pre>
...
 
class def : public abc
{
  public :
  virtual ~def(){}
  virtual void if_method1(){}
  virtual int  if_method2(){return 0;}
  virtual bool if_method3(){return true;}
 
};
   
int main()
{
  def *a = new def();
  delete a;
}
</pre>

<p>
When you compile and link this, the linker complains about a missing 
symbol for the destructor of class abc!
``undefined reference to `abc::~abc()''
</p>

<p>
To eliminate the problem, you have to provide a body for the destructor: 
`` virtual ~abc(){} '' rather than ``virtual ~abc()=0;'' in the above 
class definition for 'abc'.  Although this is less than perfect in that 
there is an implementation defined for a member of what would otherwise 
be a pure virtual base class, it accomplishes what we need to do, and 
eliminates those horrible warnings.
</p>

<p>
In parting, g++ does provide another way to rid us of the  ``  warning: 
'class abc' has virtual functions but non-virtual destructor'', by 
specifying the -Wno-non-virtual-dtor flag at compile time.  Beware 
though; The default destructor as created [automatically] for the 
virtual base class is public, which implies that an inadvertent 'delete' 
on a pointer to the virtual base class will succeed with a resulting 
memory leak.

It may be true, I can't say without seeing the full class definition. My 
Annotated C++ Reference Manual says "If a base or member has a destructor and 
no destructor is declared for it's derived class a default destructor is 
generated". I can see that class abc is not a derived class, but does it have 
member variables with destructors?

Hi, Neil
</p>

<p>
Nope.  No member variables.
</p>

<p>
I think the point I was trying to get across to anyone interested, is
that there is a default public non-virtual destructor generated where no
destructor was specified for a class.
</p>

<p>
It seems to be the case regardless of whether or not member variables
were specified, or whether the class contains pure virtual methods.
</p>

<p>
Now that is ok, so long as one understands that this is the case, as one
can simply code around it as I have done.  I noticed though, that
several people received the wrong advice (not on TAG) as to how to deal
with the compiler warning.
</p>

<p>
As far as I can figure, the vtable must contain placeholders for virtual
destructor though, as soon as there exists even a single pure virtual
method in a class declaration, since you can never create an instance of
it anyway which makes coding a body for the destructor of such a class
rather redundant.
</p>

<p>
Would it not be more sensible then to simply generate the automatic
private virtual destructor as the default for pure virtual classes, with
no associated symbol that the linker can complain about as being
unresolved?
</p>

<p>
Why insist that the destructor for a class with pure virtual methods
should have a body?  What on earth would be the sense in making it
public and non-virtual by default to boot?

I meant 'protected' rather than 'private'.  Sorry.
