<p>
Hello,
</p>

<p>
I was looking at version control mechanisms to handle /etc
on the machines here. If people on TAG have used such systems I would
appreciate feedback.
</p>

<p>
CVS: seems to be the classic solution. Cons: People say it is old and
unmaintained code which is "end-of-life".
</p>

<p>
Mercurial: One of the modern VC systems considered "notable" on
Rick Moen's knowledge base. One difficulty with "hg" is that it
insists on the "distributed" model. Putting the version control
history outside /etc (a la CVS) would require convoluted mounts.
</p>

<p>
GIT: Another modern VC system (though not "notable" as per Rick's
kb). It is rather similar to Mercurial in many ways. One difference
is that one can use the environment variable GIT_DIR to point to a
different directory for storing VC history.
</p>

<p>
Some reasons to keep VC history outside /etc:
	1. This way one can easily check for "cruft" without
	   adding an explicit "ignore" for ".hg" or ".git" ...
	2. Uses less space in "/etc".
	3. Can keep the history on an "archival" disk safe from
	   potential corruption.
</p>

<p>
Any thoughts/suggestions by people on TAG are welcome as usual!
</p>

<p>
Regards,
</p>

<p>
Kapil.

Oddly enough, I was just talking about that exact problem with my
friends in Victoria, Australia:

<p>
  &gt; I still use RCS in various /etc sub-directories at home (postfix
  &gt; and others), mostly because I'm too lazy to change something that
  &gt; works.  RCS does have the annoying habit of locking or changing the
  &gt; permissions of files when they are checked in until you check them out
  &gt; again....quite annoying when what you are checking in are executable
  &gt; scripts.
</p>

<p>
  Permissions, ownership, special files (symlinks being the pointy end of
  that problem), and pretty nearly all such metadata -- but RCS remains
  useful anyway.
</p>

<p>
  Oh, and leaving litttle RCS droppings all over <em>in-working-tree</em>
  locations:  right in your working tree itself unless you create a "RCS"         
  subtree to receive them.  This avoidable misfeature has been tragically         
  replicated by several of the otherwise excellent next-generation SCMs,
  too (bzr, darcs, Mercurial).  Ugh, hate that.
</p>

<p>
  Only G.B. Shaw's fabled "unreasonable man" would seek something markedly
  better for sysadmin housekeeping, and the *buntu boys are working the
  bugs out of adapting bzr for that purpose:
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/VersionControlledEtc">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/VersionControlledEtc</a>
</p>

<p>
  Worth watching, I think.  (All hail the unreasonable man!)
</p>



<p>
I should note that sharp-eyed mailing list member Trent W. Buck 
demurred slightly:
                                                                                
  Uh, all three of the SCMs you mentioned have <strong>one</strong> top-level metadata
  directory in the root project directory.
</p>

<p>
Which is a good point, and is indeed an improvement on RCS having a
metadata directory in <em>each</em> working directory.  This matter, by the
way, was extensively explored in Kevin Smith's blog in
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061206073756/http://blog.fxa.org/articles/category/scm">http://web.archive.org/web/20061206073756/http://blog.fxa.org/articles/category/scm</a>
.

<pre>
&gt; CVS: seems to be the classic solution. Cons: People say it is old and
&gt; unmaintained code which is "end-of-life".
</pre>

<p>
CVS should never be deployed afresh, at this point:  If nothing else,
use svn instead, as a drop-in replacement.  It fixes all of CVS's
implementation problems, while retaining (for good or bad) the same
design aspirations, no more and no less.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Mercurial: One of the modern VC systems considered "notable" on
&gt; Rick Moen's knowledge base. One difficulty with "hg" is that it
&gt; insists on the "distributed" model. Putting the version control
&gt; history outside /etc (a la CVS) would require convoluted mounts.
</pre>

<p>
You're actually mixing together a good thing and a bad one:  The
distributed model is the good part, and nothing about it inherently 
prevents what one wishes to achieve, here.  
</p>



<pre>
&gt; GIT: Another modern VC system (though not "notable" as per Rick's
&gt; kb). 
</pre>

<p>
I think, since you mention it, that git is overdue for that marker.
It's rapidly moved from being a raw, brand-new, and evolving project to 
a mature tool and major success story.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; It is rather similar to Mercurial in many ways. One difference
&gt; is that one can use the environment variable GIT_DIR to point to a
&gt; different directory for storing VC history.
</pre>

<p>
Fantastic!  See, I didn't know that.  I've learned something useful
today.  Thank you, Kapil.
</p>

<p>
Oddly enough, this is precisely the issue I stubbornly insisted 
was significant, in my conversation with Trent -- and is the very
solution I suggested:
</p>

<p>
   &gt; Where else could metadata be kept?  Remember that distributed SCMs
   &gt; <strong>only</strong> have a working tree -- there is no "server" which can hang onto
   &gt; metadata.
</p>

<p>
   I would suggest:  Ideally wherever specified via an appopriate
   dotfile entry, environment variable, or system-wide /etc datum.
</p>

<p>
My exploration of SCMs has been extremely scattershot, so it's always
possible that darcs, Hg (Mercurial), Monotone, bzr (Bazaar), Codeville,
or ArX has <em>also</em> sprouted this facility, and I just haven't yet heard 
about it.

Avoid them.  They become problematic, since you enforce something on
/etc for which it was never designed.  At best you can try and tie in
the package manager
(<a href="http://www.isisetup.ch/wiki/IsiSetupRevisionControl">http://www.isisetup.ch/wiki/IsiSetupRevisionControl</a>) but even that

I had the impression that all checked-in file metadata gets accurately
stored and versioned.  I could be wrong (or misreading your point) --
and I've not actually <em>tried</em> this sort of thing.  I've only (slightly)
considered the concept, so far.
</p>

<p>
Mind you, although I think it a capital idea to store a full <em>history</em>
of /etc contents in an SCM, I would have to think long and hard before
using /etc checkouts to populate /etc directly, e.g., files in /etc
existing only after SCM checkout <em>into</em> /etc.
</p>

<p>
The big win would tend to come with, e.g., routinely tracking changes to
/etc/apache and /etc/bind configuration files, since both Apache HTTPd
and BIND9 (especially the latter) are horrifically uninformative in
the ways they fall over and die from syntax errors in their conffiles.
Much detective work can be saved from the simple ability to be able to
retrace diff histories in, say, DNS zonefiles.

No -- it does not.  GIT only tracks the execute bit on files; and the
requisite of using  isisetup is that the metastore has to be updated
each time something changes within this supposed version controlled
/etc -- that's not good.

I used "distributed model" rather loosely and you are right.

</pre>

<p>
Pleased to be of help.
</p>

<p>
I just noticed that there is mention of this approach on the ubuntu
wiki link that you sent me.
</p>

<p>
As I mentioned (and you are aware) there are some convoluted
mechanisms available to achieve almost this goal with the other SCMs.
For example,
	mount --bind /var/lib/repos/hg/etc.hg /etc/.hg
(for this the /etc/.hg directory has to exist which is a small bit of
cruft). After this Mercurial should work as expected.
</p>

<p>
A different approach would be to use /etc as a target rather than as
a working directory. The folks at infrastructures.org seem to believe
in this approach which uses a "Gold Server" as explained in
	<a href="http://www.infrastructures.org/bootstrap/gold.shtml">http://www.infrastructures.org/bootstrap/gold.shtml</a>
</p>

<p>
But basically, (as you suggest) keeping the working directory separate
from its VC history data --- but tied using a configuration file of
some kind would be the best. Even the cloning operation would be much
faster to set up and would have the (somewhat dubious) advantage of
working fast on file-systems which do not have hardlinks (FAT file systems!).

One of those two approaches may end up being the best compromise.
</p>

<p>
It seems that -- predictably in retrospect -- the design of "git" and
quite possibly a number of the other next-generation SCMs is narrowly
focussed on the needs of developers, judging by what Thomas is now
revealing, e.g., the git developers' reportedly not bothering to version
permissions, ownership, etc. (if I read Thomas right).
</p>

<p>
I'll freely admit to having delved only into shallow waters on this
topic, and not drunk deeply of the Pierian Spring:  I've been hoping
someone else would prototype, for example, some good way of keeping /etc
routinely version-tracked, and write up a well-debugged tutorial.  
(I hate being a pioneer:  There are all of those pesky arrows.)
</p>

<p>
Don Marti has had perhaps a somewhat more steely-eyed assessment of the
likelihood of that happening:  He'd like IDG / LinuxWorld.com to pay for
it (<a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/community/?q=node/444):">http://www.linuxworld.com/community/?q=node/444):</a>
</p>

<p>
  What the world needs now (besides an ATX power supply with a built-in
  USB ammeter) is good Git tutorials.
</p>

<p>
  Ted Ts'o points out (<a href="http://tytso.livejournal.com/29467.html">http://tytso.livejournal.com/29467.html</a>)
  that git is powerful but needs help in the documentation department.
</p>

<p>
  Donnie Berkholz points
  (<a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/community/?q=node/275#comment-3542">http://www.linuxworld.com/community/?q=node/275#comment-3542</a>) to X.org's 
  UsingGit (<a href="http://freedesktop.org/wiki/UsingGit">http://freedesktop.org/wiki/UsingGit</a>), but we need more
  tutorials, especially "git for webmasters" and "git for system
  administrators." Git gives you so many options starting off that
  a good set of "cookbook" pages for different types of projects
  would be really helpful.
</p>

<p>
  LinuxWorld.com would run (and pay for) a good git tutorial, and the
  author contract allows an author to contribute the tutorial to the

<p>
Thinking about this some more, another approach is to use some sort
of patch manager like "quilt" or "mercurial queues" --- the patches
can be maintained "outside the working area".
</p>

<p>
This avoids the permissions issue that Thomas mentioned. However, I
am not sure whether these mechanisms can handle (addition/removal of)
symlinks and file movement.
</p>

<p>
One problem with patching is that there are wheels within wheels
within wheels. One needs some sort of "consolidation step" which is
triggered by a threshold like size of patch or age of patch. (Mercurial
is supposed to have this feature.)
</p>

<p>
Using "/etc" as a target can also resolve the permissions issue
but there are other complications ...

Basically, the idea is to run a script at the end which fixes
permissions. The config file that dictates the permissions (and
possibly empty directories) can be one of the files in your
configuration which will be updated. The hook-script is part of the
VC infrastructure and resides in $GIT_DIR.

I have been following this thread, and thought to share an interesting
approach with you.
</p>

<p>
Back in the days of the PDP-11, RSX-11M OS used to version each file as
it changed.  Only once you did a 'purge' command, would the earlier
versions be removed.  That was hugely useful.  The latest file would be
named 'filename', and all other versions of the same file would be
'filename;1', 'filename;2', etc.
</p>

<p>
A version control system such as rcs is cool enough, I suppose, and
common to most platforms as well. It does take a bit of knowledge of
ci/co etc. to drive, and has the disadvantage that you only see the
currently checked-out file at any given stage.
</p>

<p>
In the early days of playing Linux, I wrote a script that traversed a
directory using 'find', and created hard links to each file in a target
directory and subdirectories.  The hard links and duplicate directory
structure were saved in a separate base directory on the same volume.
Yup, you guessed it- I used file name extensions ;1, ;2 etc. for their
unique versions.
</p>

<p>
So long as your editor created a new file rather than just rewriting the
same inode, a regular cron of the script ended up in keeping my
versioned files for me.  I never lost a thing after that, and could
always go back to see change history.
</p>

<p>
As the file was always linked in the backup directory, you could delete
the original and restore it again effortlessly.  The use of hard links
meant that hardly any additional disk space was used unless you actually
edited a file, resulting in a new inode and hence a new version (when
cron got around to it).

The VAX/VMS system that I once used had a similar feature which

Actually, you <strong>can</strong> see older versions at the same time with systems
which have lightweight cloning like "mercurial" and "git". It is just
a little more complex ( ;-) ) than something like
	
	vimdiff 'a' 'a;1'
</p>

<p>
So versioned file-systems <strong>are</strong> interesting but somehow I don't see
many implementations.

Wonder why?!

Yeah, I remember purge /keep=5 and all that.

Emacs will do numbered versions for you. My .emacs has

<p>
(setq version-control 't)		; make numbered backups
(setq vc-make-backup-files 't)		; keep backups for files in version control
(setq delete-old-versions 't)		; delete excess backups without asking
(setq kept-old-versions 2)		; keep the 2 oldest backups
(setq kept-new-versions 3)		; keep the 3 newest backups

This method has already been suggested at by Rick, but I'll try to go a
step or two deeper.
</p>

<p>
I would only use version control systems for specific directories in
/etc, instead of tracking the entire tree. Example, track for apache2/,
[mail server here]/, etc.
</p>

<p>
This has the advantage of being much easier to branch. You could either
have separate trees for each program config directory (apache2/, etc.)
or a broader root directory for all of /etc and then config directories
bellow that. I suppose it would depend on how you like to configure your
version control systems, repository user permissions (give developers
and operations access to the apache2 config, but only operations get to
touch the bind config), etc.
</p>

<p>
So maybe your svn (so shoot me, I like the method in their madness) tree
would look like...
</p>

<pre>
/				top /etc
/config_dir			a specific config directory
/config_dir/trunk	        working copy
/config_dir/branch		configs known to be stable
/config_dir/branch/arch		oh sexy, we just broke down by arch type
</pre>

<p>
Also, tracking all of /etc's contents doesn't make sense to me. If you
were to pull from the repository to a different distro or the same
distro running different versions of the same software, then you are
going to be in a bad way. Also, if you are like me, then you love
installing new programs on your home-not-for-production-or-work machine,
which would create MANY insertion and deletion calls to your revision
tree(s).
</p>

<p>
Yes, I am starting to get complicated. Yes, this may be more than a home
user needs for their desktop machine. I say all of this because at the
end of the day I don't see a point to keeping a revision tree for a
simple, stay at home machine. Revision control systems are inherently
robust [and complicated], and are therefore more than you probably need
for even a home mail/web server. I would stick to running a script via
cron to save diffs for you. Then, if you make multiple copies before
cron runs again and want to save your new copy, you can still run the
script yourself. Much simpler.

&gt; I was looking at version control mechanisms to handle /etc
&gt; on the machines here. If people on TAG have used such systems I would
&gt; appreciate feedback.
&gt;
&gt; CVS: seems to be the classic solution. Cons: People say it is old and
&gt; unmaintained code which is "end-of-life".
&gt;
&gt; Mercurial: One of the modern VC systems considered "notable" on
&gt; Rick Moen's knowledge base. One difficulty with "hg" is that it
&gt; insists on the "distributed" model. Putting the version control
&gt; history outside /etc (a la CVS) would require convoluted mounts.
&gt;
&gt; GIT: Another modern VC system (though not "notable" as per Rick's
&gt; kb). It is rather similar to Mercurial in many ways. One difference
&gt; is that one can use the environment variable GIT_DIR to point to a
&gt; different directory for storing VC history.
&gt;
&gt; Some reasons to keep VC history outside /etc:
&gt; 	1. This way one can easily check for "cruft" without
&gt; 	   adding an explicit "ignore" for ".hg" or ".git" ...
&gt; 	2. Uses less space in "/etc".
&gt; 	3. Can keep the history on an "archival" disk safe from
&gt; 	   potential corruption.
&gt;
&gt; Any thoughts/suggestions by people on TAG are welcome as usual!

Mildly related but not quite...
</p>

<p>
We use puppet to manage the configurations on all machines in our park
(&gt;1000 nodes) and version-control our filestore and manifests.
</p>

<p>
Manifests are puppet-recipes for configuration, filestore is the
associated configfile/template storage.
The puppet client on the host can be configured to hold a versioned
backup-copy of changed configfiles if it pleases you to do so, we have
found that it is easier to roll-back our change on the puppet-master
server which holds all config-parts for one or more servers in a
servergroup.
</p>

<p>
Totally unsuitable for single desktop use.
</p>

<p>
Very effective for large-ish computerparks.
As far as I can gather from the puppet irc channel and mailing lists the
tool is used by desktop and server administrators alike.
</p>

<p>
I've seen happy deployment reports from people starting from 15 hosts
and upwards.
</p>

<p>
Puppet is a new-comer on the block and definitly has rough edges and
very fast development turnover but it has been (and still is) invaluable
in growing our serverpark from 400+ hosts to the staggering 1000+ hosts
we manage today.

Hello,

<p>
I agree overall with the remarks made by Samuel but I have one bone
to pick:

Let us assume that a person who uses 1-5 machines also wants to keep
track of daily work in a systematic way. Using version control is a
good way to do this. I can imagine "formal" letters which are
represented by different branches for different people as an example.
(Using a LaTeX style file is probably a better way!).
</p>

<p>
So a "systematic" user of a small number of machines is likely to
learn version control. In which case it may be easier to use version
control wherever different versions of data need to be tracked.[*]
</p>

<p>
There is of course a risk that everything will start looking like a
nail --- with VC as the hammer!
