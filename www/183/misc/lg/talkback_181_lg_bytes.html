Speaking of missed news, Google Code In has started
(<a href='http://code.google.com/opensource/gci/2010-11/index.html'>http://code.google.com/opensource/gci/2010-11/index.html</a>). It's a
competition for high school students to work with open source. If you
know any tech-savvy 13-18-year-olds, encourage them to participate!

For whatever reason, Howard - who usually submits the NB material, which
is then formatted by Deividson - omitted the Distro section this month,
which Deividson did his best to fill in. It's not his usual "beat", but
he made a pretty fair job of it anyway... although bits like the above
release fell through the cracks. Personally, I'm very grateful for his
stepping up to the plate.
</p>

<p>
The fact is that we have a very small (read "one correspondent and one
editor") news team, so things like this are apt to happen. A larger team
(read "more volunteers") would produce more complete coverage... but
although many people enjoy reading LG, few seem to want to come forward
and help keep it going.
</p>

<p>
For whatever reason - whether it's because I don't have the marketing
savvy (or whatever the missing factor) to attract and keep a large
number of eager volunteers, or because the format of LG is outdated, or
something else - we're not getting the brainshare that's necessary to
make LG grow, or to make it the top-quality publication that it could
be. I often wonder if it's worth the continued effort - because the
Linux community seems to be telling me that it isn't. I hope I'm
mistaken about that.
</p>

<p>
No matter what the case, though - all of you who contribute, authors,
editors, proofreaders, authors, and others who put their time and effort
into producing LG have my personal gratitude and appreciation. Thank you
all.

Personally, I read LG for the articles, reviews, tips, mailbag.There are a lot of places on the interweb that 
provide news in twitter-sized chunks, but very few have any indepth analysis of trends, or
reviews that are not tainted with fanboyism(not a proper word, I know)of any kind (who said Phoronix?).
Apart from LG, only other tech news source I read fairly regularly is LWN.   
So, imho, there is a place for The Linux Gazette, and I do not think that the format is outdated, think of it 
as a magazine, in contrast to 'daily newspaper or a ticker thingie on cable news channels' format that most
other sites use.
Ephemeral news for people with nanosecond attention spans.
LG is, and it should be, better than that.

Thanks, Pedja. That's how I think of it, and that's where I try to focus
it. I just wish there were more people thinking that way, and jumping in
with help and ideas.

<p>
In some ways, I miss the earlier days of Linux. That's not to say that I
resent how easy and user-friendly Linux is now; this is more like
McLuhan's dictum of "something is always lost as well as gained". We've
gained a huge number of users; we've lost some of the spirit of fun and
exploration that characterized the community in the earlier days. To me,
LG represents that spirit and that philosophy.
