Hi all
</p>

<p>
Would like to introduce myself and this site, that I hope will become
popular place for Linux Gazette translations on Serbia language.
</p>

<p>
Most of my work evolves around Solaris Administration, but sometimes I
also need to do Linux work and Gazette is great source of helpful tips.
</p>

<p>
Despite my extremely busy professional (and personal) schedule, I'll try
to find time for translation, but I also encourage people from former
Yugoslavia to contact me and submit their translations. They all know that
there is no much difference between languages like Serbian, Croatian,
Bosnian, etc, so I am willing to publish all translation (both in Cyrillic
or Latin alphabet) .
</p>

<p>
Cheers
Zarko

Great to hear from you, and I wish you every success in your
endeavour. Translation can be quite a challenge, but there are several
tools to help make the task a little easier (any2po, Translate
Toolkit, OmegaT). If you can, it might be best to set up Pootle on a
server somewhere, so you don't have to rely on individuals to
translate whole articles unassisted - it can also ease the task of
editing the translations somewhat.
