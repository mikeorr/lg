I'm an undergraduate ex-student of Computer Sciences. I left the university
for economic reasons and now I'm technical consultant and writer. I have been

the university, except for a tetris clone.


<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Eric Kasten</H4>
I'm a software developer by day and an artist, web developer,
big dog, gardener and wine maker by night.  This all leaves very little
time for sleep, but always enough time for a nice glass of Michigan
Pinot Gris.  I have a BS double major in Computer Science and
Mathematics and an MS in Computer Science.  I've been using and
modifying Linux since the 0.9x days.  I can be reached via email at
<A HREF="mailto:kasten@sunpuppy.com">kasten@sunpuppy.com</A> or through 
my website at <A HREF="http://www.sunpuppy.com">http://www.sunpuppy.com</A>.


<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Sean Lamb</H4>
I'm currently working on completing my BS degree in Computer Science at Lakeland
College (begun earlier at the University of California, Riverside). I've been
involved in computer support for the past 6 years, via phone, fax, and email,
and I have created documentation for use by end users (some articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base) and other support staff (published in-house as either
individual documents or on the support intranet), and I contributed some
chapters to "Special Edition Using KDE" from Que publishing (now in print). I
have done some application development on MS-DOS platforms and have begun
developing a pair of applications for my Linux box. I am currently employed as
a software developer working in C++ with Informix on a mix of Linux and AIX
servers. When I'm not playing with or writing about Linux, I can usually be
found working on my model railroad.

<!-- *** BEGIN Not Linux *** --->

<P> There's been a flurry of activity behind the scenes this month.
The Answer Gang is finally on track and has taken over all tech-support
questions to the <I>Gazette</I>.  We're also experimenting with ways to 
improve the TAG index and <I>LG</I> FAQ to make it easier to find previous
answers to (and articles about) frequently-asked questions.

<P> This issue also marks the debut of the new cartoon series  
Tuxedo Tails.  

<P> News Bytes was not available by the publishing deadline and will return
next month.

<P> Happy Linuxing!
