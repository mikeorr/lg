<CENTER><H2><I>Severe Conditions</I></H2></CENTER>
Most severe conditions result in the administrator being paged.  These include loss of
network connectivity, loss of HTTP access, and disk conditions over 95% full, since these
can result in a system hang.  Furthermore, any "NOTICE" messages in
the message file causes a page since this may signal a disk fault.
<P>
Under these circumstances, the screen should turn red.  Click on the corresponding red dot
for additional information about the condition.
<P>
If a severe situation is occurring that is not being noticed by Big Brother, use the PAGE
button on the main screen to page the administrator manually.<BR><BR>

<HR>
<CENTER><H2><I>Warning Conditions</I></H2></CENTER>
These include HTTP server errors, disks 90-94% full, the death of important
processes, and "WARNING" messages in the system logs.
<P>
The screen should turn yellow if this is the most severe situation at the time.
Click on the corresponding yellow dot for additional information, and page
the administrator manually if necessary.<BR><BR>
<HR>
<CENTER><H2><I>No Report Warnings</I></H2></CENTER>
Each report is checked for freshness.  If a any report is more than 30 minutes old, it is marked 
with a blue dot, and the screen turns blue, assuming that it is the most serious situation
at the time.  <P>
<P>
These may be the result of heavily loaded systems, but may also indicate a more 
serious loss of communication within the Big Brother system itself.<BR><BR>
<HR>
<CENTER><H2><I>System Information</I></H2></CENTER>
Click on any server name for additional details about the machine.  Information
about all components are available, including serial numbers, partition sizes,
SCSI addresses, and the physical locations of the devices.  This
information
lives in the notes directory.
<P>
<HR>
<CENTER><H2><I>General Information</I></H2></CENTER>
The current status of any individual component is always available by clicking the appropriate
dot in the display matrix.  You may have to hit <B><I>Reload</I></B> to get the most recent entry.
<P>
Occasionally the screen changes color for CPU or HTTP warnings.  These can usually be disregarded
since Big Brother has been instructed to be <B>very</B> sensitive during this initial test.  Similarly, internet connections may turn yellow when the network
is heavily loaded.  Although it should be checked out, this is usually not a
problem unless the whole Internet section goes yellow.
