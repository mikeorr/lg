<h1>How to Give Linux Away</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/ruecker.html">Scott Ruecker</A></b></p>

<p>

<p>
As a community, we would like to see large computer manufacturers sell
PCs with Linux already on them. Is this the only option worth
considering?
</p>

<p>
I work as a sales representative for one of the large PC manufacturers, at
many different technology retail stores. Three years ago, I heard about
Open Source and Linux. My first exposure came in the form of the Firefox
browser. When I speak with customers, I talk about my experiences using
Linux. I ask them if their computer is running slow, and the answer is
always "Yes". They tell me how it is running really slow no matter what
they do, or how they can't seem to create any free room on their hard
drive.
</p>

<p>
People often ask me if MS-Office comes with the computer, and I say "No,
but have you ever heard of <a
href="http://OpenOffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a>?"  I tell them how it can
read and save the MS formats, and how I have been using it at college even
though MS-Office dominates on campus. I tell them what it can do and that
it doesn't cost a dime. That usually gets their attention.
</p>

<p>
I also will often hear the customer say, "As soon as I get home I am going
to throw the old computer away". What I say at that point - and what I think we
should all be saying - is "You know that old computer that can't run
Windows the way you need it to anymore? Give it to me, and I'll fix
it up and give it to someone or some family that does not have a
computer."
</p>

<p>
I have had several conversations with customers that have led to them
giving me their old computers when buying a new one. I fixed one up and
gave it to a friend of mine who lives on a ranch in Colorado, and because
of it he has been able to stay in contact with friends and family here in
Phoenix. What if we all did that? All of us? What if everyone who used
Linux fixed up an old computer, configured it for common uses, and gave it
to someone or some family who did not have one? Think about it.
</p>

<p>
We would not only double the number of people who use Linux, but have
a very positive effect on society. We all know that having a computer
in the home makes everyone who uses it read better. It is my belief
that that the ability to read well does as much or more for that person
as going to school. Someone who knows how to read can find what they
need to learn the skills and teach themselves anything they want. If a
child can be positively affected by having a computer, so can an
entire family.
</p>

<p>
I am not trying to proclaim some kind of "call to arms" to join me in some
crusade - not at all. I just want to share some of the things I say, and
some of the questions I ask, that have introduced Open Source Software to
new people in a positive way. As the saying goes, "You never get a second
chance to make a first impression". I hope that what I say in this article
will help you make that first impression a good one. Over the last two
years, I have gone from not knowing how to pronounce "Linux" correctly
to... well, still not knowing how to pronounce SuSE correctly.
</p>

<p>
You gotta admit, though - fixing up and giving away computers is at least good
karma (I hope).
</p>


<h3>
Part 2 - Changing Opinions
</h3>

<p>
If someone has already made up their mind not to give something new a
try, then there is no sense in wasting your time trying make them
re-think their decision. However, there are plenty of other people around -
and some of them are only held back by excuses.
</p>

<p>
Among those who give such excuses, there are those who are just
repeating what they have heard or read and really do not have any of
their own information or experience to draw from. They are easy to
pick out - once you have heard hundreds of different people say almost
the exact same thing like I have. It's not that hard; all you have to
do is ask a few questions and you can easily determine if they are just
repeating what they have heard or actually have their own reasons for
not wanting to give Linux a try.
</p>

<p>
Here is what I do:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Ask them if they use IE, WMP (Windows Media Player), Quicktime, iTunes,
Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access... and always ask them how many types of
Anti-Virus programs they are using. Make sure that you always end with the
Anti-Viruses - trust me, I'll tell you why in a moment.
</p>

<p>
You will find that roughly 99% of the people you talk to do not even
use all of those programs I listed - and very, very few use any programs
that are not on that list. Most people only use IE, Word, WMP, and maybe
Quicktime a little - and whatever Anti-Virus software they have installed.
</li>

<li>
Ask them how many types of Anti-Virus programs they use.
</li>

<p>
After you ask, most people will repeat it back to you saying, "How many
types of Anti-Virus programs do I use?" "Do you have more than one
Anti-Virus program on your computer?" Some people do not - but many do use
more than one.  This is where I tell them, 

<blockquote>"When I ran Windows, I used Ad-Aware, Zone Alarm, AVG, McAfee
(the free version), Spybot, Spywareblaster, Spyware-Doctor, Webroot, and
Registry Mechanic."</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Which is true: I had all of them on my computer at the same time and
between them I could keep my system fairly safe. Fairly.
</p>

<li>
Ask them if they have ever heard of Firefox.
</li>

<p>
Some will ask, "What is Firefox?" - "Firefox is a browser."
"What is a browser?" - "It is a program that you use to surf the Internet."
"You mean like IE?" - "Exactly, only it is a lot safer than IE." This is
where I go into the features, how it imports favorites and why it is safer
than IE. Something like:
</p>

<blockquote>
"Because it is not a part of the operating system, it is a lot harder
for spyware to damage your system when using Firefox."
</blockquote>

<p>
Again, technically true.
</p>

<li>
Ask them if they have ever heard of <a href="http://OpenOffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a>. 
</li>

<p>
Then say to them,

<blockquote>
"OpenOffice allows you to view, modify, save, and send the changed
document in MS format and it does not cost $500... actually, it does not
cost a dime."
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
I will tell you that a lot of people are <em>not</em> happy when they buy a new
computer and then are told by the store employee that it does not come
with Word or Office - and that if they want it, it will cost hundreds of
dollars. If you can get people to listen to you about OpenOffice's
compatibility features and price, of lack thereof, many will not leave
until they get the web address from you.
</p>

</ol>

<p>
If I can get most of the way through these steps, then I know I can
re-visit the Linux question and stand a chance of success. I can show
them that it just might be something that could work for them. When I
explain the Root and User separation built into Linux - how it makes
the computer safer and that they will not need multiple Anti-Virus programs
or have to re-format their hard drive every six months because Windows
does not actually delete anything - they start to actually look at the
retail Linux box I have already handed them.
</p>

<p>
Is this system perfect? No. You may talk about one thing before
another or skip over something or do it in reverse - every conversation
is unique. I want to inform them of choices they may not have known of,
open them up to new ways of doing something and not make them feel
like they were wrong or stupid. If I do it right, they do not even
feel their own shift in opinion or preference.
</p>

<p>
I could expand on this some more, and I will, but I thought that giving you
the basics of what I do might help others in getting past the <a
href="http://okopnik.freeshell.org/acronyms.cgi?string=FUD">FUD</a> without
alienating the person you are talking to. Changing someone's opinion or
stance without making them feel stupid takes practice - and I get a lot of
practice.
