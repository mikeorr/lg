<EM><B>The ptrace system call is crucial to the working of debugger programs like gdb - yet its behaviour is not very well documented - unless you believe that the best documentation is  kernel source itself! I shall attempt to demonstrate how ptrace can be used to implement some of the functionality available in tools like gdb.</B></EM>

<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<P><B>ptrace()</B> is a system call that enables one process to control the execution
of another. It also enables a process to change the core image of 
another process. The traced process behaves normally until a signal is caught. 
When that occurs the process enters stopped state and informs the 
tracing process by a <B>wait()</B> call.  Then tracing process decides how the 
traced process should respond. The only exception is SIGKILL which surely kills 
the process.
<P>The traced process may also enter the stopped state in response to some 
specific events during its course of execution. This happens only if the 
tracing process has set any event flags in the context of the traced process.
The tracing process can even <B>kill</B> the traced one by setting the exit code 
of the traced process. After tracing, the tracer process may kill the traced 
one or leave to continue with its execution.
<P>
<P><B>Note:</B> Ptrace() is highly dependent on the architecture of the 
underlying hardware. Applications using ptrace are not easily portable across 
different architectures and implementations.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="s2">2. More Details </A></H2>

<P>The prototype of ptrace() is as follows.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
        #include &lt;sys/ptrace.h&gt;
        long  int ptrace(enum __ptrace_request request, pid_t pid,
                void * addr, void * data)
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Of the four arguments, the value of <B>request</B> decides what to be 
done. <B>Pid</B> is the ID of the process to be traced. <B>Addr</B> is the 
offset in the user space of the traced process to where the <B>data</B> is 
written when instructed to do so. It is the offset in user space of the traced 
process from where a word is read and returned as the result of the call.
<P>
<P>The parent can fork a child process and trace it by calling ptrace with 
<B>request</B> as PTRACE_TRACEME. Parent can also trace an existing process using 
PTRACE_ATTACH. The different values of <B>request</B> are discussed below.
<P>
<H2>2.1 How does ptrace() work.</H2>

<P>Whenever ptrace is called, what it first does is to lock the kernel. Just 
before returning it unlocks the kernel. Let's see its working in between 
this for different values of <B>request</B>.
<P>
<H3><B>PTRACE_TRACEME</B>:</H3>

<P>This is called when the child is to be traced by the 
parent. As said above, any signals (except SIGKILL), either delivered from 
outside or from the <B>exec</B> calls made by the process, causes it to stop and 
lets the parent decide how to proceed. Inside ptrace(), the only thing that is checked is 
whether the ptrace flag of the current process is set. If not, permission 
is granted and the flag is set. All the parameters other than <B>request</B> are 
ignored.
<P>
<H3><B>PTRACE_ATTACH</B>:</H3>

<P>Here a process wants to control another. One thing to 
remember is that nobody is allowed to trace/control the <B>init</B> process. 
A process is not allowed to control itself. The current process (caller) becomes 
the parent of the process with process ID <B>pid</B>. But a <B>getpid()</B> by the 
child (the one being traced) returns the process ID of the real parent.
<P>
<P>What goes behind the scenes is that when a call is made, the usual permission 
checks are made along with whether the process is init or current or it is 
already traced. If there is no problem, permission is given and the flag 
is set. Now the links of the child process are rearranged; e.g., the child is 
removed from the task queue and its parent process field is changed (the 
original parent remains the same). It is put to the queue again in such a 
position that <B>init</B> comes next to it. Finally a SIGSTOP signal is delivered 
to it. Here <B>addr</B> and <B>data</B> are ignored.
<P>
<H3><B>PTRACE_DETACH</B>:</H3>

<P>Stop tracing a process. The tracer may decide whether the child should continue 
to live. This undoes all the effects made by PTRACE_ATTACH/PTRACE_TRACEME. The 
parent sends the exit code for the child in <B>data</B>. Ptrace flag of the child 
is reset. Then the child is moved to its original position in the task queue. 
The pid of real parent is written to the parent field. The single-step bit 
which might have been set is reset. Finally the child is woken up as nothing 
had happened to it; <B>addr</B> is ignored.
<P>
<P>
<H3><B>PTRACE_PEEKTEXT, PTRACE_PEEKDATA, PTRACE_PEEKUSER</B>:</H3>

<P>These options read data from child's memory and user space. PTRACE_PEEKTEXT
and PTRACE_PEEKDATA read data from memory and both these options have the same
effect. PTRACE_PEEKUSER reads from the user space of child. A word is read and 
placed into a temporary data structure, and with the help of put_user()
(which copies a string from the kernel's memory segment to  the
process' memory segment) the required data is written to <B>data</B> and returns 
0 on success.
<P>
<P>In the case of PTRACE_PEEKTEXT/PTRACE_PEEKDATA, <B>addr</B> is the address of 
the location to be read from child's memory. In PTRACE_PEEKUSER <B>addr</B> is 
the offset of the word in child's user space; <B>data</B> is ignored.
<P>
<H3><B>PTRACE_POKETEXT, PTRACE_POKEDATA, PTRACE_POKEUSER</B>:</H3>

<P>These options are analogous to the three explained above. The difference is 
that these are used to write the <B>data</B> to the memory/user space of the 
process being traced. In PTRACE_POKETEXT and PTRACE_POKEDATA a word from 
location <B>data</B> is copied to the child's memory location <B>addr</B>. 
<P>
<P>In PTRACE_POKEUSER we are trying to modify some locations in the 
<CODE>task_struct</CODE> of the process. As the integrity of the kernel has to be 
maintained, we need to be very careful. After a lot of security checks made 
by ptrace, only certain portions of the task_struct is allowed to change. Here
<B>addr</B> is the offset in child's user area.
<P>
<H3><B>PTRACE_SYSCALL, PTRACE_CONT</B>:</H3>

<P>Both these wakes up the stopped process. PTRACE_SYSCALL makes the child to 
stop after the next system call. PTRACE_CONT just allows the child to continue.
In both, the exit code of the child process is set by the ptrace() where the 
exit code is contained in <B>data</B>. All this happens only if the 
signal/exit code is a valid one. Ptrace() resets the single step bit of the 
child, sets/resets the syscall trace bit, and wakes up the process; <B>addr</B> is ignored.
<P>
<H3><B>PTRACE_SINGLESTEP</B>;</H3>

<P>Does the same as PTRACE_SYSCALL except that the child is stopped after 
every instruction. The single step bit of the child is set. As above <B>data</B> 
contains the exit code for the child; <B>addr</B> is ignored.
<P>
<H3><B>PTRACE_KILL</B>:</H3>

<P>When the child is to be terminated, PTRACE_KILL may be used. How the murder
occurs is as follows. Ptrace() checks whether the child is already dead or not.
If alive, the exit code of the child is set to <B>sigkill</B>. The single step bit
of the child is reset. Now the child is woken up and when it starts to work it 
gets killed as per the exit code.
<P>
<H2>2.2 More machine-dependent calls</H2>

<P>The values of <B>request</B> discussed above were independent on the
architecture and implementation of the system. The values discussed below are
those that allow the tracing process to get/set (i.e., to read/write) the
registers of child process. These register fetching/setting options are more
directly dependent on the architecture of the system. The set of registers
include general purpose registers, floating point registers and extended
floating point registers. These more machine-dependent options are discussed
below.  When these options are given, a direct interaction between the
registers/segments of the system is required.  

<P> <H3><B>PTRACE_GETREGS,
PTRACE_GETFPREGS, PTRACE_GETFPXREGS</B>:</H3>

<P>These values give the value of general purpose, floating point, extended
floating point registers of the child process. The registers are 
read to the location <B>data</B> in the parent. The usual checks for access on the
registers are made. Then the register values are copied to the location 
specified by <B>data</B> with the help of getreg() and __put_user() functions; 
<B>addr</B> is ignored.
<P>
<H3><B>PTRACE_SETREGS, PTRACE_SETFPREGS, PTRACE_SETFPXREGS</B>:</H3>

<P>These are values of <B>request</B> that allow the tracing process to set the 
general purpose, floating point, extended floating point registers of the child 
respectively. There are some restrictions in the case of setting the registers.
Some are not allowed to be changed. The data to be copied to the registers will 
be taken from the location <B>data</B> of the parent. Here also <B>addr</B> is 
ignored.
<P>
<H2>2.3 Return values of ptrace()</H2>

<P>A successful ptrace() returns zero. Errors make it return -1 and set 
<B>errno</B>. Since the return value of a successful PEEKDATA/PEEKTEXT may 
be -1, it is better to check the <B>errno</B>. The errors are 
<P>
<P>EPERM : The requested process couldn't be traced. Permission denied.
<P>
<P>ESRCH : The requested process doesn't exist or is being traced.
<P>
<P>EIO   : The request was invalid or read/write was made from/to invalid area
of memory. 
<P>
<P>EFAULT: Read/write was made from/to memory which was not really mapped. 
<P>
<P>It is really hard to distinguish between the reasons of EIO and EFAULT. 
These are returned for almost identical errors.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="s3">3. A small example.</A></H2>

<P> 
If you found the parameter description to be a bit dry, don't
despair. I shall not attempt anything of that sort again. I will
try to write simple programs which illustrate many of the
points discussed above.
<P>
<P>Here is the first one. The parent process counts
the number of instructions  executed by the test program run by the child.
<P>Here the test program is listing the entries of the current directory.

<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Conclusion</A></H2>

<P>
<P>Ptrace() is heavily used for debugging. It is also used for system call
tracing. The debugger forks and the
child process created is traced by the parent. The program which is to
be debugged is exec'd by the child (in the above program it was
"ls") and after each instruction the parent can examine the register
values of the program being run. I shall demonstrate programs which
exploit ptrace's versatility in the next part of this series. Good
bye till then.
