Detention for the student and legal threats from a clueless teacher.

<p>
Just read it. Yep, that part is less than funny - and it shows how
polarized that aspect of the world has become. The thing is, the
not-funny part isn't about Linux: it's about the social interaction that
can result from clueless action by someone in power. That teacher made a
mistake - that happens, and is understandable. What is not so easy to
justify is her stupidly-emotional reaction, complete with legal threats
and accusations. If it happened with something else - let's say a
Chinese knockoff of a Belgian-made teddy bear - and she emailed the
parents to accuse them and threaten them... and one of the parents
happened to be a lawyer... she would now understand *exactly what "being
thrown to the wolves" means. Having a pseudonymous nickname mentioned on
Slashdot does not equate to that in the least.
</p>

<p>
Ken, by contrast, acted in a mature and reasonable manner *where it
mattered*. He blew off steam on his blog - but managed to do it in such
a way that the backlash, no matter how serious, did not affect that
teacher. And, to cover whatever doubt remained in his own mind, he
apologized - explicitly and clearly.
</p>

<p>
Whatever the shitstorm in a cup, it'll be over tomorrow. That would not
be the case if Ken's reaction (and followup) were not those of man with
discretion and judgement; nor would it be the case in the
hypothetical[1] situation I described above. "Karen" has expressed her
gratitude to Ken; I'll add my own regards [2] here.
</p>



<p>
[1] ...or not so hypothetical. I know of a case in a Colorado school
where a teacher was haunted out of her job and her profession and sued
into abject poverty by a lawyer-parent who decided that his little
Johnny's self-esteem was being damaged by the poor grades he was
(deservedly) receiving. Legal harassment is not a myth, folks; it
happens, and not just once in a while.
</p>

<p>
[2] Most people can be brave after sober consideration, a period of
preparation in the dressing room, and with their adoring fans watching
breathlessly; the thing that counts for a lot with me is doing the right
thing in the very moment when you're pissed off and harried and
threatened. It's one of the biggest challenges we humans have... and few
of us succeed every time. I can only applaud when I see an instance of
it.

Just for the record, to show some of the difference, here in Paran√° -
Brazil, all of the public schools (more than 2.100 schools) use Linux
only, from the director's room to the students - and not only that,
the teachers room and the labs the students uses where all re-made
with a debian-based distribution, featuring a hydra-like setup to
allow 4 users per computer.
</p>

<p>
Currently, they account a 127,3 million economy on licences only - not
accounting the ammount of computers (because of the 4 users per
computer) and the lower energy bill - it's a win-win situation.

<p>
It's possible that Ken Starks has grown up a bit, since the days a few
years ago when he started blogging (at the time, omitting his name and
using solely the moniker "Helios").  At the time of his very noisy
appearance on the Internet, he seemed to do little beside trolling, and,
for a blog supposedly concerned with Linux, seemed to spend the vast
majority of its time slagging Microsoft Corporation.
</p>

<p>
On reflection, I'm not sure Mr. Starks has grown up discernibly.  And I
would inclined, if the man told me the sun was going to rise up in the
east, to get up early and check.  Or better yet, just not waste time on
him at al.

I have no knowledge of Ken Starks other than what I've seen in this one
situation - and that's all I have to judge by, of course. For all I
know, he may well be Adolph Hitler in disguise at all other times [1],
but in this situation, he did the right thing.

<p>
I wouldn't even necessarily rely on the recounting of facts:  Some
later, less-heated analyses suggest that the teacher had merely reacted
to the kid disrupting the class by "confiscating" the kid's Linux media
only until the end of the school day, which is pretty much standard
practice in US public schools anywhere.
</p>

<p>
The (alleged) e-mail with the goofy litigation threat, that were claimed
to have been from the (consistently unnamed) teacher were of course
pathetic no-nothingism, but it's positively amazing how Starks has
seemed to find and grapple onto exactly such people in incident after
incident, over the years, always as if they were his tailor-made
opponents for each particular moment.
</p>

<p>
I'd already classified "helios" (Starks) as a liability at the time of
his loud advocacy of the Lobby4Linux debacle, a year and a half ago:

<p>
Reviewing some more of the follow-ons from the original squabble, 
there <em>is</em> some hope that Starks is indeed growing up a bit:  He posted
a belated clarification[1] that:
</p>

<pre>
o The teacher did not, as he'd claimed, confiscate the student's Linux disks,
  just hold them until the end of the class because he had been 
  (as I figured) disputive of the class with them.[2]
o The teacher did not, as some had claimed, put the student on "detention".
o She had not threatened Starks or anyone else with litigation, but 
  merely expressed a suspicion that he might be advocating illegal 
  activity.
</pre>

<p>
About the only thing Starks did that was right was not splashing the
teacher's name and e-mail address all over Slashdot.  Assuming there
ever was such a teacher.
</p>

<p>
And there lies one big problem:  We're asked to make the charitable
assumption that the entire little morality play wasn't invented out of
whole cloth, for publicity / melodrama purposes, by a notorious
self-promoter, which is also more than possible.  Frankly, the style of
writing in the alleged teacher's e-mail seems fake, and the entire
incident seems much too pat.  
</p>

</p>

<p>
[2] Quoting Starks's clarification:  "The lad was being disruptive, but
that wasn't mentioned. Neither was the obvious fact that when she saw a
gaggle of giggling 8th grade boys gathered around a laptop, the last
thing she expected to see on that screen was a spinning cube.
She didn't know what was on those disks he was handing out. It could
have been porn, viral .exe's...any number of things for all she knew.
When she heard that an adult had given him some of the disks to hand
out, her spidey-senses started tingling. Coupled with the fact that she
truly was ignorant of honest-to-goodness Free Software, and you have
some fairly impressive conclusion-jumping."

Ever since I read about Brazil's Open Source initiative, years ago, I've
been impressed by their approach. It's great to hear how well it
continues to work.
