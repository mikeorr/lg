"Foolish" is becoming an inappropriate title, since more and more of the submissions are
"interesting" rather than "foolish".  But we'll stick with the title.  The submissions
continue to pour in.



<H2>A baffling screen</H2>

By <A HREF="mailto:Courtney_Grimland@commdec.com">Courtney Grimland</A> 

<P> I remember the very first time I installed Linux on a PC (or any computer,
for that matter).  It was a Red Hat installation (6.2 I believe), and
everything went smoothly.  Keep in mind this was my very first exposure to
anything ![DOS|Win9x].

<P> When time came to boot it up, I anxiously typed in my root password.  Next
thing I know, I'm frantically digging through all of the documentation and
paperwork that came in the box, looking for my bash number.  Sure am glad I
didn't call up Red Hat and ask for help with the registration process (which
is what I thought this was).

<P>You see, after I logged in with root password, all I see is:
<PRE>
bash#
</PRE>

It kind of threw me.  I didn't recognize it at the time to be a friendly
command prompt waiting for input (like <CODE>c:\</CODE>) that I was used to seeing
all of my life).

<P> I guess it wasn't really a foolish thing, but it shows how far I've come in
the last year and a half.  I'm currently working on a device driver and
file-management software for my nifty little miniature MP3 player my
girlfriend bought in Hong Kong.


<H2>A story from Russia</H2>

By <A HREF="mailto:s_mage@land.ru">BaRoN!</A> 

<P>
Hello gazette,<BR>
  I read a Russian translation of your funny stories, and here is a
story about a friend of mine.<BR>
  It was about 5 or 6 years ago... He had a 100Mb hard disk. And after
  a half-year of working fine, it stopped being detected by BIOS. In the mid-1990s, tech
support was VERY BAD in Russia, and it was EVEN WORSE in the country. We
live in a small town (about 300.000 people) and in the mid-1990s, just
about 100 of families had got PC's. So, the seller said that the HDD
was damaged my friend and will not be replaced.<P>
  A new 100Mb HDD was unaffordable to my friend, so we started to do
  different things with it.<P>
  Alex, my friend, took his HDD to show to one guy, and after he
  brought it back to home, IT WAS DETECTED BY THE BIOS!<P>
  We tried to partition it and then to format it, and IT PASSED OK!
  But this paradise lasted for only one day.<P>
  When it didn't work again, Alex tried a different strategy.  He walked for 20
  minutes with his HDD -- and was detected again! (It was winter, about
  -25 degrees (Celsius)).<P>
  I suggested he put his HDD into polyethalyne packet and put it in the freezer
  portion of his refrigerator for fifteen minutes.  That too :).<P>
  So every morning before my friend went to school, he grabbed his hard drive and 
  put it in the freezer. :). It lasted for about 5 months,
until he could afford to buy new HDD.



<H2>Conclusion</H2>

Another interesting point is how many of the stories we've received can be
summarized as, "If anything goes wrong, try freezing, refrigeration or ice
cubes."
