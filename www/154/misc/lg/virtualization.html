Hello everyone.
</p>

<p>
I'm starting a paper here on Virtualization for my post-graduation,
and I'm wondering if any of you use virtualization professionally, for
what, what software you use to do it and with what host/guest OS's

<p>
   
I run VMWare fusion on my mac and run Red Hat 4 &amp; 5, Windows XP, Cent OS 
5, Solaris 10 x86, and I'm going to try Vista when I get my ram for my 
computer. At work we run VMWare ESX we run RedHat 5, Windows XP, Windows 
Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008. They all run very good. I have also 
used the free version of vmware for other people servers before.
</p>

<p>
I hope this is what you are looking for.

What do that "at work" do? You run all those  OSs in the same machine?
Whats the machine hardware they run on?

Hi...
</p>

<p>
Mostly I use Qemu with or without kqemu module for experimenting with
Linux kernels. It serves me well when researching before writing about
Linux.
</p>

<p>
Lately, I also use KVM (actually it's extended version of Qemu) and
UML. KVM works well when I need accelerated virtualization since it
utilizes Intel VT or AMD SVM technology. While UML is a good choice
when you just want light weight OS virtualization. Me, like the rest
of kernel learner, find it a perfect choice for exploring certain
areas of kernel because gdb can be easily attached to UML.
</p>

<p>
VirtualBox also grab my attention. It has nice GUI and mature
virtualization. In some of my projects, VirtualBox is a life saver
when I want to experiment with several different configurations.
Thanks to its snapshot feature, when things go wrong I simply "step
back" to previous snapshot state and start fresh.
</p>

<p>
regards,
</p>

<p>
Mulyadi.

Hi Deiv,
</p>

<p>
Are you perchance related to those other Okopniks running around loose
in here? <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">

&gt; I'm starting a paper here on Virtualization for my post-graduation,

</pre>

<p>
I use virtualization quite a bit:
</p>

<p>
For a now-defunct client, I ran their development, QA, and production
servers (RHEL3) under VMware Server running on RHEL4 on a Dell Poweredge
4600.  There was also an offsite replica of the system for disaster
recovery/business continuity reasons.  I would do basic file backups
twice a week to keep the two in sync and once a month I would backup the
VM files to disk, drive them to the offsite center, and copy them over.
Voila!  Perfect backups!
</p>

<p>
I run VMware Server at home on CentOS 5.x running various VMs (Suse,
openSuse, RHEL, Win XP, and yes, even DOS) for various client and
personal projects .  For clients, I've done things like set up DRBD and
heartbeat between virtual servers, use a Win XP client to login to a
client's VPN to access their Linux box, and investigate the feasibility
of using Hadoop (<a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/core/">http://hadoop.apache.org/core/</a>) using a virtual
cluster.
</p>

<p>
I also run VMware Fusion on my Macbook running Tiger (10.4.x) when I
need to travel with virtualization or interact with a Mac. (It's not
necessary to run VMs on the Mac to interact with a Mac, but it sure is
nice to run everything on my Mac when I'm laying in the hammock out
back. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">  A recent example: I'm working on a Windows NT PDC to Samba
3.x + OpenLDAP conversion for a client who is mostly a Mac shop with
some XP and two openSuse servers.  On my Macbook I've got an
openSuse+Samba+openLDAP VM and a Win XP client VM logging into the
domain and the local Macbook using the openLDAP server as a directory
(doing searches in Address Book). To test out my setup, I went to the
client's site, fired up my VMs, changed the IP addresses, and then
played with my VMs on his network, i.e. instead of modifying the
client's openSuse servers, we attempted to do the "net rpc vampire" with
the virtual openSuse on my Macbook (it didn't work, but that's a story
for another time).
</p>

<p>
I've also started playing with Amazon's EC2 for a client project which
is technically virtualization but probably isn't what you're looking for.
</p>

<p>
Virtualbox is next on my list of things to play with just because the
rootless windows look cool.
</p>

<p>
I bought Parallels for the Mac when it first came out, but I wasn't
impressed with it, especially since it didn't run Linux VMs, although I
hear it's improved greatly since then.

<p>
At work we use VMWare running various instance of SmoothWall so we can
test/fix bugs, etc.  I use QEMU a lot to run various flavours of
different LDAP servers too.
</p>

<p>
When I am not at work, I use UML (User Mode Linux) to do all manner of
things; but you might not class that as true virtualisation.

&gt;&gt; Hi Deiv,
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Are you perchance related to those other Okopniks running around loose
&gt;&gt; in here? <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
&gt;
&gt; We never found out how relative we are - but considering the okopnik
&gt; family is not that big we might be
</pre>

<p>
A couple of things:
</p>

<p>
1.  I was not the original person asking this question, Faber Fedor was.
2.  If you're going to reply to a thread off-list, regardless of the
recipient, please ensure you make it known -why-.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Last question I guess, anyone uses virtualization for a proxy/db
&gt; server? Like running linux, and a VM inside that linux that is your
&gt; proxy server?
</pre>

<p>
And yes, to answer your question (which no one on the list will
receive since you sent this directly to me), I use virtualisation for
proxying in the way you describe to test our products and the features
I write for it; that aside, many people/small companies work in this
way -- this is why VMWare player exists, for instance.
</p>

<p>
I still like and prefer UML though.
