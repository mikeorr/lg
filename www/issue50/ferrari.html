<P>On Tuesday,
January 11, 2000,  the culmination of hard work by a dedicated group
of volunteers worldwide has produced the first in a series of
certification tests for the Linux* community. The Linux Professional
Institute(LPI; <A HREF="http://www.lpi.org/">http://www.lpi.org</A>
)which was incorporated (nonprofit) in Ontario, Canada in October,
1999; has released its T1A Exam
<P>(<A HREF="http://www.lpi.org/t1alaunch.html">
http://www.lpi.org/t1alaunch.html</A> ) to the world through the
<A HREF="http://www.vue.com/linux">
Virtual University Enterprises'</A> (VUE)  
 1700 plus testing centers.  The  exam   qualifies the participant
towards certification at Level 1 (Junior-Level/ Linux system
administrator). This first exam is just one in a series which will be
available for the individual looking to add credentials to their
Linux knowledge and experience.
<P>In October 1998,
the concept of Linux certification was launched with the leadership
of Evan Leibovitch(current LPI Executive Director) and Dan
York(current Board Chairman)who were
introduced to each other by Jon &quot;maddog&quot; Hall of Linux
International. After many months of hard work and thousands of
volunteers, Evan Leibovitch proclaims, &quot;This    
is what we've been
working towards since the day we started.&quot; &quot;We've tried to
make our program challenging, vendor-neutral and accessible, and I
believe we've succeeded on all fronts&quot; according to Evan. Scott
Murray(Director of Exam Development) adds &quot;Our volunteers are a
crucial part of LPI, and the delivery of quality exams reflects the
hard work and care they have contributed to the program.&quot; &quot;We
want to provide a certification that is supported and respected by
it's community&quot; he says. And further acknowledgment comes from Dan
York; &quot;We've learned an amazing amount...and truly demonstrated
the power of a group of people working together to accomplish a
common goal!&quot; &quot;All that we can say is THANK YOU for helping
to make this dream a reality&quot; he says.
<P><BR>

<P>We would like to
thank the many people who have worked on the technical aspects of the
tests(submitting and reviewing test questions), those who have
staffed our booths at the shows around the globe, those who have
responded through our different channels of communication(web site,
e-mails, etc.), our participants in the Advisory Council, and most
importantly our financial sponsors; both individual, and
corporate(listed alphabetically) ;  Caldera Systems, IBM, Linuxcare,
SGI, SuSE, TurboLinux, and Wave Technologies. Our association with
Wave Technologies and ProsoftTraining.com have helped us greatly. We
have an extensive listing of our volunteers at
<A HREF="http://www.lpi.org/thanks99.html">http://www.lpi.org/thanks99.html</A>
.
<P><BR>

<P>Those
interested in taking the first exam(T1A) will need to register with
VUE; 
<A HREF="http://www.vue.com/linux/">http://www.vue.com/linux/</A>
and pay a fee of $100. The test will take approximately 1-2 hours. To
find the location nearest you go to

.


<P>A call for help is
still being echoed for the submission of questions for the T2series
of exams. If you can help write questions for these  tests, please
visit our <A HREF="http://www.lpi.org/cgi-bin/tips.py">&quot;TIPS
system&quot;</A>. We could also use help reviewing all of the
questions  for these advanced tests. Plus, volunteers would be
greatly appreciated to help staff upcoming events. For a schedule of
events which we will be participating in, please see
