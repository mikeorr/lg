<h1>GNU Octave - Functions and Scripts</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/odonovan.html">Barry O'Donovan</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

In this, the second article on <a href="http://www.octave.org/">GNU
Octave</a>, I will build on the basics that were covered in
<a href="/109/odonovan.html">issue #109</a> by introducing
functions and scripts through a number of examples. Obtaining and
installing GNU Octave as well as sources for official documentation
is discussed in the first article and you should refer to it for
more information.

<h3>Functions in Octave</h3>

Just like any other programming language, Octave has full support
for creating functions. Functions are an essential tool that allow
large problems to be broken down into a number of smaller tasks. A
function should perform a <strong>specific task</strong> and it
should <strong>perform it well</strong>. These criteria are very
important. The more specific the task that a function performs the
more reusable it will be; although you may be writing it to help
solve your current problem, if it is well defined then it could
also be used in many future problems. By "perform it well", I mean
that the function should give the correct answer for valid input
while reporting an error for invalid input; it should be a
veritable "black-box" - once written and tested it should be of
sufficient quality that you can trust it without having to recheck
it in all future problems.

<p>One extremely simply mathematical function that Octave lacks and
which I required recently was the factorial function. This function
is defined as:</p>

<blockquote>
    <code>n! = n(n-1)...2&middot;1</code>
</blockquote>

So, for example, <code>5! = 5&middot;4&middot;3&middot;2&middot;1 =
120</code>. There are a number of algorithms for implementing this
function and I will cover some of them to give a good introduction
to functions in Octave. Let's begin with an iteration solution:

<pre class="code">
function answer = lg_factorial1( n )

    answer = 1;
    
    for i = 2:n
        answer = answer * i;
    endfor

endfunction
</pre>
Listing 1: <a href=
"misc/odonovan/lg_factorial1.m">lg_factorial1.m</a>

<p>So, a function definition in Octave is:</p>

<pre class="code">
function name
    body
endfunction
</pre>

Functions should be saved on their own in a text file named the
same as the function itself with the extension <code>.m</code>. So
the above file would be saved as <code>lg_factorial1.m</code>. When
you now try and call the function <code>lg_factorial1()</code>,
Octave will search the list of directories specified by the
built-in variable <code>LOADPATH</code> for files ending in &lsquo;.m&rsquo;
that have the same base name as the function name. If you want to
create a repository of functions on your computer and would like to
have <code>LOADPATH</code> include that directory automatically,
you can add the line:<br>
<code>LOADPATH = "/path/to/your/files/:"</code><br>
to the Octave configuration file <code>~/.octaverc</code>. Octave
also checks the path specified in the built-in variable
<code>DEFAULT_LOADPATH</code> which includes the current working
directory by default.

<p>A function can take any number of arguments as a comma separated
list in parentheses after the function name. Multiple return values
can also be defined:</p>

<pre class="code">
function [retval1, retval2, etc] = name( arg1, arg2, etc )
    body
endfunction
</pre>

<p>There are two additional rules in the mathematical definition of
the factorial function:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>0! = 1</code></li>
    <li><code>n &gt;= 0</code></li>
</ul>

Let's incorporate these rules into our function definition:

<pre class="code">
function answer = lg_factorial2( n )

    if( n &lt; 0 )
        error( "there is no definition for negative factorials" );
    endif
    
    answer = 1;
    
    if( n == 0 )
        return;
    else
        for i = 2:n
            answer = answer * i;
        endfor
    endif

endfunction
</pre>
Listing 2: <a href=
"misc/odonovan/lg_factorial2.m">lg_factorial2.m</a>

The function first tests to ensure that the input is valid
(non-negative). If it is not it throws an error using the
<code>error()</code> built-in function. As well as printing the
error message, it also prints a traceback of of all the functions
leading to the error. This is very useful for programmers who are
solving complex problems with many functions as they can narrow
done the offending problem very quickly.

<p>If the input is valid then we test for the zero case and we use
the <code>return</code> command to end the function if it is true.
Unlike many other programming languages, Octave's
<code>return</code> statement does not take any arguments, so it is
essential that the return value(s) are set before a
<code>return</code> call is encountered as I have done with
the <code>answer = 1</code> statementabove.</p>

<p>Now, what happens if <code>lg_factorial2()</code> is called
without any arguments?</p>

<pre class="code">
octave:1&gt; lg_factorial2()
error: `n' undefined near line 3 column 9
error: evaluating binary operator `&lt;' near line 3, column 11
error: if: error evaluating conditional expression
error: evaluating if command near line 3, column 5
error: called from `lg_factorial2' in file `/home/user/lg/lg_factorial2.m'
octave:1&gt;
</pre>

<p>We can also check to ensure that a valid number of arguments
have been passed to the function using the built-in variable
<code>nargin</code>. This variable is automatically initialised to
the number of arguments passed. While we're at it, we should also
try and ensure that a valid data type is passed. Unfortunately,
Octave has no <code>isinteger()</code> function but we can check
that it is a real number and not a vector. If a real non-integer is
passed it will be automatically rounded down by the range operator
(<code>2:n</code>).</p>

<pre class="code">
function answer = lg_factorial3( n )

    if( nargin != 1 )
        usage( "factorial( n )" );
    elseif( !isscalar( n ) ||  !isreal( n ) )
        error( "n must be a positive integer value" );
    elseif( n &lt; 0 )
        error( "there is no definition for negative factorials" );
    endif
    
    if( n == 0 )
        answer = 1;
        return;
    else
        answer = prod( 1:n );
    endif

endfunction
</pre>
Listing 3: <a href=
"misc/odonovan/lg_factorial3.m">lg_factorial3.m</a>
<p>This example introduces the <code>usage()</code> built-in
function. It is very similar to <code>error()</code> in that it
prints a traceback of the functions leading up to the call to help
debugging but instead of printing "error: ...", it prints "usage:
...". The <code>isscalar()</code> and <code>isreal()</code>
functions check that the given argument is a scalar value (as
opposed to a vector, a string, etc) and a real number (as opposed
to a complex number) respectively. The <code>!</code> before them
inverts the test so that it reads as <em>if n is not a scalar or if
n is not a real number then raise an error</em>.</p>

<p>You also have noticed that I have changed the code for
calculating the factorial. I now use the built-in function
<code>prod()</code> which calculates the product of the elements in
a given vector. In this case, the given vector is the range
<code>1:n</code>.</p>

<p>In the previous article, I mentioned that Octave comes with full
documentation which is accessible through the Linux command
<code>info</code>. There is also a built-in <code>help</code>
function for every command. For example:</p>

<pre class="code">
octave:2&gt; help prod
prod is a built-in function

 -- Built-in Function:  prod (X, DIM)
     Product of elements along dimension DIM.  If DIM is omitted, it
     defaults to 1 (column-wise products).
...
octave:3&gt;
</pre>

<p>A "well written" function should allow the use of the help
function in a similar manner. The help text is taken as the first
block of non-copyright (see <a href="#copyright">below</a>)
comments from a function file:</p>

<pre class="code">
## usage: answer = lg_factorial4( n )
##
## Returns the factorial of n (n!). n should be a positive
## integer or 0.

function answer = lg_factorial4( n )

    if( nargin != 1 )
        usage( "factorial( n )" );
    elseif( !isscalar( n ) ||  !isreal( n ) )
        error( "n must be a positive integer value" );
    elseif( n &lt; 0 )
        error( "there is no definition for negative factorials" );
    endif
    
    if( n == 0 )
        answer = 1;
        return;
    else
        answer = prod( 1:n );
    endif

endfunction
</pre>
Listing 4: <a href=
"misc/odonovan/lg_factorial4.m">lg_factorial4.m</a>
<p>And calling the <code>help</code> function will now yield:</p>

<pre class="code">
octave:3&gt; help lg_factorial4
lg_factorial4 is the user-defined function from the file
/home/user/lg/lg_factorial4.m

usage: answer = lg_factorial4( n )

Returns the factorial of n (n!). n should be a positive
integer or 0.

...
octave:4&gt;
</pre>

<p>Another common algorithm for calculating the factorial of a
number is to use a recursive function (a recursive function is one
that calls itself). This can be implemented in Octave (ignoring the
error checking for now) as:</p>

<pre class="code">
function answer = lg_factorial5( n )

    if( n == 0 )
        answer = 1;
        return;
    else
        answer = n * lg_factorial5( n -1 );
    endif

endfunction
</pre>
Listing 5: <a href=
"misc/odonovan/lg_factorial5.m">lg_factorial5.m</a>
<h3>Testing Function Efficiency</h3>

<p>Academic use of Octave often tends to be in the form of large
and time-consuming simulations. As such it is important to know how
to both write quick and efficient code as well as testing the
efficiency of code that you do write.</p>

<p>Let's begin by comparing the three algorithms above for
calculating the factorial of a number. Octave has two functions for
starting and stopping a "wall-clock timer":</p>

<pre class="code">
octave:4&gt; tic(); sleep( 10 ); toc()
ans = 10.0
octave:5&gt;
</pre>

<p>To make the comparison fair, the only checking we will perform
is if <code>n == 0</code>, otherwise we will assume it is a
positive integer. We will use the program in listing 5 above, the
iterative version shown in <a href=
"misc/odonovan/lg_factorial6.m">lg_factorial6.m</a> and the
<code>prod()</code> version shown in <a href=
"misc/odonovan/lg_factorial7.m">lg_factorial7.m</a>. The commands
executed for the comparison and the times found can be seen
here:</p>

<pre class="code">
octave:5&gt; tic(); for i=1:100 for n=1:100 lg_factorial5( n ); end; end; toc()
ans = 23.5154919996858
octave:6&gt; tic(); for i=1:100 for n=1:100 lg_factorial6( n ); end; end; toc()
ans = 3.06905199959874
octave:7&gt; tic(); for i=1:100 for n=1:100 lg_factorial7( n ); end; end; toc()
ans = 0.537685000337660
octave:8&gt;
</pre>

Firstly, the recursive function took the longest by far and this
was to be expected. Just like with most other programming
languages, calling functions (even recursively) requires a lot of
overhead. The result that may surprise you is that the use of the
<code>prod()</code> function is about six times faster than
iteration. This is because, just like Matlab, Octave is quite slow
at looping and it should be avoided wherever possible.

<p>As I have already stated, well written and documented functions
are important, especially if you wish to share your code. Some may
think that the effect of checking for valid input may significantly
slow a function's execution. Let's compare the iteration algorithm
in <a href="misc/odonovan/lg_factorial6.m">lg_factorial6.m</a>
against the same algorithm but with full error checking in <a href=
"misc/odonovan/lg_factorial8.m">lg_factorial8.m</a>:</p>

<pre class="code">
octave:8&gt; tic(); for i=1:100000 lg_factorial6( 10 ); end; toc()
ans = 9.44780500046909
octave:9&gt; tic(); for i=1:100000 lg_factorial8( 10 ); end; toc()
ans = 17.9307480007410
octave:10&gt; 
</pre>

<p>There is clearly a difference but when you consider that each
function is called 100,000 times, the added time for the error
checking is only 0.000085 seconds per function call.</p>

<p>Another important tip to remember when writing Octave functions
is to avoid resizing matrices unnecessarily. The manual itself
states that if you are &ldquo;<em>building a single result matrix
from a series of calculations, set the size of the result matrix
first, then insert values into it.</em>&rdquo; The following is a
graphic illustration at just how slow this can be:</p>

<pre class="code">
octave:10&gt; clear a; tic(); for i=1:100000 a(i) = i; end; toc()
ans = 52.4
octave:11&gt; a = [1]; tic(); for i=2:100000 a = [a i]; end; toc()
ans = 362.247
octave:12&gt; a=zeros(100000,1); tic(); for i=1:100000 a(i) = i; end; toc()
ans = 1.42
octave:13&gt; 
</pre>

<h3>Octave Scripts</h3>

<p>Octave script files are simply a sequence of Octave commands
which are evaluated as if you had typed them at the Octave prompt
yourself. They are useful for setting up simulations where you wish
to vary certain parameters for each run without having to re-type
the commands each time, for sequences of commands that do not
logically belong in a function and for automating certain
tasks.</p>

<p>Octave scripts are placed in a file with the <code>.m</code>
extension in the same way that functions are but a script file
<strong>must not</strong> begin with the <code>function</code>
keyword. Note that variables defined in a script share the same
namespace (or scope) as variables defined at the Octave prompt.</p>

<p>The following is a simple example of an Octave script which
calculates the time taken to create an array of integers of size
specified by the user:</p>

<pre class="code">
# An example Octave script 

len = input( "What size array do you wish to use for the evaluation: " );

clear a; 
tic(); 
for i=1:len
    a(i) = i; 
endfor 
time1 = toc();

a = [1]; 
tic(); 
for i=2:len 
    a = [a i]; 
endfor
time2 = toc();

a=zeros( len, 1 ); 
tic(); 
for i=1:len 
    a(i) = i; 
endfor
time3 = toc();

printf( "The time taken for method 1 was %.4f seconds\n", time1 );
printf( "The time taken for method 2 was %.4f seconds\n", time2 );
printf( "The time taken for method 3 was %.4f seconds\n", time3 );
</pre>
Listing 6: <a href=
"misc/odonovan/lg_calc_time.m">lg_calc_time.m</a>
<p>And once it is saved in an appropriately named file, it can be
executed as follows:</p>

<pre class="code">
octave:13&gt; lg_calc_time
What size array do you wish to use for the evaluation: 20000
The time taken for method 1 was 1.3509 seconds
The time taken for method 2 was 12.8984 seconds
The time taken for method 3 was 0.2850 seconds
octave:14&gt; 
</pre>

<h3>Executable Octave Scripts</h3>

<p>It is also possible to have executable Octave script files like
we have executable Bash scripts. This is an excellent feature of
Octave that can be very useful for large problems where a mixture
of programs, tools or applications may be needed to solve the
problem.</p>

<p>The example in listing 6 above can be easily converted to an
executable Octave program by adding a single line to the
beginning:</p>

<pre class="code">
#! /usr/bin/octave -qf

# An example executable Octave script 

len = input( "What size array do you wish to use for the evaluation: " );
... ... ...              ... ... ...              ... ... ...
printf( "The time taken for method 3 was %.4f seconds\n", time3 );
</pre>
Listing 7: <a href=
"misc/odonovan/lg_calc_time.sh">lg_calc_time.sh</a>
<p>Just make sure that the path to the Octave program is correct
for your system (<code>/usr/bin/octave</code>), make the script
executable and run it as follows:</p>

<pre class="code">
[barry@hiscomputer lg]$ chmod u+x lg_calc_time.sh
[barry@hiscomputer lg]$ ./lg_calc_time.sh
What size array do you wish to use for the evaluation: 20000
The time taken for method 1 was 1.3959 seconds
The time taken for method 2 was 13.0201 seconds
The time taken for method 3 was 0.2800 seconds
[barry@hiscomputer lg]$
</pre>
If you call the script with command line arguments, then they will
be available through the built-in variable <code>argv</code> and
the number of arguments will be contained in the variable
<code>nargin</code> which we have already seen. A simple example of
this can be seen in <a href=
"misc/odonovan/lg_calc_time2.sh">lg_calc_time2.sh</a> which is the
same as the last example except it reads the size of the array from
the command line.

<h3><a name="copyright" id="copyright">Conventional Headers and
Copyright Notices</a>
</h3>

As I mentioned in the previous article, Octave is not as complete
as Matlab for specialised functions and the Octave developers
welcome new additions which are well written and robust. There are
conventions for writing function files which include author
information, copyright restrictions, date of creation, version, etc.
Functions for inclusion with Octave will have to be distributed
with an appropriate open source license (further information can be
found in appendix A of the <a href=
"http://www.octave.org/doc/octave.html">official
documentation</a>). With proper headers and a copyright notices, my
factorial function would look like:

<h3>Final Words</h3>

<p>There are many tricks and techniques for writing efficient
Octave code. Examples include imaginative uses of the
<code>reshape()</code> function for operations between elements of
the same matrix so as to avoid iteration. I would welcome all such
tips to <img src="../gx/authors/email/odonovan.png"> and if I get
enough I will write them up in an article.</p>
