<p>
Indeed; happy 150th, LG. It's taken a lot of effort and involved a lot
of people, including everyone here. Thanks, everybody, for helping make
it a great community resource!
</p>

<p>
This is also a good point to review the process by which LG happens, and
ask for input from you folks. As it stands right now, the process is
fragile, top-heavy, and has a couple of bad choke-points; perhaps
someone here will have a suggestion or two for improving it.
</p>

<p>
1) Starting from the source end, we have articles and press releases
come into LG, via articles@ and bytes@ addresses (or, occasionally, less
orthodox means.) For articles, I review them and either a) add them to
the upcoming issue repository (SVN) or b) put them on hold (my personal
directory in SVN, p/ben/tmp) for publication in a later issue. 
</p>

<p>
2) PR gets routed to my 'bytes' mailbox. Ever since we lost Sam Bisbee
as NewsBytes editor, that load has gone floating... which means that
either I do it (very rarely), Kat does it (usually), or it doesn't get
done (all too common.)
</p>

<p>
3) The articles, meanwhile, have been vetted and generally pounded into
shape by yours truly. The sit in articles/&lt;issue_number&gt;/, where they
are available to our proofreaders and tech editors until the end of the
month. 
</p>

<p>
4) At that point, Kat produces the various in-house mail stuff
(lg_mailbag, lg_launderette, lg_tips, etc.) and adds them to the
repository, while I proof, edit, and review anything that hasn't been
handled. In parallel with this, I repeatedly build the issue and check
the layout as I work on a given article.
</p>

<p>
5) Next, I add external content (comics, other news, etc.) and process
it to fit the LG format.
</p>

<p>
6) I build the issue and check it, with Kat providing backup, and fix
any flaws. After several rounds of this, the issue is ready to be
published. I run the final processing scripts, depending on how much
time and energy I have (adding Digg links, 'tidy', etc.), do a final
check on the issue, and a final build.
</p>

<p>
7) Last, I upload the newly-created issue to the LG server, relink
<a href="../../../current">http://linuxgazette.net/current</a> to point to it, update 'archives.html'
to contain the new issue link, build the FTP tarball, and send out the
"LG has been pubbed!" notice to the world.
</p>


<p>
As you can probably guess by now, all of this is getting to be quite the
sore point; this is all <strong>besides</strong> the usual monthly stuff I do for LG
(i.e., dealing with conference promoters, review book submissions and
requests, handling author and volunteer questions, updating/maintaining
the FAQs, handling site questions and issues, creating and updating the
LG scripts, etc.) There are times, especially during that final stretch,
that I get so frustrated that I feel like dropping the whole thing and
walking away. As it stands, Kat and I usually spend the last three days
of the month doing nothing <strong>but</strong> LG stuff - and this is way, way too
much.
</p>

<p>
This is not to slight the services of our steady reviewers, by the way;
in particular, Ren&eacute; Pfeiffer has quietly but steadily done a bunch of
editing every month, and a number of other people have participated at
various times - but to keep LG going, we need more than that. Say, three
or four steady reviewers every single month, with help from others on
occasion would take care of it.
</p>

<p>
Folks, I really do need help here. Changes need to happen if LG is to
keep running - there's no reasonable way that I and Kat can keep
carrying that load. I would really appreciate suggestions, offers of
help, ideas on making the process better, etc. It can't keep going like
this... and I would really prefer to have this separated into reasonable
chunks, each handled by a responsible, reliable person than have it all
come suddenly crashing down one month because I just couldn't handle the
stress and the effort.

That's excellent, Ram. I like to see LG functioning as a springboard for
people's talents and abilities; I see that as one of the hugely positive
effects that Linux has on the world, and I'm always chuffed to hear of
another success story of that sort.

<p>
Thanks, Ram - I appreciate that. What I mostly see as necessary right
now is a steady crew of proofreaders and tech editors. We really need a
NewsBytes editor - someone who will take in the stream of PR, separate
out the hype, and presents our readers with useful, relevant content. We
need one or more editors for our mail stream: someone to produce the
Mailbag, 2-Cent Tips, Talkbacks, etc. - this is just a matter of
tweaking the input to produce a reasonable layout rather than any sort
of proofing or editing. Most of all, though, we need people who will be
there reliably, every month - or who will let us know, as early as
possible, that they won't make it that month. That's a serious
commitment - and that's what we really need.

The first thing that springs to my mind is some sort of coordination
between the (technical) proof-readers. Quite often I don't know if
someone is working (or is going to work) on an article and if someone
needs help when proof-reading an article. Maybe checking the subversion
log is sufficient, but I think there should be some words describing
what to do and what to look for. There is a workflow description in the
"Proofreading LG" FAQ section, but I seldom see the "Editing XYZ"
messages in the log.

In theory, everybody <em>should</em> be using those - as well as setting and
clearing the bits they're working on/are done with. Unfortunately, given
the usual minimal level of activity in the repository (except my rushing
about at the end of the month), that can be hard to track.

It's a good idea to check for updates at any time, and definitely around
the deadline. If I have several articles early in the month, I'll just
create the new issue and add them in right then, and people should feel
free to jump on them.

Yeah. I've always managed to hold it together through thick and thin -

I confess, I don't use the subversion very often. This is mainly because
it's a pull log instead of a push log. Exporting the logs to a kind of
editors mailing list would be a way to push the information. It's just a
thought since in times of stress I cling to my email inbox and sort
everything there.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The first thing that springs to my mind is some sort of coordination
&gt; &gt; &gt; between the (technical) proof-readers. Quite often I don't know if
&gt; &gt; &gt; someone is working (or is going to work) on an article and if someone
&gt; &gt; &gt; needs help when proof-reading an article. Maybe checking the subversion
&gt; &gt; &gt; log is sufficient, but I think there should be some words describing
&gt; &gt; &gt; what to do and what to look for. There is a workflow description in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; "Proofreading LG" FAQ section, but I seldom see the "Editing XYZ"
&gt; &gt; &gt; messages in the log.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; In theory, everybody <em>should</em> be using those - as well as setting and
&gt; &gt; clearing the bits they're working on/are done with. Unfortunately, given
&gt; &gt; the usual minimal level of activity in the repository (except my rushing
&gt; &gt; about at the end of the month), that can be hard to track.
&gt; 
&gt; I confess, I don't use the subversion very often. This is mainly because
&gt; it's a pull log instead of a push log. Exporting the logs to a kind of
&gt; editors mailing list would be a way to push the information. It's just a
&gt; thought since in times of stress I cling to my email inbox and sort
&gt; everything there.

I have the same general approach at those times. I could set up a cron
job to run once a day and email the logs to the 'lg-volunteers' list
(hosted on Rick's server, same signup procedure as TAG, etc.) - I
suppose that would serve as a reminder to anyone who's signed up that
other people are working at it. I could also post reminder messages
there ("New article added", "Article submission closed for this month",
etc.)
</p>

<p>
Hmm, this is sounding like a reasonable idea. Any reasons against?

I set this up earlier today; as long as my laptop is on around 5pm, the
notice will go out daily. Anyone doing proofing or editing for LG should
sign on at <a href="http://lists.linuxgazette.net/mailman/listinfo/lg-volunteers/">http://lists.linuxgazette.net/mailman/listinfo/lg-volunteers/</a>
- this way, you'll get to keep up on what's going on.

I do can check the newsbytes material, maybe do some reviewing, but
proof-reading is a bit too much for my english i think.

That's not a problem at all, Deividson; if you can condense it down to
interesting material instead of PR-speak, it would go into the
repository and be proofed just like every other article. I'd be very
happy if you'd take that on - although LG is going to look like it's
the Okopnik family magazine, given how many of us are participating. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
I've said this several times before, but I find an article from a
non-native English speaker who works hard at his grammar and spelling
far preferable to sloppy and careless work from someone who is supposed
to be at home with the language. Editing the former is relatively easy -
the errors are consistent and are far more likely to be handled as soon
as they're pointed out. The latter can be an absolute nightmare.

OK - I've got you listed as being in charge of NewsBytes in
'<a href="../../../jobs.html">http://linuxgazette.net/jobs.html</a>'. And even if it's not in our veins,
the next generation (a random sample of which is even now climbing up
the companionway steps like a little monkey...) can certainly lay that
claim. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
