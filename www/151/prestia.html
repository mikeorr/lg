<p>
Crontab is a very useful command used to run unattended scheduled 
tasks, which can decrease administrative time. There are also two similar 
commands: anacron and at. Anacron is for scheduling commands that do not 
require the computer to be on at all times; Anacron uses day-, week-, and 
month-type intervals. The "at" command runs a task once, at a set time,
and can also be very useful. But most commonly used is crontab, because
it is more versatile, and can be customized to run at any time
interval.</p>

<p>At our college, we have several servers running scripts which
back up critical data during off peak hours. We have automated these
procedures by using cron. For example, the backup script brings several
services to a stop, performs an rsync of any changes from the
hot server to a duplicate cold server, performs a standard tape
archive backup, and finally brings the halted services back online. I
sure am glad I don't have to be present at 1:00 AM, when this operation
is performed! Thanks to cron, all I have to do is load and unload the
backup devices and check my mail every morning to make sure all went
well. I also have other programs that are run periodically - I
would hate to have to remember to run these scripts every day.</p> 

<p>In administering your system, you will also need to use cron quite a
bit. This is done via the 'crontab' file, which lists the times and the
scripts to be executed. The system also has a default crontab file,
<tt>/etc/crontab</tt>, which runs certain scripts at set times: hourly,
daily, weekly, and monthly. This file can be kind of cryptic-looking at
first - so let's take the mystery out of it by breaking it down.</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# cat /etc/crontab
SHELL=/bin/bash
PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
MAILTO=root
HOME=/

# run-parts
01 * * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.hourly
02 4 * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.daily
22 4 * * 0 root run-parts /etc/cron.weekly
42 4 1 * * root run-parts /etc/cron.monthly
[root@localhost ~]#
</pre> 

<p>
The first part simply sets a few variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
SHELL<dt><dd>The first line specifies the shell to use for parsing the
command line. "/bin/sh" is the default.
</dd> 

<dt>
PATH</dt><dd>Because cron runs as subshell process, we need to either
specify a path or use a PATH statement in crontab. The reason for this is
that we are not logging into a console when we run these jobs - so neither
.bashrc or .bash_profile have been sourced, and we have no environment
variables to work with as we do when we login as a regular user or as root.
It's also important to remember that trying to output data without a console
is pointless - there's no screen to display it on! - so you need to make
sure that any output that you want to save is logged somewhere.
</dd> 

<dt>
MAILTO</dt><dd>On the next line, we have a "MAILTO=" command sending the 
results of these cron jobs to the root user. If MAILTO is defined but
empty, mail from 'cron' will simply be discarded; if it's not set, then it
will be sent to the owner of the crontab. I will show a sample of this
additional output, later.
</dd> 

<dt>
HOME</dt><dd>The next line sets the home directory used by cron. If
unspecified, it will default to the entry in the owner's /etc/passwd file.
</dd>

<dt>
# run-parts</dt><dd>This line is actually just a comment specifying the
section, although "run-parts" is a command that will run all the scripts or
programs in the directory that is specified. There is even a man page for
run-parts.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The time field seems to be the part that everyone has problems with -
unless you're familiar with it, it can seem pretty cryptic. The rest is
very straightforward. The user column specifies the 'run-as' user, and the
"run-parts" command runs the scripts in the specified directory.  Note that
the directories are named by the interval at which they're run; you could
just place your scripts in the directory you wanted, and they would be run
at the times that are already set in the time section. This is not a good
idea, though, because you can forget they're in there.  It's by far better
to edit your crontab file and create your own cron job, because it's easier
to get a listing of your cron jobs this way and fine-tune them through via
the crontab command.  Keep in mind that this is the system crontab file
(it runs the system maintenance scripts and programs), so a user's crontab
will look a little different - in fact, the structure will be different -
so don't try to replicate this.
</p> 

<pre class="code">
#		Time	      User      Command       Path

01   *   *   *   *    root      run-parts     /etc/cron.hourly
02   4   *   *   *    root      run-parts     /etc/cron.daily
22   4   *   *   0    root      run-parts     /etc/cron.weekly
42   4   1   *   *    root      run-parts     /etc/cron.monthly
</pre>


<h3>The Basics</h3>

<p>
There are two files that specify which users can and cannot use crontab:
/etc/cron.allow and /etc/cron.deny. Usually, only cron.deny exists,
and it really couldn't be much simpler: If cron.deny is present,
and the user's username is in it (one user per line), then he or she is
denied use of the crontab command. If cron.allow is present, then only
users listed (one per line) in this file are allowed crontab use.</p>

<p>
In the crontab file, there are six fields for each entry, each field
separated by spaces or tabs.
</p>

<ul>
    <li> The first five fields specify when the command will be run.
    <li> The sixth field is the command itself.
</ul>

<pre>
          Minute - 0-59.
          Hour - 0-23 24-hour format.
          Day - 1-31 Day of the month.
          Month - 1-12 Month of the year.
          Weekday - 0-6 Day of the week. 0 refers to Sunday.
</pre> 

<p>
In the file, this would look as follows (the comments aren't necessary,
but they can be very convenient as a reminder):
</p>

<pre class="code">
# min(0-59)    hours(0-23)   day(1-31)   month(1-12)    dow(0-6)   command
   34               2           *            *             *       sh /root/backup.sh
</pre>

<p>
This example runs, at 2:34 AM every day of the month, every month of the year, 
every day of the week, the backup script called in the last column by
"sh /root/backup.sh". 
</p>

<p class="editorial">[ This, of course, requires the script to be written
in strict 'sh' syntax - e.g., any "Bash-isms" would cause errors. As is the
usual case with shell scripts, using a shebang which specifies the desired
shell, making the script executable, and running it simply by specifying
the name offers more precise control over the execution environment. -- Ben ]
</p>

<p>
A star in any position means 'every interval'; that is, a star in the
'minutes' slot would mean "execute this every minute".
</p>


<h3>Try It</h3>

<p>
Let's set up a cron task, just to see how easy it really is to do. The
command we run is crontab -e, which will bring up a vi editor session <a
href="#1"><strong>[1]</strong></a> in which we set up our cron task.  Also,
you can space the numbers as far apart as you want, but I would recommend
getting in the habit of using just one single space because you may need
the extra space for the absolute path to whatever command you're running.
</p>

<pre>
[root@localhost ~]# crontab -e
</pre>

<p>
Now enter the following line:
</p>

<pre>
* * * * * /usr/bin/wall "Hello From Crontab"
</pre>

<p>
When you save it, you should see the following output:
</p>

<pre>
crontab: installing new crontab
[root@localhost ~]#
</pre> 

<p>
In a few moments, you will see a message:
</p>

<pre>
Broadcast message from root (Thu Apr  3 14:52:01 2008):

Hello From Crontab
</pre>

<p>
This message will continue every minute, because we put stars in every time
field; if we do not remove this crontab after we're satisfied, we will be
greeted every minute for the rest of our lives. This is also a good
demonstration of what crontab can do if you make a mistake! We will need
to execute "crontab -r" to remove the entry.
</p>

<pre>
[root@localhost ~]# crontab -r
</pre>

<p>
Now, say at a certain time in the future you need to start the Apache 'httpd' 
Web server. We could use a cron job to do this. First, we'll check to 
see that httpd is not running. Then, we'll do a "date" command to get the 
current time, so we can set the service to run in the future.
</p>

<pre>
[root@localhost ~]# service httpd status
httpd is stopped
[root@localhost ~]# 
[root@localhost ~]# date
Thu Apr  3 15:45:32 MST 2008
[root@localhost ~]#
</pre>

<p>
We can now easily figure out what 10 minutes from now will
be, execute crontab -e in the editor, and write a simple
crontab file, remembering the format.  </p> 

<pre>
# min(0-59)    hours(0-23)   day(1-31)   month(1-12)    dow(0-6)   command

   55	          15           *            *		*  	/sbin/service httpd start
</pre>

<p>
For now, just use stars for the day, month, and day of week, and only one 
space between elements; some distros complain if you have more spaces. 
So, enter something like this:
</p>

<pre>
55 15 * * * /sbin/service httpd start
</pre>

<pre>
[root@localhost ~]# crontab -e 
crontab: Installing new crontab
</pre>

<p>
If you made any mistakes, 'crontab' will tell you about it right as you
close the editor. Assuming that everything was right, though, we will have
the Apache Web server running less than ten minutes from now. You can use
"crontab -l" to list your jobs at any time, to see what is in your crontab
and when these jobs are set to run:
</p> 

<pre>
[root@localhost ~]# crontab -l 
55 15 * * * /sbin/service httpd start
</pre>

<p>
Yours should look similar. What this means, though, is that 'httpd' is
still set to run every single day at the specified time. Again, we'll
remove it by executing "crontab -r" to delete all the entries in the file.
</p>

<pre>
[root@localhost ~]# crontab -r
</pre>

<p>
The combinations seem endless. There are also additional variations for
specifying time: "20-27" specifies a range; "3,4,7,8" mean just those
intervals for that selection; and */5 would be every 5th interval. Another
feature of cron is that, upon completion of a job, it will mail the command
output to the user who set up the cron job unless that feature is disabled.
</p>  

<h3>Some more samples</h3>

<p>
This crontab entry would run the command every 15 and 30 minutes after 
every hour, during the month of May:
</p>

<pre>
15,30 * *  5 * /usr/bin/command
</pre> 

<p>
To run a backup script on just Sundays, Mondays, and Tuesdays at 2:12 AM,
the entry would be:
</p> 

<pre>
12 2 * * 0-2 sh /root/backup.sh
</pre> 

<p>
To run a script at 12 minutes after every 3rd hour of every day, the entry 
would look like this:
</p> 

<pre>
12 */3 * * * sh /root/script.sh
</pre>

<p>
To get cron to write the output of the commands to a log, you can append 
something like this to the command entry:
</p>

<pre>
12 */3 * * * sh /root/script.sh &gt;&gt; /root/script.log 2&gt;&amp;1
</pre>

<p>
To have cron suppress the e-mail:
</p>  

<pre>
12 */3 * * * sh /root/script.sh &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
</pre>

<p>
This is a sample of cron output that would end up in the mail
</p>

<pre>

Date: Thu, 3 Apr 2008 12:08:01 -0700

speaking, on most systems, "crontab -e" will invoke whatever is defined
by the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables.

Joey was born in Phoenix and started programming at the age fourteen on
 a Timex Sinclair 1000. He was driven by hopes he might be able to do
 something with this early model computer. He soon became proficient in
 the BASIC and Assembly programming languages. Joey became a programmer
 in 1990 and added COBOL, Fortran, and Pascal to his repertoire of
 programming languages. Since then has become obsessed with just about
 every aspect of computer science. He became enlightened and discovered
 RedHat Linux in 2002 when someone gave him RedHat version six. This 
 started off a new passion centered around Linux. Currently Joey is 
 completing his degree in Linux Networking and working on campus
 for the college's RedHat Academy in Arizona. He is also on the staff of
 the Linux Gazette as the Mirror Coordinator.
