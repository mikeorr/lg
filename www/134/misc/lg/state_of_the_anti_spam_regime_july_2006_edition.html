</p>

<p>
Ben recently called my attention to incoming mail being rejected at my
SMTP server because the system SPF daemon could not be reached.  More
recently, about an hour ago, a flurry of spam snuck through the system
because the SpamAssassin daemon had died.  And Exim4 (the SMTP daemon)
has occasionally entered a fault mode where a queued-up message is
processed repeatedly.
</p>

<p>
All of these epiphenomena turn out to have the same underlying cause:  
Baby needs new shoes.
</p>

<p>
Just as a frog put in a pot of cold water and brought slowly to a boil
will not jump out and save himself, mail servers reach the brink of
failure by... um... degrees.  In this case, what's been happening is
that my server's meagre 256MB of RAM is being badly overstressed.
</p>

<p>
The repeat-sending syndrome was an early clue:  The queue-handling Exim4
instance would send the queued mail out, and then call a different
routine to process final steps including deletion that just happened to 
require more RAM, which was not available so the Exim4 instance died
before cleanup could occur.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, I've sung the praises of GNU screen so effectively
that several other shell users (Hi, Karsten!  Hi, Ben!  Hi, Thomas![1])
have joined me in leaving it running 24x7 running (sometimes) large jobs
-- more RAM gone.  And last, the volume of incoming spam continues to
increase and find new tricks, while my primary SMTP-layer defence of
Exim4 rulesets isn't being updated because the host is a lame-duck
installation intended to be retired.
</p>

<p>
Right behind the primary defence, intended to backstop spam that gets
past Exim4's rules, is -- guess what?  SpamAssassin, a rather large,
slow, and RAM-grabbing Perl script, running in daemon mode and spawning
more instances as needed.  The busier and slower it gets, the more
RAM-grabbing instances.
</p>

<p>
So, we've been getting weird MTA repeated-mailing behaviour, and
mysteriously dying processes:  The kernel OOM-killer gets set loose,
and starts shooting large and/or busy processes in the head.  If I'm 
lucky, it's one of my mutt instances running under screen and reading
one of my carelessly overlarge mbox files.  Or screen itself.  If I'm
unlucky, it's spfd.  Or SpamAssassin.  Or Exim4.  Or Apache httpd.  Or
BIND9.  All of those have happened.
</p>

<p>
The pattern was obvious, but I've been reluctant to see it, in part
because it's a pain to deal with.
</p>

<p>
The only fix is to debug my problems with the intended replacement box
(needs a kernel with ability to load the root FS from software RAID1), 
configure its daemons for the needed services, sync up all data files,
and do a flag day.  The new box is better in every way, including 
its 1.5 GB of system RAM.
</p>

<p>
I need to do that.  You guys really can't.  I just need to find the
time.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, I'm using screen <em>less</em>.  (Karsten, if you can help in
that area, too, that would be appreciated.)
</p>

<p>
[1] Latter two names being a guess -- and it's not like there's anything
wrong with using screen.  It's great stuff.
</p>

Cheers,              Your eyes are weary from staring at the CRT. You feel 
Rick Moen            sleepy.  Notice how restful it is to watch the cursor 
rick at linuxmafia.com  blink.  Close your eyes. The opinions stated above are 
                     yours. You cannot imagine why you ever felt otherwise.

<p>
Redirecting back to "tag", just in case we have some diagnostic 
opinions from there.
</p>

&gt; That's how I figured you were using it, Rick. If you wanted money, you'd
&gt; have said so - I have this feeling that you got over being all shy and
&gt; retiring a while ago. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> I just thought that you might still be in the
&gt; planning/buying stages.
</pre>
 
The newer machine in question's still, to my way of thinking, pretty nice:
Single-proc PIII/800 or so, VA Linux Systems 2230 2U rackmount chassis,
Intel L440GX+ "Lancewood" motherboard, 1.5TB RAM, 2 x 73GB RAID1 pair
(Linux software RAID) for the important filesystems, 16GB? boot drive,
</p>

<p>
That's pretty snazzy -- for 2001.  ;-&gt;
</p>

<p>
All the filesystems are built, and it's loaded with Debian "etch" 4.0
and a rough cut of all the necessary software, not yet fully configured.
Data files haven't yet been copied over (IIRC).  
</p>

<p>
The last time I worked on it, I'd fetched a new Debian-packaged binary
kernel 2.6.x and blithely <em>removed</em> the previous, believed-bootable 
installed 2.6.x kernel.  And then rebooted, found that I'd just shot
myself in the foot, lost patience / ran out of time, and quit for the
day.  I've not yet gotten back to it, and meantime other things have 
been keeping me away.
</p>

<p>
You know, it's also possible the old box has developed a bad spot of
RAM, or something like that.  Look at this kernel "oops" from
/var/log/messages, which is typical of process blowouts, lately:

Off hand, I'm uncertain of the root cause.

Rick do you mean 1.5Gb memory?? ;)  Just thinking that terabytes of 
memory is going a bit OTT...  I also thought that P3's usually only go 
up something like 2Gb memory, not sure off hand though.

D'oh!  Yes, I only <em>wish</em> I had 1.5 TB of RAM.  I'm willing to accept
that even in PC-100.  Just leave it in a brown bag on my doorstep,
please, and nobody need get hurt.  ;-&gt;
</p>

<p>
Yes, the old box is back online.  Absent-minded members of my household
(myself certainly included) had closed up <em>all</em> the doors leading into the 
garage that is the temporary home of our servers.   Today, my town had
record high temperatures of 35 degrees (95, if using last millennium's
Fahrenheit scale) -- which meant it was probably closer to 40 inside the 
sealed garage.  And the machine simply was unhappy, that way.
</p>

<p>
There will be a fresh backup, soonish -- and I'll devote serious
attention to the long-delayed hardware migration, -and- to creating the
planned server-shelf space in the foundation crawlspace, under my house.
For now, there's also an electric fan blowing additional air at the
server.
</p>

<p>
For the record, anyway, if you see segfaults and kernel oopses, it <em>may</em> 
indicate a runaway heat problem.  I didn't know that, before.

One of the laptops that I tested before buying the HP that I have as my
backup machine ran ridiculously hot - I actually got to see the kernel
spit out a "thermal shutdown" message and halt (I didn't realize it had
such a goodie in it until it did that.) During the short time that I ran
it - and I actually tried two different machines of the same make and
model - a number of the sessions terminated either in a thermal cutout
or a segfault.
</p>

<p>
In general, when I see a segfault that wasn't caused by a known factor
(e.g., a just-compiled, highly experimental kernel), I immediately
suspect either a) bad hardware or b) overtemp conditions. I suppose you
could make the case that b) really resolves to a) - I've always
considered memory to be analog hardware, anyway... It sorta works within
parameters when the moon in in the right phase, but tends to wander
outside of them whenever anything (like the price of pork bellies on the
commodities market, or the percentage of carbon dioxide on Mars)
changes.
