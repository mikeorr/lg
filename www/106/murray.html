<h1>Building A Lo-Fat Linux Desktop</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/murray.html">John Murray</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3 align="center">A Newbies Guide to a <i>Less Lardy Linux</i></h3>

<p><b>Note:</b> When I wrote the first version of this article in 2001, I was using a
233mhz machine with 32megs of RAM. And while my current box has specs of
about ten times those numbers, I mainly still use the same speedy applications
covered in the story below...</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I first started playing with Linux a few years ago, after reading several
Introduction-To-Linux articles in computer magazines and on the web. In
almost all of these articles, low hardware requirements are listed as one of
Linux's advantages. Usually the authors then go on to show how easy it is to
use Linux on the desktop with the GNOME or KDE desktop environments.</p>
<p>So I set up my machine to dual-boot Win95 and Linux, and experimented with
several different distros. Initially I was disappointed with the performance
of Linux, and it took me a while to discover the performance gains made
possible by running leaner software. The fact that most of the newbie-oriented
documentation emphasised GNOME/KDE while ignoring everything else only made
things harder. That's what this page is all about - a newbie's guide to good,
lightweight software that runs well on boxes that are less than state-of-the-art.</p>
<p>GNOME and KDE are good-looking, feature-packed environments that are as
easy to use as the desktop on that other OS, but they aren't the best choice
for an older machine - they can actually be quite sluggish
unless you have some fairly recent hardware to run them. That doesn't mean
you're stuck with a text-only console though, as it's easy to set up a nice
looking Linux desktop that has plenty of speed on something like an early
Pentium with 32megs of RAM, though 64megs is even better.</p>
<p>A speedy desktop is largely just a matter of using a window manager and
applications that suit your hardware. And by the way, just because you don't
use the KDE or GNOME desktop environments doesn't mean you shouldn't install
them, or at least their core libraries. KDE and GNOME apps will run quite well
under a lightweight window manager, so if you have the disk space, I recommend 
installing both. In my experience though, GNOME/GTK apps load appreciably
quicker than the KDE equivalents. Listed
below are some suggestions for the type of apps. that most people use
everyday, all of which work nicely on my 233/64 box - and most of this stuff
should be fine with just 32megs of RAM. Keep in mind that these suggestions
are only my own personal preferences; they certainly aren't the <i>only</i>
way to do things.<br>
</p>

<h3>The Selection Criteria</h3>
<ul>
<li>Performance - It should be acceptably fast and stable on older hardware
</li><li>Graphical Interface - most newbies and non-geeks prefer this to the
command line
</li><li>Functionality - It should do everything that normal users (whatever they
are) expect of that type of app.
</li><li>Ease of Installation - It should be reasonably simple to install, without
needing kernel recompilation and without too many obscure dependencies.
</li><li>Ease of Configuration - You shouldn't need to be a vi or scripting guru to
knock it into shape
</li><li>Ease of Use - It should be reasonably easy to learn the usage.</li></ul>

<h3>Where to Get Packages</h3>
<p>You'll find a lot of this stuff is included on the installation cd's of
most distro's. Wherever possible, I've provided a link to the projects homepage.</p>

<h3><a name="The_Window_Manager"></a>The Window Manager</h3>
<p>The choice of window manager can have a dramatic effect on system performance,
and there are several good, lightweight WMs available, my favourite
being <a href="http://www.icewm.org/">IceWm</a> . As well as having a small
memory footprint, IceWm can be made to look quite good with wallpapers and <a href="http://themes.freshmeat.net/browse/925/">themes</a>
. It also has that familiar Win95 layout with the corner start button, menus,
toolbar and so on. There are certainly lighter WMs around, but for me IceWm
provides a good balance of useful features and performance - and it is lighter
on RAM than some other window managers with far fewer features. Don't assume
that IceWm has to be plain or ugly - current versions can support XFT antialiasing,
gradients and so on, and with a theme like Silver XP can be quite good-looking.</p>
<p><b>Configuring IceWm</b> is extremely easy, and while there are graphical
tools available for this, it's just as easy to edit its configuration files
manually. The global configuration files are usually in
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/icewm/ and are named <i>preferences</i> , <i>menu</i> and <i>toolbar</i>
. Make a hidden folder called <i>.icewm</i> in your home directory and copy
these three files into it. Then it's just a matter of editing them to suit
your own needs and tastes.</p>
<p>IceWm is included with many recent distros, and includes very good
documentation in /usr/doc/icewm.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.xfce.org/">Xfce</a> is another popular, fast window manager,
though strictly speaking it's really a desktop environment. Worth a look if you want
something with more bells and whistles - but I still prefer IceWm.</p>

<h3><a name="The_File_Manager"></a>The File Manager</h3>
<p>I've tried plenty of graphical file managers, but I always come back to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xwc/">XWC</a>
(X Windows Commander) because of its speed, stability, and again for its
familiar interface. XWC is a clone of the Win95 style Explorer that supports
drag'n'drop to copy/move/symlink, file associations and so on. Although it
lacks many of the features of say, Nautilus or Konqueror, its got everything I
need, without the bloat. Like IceWm, it is very easy to configure using the built
in options menu or by editing the ~/.foxrc/XWC file.</p>
<p>While I'd prefer something that doesn't look quite so Windows-like, XWC
works very well and is quite speedy. It also includes a handy archiving tool,
a media mounting tool and a rather ordinary front end to RPM. XWC can be used
in two-panel mode, like all good file managers.</p>
<p>Work has recently resumed on XWC, mainly in an effort to support a greater
variety of languages. A couple of file managers have evolved from XWC, namely XFE and
Fox Commander, and although they are more modern looking, I still find XWC to be the best for
stability and performance.</p> 
<p>Another fast, good looking filer that is highly recommended is <a href="http://rox.sourceforge.net/">rox</a><br>
</p>

<h3>Terminal Emulators</h3>
<p>Forget about the korpulent konsole, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rxvt">rxvt</a> has a
combination of features and speed that make it my favourite, plus you can customise
its appearance if you are into that sort of thing. An even lighter 
alternative is <a href="http://aterm.sourceforge.net/">aterm</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="Text_Editors"></a>Text Editors</h3>
<p>While XWC comes with its own (very) basic editor, I much prefer <a href="http://www.nedit.org/">Nedit</a>
. Nedit is fairly small, is fast and has lots of useful features built in,
including: syntax highlighting, search and replace, macro support, shell
access and much more. The built in help is very good as well. I know some
people get passionate about their editors ( especially the vi crowd ), but if
you want a good WYSIWYG style editor, Nedit is very nice indeed.</p>
<p>Another editor that I like to have available is <a href="http://www.nano-editor.org/">Nano</a>, an exceptionally light, basic app.
that will be instantly familiar to Pine/Pico users. Unlike Nedit, Nano will run from a console
as well as an X-terminal, and the value of this will be appreciated by anyone who's
misconfigured their XF86-Config file to the point that X won't start ;)</p>

<h3><a name="Internet_Stuff"></a>Internet Stuff</h3>
<p>Linux users now have a choice of quality browsers that match or beat the
performance of those on other platforms, though some are a little resource
hungry. These range from basic (but speedy) browsers like Dillo and
Links-Graphic to the ones based on a stripped down Mozilla, such as Galeon and Firefox.</p>
<p>At the lighter end of the range, <a href="http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/%7Eclock/twibright/links/">links-graphic</a> is hard to beat. Speedy, and
with a small footprint, it is surprisingly capable, and can handle frames and
tables as well as javascript. Its interface is a little different to most
other graphical browsers, but quite good once you get used to it.  <a href="http://www.dillo.org/">Dillo</a>
is another one worth trying. Dillo is extremely fast, and quite good looking
as well. Still under development, it doesn't yet handle frames, java or
javascript, so you probably won't be able to do your online banking with it.
It's brilliant for reading local html files (like helpfiles and /usr/doc/html/
stuff).</p>
<p>Opera is a very popular browser that fits somewhere between the superlight
apps like links-graphic or Dillo, and the heavy duty Mozilla based browsers.
The free-download version of Opera includes banner advertising, though it's
not really intrusive. It performs well, and supports most popular plugins.</p>
<p><br>
If you have 64meg or more, you might want to try one of the <a href="http://mozilla.org/releases">Mozilla</a>
based browsers. <a href="http://galeon.sourceforge.net/">Galeon</a> and
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> are two very good browsers based
on the Mozilla engine. Unlike Mozilla, Galeon and Firefox are web browsers only, making them significantly
more usable on slower machines, though they will still be slowish to start on an old machine.
They are exceptionally capable and stable, and support most plugins.</p>
<p>As for email, I like <a href="http://sylpheed.good-day.net/">Sylpheed</a>.
Sylpheed is <i>very</i> fast, and has a nice clear interface. It is also a
basic newsreader. There is also a related mail client named SylpheedClaws that
extends the capabilities of Sylpheed via the use of plugins and enables things
like HTML and so on.</p>
<p>If you'd like a more fully featured news client, so you
might want to try <a href="http://pan.rebelbase.com/">Pan</a>, a GTK news app.
capable of handling binary attachments.</p>
<p>I know there are several graphical <b>ftp</b> clients, and I did play
briefly with <a href="http://gftp.seul.org/">gFTP</a> (which ran fine), but I
can't really recommend anything else as I still prefer the command-line <b>ncftp.</b><br>
</p>

<h3><a name="Image_Viewers"></a>Image Viewers</h3>
<p>I use <a href="http://pantransit.reptiles.org/prog/#xli">xli</a>
 as my default image viewer. It's quick, and I like the
way I can directly scroll big images with the mouse; <a href="http://www.klografx.net/qiv/">qiv</a>
(Quick Image Viewer) is nice as well. For simple manipulations <a href="http://www.trilon.com/xv/xv.html">xv</a>
works well and requires little memory, though the interface is showing its age.</p>
<br>
<p></p>

<h3><a name="Music_and_Video"></a>Music and Video</h3>
<p>The hugely popular <a href="http://www.xmms.org/">XMMS</a> is a WinAmp clone that
can play mp3, ogg-vorbis, wav and cdr files etc. It also supports skins,
including WinAmp skins. As for video mpegs, I use <b>mtvp</b> as the default
player. It's a free player that's part of the <a href="http://www.mpegtv.com/">mtv</a>
package and works very well on lower end machines.  If you view lots of videos
in different formats, <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/">MPlayer</a> 
plays nearly all of them and is surprisingly quick on older boxes.
The officially supported version  is only available as source, though binary
packages are available as well. MPlayer can even make use of MS Windows dlls
to play Windows media files.</p>
<p>There are also plenty of graphical front ends around for <b>cd recording</b>
software. I have played around with the very popular<a href="http://www.xcdroast.org/">
xcdroast</a><b> , </b>but mainly I still use command line tools like cdrecord,
mpg123, bladeenc etc. Again, let me know if you have recommendations.<br>
</p>

<h3><a name="Office_Type_Stuff"></a>Office Type Stuff</h3>
<h3>Word Processing</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.abisource.com/">Abiword</a>
is GNOME's word processor, and is notable
for its speed and light memory usage. It is also lighter
on features than say OpenOffice-Writer or KWrite, but for some this simplicity may be appealing.
At present Abiword seems to be able to open the less complex MS-Word documents without problems, but
chokes on .doc files with complicated formatting.

</p><h3>TextMaker</h3>
<p>TextMaker is a commercial product, and while I haven't tried it personally, it does receive glowing reviews.
Both speed and .doc file compatibility are said to be very good, so this should be a good choice for older
hardware. If you think this sounds appealing, and you don't mind paying for software, this might be for you.
There is a 30 day trial version available from the <a href="http://www.softmaker.de/tml_en.htm">TextMaker website</a>.

</p><h3>Wordperfect</h3>
<p>The last available version (version 9, part of WordPerfect Office2000) was actually just the Windows version
running under a built-in version of Wine. While this version had a reputation for instability and other
problems, an older, Linux native version (Wordperfect8) still enjoys some popularity - some
still consider it as the best Linux word processor available. WP8 is stable, fast and
full featured, and light on memory usage. The Download Personal Edition is still available, though
its age dictates that some older libraries also need to be installed in order to get it working on
newer distros - more info <a href="http://www.tldp.org/FAQ/WordPerfect-Linux-FAQ/index.html">here</a>. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.koffice.org/kword">KWord</a>
is the KDE project's word processor, and it looks and works very well, however
it also has limited compatability with MS .doc files at present.</p>

<p> If  MSWord compatability is critical, you'll really have no
choice but to run <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a> or <a href="http://www.staroffice.com/">StarOffice</a>.
These suites are big and
extremely slow to load, though recent versions are much improved in this regard.
Even so, firing them up on a box with only 32megs of ram may take up to a minute...
Once loaded though, they are stable and run fine. They seem to be able to handle nearly any .doc
format file much better than any of the others, so even if you choose to use a
different word processor for your regular work, it may pay to install
Star/Open Office so you can open those difficult .doc files that your usual WP
has trouble with. </p>

<p>For those who don't require <i>any</i> MS Word compatability, <b>Netscape
(or Mozilla) Composer</b> can do a pretty good job of producing printed
documents. While it's not really a word processor, it can do tables, embed
images and links as well as spell check. Plus the html output is readable on
just about anything. Keep Composer in mind if you just want to write the
occasional letter without installing a full-blown WP program.</p>

<h3>Spreadsheets</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnumeric/">Gnumeric</a>
should probably be your first choice here; it's a mature app. that seems to handle Excel files
exceptionally well without hogging resources. <a href="http://www.koffice.org/kspread/">KSpread</a>
, like KWord, also runs well enough but doesn't completely work with Microsoft
formats just yet.</p>


<h3><a name="Performance"></a>Performance</h3>
<p>The table below shows the approximate startup times for some of the
software mentioned above. These times were measured on a 233 mHz AMD with
64meg of RAM and Linux 2.2, using the highly unscientific method of clicking
on the button and then counting the delay using the toolbar clock. Of course,
a calendar might be more appropriate for timing Star/Open Office...The figures
are obviously only rough approximations in view of the measurement technique,
but they do give a good indication of just how responsive an old Linux box can
be. <br>

<p><b>Screen Savers</b> are probably more of a nicety than a necessity.<a href="http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/">
Xscreensaver</a> works very well with lightweight window managers and is easy
to set up. It can run a randomly picked screensaver after a user-set period, and
continue to change it at pre-set intervals. Run <tt><font face="courier, courier new">xscreensaver-demo</font></tt>
to set the preferences, or see the man pages for more details. The easiest way
to start xscreensaver automatically at login is by adding the<tt><font face="courier, courier new">
xscreensaver &amp; </font></tt>command to your window manager's startup
script, eg. /usr/X11R6/bin/icewm.</p>
<p><b>Unnecessary Services</b> or daemons can slow your machine down and
lengthen bootup times. Default installations often run all sorts of servers
and other stuff that you don't need. As well as using resources, these things
can increase your security risk.<br>
