sourceXchange: Software-Development Model of the Future
</font>
</H3> 
<P>
More than just a job-posting or recruiting Web site, sourceXchange is
the industry's first vehicle to manage the open-source development
process that protects the interests of both corporate sponsors and
open-source developers.
<P>
The sourceXchange is a Web site that maintains a database of all
published project RFPs posted by corporate sponsors, registers
open-source developers and their teams, manages RFP responses from the
developer community, and manages payment.  It also will incorporate
peer review and project milestones to ensure quality and reliability of
each development project.
<P>
SourceXchange, an affiliate of O'Reilly &amp; Associates, was founded in
conjunction with HP, the founding sponsor. The two companies plan to
launch the service in early summer with an array of open-source
development projects from HP that expand its commitment to open-source
technologies.  Pending a successful beta launch in July, sourceXchange
will accept projects from other enterprise sponsors.

Cosource.com: another service to fund Open Source development
</font>
</H3> 
<P>
Redmond, WA -- Veriteam, Inc., today announced the launch of their 
web-based service, Cosource.com (
<A HREF=http://www.cosource.com>www.cosource.com</A>), which will 
enable users of Open Source Software to directly influence the 
development of Open Source Projects.
<P>
Cosource.com will launch the beta-testing phase of their service on 
June 1, 1999.  During the beta-testing phase, registered sponsors will 
nominate seed projects for development by Open Source developers, while 
programmers will register as potential developers of sponsored 
projects.  After the beta phase, Cosource.com will begin accepting 
sponsorships for specific projects from consumers of Open Source 
Software.
<P>
Cosource.com allows individuals to offer financial rewards to 
developers of Open Source Projects in exchange for creating software 
that meets the individuals' needs.  On the web site, a database records 
the specifications and initial sponsorship amount offered for a 
project.  After the initial sponsorship, other sponsors can easily add 
their sponsorship amounts to the project, thus increasing the bounty 
offered for the project.
<P>
Once a significant bounty has accrued, developers bid for the right to 
produce the software according to the specifications detailed by the 
project's sponsors.  The Staff at Cosource.com coordinate the interface 
between the sponsors and developers, making sure the needs of the 
sponsors are met and the developers are paid for their efforts.  
Sponsors make their payments via a secure credit card payment system, 
and the developer is paid with one check issued by Cosource.com.

CTiTEK replaced Windows NT with Linux on a client's webserver
</font>
</H3> 
<P>
Chesterfield, MO - May 18, 1999 - CTiTEK Inc.
<P>
"This is the fourth Linux installation in two months. Others consisted of
firewalls and Email servers.
<P>
An estimated $2,000 - $10,000 annual savings can be realized when switching to
a Linux server.  (Includes labor, hardware, and software savings).
<P> 
A Microsoft FrontPage error on an Email form was the last straw that caused
this conversion to Linux. 
<P>
Instead of consistent errors and copious amounts of time spent on Microsoft's
software undocumented 'issues', it was decided to rebuild the system into a
Linux machine.
<P>
It all started by using Windows NT with Option Pack 4 to run multiple web sites
one year ago.  The customer wanted to run several websites on one machine, so
Windows NT with Option Pack 4 was used. 
<P>
Today it became necessary to run an Email Form (an area on the website that one
can fill-in and the info is sent by email to someone in the company) on the
website, and FrontPage was used to keep everything in the MS 'family'.
Unfortunately the FrontPage Email Form did not work properly with the
webserver. After spending countless hours trying to solve the problem,
including several calls to Microsoft, we realized that the Windows NT Operating
system will have to be rebuilt with the latest version of the Management
Console (An uninstall and installation of the latest option pack did not work).  
<P>
We selected Linux because it is a robust, free Operating System (benchmark
tests with reputable magazines indicate a minimum 75% higher performance).
