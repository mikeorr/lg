<H4>Penguins in Brazil</H4>

<P> NPR had a story this month about the penguins arriving on the beaches in
Rio de Janeiro and other parts of Brazil.  Usually there are five or
so penguins, but this year there are hundreds of penguins who used to stick
around the Falklands/Malvinas Islands but have now migrated to Brazil.

<P> Scientists suspect maybe it's a long-term climactic change, and the 
cold ocean currents they follow to find their food may have shifted.

<P> Some Brazilians have adopted penguins as pets, but many don't know how
to care for them.  The penguins don't do well when the weather turns hot,
so some ppl put them in the freezer.  Unfortunately, this gives the
penguins hypothermia, because this variety is used to a temperate
environment.  One of Brazil's zoos is building a penguin rehabilitation
center for the penguins it has acquired and the ex-pets who have been
donated to it.  

<P> Can any readers in Brazil provide any more information?

<H4>Penguins in Australia</H4>

<P> In January, <I>Linux Journal</I> published a short 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxjournal.com/articles/culture/006.html">interview
article</A> about an oil spil near Australia's Phillip Island where fairy
penguins (aka little penguins, the kind that
<A HREF="../issue59/jones.html">bit Linus</A>) live, and how hackers
(including <I>LJ</I>) sent money to help rehabilitate the birds.  The article
describes how part of the rehabilitation included sweaters for the birds, made
apparently from socks.

<P> <A HREF="http://www.penguins.org.au/">http://www.penguins.org.au</A> has
pictures and whimsical drawings of penguins, and 
<A HREF="http://www.penguins.org.au/hightide/">panels from the High Tide comic
strip</A> featuring penguins.  The site features information about the Phillip
Island Nature Park.

<H4>Spam</H4>

The Spam of the Month award goes to the real estate company in Pakistan that 
offers programmers and sysadmins (certified in MCSE, Oracle, VB, e-commerce, 
etc.) for 240 hours per month for US$100.

<H4>WTO</H4>

<P> [Nov 30, 3:45pm] As I write, the N30 WTO II demonstrations have started in
downtown Seattle.  "Several hundred" protesters (600-800 according to the news)
are marching to Westlake Park from separate demonstrations on Capitol Hill and
the International District.  The most ingenious of their plans is a giant cake
they'll be presenting to Mayor Paul Schell and booster Pat Davis, to thank them
for bringing the WTO trade ministerial last year.... so they [the activists]
could expose what bastards they [the WTO] are.  In other matters, nine
Starbucks were hit yesterday and the day before....  Anyway, you'll know by the
time you read this whether news about N30 makes it outside the region.
