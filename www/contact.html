These are the contact addresses at the Linux Gazette. We'll be adding more
addresses as time goes on and the need for specific sub-headings becomes
apparent; feel free to contact us if you feel that there's a necessary
"department" missing.

proceeding further; involuntary chuckles may result. You have been warned,

<b>New issue notification</b><br>
<a href="mailto:lg-announce-request@lists.linuxgazette.net">lg-announce-request@lists.linuxgazette.net</a>
<br>
This is as close as you can get to "subscribing" to Linux Gazette (the
question that we're eternally answering for folks who don't understand how
webzines work. No, there's no print version - but feel free to email our
Editor-in-Chief, below, if you decide you want to produce one.) Send an
email to the above address, with the word "subscribe" as either the subject
or the body, and you will be added to the list of people who are notified
when we publish each issue. Tell your friends; have them tell two
friends... [ <b>recursion</b>, n. See {recursion}. ]
</p>

<p>
<b>Article submission</b><br>
<a href="mailto:articles@linuxgazette.net">articles@linuxgazette.net</a>
<br>
We are always on the lookout for good articles written by our readers. If
you have an interesting Linux experience to relate, a Linux-related topic
on which you're knowledgeable, or anything Linux (and preferably fun) that
you think may interest our readers, please check out our <a
href="faq/author.html">author submission guidelines</a> and send it to the
above address.

<p>
<b>NewsBytes</b><br>
<a href="mailto:bytes@linuxgazette.net">bytes@linuxgazette.net</a>
<br>
Summaries of Linux-related news. Please submit these in a plain-text
format; a one- or two-paragraph summary (as opposed to a large and rambling
press release) is strongly preferred; non-text submissions may be ignored,
or possibly stomped on, wadded up, tossed into the trash and set on
fire with extreme prejudice (maybe not, but why chance it?)
</p>

<p>
<b>LG Editor</b><br>
<a href="mailto:editor@linuxgazette.net">editor@linuxgazette.net</a>
<br>
Reader concerns, writing advice, ruthless redaction, and a skewed
sense of humor - with sailing, motorcycles, flying, and yoga thrown into
the mix for randomness. Witty repartee on alternate Tuesdays, deep
philosophy at odd moments, helpless dragons saved from ravening princesses
when occassion warrants, belly laughs at the Universe happily shared at any
time. Write at your own risk; results may be highly variable, and past
performance is <em><strong>not</strong></em> a guarantee of future behavior.
</p>

<p>
<b>The Answer Gang</b><br>
<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net">tag@lists.linuxgazette.net</a>
<br>
An irreverent bunch of wild-eyed Linux maniacs, who nevertheless manage to
come up with some terrific answers to a broad variety of Linux-related
(and, in the fully-extended meaning of the word, <i><b>other</b></i>) questions. Please
read the <a href="tag/ask-the-gang.html">Asking Questions of The Answer
Gang</a> guide, lest the daemons of RTFM and STFW devour your liver after
extracting it with a plastic fork (it hasn't happened yet, but you never
know...)
</p>

<p>
<b>Translators</b><br>
<a href="mailto:editor@linuxgazette.net">editor@linuxgazette.net</a>
<br>
The people who bring the Linux Gazette to the rest of the world <font
color="#FF0000">(thank you all!)</font> If you want to be one of the few,
the proud... that's right, the Marines are looking for a few good men.
However, if you know English as well as another language, and are looking
to get paid in the finest of Open Source coin - <b>respect</b> and
<b>recognition</b> of the Open Source community - then please join us. You
do not have to translate the entire issue, or even do it on any regular
schedule - anything you decide to contribute would be great. However, if
you're the first (senior) translator for your language, don't be surprised
if a bunch of people offer to help you in your effort.
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirrors</b><br>
<a href="mailto:mirrors@linuxgazette.net">mirrors@linuxgazette.net</a>
<br>
For those who would like to provide the Linux Gazette as a local
resource to their community, this is the address to ping when you want to
join the list, or have questions, concerns, issues... or just good wine,
fine music, interesting books, or other great stuff you're willing to
share. Bribes cheerfully accepted, midnight deals handled with suave
aplomb, tearful offers of eternal love and fealty considered, flames
(unless they're new and interesting) "/dev/null"ed, duels (my choice of
weapons) pre-accepted.
