&gt;  Another question: I've come across this after updating
&gt;  Debian testing: I seem to be loosing fonts, or at least
&gt;  the helvetica font I need for vncviewer and imagemagic:
&gt; 
&gt;  For example, "display image.jpg" gives me:
&gt; 
&gt; display: unable to load font
&gt; `-*-helvetica-medium-r-normal--12-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1'.
&gt; display: unable to load font
&gt; `-*-helvetica-medium-r-normal--12-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1'.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  And vncviewer gives me this:
&gt; 
&gt; $ vncviewer wherever:2
&gt; VNC server supports protocol version 3.7 (viewer 3.3)
&gt; Password:
&gt; VNC authentication succeeded
&gt; Desktop name "wherever:2 (myusername)"
&gt; Connected to VNC server, using protocol version 3.3
&gt; VNC server default format:
&gt; 16 bits per pixel.
&gt; Least significant byte first in each pixel.
&gt; True colour: max red 31 green 63 blue 31, shift red 11 green 5 blue 0
&gt; Warning: Cannot convert string
&gt; "-*-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-16-*-*-*-*-*-*-*" to type FontStruct
&gt; Warning: Unable to load any usable ISO8859 font
&gt; Warning: Unable to load any usable ISO8859 font
&gt; Warning: Missing charsets in String to FontSet conversion
&gt; Warning: Unable to load any usable fontset
&gt; Error: Aborting: no font found
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  I tried searching for explanations, and as far as
&gt;  I can tell I've got all the font packages installed.
</pre>

<p>
First, I'd suggest checking to see if you system agrees with you about
that.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
ben at Fenrir:~$ xlsfonts -fn "-*-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-16-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"
-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--16-116-100-100-p-0-iso10646-1

Mine certainly recognizes those patterns, and can match them from the
installed fonts (which is why, I suppose, I don't have that problem. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
If yours can't - and I suspect that this is what you'll find - then you
need to do a little investigative work to find out what's happening.
First, you'll need to find out what X considers your font directories:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
ben at Fenrir:~$ xset q|grep -i font
Font Path:
  /usr/share/fonts/X11/misc/,/usr/share/fonts/X11/100dpi/,/usr/share/fonts/X11/75dpi/,/usr/share/fonts/X11/cyrillic/,/usr/share/fonts/X11/TTF/epson/,/usr/share/fonts/X11/TTF/extra/,/usr/share/fonts/X11/TTF/freefont/,/usr/share/fonts/X11/TTF/openoffice/,/usr/share/fonts/X11/TTF/thryomanes/
</pre>
Lots of goodies, but those first three are the ones we really care about
- we can live without the others, but these are the base fonts for X.
They may be in a different place in your list; the important bits that
we're looking for are the 75dpi/100dpi/misc directories.
</p>

<p>
(If you don't get some similar output, you'll need to verify that your
'/etc/X11/xorg.conf' or '/etc/X11/XF86Config-4', whichever one you use,
contains at least those critical directories in the "Files" section, as
'FontPath   "/usr/share/fonts/X11/misc/"', etc.)
</p>

<p>
Now that you know where your fonts live, you need to check your font
listings in those directories. These are contained in per-directory
files called 'fonts.dir'. Here we go (note that you'll need to use
whatever <strong>your</strong> font directories were, since there are at least two
possible options):
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
ben at Fenrir:~$ grep -h -- -helvetica /usr/share/fonts/X11/100dpi/fonts.dir|head -5
helvB08-ISO8859-1.pcf.gz -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--11-80-100-100-p-60-iso8859-1
helvB08.pcf.gz -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--11-80-100-100-p-60-iso10646-1
helvB10-ISO8859-1.pcf.gz -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--14-100-100-100-p-82-iso8859-1
helvB10.pcf.gz -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--14-100-100-100-p-82-iso10646-1
helvB12-ISO8859-1.pcf.gz -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--17-120-100-100-p-92-iso8859-1
</pre>
If you don't get something similar to the above results, 'cd' into each
of those font directories in turn and verify that you have the
appropriate font files there (you can do a quick check against 'dlocate
xfonts-{75,100}dpi'). If you do, then run, as root, the 'mkfontdir'
command which will rebuild your 'fonts.dir' (it never hurts to do
this in case of doubt) and follow it up with 'xset fp rehash', which
will reread the font databases in the path.
</p>

That pretty much covers troubleshooting X fonts from one end to the
other. If this doesn't fix it, shoot your computer and bury it with a
stake through its CPU. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Thanks, I really appreciate your taking the time to put together this guide
 to the mysteries of X fonts. It helped a lot to reassure me that
my eyes weren't deceiving me over the last few days.
</p>

<p>
It seems Debian testing was just going through some font troubles,
and right enough, today everything is back to normal again after another
dist-upgrade and restarting X a second time.
So I guess it was a bit like a spot of bad font-weather.
</p>

<p>
Hope things went well with the hurricane and you managed to find
shelter for your boat.

Peter.

Oh, that one petered out - when it went over us, we didn't even get any
wind. We did, however, put out a large new anchor and chain just in
case. There's another storm, Florence, in the offing -

What's important is that your adoring fans do.
</p>

<p>
Really, there's no point in reading any of it. Did you actually think
that it's possible to understand all this Linux stuff? According to a
Large Unnamed Company based in Redmond WA, it's just way too complex for
the human mind, and only weird techno-freaks could ever get it. Who are
you going to believe, some wild-eyed fringe radicals or a reputable
company with billions of dollars? The choice is obvious. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
