#
# This script is used to set up a file containing information about
# the actual network environment. This can be esp. useful for a
# laptop being used in multiple environment: at home, in the office,
# at a customers site.
#
# This is done as follows: When "lilo" prompts, type e.g.
# linux netoff=
# This sets up an shell variable "netoff", containing nothing. The
# kernel starts the init process with "netoff" as part of its
# environment, so does init. So this script can check for
# "netoff". Placing assignments in a file is a convenient way to
# enable user processes to deal with multiple environments (login
# provides user processes with a complete new environment, so they do
# not longer know about "netoff").
#
# I took "netoff=" just for convenient typing. Of course you can use
# something like "PROFILE=34" and scan for that ...
#
# Right now I use this mechanism for setting up my .fvwm95rc and my
# printing environment. My .fvwm95rc is pre-compiled by means of the
# variable "PROFILE". This way I can use one source for different
# displays and so on.
#
# As is this script eventually tries to set up a plip connection by
# executing /etc/init.d/plip. To be able to do so, it must be called
# after "kerneld" is started ! (One example: S12kerneld, ...
# S30netstd_misc, S40netenv, ....)
#
# Another hint regarding pcmcia:   
# My Debian GNU/Linux 1.2 used to set up the PCMCIA-Ethernet-Card in
# /etc/pcmcia/network.opts. I changed this slightly by simply
# . /tmp/netenv
# This way the assignments in /tmp/netenv are passed to the calling
# script. You HAVE to reorder the calling sequence of scripts in
# /etc/rc2.d. Example:
# S10sysklogd S12kerneld S15netstd_init S18netbase S19netenv S19pcmcia
#
# The profiles I defined are as follows:
# 1x Tower Home, system name "nana", network plip only.
# 2x Desktop Office, system name "zaza", Ethernet.
# 3x Laptop, system name "lulu".
# 30 at home, no Ethernet, eventually connected to tower via plip
# 31 in the office
# 32 at customer site 1
# 33 at customer site 2
#-------------------------------------------------------------------
NETENV=/tmp/netenv	# When located in /tmp, script must be called
                        # AFTER wiping out /tmp has been done ...

if [ `uname -n` = "nana" ]; then
   (
   echo "# Networkenvironment: Home Tower (Network-Interface: Plip)"
   echo "export PROFILE=10"
   ) > $NETENV
