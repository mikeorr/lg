Doesn't everybody? I've worked really hard to make a svelte, sexy
representation of the Linux world, with nice ankles and a sultry voice.

Yep - those new laxatives are top-notch!

<p>
You know, I really like that lowercase "i". It indicates an absence of
egotism, a purity of heart, a generous soul; someone who considers the
relationship more important than just her own wants and needs. Or it
could just mean that your writing skills suck, and that you <strong>are</strong> a
money-grubbing scammer, exactly as the evidence overwhelmingly screams
you are. Perhaps I should toss a coin?
</p>

<p>
[Down, DOWN!!! Not TO you, you greedy little spammer monkey - it's just
an expression! Oh, dear. I think I've made my decision, and it's not a
favorable one.]

<p>
Madam, do I <em>know</em> you? Would you mind not standing so close, please?
You're <strong>breathing</strong> on me! For all I know, you may have (as a recent
email in my spambox said) "ill-health of Oesophageal adenocarcinoma or
gastric cancer with or without eradication of Helicobacter pylori
infection in chronic atrophic gastritis patients will be deadly." In
other words, back, you damned thing!
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Remember the distance does not matter what matters is the love we

<p>
Distance does indeed matter - not only are you trying to worm your way
into my personal space (and pocket); not only are you and all your kind
malodorous and offensive even <strong>before</strong> you get physically close: you are
a vile skankazoid leech, a flaming diseased pustule upon the body of the
Internet, and the more distance between us, the better I like it.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; i wait to hear from you soon.
</pre>

<p>
Give it a just a littlle longer, OK (e.g., 'while :; do sleep 1; done')?
Meanwhile, would you mind keeping your hands off that keyboard? Before
you "share the love that matters" with another 10,000 random email
addresses? Since, y'know, we share that love.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; kiss regards Miss Suzee
</pre>

<p>
Kiss my grits, Miss Suzee (a.k.a. Nigerian spammer named Kehinde or
Alaba or whatever.) And thanks for the entertainment!

Standard spammer tactic, somewhat like the Melissa virus: harvest
addresses and URLs from a given site, send mail "from" the harvested
URLs to the harvested addresses. The theory is that you're more likely
to open an email if it comes from a familiar domain.

You even managed to fit a one liner in there to keep it on topic.

<p>
That's like beating them off with a stick (LART?) whilst simultaneously
juggling bowling balls and chainsaws.

<p>
Well done! I say.
