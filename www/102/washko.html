<h1>Creating Animated Screenshots on Linux</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/washko.html">Daniel S Washko</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>Capturing screenshots has been an invaluable
tool for users of graphical environments for a long time. Utilities like
<strong>import</strong>, the Gimp's acquire screenshot, and those included with
one's preferred window manager or desktop environment enable
users to share screenshots of their desktop
and enhance tutorials by not just
writing about how to do something, but also providing images for
reference. </p>

<p>But how about taking this to the next level, and instead of merely
providing a static image, play a nice video clip which clearly demonstrates
the steps being explained? Such a screen recording would be an invaluable
complement to tutorials and demonstrations, and have many other practical
purposes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a quick search on Google reveals that the choice of screen
recording applications on Linux is pretty sparse.
 While other Operating Systems have a wide
array of commercial and shareware applications available for
screen recording, Linux seems to come up short. 
But two applications rise to the surface as outstanding
utilities to fit this niche: vncrec and vnc2swf. What makes these
utilities even more useful is that they take advantage of
Virtual Networking Computing, commonly called VNC.  VNC was developed by Olivetti Research
Laboratory (ORL) and has been a staple tool for system administrators 
everywhere. VNC's greatest benefit is its cross-platform capability.</p>

<p>VNC makes use of thin-client technology to create a session  
between a VNC server and VNC
client via an IP connection.  This session allows the VNC client to either 
take control of the VNC server, watch what is happening on 
the VNC server, or engage in a group view where any 
number of VNC clients connect to a VNC server.
Both the VNC server and client run on most modern operating systems.  
You can run the server on a Windows workstation and connect with the client running
on Linux.  Or, you can run the client on NetBSD and the server on Mac OSX.  
</p>

<p>This article assumes you know the basics of running both the vncviewer and vncserver.  For
 complete documentation on VNC consult the <a href="http://www.realvnc.com">Real VNC</a>
 website and documentation files included with VNC.</p>

<p>With vncrec and vnc2swf the capabilities of VNC are taken to
another level by allowing the recording of VNC sessions for
future use. This is one of the rare screen recording applications
that is not limited to capturing a single platform, as you
can easily record Windows, Linux, OS X, and Solaris sessions. Currently, though,
vncrec and vnc2swf only run on Linux, OS X, the BSD's, and other Unix based OS's.</p>


<h2>vncrec</h2>

<h3>Installation and Basics</h3>

<p>Vncrec was developed by Yoshiki Hayashi and released under the
GNU GPL. The source code is available at <a href=
"http://www.sodan.org/~penny/vncrec">www.sodan.org/~penny/vncrec</a>.
The current version is 0.2 and very stable. The
only requirement to compile vncrec is Xvnc which is included in 
the download of VNC from <a href="http://www.realvnc.com/">Real VNC</a>.
After fulfilling the requirement and unpacking the sources, vncrec 
is built issuing these commands in the <i>vncrec-0.2</i> directory:</p>

<pre>
	xmkmf
	make World
</pre>
       
After a successful compile vncrec will be ready for use in that
directory, or you can run <i>make install</i> as root to install
vncrec.</p>
 

<p>Vncrec is used to both record and play back a vncrec session. 
If you are familiar with vncviewer's (the VNC client
program) options you will notice that vncrec adds three more parameters for
recording and playback of vncrec sessions:

<ul>
<li>-record <i>filename</i></li>
<li>-play <i>filename</i></li>
<li>-movie <i>filename</i></li>
</ul>

Record does just that, it will record the VNC session and name it
whatever filename provided. Once you start a vncrec recording
session you can end the session in one of three ways: 1) Pressing
F8 and selecting exit, 2) Closing the vncviewer window, or 3) ctrl-c
in the terminal where vncrec was executed.</p>

<p>The play option will play back a recorded VNC session. 
Playback of a recorded VNC session is optimal if the playback is
done on the same machine that performed the recording. Many times 
 playback on other machines fails to produce a viewable
session. There tends to be extreme distortion, or just a black
screen.</p>

<p>Vncrec's third option: -movie will extract each frame of the
recorded session out to an .xpm file. Before you call this option it
is recommended that you do so in a separate directory dedicated for
these frame exports only.</p>

<p>To start recording a VNC session simply enter the following
command:

<pre>
	vncrec -record filename servername
</pre>

For example:

<pre>
	vncrec -record session1.vnc 192.168.0.130
</pre>

You will be prompted for the VNC server's password. After authentication
 you will connect to the VNC server much like
you would with vncviewer. When you are ready to terminate your
session press F8 which will produce the following menu:<br />

<img src="misc/washko/vnc_f8menu.png" width="220" height="233" alt="vncrec f8 menu graphic"><br />
Choose quit to exit the session and stop the
recording.</p>
 
<p>Now that you have captured your first session, enjoy the
playback:

<pre>
	vncrec -play session.vnc
</pre>

Your recorded session will now be played through vncrec.
If you watch the session all the way through it will
close upon completion.  To terminate the session before completion
 press ctrl-c in the terminal
you issued vncrec from (the F8 menu is not accessible during playback).</p>

<p>In addition, the homepage for <a href=
"http://www.sodan.org/~penny/vncrec">vncrec</a> and the README
included with the sources provides some other examples on how to
use vncrec. As always,
<i>vncrec -help</i> will produce the basic usage and outline
the accepted options.</p>

<p>There are a handful of different options you can pass to vncrec
just like you can pass to the regular vncviewer, such as 
depth, geometry, shared, and fullscreen. These options generally do
not produce the desired results when issued with vncrec. For
instance, you can try to specify a different geometry for vncrec to
use but it will drop back (or up) to the screen size run by the
server. The same will occur with depth. If you pass the fullscreen
option you will still get a screen size and a recording screen size
that equals the geometry of the server screen. If the geometry of
the server is smaller than that of the workstation you are running
the recording session from, the vncrec session will be centered on
the screen with the excess screen real estate forming a black
border around the session (which will not be recorded). Playback
using the fullscreen option will produce the expected results: Full
screen with a border should the recording geometry be smaller than
that your workstation's geometry.</p>

<p>There are some options that do make a difference. One of those
is the truecolour option. Particularly when connecting to other
operating systems that are using a "truecolour" screen depth
(usually 24 or 32 bit color depth), specifying truecolour can help
reduce any anomalies in the session. This is particularly pertinent 
 when recording sessions connected to Windows
workstations.</p>

<p>Both the vncviewer and vncrec support the viewonly options
where the client connects to the VNC server but only for viewing
purposes. There is no keyboard or mouse control passed between
the server and the client. The viewonly options would be practical 
to record a session where a third party is conducting a demonstration.</p>

<p>Vncrec cannot export the session to a video format like mpeg or avi. 
<a href="http://www.theorie.physik.uni-goettingen.de/~ostreich/transcode/">Transcode</a>
provides the necessary codecs for converting a vncrec session into
any other video codec supported by Transcode.</p>

<p>Vncrec does not record audio as VNC
does not support audio transfer. Users can work around this limitation
by employing Transcode to stream an audio track, created separately, into the
final video. </p>

<h3>Exporting vncrec Files</h3>

<p>This section will cover how to convert a vncrec session
to a video codec supported by transcode or mencoder. We will also
cover the -movie option of vncrec. To follow along with the
examples you will need a current version of <a href=
"http://www.theorie.physik.uni-goettingen.de/~ostreich/transcode/">Transcode</a>
(version 0.6.12 is the current stable as of this writing but any
version from 0.6.9 should work),<a href=
"http://www.mplayerhq.hu/homepage/design6/news.html">Mplayer</a>
(version 1.0pre3 is the latest), and a recent version of
<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a> (version
5.5.7 was installed on the testing workstation).</p>

<p>The greatest advantage of exporting the vncrec session to a
video codec is portability. This allows your recorded session
to be usable outside of the vncrec application and on
other workstations that run a video player supporting the codec
used to encode the vncrec session. Transcoding a vncrec
 session into a cross-platform viewable video
file requires that you have compiled transcode or installed a
binary package of transcode compiled with the necessary codecs
acceptable for use by the other operating system. Inquisitive
 readers are directed
to the <a href="">Transcode website</a> for more information.</p>

<p>There is a wonderful example of using transcode to encode a vncrec 
session into an avi file that was created by Tilmann Bitterberg and is
available from the <a href="http://www.sodan.org/~penny/vncrec/">vncrec website</a>.
This section will expand on that video and hopefully add some useful 
information.</p>

<p>The basic syntax for transcoding a vncrec session into an avi file is:

<pre>
	transcode -i session.vnc -g 800x600 -y xvid -o session.avi -k -z
</pre>

The -i switch designates the input file and -g declares the video stream frame size, which
in this case is 800x600.  Inclusion of the -g switch may be required depending on the
version of transcode you are using and how it was compiled.  Not declaring the 
video stream frame size may produce an error message like this:

<pre>
	[transcode] critical: static framebuffer allocation failed
</pre>

The -y switch declares the video export module, in this case xvid.  The output file, 
designated by -o, is session.avi.  The -k and -z switches are optional, but may be necessary
for proper output.  The -z switch will "flip video frame upside down," so if you 
your output video looks like a mirror image of what you are expecting, you need to pass
this switch.  -k will swap the red/blue in the video frame to produce more accurate
colors.</p>

<p>Transcode has more extensive features and will even allow you to include an 
audio channel in the final output.  Thus, one could include audio commentary or instruction 
to the video.  Curious readers 
are encouraged to visit the <a href="http://www.theorie.physik.uni-goettingen.de/~ostreich/transcode/">
transcode site</a> and documentation for more information.</p>

<p>If for some reason the playback of your transcoded session is not optimal, there
may be some artifacts or distortions along the bottom and left edges of the 
video.  You may want to try resizing the video during the transcode process.  
Standard video sizes follow an aspect ratio divisible by 32, 16, 8, 4, or 2.  Typical
sizes include 800x600, 640x480, 720x480, 480x260, 320x172, and 240x128.</p>

<p>Resize the vcnrec session with transcode  can be 
 accomplished using the -Z switch:
 
<pre>
	transcode -i session.vnc -g 800x600 -y xvid -Z 720x480 -o session.avi -k -z
</pre>

In this example the original 800x600 session is reduced to an avi file that is 
720x480.  There is more to the -Z switch, like the capability of augmenting 
the type of filtering.  Furthermore, there are other resizing switches one
may want to employ.  These switches are explained in the transcode man page.
</p>

<p>Remember that the resize value should be a factor of 32, 16, 8, 4, or 2.  Some of
the resize switches used by transcode require a strict ratio be applied.  Consult 
the <a href="http://www.theorie.physik.uni-goettingen.de/~ostreich/transcode/">
Transcode website</a> for in depth coverage and examples.</p>

<p>Finally, keep in mind that clarity of the video decreases proportionally with size. 
Transcoding an 800x600 vncrec session to a 240x128 sized .AVI file will produce 
a video that is next to impossible to watch, especially if there is text to be read.</p>

<p>Creating cross-platform compatible videos using transcode can be difficult.  In fact, 
the author and his colleagues had a problem doing this.  You must use a codec that 
is available on the target system[s].  If your video is made available as a 
download to the public, it may be difficult to guarantee that the recipient[s] will
have the necessary codecs installed.</p>

<p>Another quirk found with transcode is a tendency for 
the transcoding process to bail out before completing.  One particular problem is when 
the vncrec session involved browsing the Internet.  When the browser window 
changes in the vncrec session transcode exits without an error.  (This was tested 
on multiple machines with consistent results.)  A possible reason is that the 
workstations did not have enough memory and processor speed to handle 
what was required by transcode.  Transcoding a vncrec session of a browser using a 2ghz machine 
produced the desired results.  Interestingly, the sample video created by a 
transcoded vncrec session showed the creator using a web browser, albeit Netscape 2.1.</p>

<p>Successful conversion of a vncrec session does not depend on transcode alone.  If your 
vncrec session suffers from the drop out problem described above, you may 
want to give mencode a shot.</p>

<p>Vncrec has an option to dump out each frame from of the vncrec session to a .xpm file.  By using the 
-movie switch each frame will be dumped out in sequential order give an appropriate file name to 
maintain that order:

<pre>
	vncrec -movie session.vnc
</pre>

Before executing this command it is recommended you start in an empty directory, or 
alternately a directory created for the purpose of holding these files, as this 
command will most likely generate up to a few thousand files.</p>

<p>Once you have the vncrec session exported to individual frames you will 
convert these frames to a format mencoder can handle. (For the purposes of this article 
jpeg will be the format used.)  This is easily accomplished using mogrify (part 
of the ImageMagick suite):


<pre>
	mogrify -format jpg *.xpm
</pre>

Mogrify will convert each .xpm file to a .jpg file.  This can take some time
 depending on the number of files and the hardware
specifics of your workstation.</p>

<p>Once the conversion process is finished, use mencoder to 
sequentially encode them into the video format of choice:


<pre>
	mencoder \*.jpg -mf on:fps=8 -o session.mpg -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg1video
</pre>

The "-mf on:fps=8" tells mencoder to turn on the multiple files option and encode
at 8 frames per second all the jpg files in the same directory.  The output file, -o, 
will be session.mpg.  Mencoder will use the lavc (libavc codec) as the output video
codec (-ovc) and pass the lavc option (-lavcopts) to create a mpeg1 video.  Once the conversion 
process is finished, the resulting video should be playable on any media player capable 
of playing mpeg1 video.  Furthermore, the file size should be very small.</p>
</p>

<p>In summary, the vncrec utility makes it a snap to capture vnc sessions on any platform
the server is running on.  File sizes of the sessions tend to be small.    There is a tendency
for the recorded session to only playback on the machine it was recorded from.  Although 
there is no native export to standard video codecs, vncrec sessions 
can be encoded to a video using transcode. Additionally, individual frames can 
be exported from the session and later pulled together using mencoder.
</p>

<h2>vnc2swf</h2>

<p>The second screen recording utility examined can be considered a cousin to 
vncrec:  Vnc2swf.  Vnc2swf exports the screen recording to Flash format for playback, 
either embedded in a web page using a browser with the Macromedia Flash plug-in, or a 
standalone Flash player.</p>

<h3>Installation and Basics</h3>

<p>Vnc2swf, distributed under the GNU GPL, can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/vnc2swf/">http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/vnc2swf</a> 
and requires that you have the <a href="http://ming.sourceforge.net">Ming library</a> installed.  
The Ming library allows applications to export to the Flash format.  As of this writing 
the latest version of ming-0.3alpha2 will not work with the current version vnc2swf (version 0.3),   
Ming version 0.2a had no problems.  I strongly recommend starting with Ming 0.2a.</p>

<p>After extracting the Ming library, you may want to edit the Makefile and change some
parameters (like installation destination).  To compile simply:

<pre>
	make
	make install (root access required)
</pre>

There are more installation scenarios for Ming such as integrating with PHP and Python.  
Review the README file for more information.  The above provides the basic installation 
necessary for vnc2swf.</p>

<p>Compiling vnc2swf takes three steps:

<pre>
	./configure
	make
	make install (root access required)
</pre>

</p>

<p>Like vncrec, vnc2swf has similar command parameters to vncviewer, with some added 
options for recording the session.  Unlike vncrec you do not have to start 
recording the vnc session right away; you can start the recording via the F8 menu.  This 
also means you can stop a recording without closing the session and even pause, then 
resume the recording later on--two features not available in vncrec.  Another interesting 
feature is the ability to record a sound file in conjunction with the session.  Right 
now the mp3 format is supported and must be generated beforehand.  You can 
pipe in live miked audio, but this requires patching the Ming Libraries.  The
patch and directions are provided with the vnc2swf sources.  See the README
file for more information</p> 

<p>Execution of vnc2swf is as simple as vncrec.  For example:

<pre>
	vnc2swf -truecolour -startrecording sample.swf localhost:1
</pre>

This starts recording (-startrecording) a vnc session to the server running on 
localhost:1 using the truecolour parameter and outputting to sample.swf.  If we did not 
specify the startrecording parameter, then we would need to start the 
recording via the F8 menu, which is a bit different than that for vncrec:
<br />

<img src="misc/washko/vnc2swf_f8.png" width="247" height="342" alt="vnc2swf f8 menu graphic"><br />

The additional options are "Recording" (F9 is the hot key to toggle) which will allow you to start and stop the recording.  
When vnc2swf is recording this option will be highlighted.  In the image above, the session is 
not recording.  You can switch from the current color settings to 8bit color and  
back to original by toggling the "8 bit" option.  "Switch Recording Method" 
toggles between recording every image update immediately (default) to  record only one
image per update frame. The latter will reduce the size of the generated Flash file.  You can 
toggle the recording method using the F10 key.</p>

<p>Vnc2swf will allow you to loop in a pre-recorded mp3 file using the -soundfile option:

<pre>
	vnc2swf -soundfile music.mp3 sound_sample.swf localhost:1
</pre>

Notice that the -startrecording option was not used in this example.  This means that 
recording would have to be started in the vnc2swf session either by the F8 menu or pressing
F9.  The mp3 file is looped into the Flash output only when the vnc2swf session is 
recording.  Thus, the mp3 will start recording into the flash when recording starts on 
the vnc2swf session.  Furthermore, if you pause the recording, the mp3 recording will also 
pause.  Upon resuming the recording, the mp3 will continue from the point it was left off.</p>
 
 
<h2>Tips for Creating a Tutorial Session With an Audio Track</h2>

<p>Adding an audio track to a tutorial session can be a bit tricky.  Getting the audio to sync 
with the video is key for proper effect.  The best option is to follow the directions in the vnc2swf 
README file to patch the Ming library and allow live miked audio to be recorded by vnc2swf through a 
pipe.  But there are other methods to accomplish this task.</p>

<p>First and foremost, you should carefully plan your tutorial.  You may want to create 
some story boards and even script a dialog.  Adequate preparation is essential
for a polished product. </p>

<p>Once your script is complete you will record an audio session.  Most Linux distributions 
have some recording software installed.  Sox is a command line utility that will record 
audio in from your sound card to a .WAV file.  Both Gnome and KDE have recording applications. 
There are also a number of graphical programs like <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">
Audacity</a> and <a href="http://rezound.sourceforge.net/">ReZound</a> that are excellent choices.  
Use any one of these to create a .WAV file of your script.  Be careful not to rush through your 
script.  Leave pauses long enough to account for your actions and how long they may take to 
execute in the session.  It is also recommended to create a seperate 
count-down .WAV file (a recording counting down from 5 is adequate).</p>

<p>After creating a .WAV of your script use an encoder like Lame to convert the .WAV to an 
.MP3 file for use by vnc2swf.</p>

<p>The difficulty is in making sure the audio is synced with the video.  Since vnc2swf 
will not play the audio while recording the session, you will need to play the audio 
through another program while recording.  I.e.; the recommendation for two files.
Furthermore, creating the count down audio will provide enough time to start the recording.  You 
may want to reherse the process before recording using vncviewer instead of vnc2swf 
with the next few steps.</p>

<p>Open up two xterm sessions:  One to run the vnc2swf session and the other to play the 
scripted audio so you can follow along.  In the first xterm start your vnc2swf session without
the -startrecording option and make sure you specify the audio file with the -soundfile 
option:

<pre>
	vnc2swf -audiofile audio.mp3 session.swf :1
</pre>

In the second xterm set up to play the count down and .WAV version of the audio file.  You may 
also want to add a few extra buffer seconds to give you time to switch back to your vnc2swf session 
by using the sleep command:

<pre>
	sleep 5; play countdown.wav audio.wav
</pre>

At the end of the count down press the F9 key to start the recording and follow the 
directions of your audio script.  Upon completion press the F9 key to stop 
the recording and then exit vnc2swf.  Play the Flash session back in a web 
browser or through gflashplayer.</p>

<p>If you stop recording the vnc2swf session, but do not exit, this will pause the audio
recording.  Resuming the recording will continue to record the audio into the session from
where it was left off.  Should your tutorial contain needless filler like internet downloads or 
program compiles, you can break the audio file you are following up into parts and repeat 
the above steps toggling the F9 key to pause each part until the filler completes.</p>

<p>Getting the audio and video to sync can be a tricky process.  You may need to repeate 
the vnc2swf recording process above a few times until you get the hang of it.</p>

 
<h2>Embedding Vnc2swf Sessions in a Web Page</h2>
<p>Once your Flash recording has been created you should embed the Flash 
in some HTML code, specifying the height and width value of the Flash file.  Failure to do 
so will result in distorted playback.  Here is sample code:
 
<pre>
	&lt;embed src="sample.swf" width="800" height="600" loop="false" quality="high" 
	pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" 
	type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;
</pre>

This code should work without a problem on Mozilla-based browsers.  For Internet 
Explorer you will need to make use of the &lt;object&gt; tag.  Notice that the 
width and height values of the Flash file are specified.  Also, the loop="false" will prevent
your Flash from looping continuously.  You can also specify a numeric value to have the 
Flash loop "x" number of times.  For more information on embedding a Flash file in a 
web page check out <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/flash/ts/documents/tn4150.html">Macromedia's
Technote on Object and Embed Tag Syntax</a>.

The vnc2swf session can be played in a standalone Flash player (i.e.; <a href="http://macromedia.mplug.org/">
gflashplayer</a>).  Playback will suffer the same distortions as when played
in a web browser without embedding the Flash in HTML and specifying the height 
and width, unless you specify playing at 100%.  The 100% option is available under the View 
menu.

<p>Hopefully this overview of VNC recording utilities has sparked some interest
in playing with these tools and putting them to practical application.  This article has 
only scratched the surface, the rest is up to your exploration.  For instance, you can record 
real-time audio with vnc2swf, but this requires patching Ming (hint:  see the 
vnc2swf README file).  You can also add audio to transcoded vncrec sessions for which one 
is directed to the transcode documentation.  As always, have fun.</p>
