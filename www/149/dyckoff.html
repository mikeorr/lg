<h1>Away Mission: About IdMgt, Higgins, RSA, Catalyst, and ITxpo</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>


<p>
Lately, there have been a lot of conferences focusing on the role of
digital identity and the role of Identity Management [IdMgt or IdM]
technology. This is a strong indicator of the level of interest by a
broad group of stakeholders: government, enterprise IT, SaaS and
mobility service providers, security firms, Internet merchants and Web
2.0 site operators, privacy advocates, and large user communities.
</p>

<p>
The issues are still being scoped - but innovative and potentially
disruptive technical solutions are already being developed by startups and
niche players, and you'd need a scorecard to sort out the players and the
issues.  Opportunities for doing just that abound at conferences and
interop events such as the annual RSA conference, the annual Digital ID
conference, IT and government security events, and events put on by ACM and
USENIX among others, and the pundit platforms provided by the Gartner Group
and the Burton Group.
</p>

<p>

What we learn at these events is that under the newly enhanced regulatory
environment, identity policy, provisioning, management, and lifecycle are
critical for both security needs on the one hand and also for meeting legal
and compliance requirements on the other. Government and industry alike
know they have to address these points, but the ink hasn't dried on the
standards or the expectations. Figuring out what to do is at least as
important as how, but both areas are still being defined so there's a place
for both the technical conferences addressed at implementers, and the
conferences focusing on governance and management. Bring on the pundits,
please.

</p>

<p>
It's also hard to ignore the David and Goliath comparisons. But maybe
that's why you're reading this Away Mission. OK, let's get to it.

<h3>Higgins and OpenID</h3>

<p>
The complexities of Digital ID management have been the focus of many IT
and security technology conferences over the past year. All have had to
touch on ID federation and the relations between ID providers, ID
authenticators and those relying on this information in digital
transactions. All the major conferences have paid attention to the
demands of user-centric ID mechanisms that afford a large measure of
selection and control to the persons represented by these digital IDs.
</p>

<p>
Two trends have clearly emerged in the last year. First, user-centric ID is
better understood and better supported by Web businesses, as shown by the
acceptance of OpenID and other user-centric ID management technologies.
Second, the Higgins framework for digital ID Federation and
interoperability has also gained significant mind share and support and is
now used in several shipping products.
</p>

<p>
OpenID has had a lot interoperability wins this last year and some
10,000 Web sites now allow login via OpenID. Although OpenID has many
options, usually a URL associated with the user is accepted as an
identity credential. Typically, this is a person's blog address. If a
person blogs on multiple subjects, each URL is relevant to its
particular subject.
</p>

<p>
Identity guru Kim Cameron said this about OpenID: <quote>"OpenID gives
us common identifiers for public personas that we can use across multiple
Web sites - and a way to prove that we really own them."</quote> Cameron
goes on to call this a huge win compared with random screen names and a
hodge-podge of passwords. 
</p>

<p>
OpenID 'news' is discussed further in the RSA section below.
</p>

<p>
Higgins, which began in 2003 and became an Eclipse incubator project in
2004, released its 1.0 version in February. Products from Serena and
Novell (Bandit) now use Higgins code and abstractions and a larger
community of developers is coalescing around it. Why? Because it
provides a lot of needed functionality for transactions between ID
providers and ID consumers and because of its broad, agnostic any-to-any
approach.
</p>

<p>
Higgins has support for straight SAML protocols and also the SOA
supported WS-Trust protocols. Higgins has plugins written in both C++
and Java, and Higgins supports the InfoCard concepts derived from (but
not limited to) Microsoft's CardSpace. In short, Higgins is the right
intermediary framework for this IdMgt epoch.
</p>

<p>
Higgins is currently in use by ALF, CloudTripper.org and the Community
Dictionary Service. The Novell DigitalMe product is over 90%
Higgins-based.
</p>


<p>
The Higgins community is also working on notation for graphing ID
relationships and correlations of the same person, something very
important to usefulness of social and business networks. Higgins borrows
here from Semantic Technology, using descriptive tuples in a manner like
RDF and OWL. This is currently called Higgins OWL or H-OWL. Discussions on
this and the data model should appear here:
</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Higgins_Data_Model">http://wiki.eclipse.org/Higgins_Data_Model</a></p>

<p>
The Higgins Project will be demonstrating Release 1.0 at the
user-centric identity interoperability event at RSA2008. The last major
use interop event in the US took place at the June 2007 Burton Catalst
conference.
</p>

<p>
IBM, Novell, Parity and other vendors will all be showing interoperable
applications based on the Higgins framework. This event will
feature interoperability between identity providers, card selectors,
browsers and Web sites. When users 'click-in' to sites via managed
information cards, or i-cards, components from Open ID, Higgins Identity
Framework, Microsoft CardSpace, SAML, WS-Trust, Kerberos and X.509 will
hopefully interoperate within an identity layer built from both
open-source and commercial components. Card selectors can be embedded in
Mozilla browsers, or based on the GTK/Cocoa selector for BSD and Linux.
</p>

<p>
The less ambitious demo in 2007 worked well after all the servers
were up and initialized.
</p>

<p>
The Burton Catalyst conference, reviewed below, analyzed emerging trends
in IdMgt and heavily featured user-centric ID solutions like OpenID and
Higgins. With Higgin's leap from incubator status to production
software, it will a lot more pervasive.
</p>

<h3><a name="rsa-section">Do you know the way to RSA?</a></h3>

<p>
The Goliath conference in the security realm would be the RSA
conference. This Godfather of the modern security conference was
originally a specialty conference for cryptographers and mathematicians
17 years back. Now, the conference is broadly focused on security issues
and security products, and features big tech company CEO keynotes along
with occasional keynotes by researchers and a huge vendor expo. For a
while, the RSA conference was held in San Jose, but more recently has
been resident in San Francisco.
</p>

<p>
I recall attending when it was an insider's conference, a kind of united
white hats parley to discuss cutting edge research. When enterprises
realized that multiple layers of security were <i>de rigueur, </i>
the big dollars started to be made in security, and the RSA conference
became a necessary venue for security firms and the big software houses.
Then they were bought by EMC, which broadened the conference to include
secure storage. They still call the big conference party "The
Cryptographers Ball" and host a separate researchers track that requires
serious credentials to join.
</p>

<p>
The company behind the initials - and the crypto algorithm that also
bears the same initials - has stood for cryptographically secure products
for the same time period. Arguably, the RSA algorithm, now in the public
domain, has been instrumental in allowing allowing secure Web traffic
and internet commerce to occur. (The initials stand for Ron Rivest, Adi
Shamir and Len Adleman, who invented the RSA algorithm in 1977
(RIVE78)).
</p>

<p>
This is where a lot of security products - and partnerships - get
announced and where the big companies try to explain initiatives they
are only just starting. In 2007, attendess heard from Intel, Cisco and
Oracle, as well as EMC. Futurist Ray Kurzweil gave the closing keynote
on technological progress and evolution. For the RSA 2008 conference,
there will be speakers from CA, IBM, Microsoft, and smaller ISVs
like TippingPoint and Websense. There will also be a special keynote by
Al Gore on "Emerging Green Technologies" on April 11th. Here's a list of
all the RSA 2008 keynotes:
<a title="http://www.rsaconference.com/2008/US/Conference_Program/Keynote_Speakers.aspx" href="http://www.rsaconference.com/2008/US/Conference_Program/Keynote_Speakers.aspx">http://www.rsaconference.com/2008/US/Conference_Program/Keynote_Speakers.aspx</a>
</p>

<p>
All the keynote presentations from RSA 2007 are available here:
<a title="http://media.omediaweb.com/rsa2007/index.htm" href="http://media.omediaweb.com/rsa2007/index.htm">http://media.omediaweb.com/rsa2007/index.htm</a>
</p>

<p>
One of the most far-reaching announcements at RSA 2007 was Bill Gates's
keynote, where he said that Microsoft would support and collaborate with
the OpenID project. This led to Microsoft, IBM, Google, Yahoo, and
Verisign joining the OpenID Foundation as corporate board members this
past February. The OpenID Foundation was formed in June 2007 to support
and promote the technology developed by the OpenID community.
</p>

<p>
OpenID enables individuals to convert one of their already existing
digital identifiers -- such as their personal blog's URL -- into an
OpenID account, which then can be used as a login at any Web site
supporting OpenID.
</p>

<p>
Most of the content for RSA 2007 is accessible only with the conference
CD. However, a very nice selection of "Expert Tracks" were videoed and
are available publicly online. I would recommend the sessions on ID
federation and also session 202 - "Deeper Injections: Command Injection
Attacks Beyond SQL". Find that material here:
<a title="http://media.omediaweb.com/rsa2007/tracks/index.htm" href="http://media.omediaweb.com/rsa2007/tracks/index.htm">http://media.omediaweb.com/rsa2007/tracks/index.htm</a>
</p>

<p>
Another item available on the Web is Pat Peterson's presentation on
"Deconstructing a 20-billion Message Spam Attack" from 100,000 zombie
bots. (Patrick Peterson is Vice President of Technology at IronPort
Systems.) That's available here:

</p>

<p>
Although an Expo/Keynote pass to RSA 2008 is not free, many participating
vendors email discount codes for free expo admission. You can contact the
ones you are familiar with or, if you have contact with Applied Identity,
or would like to, use code <b>EXP08APP</b> before April 4, 2008.

<h3>Gartner and Burton IT Conferences</h3>
</a>

<p>
Gartner is subscribed to by almost all of the Fortune 1000. It bought
out META Group a couple of years back, and the Cambridge Group as well as
other small fish in the consulting business. It's the 800-pound, or maybe
8000-pound, consultancy. Its researchers maintain over 20 distinct advisory
services and each of those holds annual conferences. If your company
subscribes to Gartner services, some annointed co-workers get to go to some
of these. It's also hard to ignore Gartner pronouncements, especially since
they have the ear of many C-Level executives.</p>

<p>
Gartner does a lot of research so it's wise to pay attention. Gartner,
and its competitors, are good at spotting and analyzing industry trends
early. They tend to follow the major vendors in each sector closely, and
may ignore an upstart, particularly in the open source arena, due to this
focus. However, Gartner also tries to link in their other services and
there is a bit of cross-selling going on.
</p>

<p>
The major challengers to Gartner are the Burton Group and Forrester
Research. Both offer significant access to webinars and white papers
on-line, a substantial number of these for free. The Burton Catalyst
conference is aimed at IT innovators and bleeding edge adopters, as well as
those trying to gauge the velocity of change. The purpose of the conference
is to make sense of leading IT issues and trends both individually and as a
group, and this conference - unlike the more narrow focus of the Gartner
events - often draws experts from all of their research services, and high
value guests from outside institutions and communities. Many of the key
Burton presenters blog regularly on their research areas and also use
reader comments to prepare the prepare for upcoming events.
</p>

<p>
I like both events but I have to express a preference for the size, the
mix, and the medley of Burton Catalyst. Because the events are smaller,
it's easier to find people interested in networking; and because of the
interlinking, one gets more of a 3D view of issues and architectural
approaches. Bottom line: I feel like I learned and understood more at
the end of the Catalyst Conference than after a Gartner Group IT
Security conference in 2007.
</p>

<p>
Having said that, I note that both organizations make getting
the conference materials difficult if your company does not subscribe to
a consulting service. Burton was better here, with most materials going
up 2-3 weeks after the conference for a download window of about 6
weeks. I had trouble for the 2006 Catalyst Conference since the
materials were unavailable for the first 10 days after the conference
and I checked back about 60 days afterward, only to find out the download
window had closed. (They did provide some individual presentations on
request.) Communications from Burton was much better in 2007 and it was
easier to know when the window would open and close. Burton also
provided live downloads during the conference but most of the last
day's presentations were not available on that day. No conference CD was
available, but some vendors provided USB drives. All that was
required was a conference login, with an online option for forgotten
passwords.
</p>

<p>
Gartner, in contrast, did provide a conference CD, but many of the
sessions were either missing or had only a short text outline. The missing
or incomplete presentations were not available during the conference.
Getting the materials afterward required the conference CD and a Gartner
account key, which attendees did get but had to be hunted for. I think
Gartner should have kept conference attendees better informed about the
availability of late posted presentations, but I also know that this is a
general problem for IT, developer, and other technical conferences. Since
both Gartner and Burton are in the business of selling their research, the
extra barriers are understandable but can more than a little annoying.
</p>

<p>
On the swag and party level, Burton also wins but only by a nose.
Gartner gave attendees a real day backpack with a pocket for laptops while
Burton handed out small padded zipper bags that are great for slipping
inside other bags (like the Gartner bag).That's a point for GGrp. And
Gartner had a real vendor expo, which partly conflicted with the schedule
of presentations. Burton Catalyst has a tradition of evening vendor soirees
along two corridors of hotel ballrooms and meeting rooms.  Every room has a
theme or game and each has either food or drink or both plus marketing
swag. Some contests included iPods or LCD TVs; for example SAP gave out 2
GB USB jump drives for asking technical questions about their IdMgt
products. But the major point here is that the vendor presentations were
evening affairs, outside of conference hours, and easily accessible. (One
vendor couldn't get the space needed one night, so their event was held
directly across the street and started half and hour before the other
events - see, very easy.)
</p>

<h3>GG and BG summaries....</h3>
<p>
The main thrust of the 2007 GGrp IT Xpo was the need to innovate and
provide greater value for the enterprise. This meant assembling a
creative mix of available technologies and allowing individual
workgroups and departments to experiment. Corporate attitudes toward
consumer tech entering the enterprise must shift from "unavoidable
nuisance" to "opportunity for additional innovation". It also means
rethinking the IT Fortress mentality. One of the key ways to
achieving this more open state is to begin to use ID provisioning, ID
federation, and ID management.
</p>

<p>
<quote>"Most IT organizations simply cannot deliver new value, new processes,
new markets, and new channels because their DNA is fundamentally about
control, which is the opposite of what you need for innovation and
growth,"</quote> said Jennifer Beck, group vice president at Gartner.
</p>

<p>
Gartner also said that about 30 percent of IT funding is not going to
centralized functions, but into the business units, such as sales and
marketing, for their own research and development. In June of 2007,
Jackie Fenn, vice president and Gartner fellow, said, <quote>"By embracing and
leveraging employee experimentation and experience with consumer
technologies, enterprises can enjoy a significant addition to the
resources they can apply to evaluating innovation."</quote>
</p>

<p>
A recent Gartner survey found that most organizations have work underway
to develop a strategy for Web 2.0, but few are prepared for, or executing
on that strategy. Gartner predicted that by year-end 2007, about 30
percent of large companies will have some form of Web-2.0-enabled
business initiative under way.
</p>

<p>
The internal challenge for companies experimenting with Web 2.0 is
characterized by inbound risks, such as malicious code in RSS feeds, and
outbound risks, such as information leakage through inappropriate
blogging or use of collaboration tools. The external challenge is threats
generated by enterprise usage and participation in Web 2.0 technologies,
such as use of third-party content (mashups) and engaging in open user
communities.
</p>

<p>
At Burton Catalyst, I kept mostly to the IdMgt and Security tracks,
which occassionally conflicted. There were other tracks on Networks,
SOA, Computer OSes, and Data Center Operations. One of the key takeaways
was that current IdM products actually reinforce the traditions of
centralized control to achieve provisioning, federation, and
de-provisioning. This counters and undermines distributed processing,
departmental independence, user-centricism, etc., and also runs counter
to the Web 2.0 trend.
</p>

<p>
Although a lot was said about ID management and federation, about
credentials and role-based security, a Feb 15 entry at
<a href="identityblog.burton.com">identityblog.burton.com</a> by analyst Gerry Gebel provides a good summary
of how Burton understands the current era:
</p>

<p>
<quote>"Technologies like federation help us make incremental advancements
beyond the command and control approach. If we permit authentication to
occur outside our domain and project this information through a
federation exchange, that's a sign of progress. However, federation
products, as they are currently constructed, still require considerable
coordination between parties in order to establish the connection: we
focused on this issue at Catalyst last year.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote>"So, it was interesting to see the recent video sparring between <a
href="http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/entry/sun_versus_ping_an_epic">Sun</a>
and <a
href="http://blog.pingidentity.com/blog/default/2008/01/29/Ping-Strikes-Back">Ping
Identity</a> regarding what they've done to address this from a technology
perspective. To follow up, we recorded a podcast this week with Sun, Ping
Identity, and Covisint - which will be available soon on the <a
href="http://inflectionpoint.burtongroup.com/ip/2008/03/burton-group-te.html">podcast
site</a> .</quote>  
</p>


<p>
<quote>"More incremental change is what we can expect in the near term until
different identity business models emerge. Similarly, the introduction
of OpenID and information card systems purport to change the dynamic by
providing more user control over identity data, but this is in name only
- business still determine what attributes are required to complete an
e-commerce transaction and the user can select an information card that
matches the business' criteria. Real change happens when third party
identity agencies and intermediaries proliferate and are utilized by
Internet properties. Identity oracles, as described here, are examples
of intermediaries that are beginning to appear in the marketplace."</quote>
