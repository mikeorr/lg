Hello Ben and all,
</p>

<p>
I am now using icewm with idesk (Version: 0.7.5-4). My combination still 
missing the wallpaper. Everytime idesk reports
</p>

<pre>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[idesk] Background's file not found.
[idesk] Background's source not found.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</pre>

<p>
Though I have the proper path set there
</p>

<pre>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Background.Delay: 1
  Background.Source: /home/joy/pics/Father
  Background.File: /home/joy/pics/Father/love.jpg
  Background.Mode: Center
  Background.Color: #FFFFFF 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</pre>

<p>
I have even checked those image in kde and the image folder as the source of 
slideshow in kde. Everything running well. Don't know why idesk gives the 
error. Background color is blue which is provided by icewm !!!
</p>

<p>
Any clue ?
</p>

<p>
Thanks
</p>

Well, you've done two conflicting things here: you've told idesk to use
a directory for a random image (and to flip that image every minute) and
you've told it to use a fixed image, too. You should probably pick one
of the two, although idesk probably has a standard way of choosing one.
</p>

<p>
Since the background color is coming from IceWM, I suspect that idesk's
background is being overwritten by the window manager - a common
occurrence, actually, according to the idesk documentation. From
/usr/share/idesk/dot.xsession:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
# sample .xsession file
 
# start idesk (we need the sleep because fluxbox will overpaint the
# idesk with the rootCommand
(sleep 2; idesk &amp;) &amp;
 
# start fluxbox
exec fluxbox
exit $?
</pre>

<p>
I suspect that the way you're starting these two leads to exactly that
problem - and I suggest you resolve it as shown above (assuming you're
using ~/.xsession or ~/.xinitrc.) If you're not, then you can start it
in just the way I described it in a 2-cent tip here a couple of days
ago: put a line that says 'idesk &amp;' in your ~/.icewm/startup file and
make sure that it's executable. You might, just for safety's sake, try
'(sleep 2; idesk &amp;) &amp;' instead of just 'idesk &amp;'; this will result in a
2-second delay before idesk starts up, but it will ensure the order in
which IceWM and idesk run.
