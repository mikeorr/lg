<h1>Away Mission - Upcoming in November '09</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>

<p>
It's nearly time to retire 2009, yet many conferences for the Linux and
open source community are just about to happen. A plethora will happen
in the first week of November, so this preview may give you ideas for
2010.
</p>

<p>
Here's a short list of what's on offer:

</dl>


<p>
As you may know, the <strong>End User Summit</strong> organized by the
Linux Foundation is by invitation only.  The event is closed to the
press, as was the first summit, in 2008.  The Summit is primarily an
opportunity for big corporate end-users to meet with leaders from within
the Linux community, including the highest-level maintainers and
developers. The event was originally created at the request of the Linux
Foundation's Technical Advisory Board.  
</p>

<p>
The Summit will take place November 9-10, 2009, at the Hyatt Jersey City on
the Hudson. Its location, just off the Exchange Place PATH Station, will
give corporate Linux users quick access from East Coast hubs.
</p>

<p>
There will be sessions on open source legal fronts, Linux and the
challenges of a down economy, tracing and performance management,
scaling Linux to 4096 processors, and other technical sessions. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>LISA '09</strong>, the annual sysadmin conference organized
by USENIX, starts the month off in Baltimore.  Locals in the
Baltimore-DC area can get the new LISA Evening Pass. This allows access
after work for conference receptions, the Vendor Exhibition on Wednesday
only, the popular Birds of a Feather sessions (BoFs), and more.  
</p>

<p>
There will be sessions on cfEngine, VMware vSphere 4.0, and
zero-emission data centers.  Cutting-edge practices and new or developing
work are presented in the paper presentations and the poster sessions.
Check out the list of accepted posters at
<a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa09/posters.html">http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa09/posters.html</a>. Also, all registered
LISA '09 attendees are eligible to received a Google Wave Sandbox
invitation.
</p>

<p>

<p>
<strong>ApacheCon '09</strong> will be held in Oakland, CA; this year is
also the 10th anniversary of the Apache Foundation. The venue is the
Marriott City Center Hotel (and that's a very safe location).  Last year,
it was held in New Orleans.  
</p>

<p>
The first 2 days include half-day tutorials.  There are also several
free events paralleling the conference tutorial days, including the
Hackathon and the BarCamps. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Apache Hackathon</strong> is held over the two days prior to the
main three-day conference, November 2-3, and everyone can join in this
free codefest event.  Coinciding with the traditional Hackathon,
<strong>BarCampApache</strong> is open to the public, and the schedule
will be determined by the participants.  Topics at BarCampApache need
not be Apache-specific.  
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
There will be several BoFs or MeetUps at ApacheCon '09, and the current
list is here: <a href="http://www.us.apachecon.com/c/acus2009/schedule/meetups/">http://www.us.apachecon.com/c/acus2009/schedule/meetups/</a>
</p>

</p>


<p>
The theme for <strong>Enterprise 2.0</strong> San Francisco is
"unlocking the business value of Enterprise 2.0", with an emphasis on
how real customers are using enterprise 2.0 social media to enable a
more efficient, agile, and highly productive workforce.  
</p>

<p>
Conference topics include, among others: 
</p>

<ul>
<li>Social Networking in Business 
<li>Social Networks as New Media 
<li>Social Messaging &amp; Twitter 
<li>Enterprise Mash-ups 
<li>Enterprise Software 
<li>Enterprise RSS &amp; Syndication 
</ul>

<p>
Since this is a new conference, you might want to take a quick look at
the keynotes from June's Enterprise 2.0 conference in Boston:
<a href="http://www.e2conf.com/e2tv/">http://www.e2conf.com/e2tv/</a>
</p>

<p>
Enterprise 2.0 San Francisco is held jointly with VoiceCon, at the
Moscone Center this year.  Registration for one event allows access to
the other.
</p>


<p>
<strong>QCon SF</strong>. This is the third annual San Francisco
incarnation of the enterprise software development conference, and its
focus is on developer team leads, architects and agile project
management.  This is primarily an open source conference, and has
separate Ruby and Java tracks.  
</p>

<p>
Organized jointly by the JAOO conference and the InfoQ.com Enterprise
Software Development Community (original creators of TheServerSide.com
and Symposium conferences), QCon is "...organized by the community, for
the community."
</p>

<p>
One unique aspect of QCon is its Euro-centric origins.  Many - but not
most - of the speakers are leading developers and architects from
Europe, and QCon is a great opportunity to meet peers from across the
Atlantic without a passport and plane ticket.  The global prospective is
refreshing, and there is no overbearing presence of giant software
vendors.  All content, no spin.
</p>

<p>
QCon speakers include Martin Fowler, Amazon.com CTO Werner Vogels,
Spring creator Rod Johnson, Hibernate creator Gavin King, Scrum
co-founder Jeff Sutherland, LINQ inventor Erik Meijer, JRuby core
developer Ola Bini, and others.
</p>

yourself: <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/archives/">http://qcon.infoq.com/archives/</a>

<p>
Happy Thanksgiving, and a Happy New Year to all!
