<p><strong>Hi,I'm Dodo.I'm just finishing a course of computer operations and I
would like to know about phreak,hacking...
Can you tell me about it ???
Tips or news ???
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks...
</strong></p>

>My first thought is that this is some sort of troll
(message intended to generate flames --- often forged
to appear from an unsuspecting party so as to harass
the apparent sender).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>That doesn't make sense in this case since getting 
one flame from "The Answer Guy" is hardly worth
the trouble.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>There for I have to assume that you have chosen an 
unusually apt handle for yourself.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>So, you're finishing a course in computer operations.
That's nice and productive.  You should also considering
taking a course in basic composition and grammar.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>(Hints:  commas and periods are normally followed by
spaces; question marks normally are used in sequences
of one (the "triple question mark" is for emphasis); 
and you finish courses that are "in" or "on" topics, 
not "of" them).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Normally I don't flame people on their spelling
grammar, or punctuation.  However, there doesn't
seem to be much else to say to you.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>You want to know about phreaking and "hacking."  
The first think to know about phreaking (the study
of practical phone fraud techniques) is that use of
most of the techniques used by phreaks is illegal
in just about any jurisdiction.  In many places you
can a) go to jail and b) insure that you can never
work in the computer industry again by getting 
convicted of crimes involving telephone and computer
fraud.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The term "hacking" as applied to techniques for 
bypassing system security and gaining unauthorized
access (or privileges on) them is highly controversial.
It is accepted practice among computer <EM>enthusiasts</EM>
to use the term "cracking" to discuss those activities
and "hacking" to discuss the lawful and legitimate 
pursuit of their hobby.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>In this latter sense we call Linus, Alan Cox, and
others "Kernel hackers."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The media prefers to use the term "hacker" in the
former sense.  This is one of many reasons that 
"hackers" and "crackers" alike tend to be disgusted
by the media.  (As a regular contributor to LG
I'm considered by some to be in "the media" and thus
worthy of suspicion and disgust.  Others have other
opinions --- some of those are even less complimentary).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>I personally find the whole "phreak mystique" to be
disgusting.  There is a tendency to romanticize 
phreaks and crackers ---- to create a mythology of
the "uberhacker" (a Nietsche-an reference that 
very few of them understand).  That whole subculture 
is permeated with a smug "superiority" that tries to 
say: "we know something you don't."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Of course, to them I'm a nobody.  I've never cracked
into anyone's system.  I've never written any 
"warez" or "sploits" and I don't even know all the
buzz words and jargon to participate in their 
conversations.  I'm a "lam3r" that's not even good
enough to be a "wannabe."  In other words, I'm not
an "3l33t d000d."  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>It also tends to be quite juvenile.  They seem to
have an inordinate fondness for bad grammar and 
intentionally crazy spelling.  I suppose it's part
of the general affectation of 'tude --- the 
rebellious aversion to authority and convention, 
even the conventions of language itself.  Trite!
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Now this is not to say that you have no business
learning about phreaking and cracking.  There's 
nothing wrong with learning about these things, nor
even anything inherently wrong with experimentation
and research.  However, there is a major problem if
you conduct your "research" on "subjects" without 
their informed consent.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>As a sysadmin's (and sometimes security) consultant I
study these things as much as my time allows.  Most
of my information comes from mailing lists like bugtraq, 
and from web sites like rootshell and the l0pht.  I'll
let you find those on your own.  You can also subscribe
to 2600 and Phrack magazines (printed) to learn more.
Phrack is also available online.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>All of the real "cracker" socializing seems to be done 
via IRC (Internet Relay Chat).  This has tended to give
the whole IRC system a bit of a bad rap.  The popularity
of IRC for this stems from at least two factors:  it is 
immediate and interactive (instant gratification is 
very important in these circles), and it allows for	
direct client-to-client communications (DCC) which makes
it easy for participants to exchange "warez" and other
files.  From what I gather the old-fashioned BBS is 
also still pretty popular in that crowd.  These seem to
be "by invitation only" --- so you'll have to curry
favor and do some horse trading to get any phone 
numbers on any of them.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Naturally it is important for these crackers and phreakers
to maintain their elite status by locking out the lamers 
and wannabes.  So anything published about them is wrong, 
or will be right after they read it.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>I suspect that this message by itself will probably get
me flamed and possibly attract some cracks on my systems 
(d00dz, don't bother; it's not sporting --- I don't do 
anything special to protect my servers, honest!  My 
web and ftp servers are just virtual hosts on some poor
ISP, no challenge at all).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Meanwhile my best advice to you, Dodo, is to cut your
moniker in half and just "do" something constructive.
If you want to make a serious study of "cracking" and 
"phreaking" than the Linux Gazette Answer Guy is a 
pretty lame place to start.  In short:  get a life!
