Hello everyone
</p>

<p>
My old internet server crashed and i had to setup a new one, and im
having several problems.
</p>

<p>
My squid configuration is pretty simple, I basically allow everything:
</p>

<pre>
Allow manager localhost 	
Deny manager 	
Allow purge localhost 	
Deny purge 	
Allow localhost 	
Allow all
</pre>

<p>
And my iptables config file is empty (exists but is empty -
/etc/network/iptables)
</p>

<p>
And msn doesnt work on the machines behind the proxy, and noone can
atach files to emails - im guessing no ports are being forwarded
(cause of the empty iptables file) but if I put content in it, eg.:
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
iptables -F
</pre>
and do an sudo iptables-apply, it gives me an "line 2 failed - failed"
- what am I doing wrong? btw im on ubuntu 10.04, and allowing any
outgoing connection to any port would be good enough, later Ill think
about the security.
</p>

<p>

Ok, now I messed a bit with iptables and managed to get the following rules up:
<pre class='code'>
$ sudo iptables -L
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere            tcp dpt:3128
ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere
 
Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere            tcp dpt:msnp
ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere
 
Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
</pre>
still no msn working, but emails are ataching ok (squid config still the same)
is there anywhere i can see why a connection is being refused?
</p>

Hi there,

<p>
Ouch.
</p>

<p>
 From your description, there seems to be multiple potential
problems. Hopefully the hints here will help you sort the important
ones quickly.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; My squid configuration is pretty simple, I basically allow everything:
&gt; Allow manager localhost 	
&gt; Deny manager 	
&gt; Allow purge localhost 	
&gt; Deny purge 	
&gt; Allow localhost 	
&gt; Allow all
</pre>

<p>
And does that allow someone using the proxy server to browse the
web? If so, yay, that much is working. If not, that's something that
will need fixing.
</p>

<p>
You probably know this already, but just to spell it out for anyone new
following along:
</p>

<p>
You must have networking set up correctly before the applications can work.
</p>

<p>
For squid (or any proxy service), the clients talk to the proxy, and the
proxy talks to the world. That's two different networking setups. A third
one, which you may also want, is for the clients to talk to the world.
</p>

<p>
On the squid box, can you access the world? Ping a well-known
public server by IP address. (I suggest 8.8.8.8, because it's easy to
remember. But that's not my address, so don't unintentionally dos-attack
it.) If that doesn't work, stop worrying about applications and do
whatever it takes to make it work. (Or understand that ping is blocked
on your network, but things you actually need are allowed, so test with
one of those things instead.)
</p>

<p>
When it does work, try an expected-to-work http GET -- pick a url and
use "curl" or "wget" to fetch it. When that works (by now you've got DNS
working too, hurray), you can expect that squid will be able to fulfil
any request it gets. The proxy can talk to the world.
</p>

<p>
So now ensure that the clients can talk to the proxy server. On the
client, "telnet squid-server squid-port", and do something like "GET /
HTTP/1.0" followed by two returns. It's an invalid request (it must have
an indication of which host is wanted), but that's OK: all you want to see
is that you could connect, and that squid returned some kind of message.
</p>

<p>
If you don't see that, then you'll need to find why: can the client not
route to squid? Can the client not send traffic out? Can squid not
get traffic in? Can squid not route back to the client?
</p>

<p>
(If this was a fully-working network that had one machine fail, then just
restoring that machine should be sufficient. If this "internet server"
was also the dhcp server, then you'll want to put that back first,
so that the clients get the right network information.)
</p>


<pre>
&gt; And my iptables config file is empty (exists but is empty -
&gt; /etc/network/iptables)
&gt; 
&gt; And msn doesnt work on the machines behind the proxy,
</pre>

<p>
I don't know msn: if it works through a http proxy, then when squid
is working, it should work too. If it doesn't proxy, but instead works
through a NAT gateway, then (assuming that your internet server is the
NAT gateway of your network) you'll need to enable that too. That is
"the clients must access the world".
</p>

<p>
<a href='https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/C/firewall.html'>https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/C/firewall.html</a> seems to have
useful details.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; and noone can atach files to emails
</pre>

<p>
By itself, that report is surprising. The unstated "people can send emails
without attachments" is particularly odd, since SMTP doesn't care about
attachments. If SMTP allows a mail be sent, it allows a mail be sent.
</p>

<p>
Unless you're not using SMTP?
</p>


<pre>
&gt; - im guessing no ports are being forwarded
</pre>

<p>
In general, ports don't need to be forwarded. Unless you're running a
public-facing service here. Oh, you said "internet server". Is this for
"lan users to get access to the world", or "world users to get access
to something on the lan"? The setup will differ.
</p>

<p>
Good luck with it,
</p>

<p>
I'm confused as to what your network is supposed to look like.
</p>

<p>
Could you draw a picture?
</p>

<p>
I <strong>think</strong> you've said that clients can talk to the proxy server, and the
proxy server can talk to the world, but clients can't talk to the world
(using the proxy server as their gateway).
</p>

<p>
If that is the case, then enabling ip_forward and adding an "iptables -t
nat -j MASQUERADE" rule on the proxy server may be an adquate start --
see the ubuntu firewall documentation from the previous mail for ways
to do that.
</p>


<pre>

&gt; is there anywhere i can see why a connection is being refused?
</pre>

<p>
Guessing, things below /var/log.
</p>

<p>
I'd probably also try a tcpdump on each interface, to see how far traffic
is getting. But I'd try to understand exactly what <strong>should</strong> be happening
first, so that I'd be able to interpret whatever logs I did see.
</p>

<p>
Good luck with it,
</p>
