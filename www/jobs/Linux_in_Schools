The Linux Gazette is interested in the use of GNU/Linux at schools. Many
computer courses take place with the involvement of GNU/Linux systems, and
it would be a shame to hide interesting projects, tutorials, or even
exciting lab configurations done with our operating system of choice. If
you are a student using GNU/Linux at school, please write about what you
learned and share it with us. If you are a teacher introducing your
students to the wonderful world of Linux systems, please encourage your
students to drop us a few lines (or better yet, a whole article) so
everyone cant get word of your noble deeds. :)
