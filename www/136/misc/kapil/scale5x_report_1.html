[[[  Hello, I've been attending Scale5x. Here is my first report. - Kapil  ]]]
</p>

</p>

<p>
Don Marti spoke about the "Going beyond User-Friendly to
User-Intimate with desktop tweaking power".
</p>

<p>
He bagan the talk with a description of how various platforms and
GUI's have evolved the Human Interface Guidelines and this was a bit
worrisome since I didn't want to hear much more about those. But I
need not have worried--he was just setting up an obstacle so that he
could show us the ways around it!
</p>

<p>
Thomas Adam would have found this talk interesting since the subtext
of this first 3/4 of talk was "How can we make Gnome/Metacity behave
more like fvwm/scwm/sawfish when we want it to?" Marti gave
a number of tips on how to use the tools "xev", "xwininfo",
"xlsclients", "xsel" and friends to make it possible to provide a
command-line/keyboard/scriptable interface to applications have only
dialog boxes and mouse clicks.
</p>

<p>
In the last quarter of his talk Marti talked about some new ways of
interacting with the computer. The simplest of these are the extra keys
on laptops which are not handled by the keyboard driver. More
unconventional are things like the hard-disk acceleration detection
driver on some laptops; you can use this to detect the orientation of
your laptop to flip the screen. A rather cool idea was using your hand
to cover the wireless antenna and have a program that detects Wi-Fi
signal strength use this in some way--for example, as an application
launcher or even a "theremin".
</p>

<p>
Marti then outlined some dangers of this way of tweaking the
interface:
<pre>
	(a) Your computer truly becomes personal. Soon no one
	else can use it and you can't use someone elses computer
	either!
	(b) This kind of programming really sucks up time without
	necessarily contributing to the community ... unless you give
	a talk about it or write an article explaining things.
</pre>
All in all a fun talk and a fun way to start the day.
</p>

<p>
Heh.  Thanks for the thought.  I don't necessarily agree with Marti that
Metacity [1] should behave like sawfish or FVWM, choice is a good thing.
Don't forget that Metacity on its own is limiting for a reason in that
it was never really meant to really be used outside of the GNOME
framework.  Some people would claim to the contrary, but it's still
true.  GNOME's way of working is entirely <strong>with</strong> the user, guiding them
through every mouse movement.
</p>

<p>
Yes, there's some merit to having a scriptable means of working, but
it's by no means for everyone.  The fact that you'd <em>need</em> to use
disparate tools such as xlsclients [2], xwininfo, etc., to possibly even
attempt to create something that's scriptable, is in my mind not really
something worth attempting; in order for that to be successful it has to
be integrated into the window manager somehow.  I bet Marti didn't
mention 'xwit', did he?
</p>

<p>
[1]  You can't call it GNOME, since it's really Metacity which is the
window manager in this case.
</p>

<p>
[2] If you're relying on this to give you an accurate depiction of which
clients are connected to $DISPLAY, don't bother.

<p>
Actually, he did. I should have said that he mentioned a number of
tools. For details one must look at the slides of the talk at the
scale5x web site.
</p>

<p>
The Gnome environment does seem to have a tool rather like
"FvwmCommand" --- it is called "devilspie".
