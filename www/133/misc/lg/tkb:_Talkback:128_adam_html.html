Did you read what I wrote in that article?  You don't need one.  If you
still want help, perhaps you'd kindly tell us what issue you're
currently having with fonts?

<p>
Thank you for you quick response.
</p>

<p>
Yes I did read the article.
</p>

<p>
But my problem is I need to support mathematica from remote Windows XP. So 
I thought installing fonts server would provide required mathematica fonts 
to the remote clients. The remote Client(windows XP) uses Xming for 
x-server. But when mathmatica is accessed, it give font error.
</p>


<p>
I have got alternate solution for this problem i.e. loading required font 
in Xming but I think if i can install font server in server, they can just 
locate the font server and run the mathematica.
</p>

<p>
Am i doing a right thing? Sir, I am newbie to linux. So
</p>


<p>
Sincerely
Rupesh

Ugh -- I have no idea, at least, not without the exact error (which you
should be providing, incidentally).  Assuming, though, that Xming works
every bit like XServer does (I'd be surprised if it did -- it is a port
after all), you would have to ensure that the font server is referenced
correctly within the Xming configuration file.

As far as I am aware, you don't need a font server unless you want to
install all your fonts on one machine and serve those up across a
network.  Someone here on LG wrote a marvellous article on font usage
which I could not improve on if I tried.
</p>

<p>
I do indeed have xfstt installed on my machine, but that was upgraded
over the years, and I forget where I sourced the package.  I certainly
don't use it anymore.  It is called xfstt.tgz if you care to look.
Effectively, to use this, you need to run:
<pre>
/usr/X11/bin/xfstt --daemon
</pre>
from your /etc/rc.d/rc.local, and refer to the port address in
your /etc/X11/xorg.conf, "Files" section.
Typically,
<pre>
Fontpath  "inet/host.domain:7101"
</pre>
Alternatively, use xset fp+ inet/127.0.0.1:7101
</p>

<p>
xfstt looks for its fonts by default in /usr/share/fonts/truetype
</p>

That wouldn't by any chance be the one that's referenced in the Subject

Dear sir,
</p>

<p>
Mathematica uses their own fonts and all other fonts are incompatible. the 
Mathematica fonts are already in the linux server. I just need to locate 
the fonts from remote X-server (Xming). I would be grateful to you if you 
suggest me in someway
</p>

I have no idea what it is you're trying to do -- or how Mathematica
works (I can only shudder to think how it might).  Where have you put
these fonts?  More importantly, are they in a location Mathematica knows
about (i.e. I assume Mathematica hasn't got some stupid hard-coded
reference to them?)

Dear Thomas,
</p>

<p>
In my machine, mathematica stores its fonts at 
/usr/local/Wolfram/mathematica/5.1/Systemfiles/Fonts directory. The thing 
is when i access mathematica from the LAN machines with slackware,it runs 
perfectly fine. But from remote no font in located.
