      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Michael Cowpland, 
        president and CEO of <a href="http://www.corel.com">Corel</a> Corporation, 
        hardly needs an introduction. An engineer by qualification, Dr Cowpland 
        began his career at Bell Northern Research in 1964. In 1985, he founded 
        Corel one of the largest software companies in the world. 
        The company is now helping develop the fast growing Linux platform; 
        in fact, Corel plans to port a majority of its applications to Linux. 
        Mike Cowpland talks of his plans for Corel and his views on Linux to <a href="http://www.freeos.com">FreeOS.com</a>. 
        </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>What is Corel doing with 
  Linux?<br>
  </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Corel is 
  basically offering really comprehensive solutions to Linux. We are doing more 
  than any other company and are also providing complete connectivity to the Windows 
  world. We have recently launched Corel Linux for the desktop. This is currently 
  available in North America and can be downloaded from our Web site. We have 
  made an extremely easy to use distribution that can be installed even quicker 
  than Windows. The user can also connect seamlessly to the all the Windows files 
  on the network including Microsoft public files. With the announcement that 
  we made a few weeks ago, he can also connect to Windows applications to run 
  those. If someone has the legacy applications that they want to connect and 
  still enjoy the benefits of Linux, they can do that by having a single application 
  server serving up the group. So you can have a cluster of Linux desktops and 
  one Windows NT server and they can all load up their Windows applications from 
  there and while using their own native Linux applications on the desktop. So 
  that provides a complete solution where we provide the basic software, which 
  is the browser, the office suite and the graphic suite. Then they may have their 
  human resource or accounting software that they still have on Windows. They 
  can run on their server without having to run them on the desktop.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Will Corel become a Linux 
  company in the near future?<br>
  </b>Well, we are already very heavily a Linux company. That is supported by 
  the fact that we are we are the most popular download on the Web. If you look 
  at CNET the number one download site, we have been the number one Linux download 
  consistently so effectively we are already a Linux company. We are introducing 
  our Linux suite very shortly and that would give us more exposure and capability 
  in Linux. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Where do you see Linux 
  5 years from now?<br>
  </b>In 5 years, Linux will become the more dominant operating system in terms 
  of Unix. Windows will be more involved with back-end applications like it is 
  today.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Why did Corel decide 
  to develop its own distribution rather than adopting or embracing an existing 
  one?<br>
  </b>We did look at several distributions but found them very limited. They were 
  difficult to install and use and required an expert, which we did not find acceptable. 
  In Linux, when something is not happening, the best thing is to do it yourself 
  and that is exactly what we did. As compared to any other distribution, we received 
  the highest rating of 9 from CNET in addition to being CNET's Editor's Choice, 
  whereas Red Hat has received a rating of 8.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Corel is primarily known 
  as a company developing Graphic suites and Office suites. Does this give a feeling 
  that Corel is losing its focus of developing applications?</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Not really, a tremendous 
  amount of User Interface has been worked at with programs such as CorelDraw. 
  In Linux, it is a world team effort with each organization doing what its best 
  at. The kernel is still being developed by the kernel people and we simply use 
  it. We don't have to reduplicate that work. We are best at the user interface 
  and we are doing that. With our 50 million Windows users worldwide we have very 
  rich experience with that. We have made the user interface really easy to use 
  and the fact that our distribution has been well received proves it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Corel has been a Windows 
  developers and is now a Linux developer. Does it affect your relationship with 
  Microsoft?<br>
  </b>We have always had a good relationship with Microsoft and continue to do 
  so. We use Visual Basic and they use our components. We can focus in certain 
  other areas, which I think in some ways it is going to be good for Microsoft. 
  They are, as you know, getting hammered for being a monopoly. Microsoft will 
  do better when they have competition OS around.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>What do you think is 
  better. Being a Linux Developer or being a Windows developer?<br>
  </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
  actually like being a multi-platform developer. Otherwise one company has too 
  much control over computer manufacturers - they can dictate terms. They can 
  insist that you bundle certain things or put logos in certain places, which 
  Microsoft has been known to do. I don't think that's good for anybody. Being 
  in the multi-platform world is healthier while maintaining connectivity, because 
  you don't want to have different islands which cannot talk to each other. We 
  consider connectivity as the biggest thing that Corel is doing for Linux. We 
  have our Windows experience and while we don't expect Windows to go away, we 
  do expect Linux to be just as important as Windows. Much of the work that we 
  will be doing on applications will be shared between the platforms.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>How is Corel helping 
  the Linux community?</b><br>
  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We have been doing 
  work with Corel Linux in the GPL or Mozilla open source licenses. The Wine work 
  that we are doing is been put back into the community. The Corel File Manager, 
  all of which we wrote ourselves, has been put back into the community. We are 
  actually very supportive of the open source concept. On the applications side 
  we don't see those as being open source because there are dozens and dozens 
  of third party utilities that we select, tune-up and include. That's what makes 
  a very rich applications because the core software is only part of the source. 
  It is the other utilities that make them useful. As we have to pay royalties 
  for many of these, its impossible to give them free.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Which are the big vendors 
  who have agreed to pre-install Corel Linux on their systems?</b><br>
  PC Chips, that makes more motherboards than anybody else is installing Corel 
  Linux as we speak. We are working with other big vendors too which we will make 
  announcements over the next 6 months. I think a lot of end-user computer manufacturers 
  are waiting for applications such as Corel's office applications and graphic 
  applications to be available before they can really offer a consumer product. 
  We will have those available soon and we expect them to make announcements then.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>There are some installation-related 
  issues regarding Corel Linux 1.0. What is Corel doing about those?<br>
  </b>There are some issues regarding legacy hardware such as ISA, which has not 
  been as automated as the latest Bus. The fact is that developers are now focusing 
  on the high volume situation first. It will take a lot before it can cover every 
  legacy hardware and this is typical of any Linux distribution.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Corel had the Netwinder 
  Project, which for some reason did not take-off and Corel decided to spin it 
  off. What was the reason behind that?<br>
  </b>The project has divested to rebel.com, and we are an active partner there. 
  They are doing very well and just went through a private round of financing. 
  They have a product similar to Cobalt, which has a market capitalization of 3-4 
  billion US$. We are very happy with our 25% ownership of rebel that we got in 
  the Netwinder project. We just felt it was better off as a separate company 
  because hardware does require a separate focus.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Will Corel do something 
  similar with Corel Linux?<br>
  </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No, 
  because we are enabling 90% of the work between Windows applications 
  and Linux applications and to some extent Macintosh applications. That is more 
  proficient than other companies doing both Linux applications and Windows applications.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Are all Corel applications 
  going to be available for Linux? <br>
  </b>Yes, absolutely. We are also considering acquisition of other applications of 
  Windows to port over to Linux, to make our portfolio even more complete. We 
  are also looking at companies who have a dual platform strategy. It is easier 
  to buy technologies than to buy the whole company in a non-exclusive way.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>(Mike Cowpland refused 
  to give any further details about the companies that they plan to or are considering 
  to acquire. Said it was too pre-mature to discuss this now.)</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Corel Office for Linux 
  was expected by the year-end of 1999? Apart from Word Perfect none of the other 
  applications are ported to Linux yet. What is the progress on that?</b><br>
  It should be available in beta form in a week's time and that's very close to 
  year-end.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>What about the competition 
  to your office suite from Star Office?<br>
  </b>The downloads of their office suite are running at 10% of our volumes which 
  is not very competitive. If you look at Sun's history of software it has been 
  dismal. Even now people complain that they are not even freeing up Java. IBM 
  is very upset that they are charging 3% license fees for anybody using Java 
  program. Sun's history on software has been the pits.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>What would happen if 
  Microsoft office were available for Linux?<br>
  </b>That would be good for the industry. More the applications on Linux, the 
  better. In fact we are working on that. With our GraphOn Bridges you will be 
  able to run Microsoft applications on Corel Linux without Microsoft having to 
  do any work. You still have to pay Microsoft's license but it will enable people 
  to rely on Linux without giving up on their favorite Windows applications.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Both Microsoft and Sun 
  are offering their office suites over the servers with the concept of application 
  service providers. What are Corel's plans?<br>
  </b>We are doing that too. We have an offering for ASP's as that provides very 
  low cost of ownership.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Does Corel plan to sell 
  computers with Linux and Corel apps preinstalled?<br>
  </b>No we would rather work with partners to do that.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>There have been some 
  controversies about the Corel Linux licensing which wasn't 100% GPL?<br>
  </b>Even Richard Stallman has been happy with our license. Being a big commercial 
  company, we have to be more careful of copyright than other smaller companies. 
  We had certain terms, which had to be introduced to ensure that everything was 
  legal.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Will Corel support other 
  free operating systems in the future?<br>
  </b>No. We think it is important to focus on Linux, as it is clearly the one.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>There were some talks 
  about Red Hat taking over Corel, is that going to happen?<br>
  </b>No, I don't think they would do that, because Red Hat is a much smaller 
  company than Corel. They have only 40-50 developers where as we have got 800 
  developers. We understand the Windows market, Red Hat does not.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>What if it happens?<br>
  </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
  is not going to happen (laughs).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>If you had a choice to 
  be taken over by a company, which company would you prefer?<br>
  </b>None (laughs).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>How does Corel plan to 
  make money out of the open source model?<br>
  </b>Corel has always been known to offer enormous value for money and thereby 
  the paradigm suits us very well. If you put a software in a box along with a 
  manual, it typically costs between 50 and 100 US$ and that's what an upgrade 
  sells for. It is really no different to our Windows model. The only difference 
  is that you get a good CD in the market with free downloads and that's why we 
  have had 2 million Word Perfect downloads, the number one rate of free download 
  of Corel Linux.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In my point of view, it 
  is very similar to the Windows model. It goes even faster and you still make 
  money on the boxes because some people don't want to wait for the downloads. 
  They want the CD and the manuals or they want the extra bells and whistles such 
  as the high level of support or may be some more bells and whistles such as 
  content. For example, on our Web site we have 50,000 images but if you want 
  to access 2 million then you have to join up and pay 30 US$ a year as 
  subscription. So it fits into a subscription model. We are looking at the Web 
  site as a revenue generator and are keen to develop a lot more traffic to our 
  portal <a href="http://www.corelcity.com">Corelcity.com</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Is Corel's Web site powered 
  by Corel Linux?<br>
  </b>Some part of it is on Solaris and Window NT, but the trend would be towards 
  moving to Corel Linux.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>What are Corel's plans 
  for India?<br>
  </b>We are optimistic about the potential of the Indian market and are very 
  very keen on it. It is a huge market and English is commonly used. We also think 
  India is natural for Linux because it needs computers at the lowest possible 
  cost. Why would they want to pay the high price of Windows when they don't have 
  to? At the same time it is full of computer scientist who can improve Linux 
  because they have access to the source code. So India can become a major contributor 
  to Linux since they can all see the source code, use the source code and be 
  a part of the improvement. So it's much more exciting for India than simply 
  being a part of Microsoft's monopoly.</font></p>
