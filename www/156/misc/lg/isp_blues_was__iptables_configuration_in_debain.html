Hi, J.Bakshi.  This note is to advise you that your choice of ISP is
causing your mail to be interpreted upon receipt as suspect, when
automatically parsed by spam-detection software.  My SMTP software
keeps kicking your mail addressed to this mailing list into an
administrative queue, to verify that it's not spam.  Even though
I've whitelisted _you personally_, your ISP's IP address keeps failing
several tests used within Spamassassin.  Those are:
</p>


<p>
RCVD_IN_SORBS:  This is fairly serious.  Your ISP's SMTP server IP
address (63.223.93.2) is in the SORBS (Spam and Open-Relay Blocking
System) antispam blocklist, which means it's been extensively used for
spamming activity (not by you).
</p>

<p>
RCVD_IN_SORBS_WEB:  This is also fairly serious.  That same IP is also
in a separate SORBS blocklist of sites that are known to have
exploitable vulnerability (e.g., FormMail scripts) that are widely
abused by spammers to send mass-mail spam.
</p>

<p>
FORGED_RCVD_HELO:  This refers to the fact that your ISP sends out a
mistaken/malformed greeting string during its SMTP delivery attempts.
In this case, IP address 63.223.93.2 (firewall.wahju.com) is sending a
greeting string claiming it's "icsmail.net".  Doing so violates mailing
list technical standards and makes your ISP's SMTP host look like a
spammer haven.
</p>

<p>
RCVD_IN_XBL:  This is <em>really</em> serious.  This means your ISP's SMTP
server IP address is also in the Spamhaus XBL blocklist, described as
"wholly incorporat[ing] data from two highly-trusted DNSBL sources, with
tweaks by Spamhaus to maximise the data efficiency and lower False
Positives. The main components are the CBL (Composite Block List) from
cbl.abuseat.org, and the NJABL Open Proxy IPs list from www.njabl.org".
Essentially, this means your ISP's mail server has been verified to be
repeatedly used by spammers to a high degree of certainty.
</p>


<p>
I cannot really advise you, except to say that, unless/until some of the
above facts about your ISP -- not your fault and not under your personal
control -- change radically, you are likely to have significant problems
with software classifying your mail as probable spam.  Some users in
similar situations have found it best to change providers.

Hello Rick Moen ,
</p>

<p>
Thanks a lot to make me familiar with this problem. And also thanks for your 
effort to add my id in the white list. I am afraid to say that there is no 
good internet connection available right now in our locality except this one. 
The provider is actually taken  connection from the 24online ISP company and 
after that he distributes the connection in our area. Some other connections 
are also available but again they are not so good like this 24online ; more 
over those connection has limited traffic. So right now I am really helpless.
</p>

<p>
Let me be really clear about this:  At the moment, approving your TAG
mail requires ongoing manual work for me.  The longer that goes on, the
less likely I am going to be to find time to do it, and I suspect the
end is imminent:  Your mails will pretty soon end up being silently
discarded.  I will not be giving you further advisories on the matter:
With this mail, I will be considering you to have been put on notice of
the problem, and will not be dealing with the matter further.
</p>

<p>
Many people in your situation elect to use webmail (GMail, Yahoo Mail,
etc.).  You should probably consider the prior sentence a strong hint.
</p>

<p>
Your course of action is entirely up to you, but basically you'll be 
the person who'll need to pay the price of inaction; i.e., you're going
to find your mail (often) just getting discarded or (if you're lucky)
rejected -- not <em>just</em> at the lists.linuxgazette.net machine, but there 
among other places.

Plus both GMail and Yahoo mail are so good, and you will be able to
keep `em even if you switch ISPs - I always used then for that reason -

There are other ways of doing that. Register your own domain and use a mail 
forwarding service (many companies offering name registration, provide 
email and web redirection for "free"). Change ISP change where your mail 
gets forwarded to.

FWIW, shortly after I wrote my most recent mail in this thread, I
remembered how to <em>unconditionally</em> whitelist J. Bakshi's currently 
subscribed address in my MTA.  (He'd been "autowhitelisted" by
SpamAssassin's Bayesian classifier, but that only ameliorated his 
mail's severely spammy overall SA score on account of the SORBS listing
and other things.)
</p>

<p>
So, J.Bakshi's mail should, for now, come through to TAG without
problems.  If it doesn't, then I expect I'll have limited time for
diagnosis, as my sympathy for those who use spammer-associated ISPs
is minimal.
