Good morning,
</p>

<p>
I am using Firefox 2.0.0.11 with Newsfox 0.8.3 to track your RSS feed at
&lt;<a href="../../../lg.rss&gt;">http://linuxgazette.net/lg.rss&gt;</a>. Since I know that updates only happen
once a month, I don't include LG in the regular refresh list, but check
it manually the first few days of each month until I get the update.
</p>

<p>
However, for the past four months, there have not been any dates on the
items in that feed. Therefore I have a mixed list with items from
multiple months and no useful way to sort it by date. Is that an issue
with the feed, or something on my end?
</p>

<p>
I do enjoy the Gazette. Although I started with SLS 1.02, I have been
using Slackware at home since '93, and Red Hat/Fedora at work for the
past two years. Unfortunately, we only have one small department using
Linux and have to struggle with MS-Windows for company wide tools.
</p>

<p>
Thank you,
</p>

&gt; Good morning,
&gt;

<p>
I don't know much about RSS other that how to generate a feed in one of
my scripts; however, looking at the "lg.rss" file at LG and comparing it
to several random RSS feeds found on the Net shows that we don't have a
'&lt;pubDate&gt;[...]&lt;/pubdate&gt;' stanza, which is the probable reason for it.
The only puzzling thing is your implication that prior to the last four
months there <em>was</em> some sort of date stamp: this would mean that
&lt;pubDate&gt; is perhaps not the answer.
</p>

<p>
In any case, even though I'm definitely <strong>not</strong> a snake-handler (our
scripts are written in Python), I'll give a shot at fixing it up - since
our Pythoneers, including those who wrote all the scripts originally as
well as the ones who did the RSS/RDF stuff, seem to be quite reticent
(or perhaps just reticulated?) these days.

<p>
Ben,
</p>

<p>
The alternative is that either Newsfox or your feed changed the way the
date was handled back in the September-November time frame. There were
several updates to both Firefox and Newsfox, but since you only update
once a month and I took some vacation during that period, I don't know
if there was a traceable link between them.
</p>

<p>
Thank you,
</p>

<p>
Bob

Ah, yes... the wonderful situation where everything except the one
constant [1] has changed. Repeatedly. I just love those (that tends to
be the point where my clients call me in to put out the fire. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
In any case, I've just tweaked the calling script and the relevant
template to contain &lt;lastBuildDate&gt; and &lt;pubDate&gt; stanzas, regenerated
the feeds, and uploaded the whole shebang to the LG site. Please fire up
your RSS reader and let me know if that took care of it.

Ahh, but it did work at one time. There was a date displayed for several
months. I believe it disappeared with the December issue.
</p>

<p>
I tried refreshing the feed, but nothing downloaded. I will try a few
more times this afternoon and let you know what I see.

I've just managed - through a bunch more Python-mangling and a bit of
Perl scripting - to not only generate the dates (I've installed the
'blam' RSS reader to check this out) but also include the first
paragraph of every article in the RSS feed. For the lg_{mail,
launderette, bytes, etc.} files, it generates a list of all the section
hedings in the file. A nice bit of improvement, I think.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for the initial push, Bob!

Yes, that is a wonderful improvement. Looks great from here.

While I was at it, I decided to go whole hog - both the RSS and the RDF
feed have been modified to contain the first para/headings list now.
Unfortunately, Atom has changed spec - *a lot* - since Jimmy created it,
and I'm really, really uninterested in studying the fine details of
something I'm never again likely to use.
</p>

<p>
If anyone here knows the state of the state for Atom, and is willing to
help set up the template for generating it, great. Otherwise, it's going
to become one with the dinosaurs - a thing of the past.
