[ If you're not a programmer or a mathematician, you might want to hit
the 'delete' key right about now. Either that, or risk being bored to
tears. Remember, I warned you! <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> ]
</p>

<p>
As I've just mentioned in my previous post, I've been fiddling with a
"max-spread" algorithm - i.e., if I have two lists, and I want the items
in the first list to be spread as widely as possible (using the items in
the second list as the "padding"), how do I interpolate them?
</p>

<p>
This can also be stated as follows: given a barbecue, a bunch of pork
cubes, and a number of cherry tomatoes, how would you arrange the
skewers in such a way that a) there's a pork chunk at the beginning and
the end of every skewer, b) each skewer is arranged in as even a manner
as possible, and c) you use up all the pork and all the tomatoes?
</p>

<p>
I got most of the way to a solution - essentially reinventing the
Bresenham line algorithm [1] (and the wheel... and fire... sheesh. I'm a
<em>very</em> poor mathematician, and a worse statistician), but got scooped by
a fellow Perl monk from the Monastery (perlmonks.org) - really nice work
on his part. I rewrote his script to actually sort arrays rather than
strings and added some guard conditions. Sample output looks like this:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
ben@Tyr:~/devel/0$ ./skewer 2 2
pork1|tmt1|tmt2|pork2
 
 ---#00#---

Can you reproduce this algorithm? <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> I found it a very interesting
exercise, myself.

<p>
Hm.... line up all porks, start puting in one tomato in the gaps until
tomate are out or alternatively gaps are out. If gaps are out start
again at the beginning putting an additional tomato in the gaps. Repeat
till tomatoes are gone....

I think Ben is thinking of a skewer as a LIFO (or perhaps FIFO). So
this means that you can't "insert" elements. Some sort of estimate of
the rate at which meat/tomato becomes available seems to be required
in that case.

That's potentially quite uneven, e.g. 8 pork cubes, 2 tomatoes, leaves all 
tomatoes at one end. I would try something like 
</p>

<pre>
assert( pork_cubes &gt; 1 );
gaps = pork_cubes - 1;
fill = tomatoes/gaps;
toms_used = 0;
for( g = 0; g &lt; gaps; ++g )
{
  toms_in_gap[g] = ((g+1) *fill) - toms_used;
  toms_used += toms_in_gap[g];
}
</pre>
I think this still biases a little towards one end, but it shouldn't be too 
hard to add a little tweak that fixes that.

<p>
Actually, the number of tomatoes and meat cubes is known ahead of time
(otherwiwise, you're right - you'd have to know the rate - but at that
point, it's pretty trivial: figure out the ratio for each item and
insert it at that rate.) But Neil is right about Karl-Heinz' suggestion;
it fails where the ratios are skewed that way.

It's a nice approach - it creates a list of gaps and details how many
tomatoes should be inserted into each gap. However, it still has a
problem - both the tomatoes and the pork chunks are integers (cutting a
tomato to 0.666666666666667 of its original size is a little difficult -
and recombining the remainder with the next tomato down the line is even
more so. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> Besides, I'm struggling a bit to see how I'd convert that to
an actual interleaved array (it may just be because I'm a bit slow on

I don't have a 'round', but I can use a 'floor' ("largest integer value
less than or equal to the argument) - I think it's what you mean. That
one requires the POSIX module, which just happens to be part of Perl.

    }
    push @final, "pork" . ++$p;
 
	# Let's see what it looks like:
    print "interleave(@$ref): ", join("|", @final), "\n";
    # And, just for fun:
    print "\t\t---", join("", grep s/(pork|tmt).*/${{pork =&gt; '#', tmt =&gt; 0}}{$1}/e,
            @final), "---\n\n";

&gt; I don't have a 'round', but I can use a 'floor' ("largest integer value

<p>
floor isn't quite the same as round, e.g. floor( 0.9 ) != round( 0.9 ). You 
can use floor to simulate round

float round( float x )

It's just a question of figuring out the average number of tomatoes you need 
in each gap and then dealing with the problem that you can't actually slice 
them up. There's nothing in there that I would call deep math. All the fancy 
crypto stuff loses me in no time flat.

Since I only used it in one place, I just added 0.5 to the equation.

$toms_in_gap[$g] = floor((($g + 1) * $fill) - $toms_used + 0.5);

[laugh] Well, <strong>yes</strong>, that <em>is</em> the question. Where I have a problem is
in coming up with that question! As I often tell my students, "once
you've stated the problem clearly, the solution should be obvious." In
this case, it was the statement of the problem (not the terms of the
"puzzle", but the mathematical problem inherent in it) that I had to
wrestle with.

<p>
Oh - here's the solution from Perlmonks.org. Besides doing it correctly,
this one also tends to produce the most esthetically pleasing results
(nicely balanced distribution of leftover items):

People on the list are already finding uses for it - e.g., distributing
the spaces in justified text, etc.
