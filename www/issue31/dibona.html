Sam Ockman's notice hit Slashdot (http://www.slashdot.org/) at 6:21PM,
it read:
<p>
<blockquote>
The 500 members of SVLUG are going to have a big rally
tonight at the largest/most prestigious computer store in Silicon Valley,
Fry's, when they stay open until 1AM to distribute Windows 98.
We're going to hand out Linux CDs and stuff like that as well.
We'd like to have more people at the rally then go to buy Windows 98.
<p>
</blockquote>
While it was obvious that the entire membership of the LUG was not
planning on showing up for a midnight rally, it was clear that this was an
idea with great potential. A little after 10PM, Sam and I arrived at the Chili's
restaurant near the rally site to meet with people beforehand. We were
hopeful that we were not going to be alone at the table.
<p>
We were not disappointed. There were about 15 people waiting for Sam to
arrive. Some we recognized from the SVLUG, and some that had seen the
notice on Slashdot. Remember only four hours had gone by since the original
posting. By the time we left, the crowd had grown to 25 people.
<p>
After consuming some munchies and a stout or two, we headed out for Fry's
electronics in Sunnyvale. For those of you who aren't familiar with Fry's,
they are a warehouse-sized electronics, software, hardware, test
equipment, junk food, books and magazine retailer out here on the west
coast. Picture Price-Costco except with resistors. Most people have a love
hate relationship with Fry's, mainly for customer service issues. It's
important to note that this rally was not a protest against Fry's, but a rally
for Linux on MS Windows 98's birthday.
<p>
We arrived at the Fry's around 11:30PM. The 500 compact discs hadn't arrived
from the generous folks from S.u.S.E. yet, and we were a little nervous
they would be late. At Fry's our numbers had doubled to a little over 50
people. By now, our signs had been pulled out and we were actively
agitating for Linux. This was a peaceful gathering, we made a point of not
being too annoying and staying out of the way of cars.
<p>
The CDs arrived around midnight, coinciding with the beginning of the
sale of the Windows 98 CDs. We started handing them out along with pamphlets
designed by Adam Richter (of Yggdrasil) to people who were coming into and
out of Fry's. At this point we had two reporters show up to document the
event (see links below).
<p>
Also, at this point we started noticing worried looking guys with
walkie-talkies watching us from the parking lot, and some Fry's managerial
types talking into their cell phones. One of the protestors overheard one
of their managers call the police, and then frustratedly say to another
Fry's guy, ``Why can't we just go over there and rip those
signs out of their geek hands?'' When we heard that, we were taken
aback, but it did consolidate our desire to continue.
<p>
A few minutes later the Sunnyvale police began to arrive in numbers. Four
police cars pulled forward into the lot. I offered myself up as their
contact, while Sam controlled the Linux people.
<p>
The police officer asked us what we were doing there, I described Linux
and how we were trying to get the word out about it. The police officer
was cool about it, telling me that we'd have to wait for his Lieutenant to
arrive to find out what to do. We were on Fry's private property,
their parking lot. It turns out there are certain situations
where it's okay to protest on someone's private property. It's pretty
much always okay to protest on the sidewalk. We had been expecting to be
asked to move to the sidewalk eventually.
<p>
Before his Lieutenant arrived, one of the other police officers asked more
about Linux, the word is one of the Linux people got a CD into his hands
on his way out of the lot. He did say, ``Hey, good luck with your
system'' to me.
<p>
Additionally, the manager of Fry's came up to me (the same one that wanted
to rip the signs out of our ``geek hands'') and asked me why I was
doing this, as Fry's sold Linux in their book section. I pointed out that we
knew this and indeed had a sign showing people which aisle to go to for the
book. He
then asked why I had not had the Linux marketing people or my (as if I'm
in charge of Linux!) vendor relations people, contact Fry's management to
arrange a similar event to the Windows 98 launch. Needless to say I was
like a deer in the headlights, I told him that, in fact, Linux was a free
operating system, and that this was one way we saw to market it (not to
mention the fact that no company could match a MS launch when it comes
down to the checkbook).
<p>
He was visibly upset, so I thought it was best to stop talking with him at
this point. I told him any further communication between us would
come to no good end, and we should only talk through the police. (His
brains were melting out his ears at this point.)
<p>
The Lieutenant arrived and said we should move to the sidewalk, so we did,
and it was just as cool, cars were actually pulling over and picking up a
copy of the Linux CD.
<p>
After about 15 minutes of this, we decided to hit the CompUSA, a few
miles away. When we arrived, there were still a lot of people in line
there. It turns out CompUSA was not only promoting Windows 98, but they
were also doing all kinds of things to bring people into the store. They
were selling the first 10 people in line computers for $98, and paying
people $4 to take away 32MB of RAM. (Actually, the RAM was $32, but there
was a $38 rebate--or something like that, it was weird.) This also
meant that there were a lot of people to promote Linux to. CompUSA's
management were cool, they just took the rally in stride, telling Sam
the rally was okay, as that was what the first amendment was all about.
Fry's had sent one of their security drones to CompUSA to warn them of our
existence, but CompUSA just let us do our thing.
<p>
After CompUSA petered out, we converged on a local Denny's to nosh.
Denny's flipped when they saw all the people, so we moved to a braver
restaurant down the street. I got home around 3AM to find
people were already uploading pictures to the web.
<p>
By the end of the night we had given out 500 CDs, and
hundreds of pamphlets. A total of six press people showed up and there
were over a half-dozen mentions in major newspapers. This is not counting
the coverage we received from other on-line sources such as CNN and the
BBC. Everyone involved had a rocking good time promoting Linux.
<p>
Whether or not you agree with this direct action model of Linux marketing, we
feel confident that we passed the Linux Message to many thousands of
people who otherwise had no real knowledge about the Linux revolution.
Viva El Revolution!
