I applaud the audacity of a project assuming that any given word has
<em>one</em> pronunciation in (among other candidate examples) English.  I'm
tempted to refer to them, as an English-language spokesbeing, our
favourite waitress from my family's 2005 sojourn in Glasgow.  ;-&gt;
(The Glaswegian accent strikes many as a wee bit thick.  But then, it's
always <em>other</em> people who have "accents".)
</p>

<p>
Still, Shtooka's project is certainly is a good way of recording how
<em>some</em> people pronounced various words as of 2008.
</p>

<p>
That somehow reminds me:  Back when I lived in Victoria, Hong Kong, my
family had occasion to visit the Norwegian consulate (later moved to
Shanghai).  We were somewhat mystified to find that, not only did the 
expatriate Norwegian staff speak English with a strong Norwegian accept,
but so did the local Chinese employees!  It turned out that the former
had been tutoring the latter.

<p>
Eh? Ok; to be fair, I haven't browsed the English samples, but I
presume they only have a single pronunciation for English because only
a single pronunciation was submitted - I've only browsed through
Russian and Czech, and found a number of alternatives in both of those
languages, annotated with the region of the speaker:

They provide open source tools for potential contributors, too.

<p>
 From my understanding of the project's goals, I'm sure they'd welcome
that - as would Voxforge, who are compiling open speech corpora, from
which to build acoustic models for use in open source speech
recognition systems.
</p>

<p>
Librivox too have something along those lines, where multiple
volunteers submit readings of the same piece of poetry or short prose.

&gt;

<p>
Not always - I pronounce my 'th's, which means I've always been made
aware of my 'accent'. Also, more amusingly at times, I've been on both
sides of interpretation by repetition - including one Polish mother
who couldn't understand a word I said until it was explained to her
that I speak Polish - and then she instantly understood me perfectly

<p>
I'm sure that, given more time and contributors, it can become a
valuable resource. I know I found it useful o learn a few words of
Czech before I went there - much more so than that 'proh seem'
nonsense that phrasebooks insist on using.

Awesome. Thanks, Jimmy! Kat's learning Russian, and it's handy to have
a resource other than me - particularly with multiple speakers - for
accent contrast.

Well, there's a Russian voice for the Fetival TTS system here:
<a href="http://festlang.berlios.de/docu/doku.php?id=russianru">http://festlang.berlios.de/docu/doku.php?id=russianru</a>
which might be useful - I haven't used it recently, but IIRC the
quality is quite good. There are also a handful of Russian books
available at Librivox:
