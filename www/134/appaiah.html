<h1>Fun with FUSE</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/appaiah.html">Kumar Appaiah</A></b></p>


<p><strong>Filesystem in Userspace</strong> (<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FUSE_(Linux)">FUSE</a>) is a very neat
innovation in the Linux kernel which allows users to homogeneously mount
almost anything as a directory with files, and opens up a new and fun way
of handling various operations. For example, imagine being able to use your
space in GMail as a disk, or mounting your <a href="Flickr">Flickr</a> photo page as a directory
in your machine. Moving files to and from the service boils down to simple
copying of files to and from the mounted directory.  Sounds fun, right? So
lets get our hands dirty with FUSE!</p>

<p>FUSE is available for the Linux kernel, as well as for FreeBSD and
OpenSolaris. It acts as a layer between the service you wish to
"mount" as a file system and the kernel, thus acting as a convenient
means to access the service as an ordinary directory/file
structure. There is an API which allows one to program the file system
behaviour, so FUSE can be extended to any situation where it is
useful to represent objects as files.</p>

<h3>Getting FUSE</h3>

<p>If you are running Linux kernel 2.6.14 or higher, in all likelihood,
you already have FUSE in the kernel as a module. Otherwise, just get
the sources from <a href="http://fuse.sf.net">the FUSE home page</a>
and compile it for your kernel. Once you are done, you can test
whether the module got loaded using:</p>

<pre>
sudo modprobe fuse
</pre>

(Or <tt>modprobe fuse</tt> as root).

<p>If you don't get errors, then we are ready to make FUSE
dance. You might want to automate the process of loading the FUSE
module every time you start your computer. This is usually
accomplished by adding a line containing <tt>fuse</tt> to the
<tt>/etc/modules</tt> file.</p>

<p>Also, ensure you have the userspace files as well, which come with
the FUSE tarball, or get the <tt>fuse-utils</tt> package for your
distribution. I would strongly recommend that you use FUSE using an
ordinary user account and not as <tt>root</tt>. To do this, just
adding yourself to the <tt>fuse</tt> group should be sufficient on
most distributions. This is usually done with:</p>

<pre>
adduser &lt;username&gt; fuse
</pre>

<p>(Depending on your distribution, your "/dev/fuse" may belong to
another group. Check with <code>ls -l /dev/fuse</code>. In that case,
add yourself to group that you see when you run the latter command.)</p>

<p>I have used Debian GNU/Linux for trying things out, but I can
assure you that things won't vary much in any other
distribution.</p>

<p>Now, we'll look at two of the interesting FUSE file systems I use often.</p>

<h3>Flickrfs</h3>

<p>Flickrfs is available from <a
   href="http://manishrjain.googlepages.com/flickrfs">the author's
   home page</a>. It is written in <a
   href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> and uses the FUSE API. As
   the name suggests, it provides a convenient interface to most of
   the things you can do on the <a
   href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> service's website through a
   convenient file system interface.</p>

<p>To start using it, extract the flickrfs
tarball, edit <tt>config.txt</tt> there to set the preferred
resolution, browser and timeout values. Create a directory called
<tt>.flickrfs</tt> in your home directory, and place the
<tt>config.txt</tt> file there. Create a mount point for your Flickr
account; I chose <tt>~/Flickr</tt>, but you can choose any
directory. If you use a proxy server to access internet, set your HTTP
proxy by doing <tt>export http_proxy="http://proxyserver:port"</tt>
with appropriate proxy server and port. Then, it is just a matter of
doing

<pre>
python flickrfs.py ~/Flickr
</pre>

<p>Now, your sets are automatically loaded. To see all your photos,
create a directory called stream, and <tt>cd</tt> to it or load it in
your file or photo manager (Konqueror, nautilus, gwenview, F-spot, to
name a few). The directory will be populated with all your Flickr
images. Similarly, there exist two subdirectories in the <tt>tags</tt>
directory, namely <tt>public</tt> and <tt>personal</tt>.  Now, to see
all of your images which you tagged with <tt>tag1</tt> and
<tt>tag2</tt> and <tt>tag3</tt>, merely create a directory called
<tt>tag1:tag2:tag3</tt> in personal, and <tt>cd</tt> to it or view it
in a file manager. A similar subdirectory in public would show
everyone's public images with those tags. Just copy photos from the
directories to your hard disk folders. Nice?</p>

<p>Many more features, like uploading being a simply copy, editing
metadata, changing date, time, permissions, license etc. are available. See <a
href="http://manishrjain.googlepages.com/flickrfs">http://manishrjain.googlepages.com/flickrfs</a>
for information.</p>

<p>To unmount when you are done using the Flickr account, just use
<tt>fusermount</tt> like this:

<pre>
fusermount -u ~/Flickr
</pre>

<p>Replace <tt>~/Flickr</tt> with your mount point.</p>

<h3>curlftpfs: Mount FTP servers</h3>

<p>This is something that I really love! Accessing a FTP server as though it's
contents were on directories on your own computer! Just get
<tt>curlftpfs</tt> from the <a
href="http://curlftpfs.sf.net/">curlftpfs page</a>, install it
using the standard <tt>./configure; make; make install</tt>, or install
the package available for you distribution, and just do something like this:

<pre>
[kumar@debian ~] mkdir IITM_Mirror
[kumar@debian ~] curlftpfs ftp.iitm.ac.in IITM_Mirror/
[kumar@debian ~] cd IITM_Mirror/
[kumar@debian ~/IITM_Mirror] ls
...
README          debian...
</pre>

<p>That's it! I have used <tt>IITM_Mirror</tt> as the mount point for the
mirror. You can now mount FTP servers, even with password login, so that
you can do uploads as well. Do <tt>curlftpfs -h</tt> for learning how
to mount servers with login for write access and using proxies. To
unmount, use <tt>fusermount -u ~/IITM_Mirror</tt>.</p>

<p>Also you can add 

<pre>
curlftpfs#ftp.iitm.ac.in /home/&lt;youruser&gt;/IITM_Mirror fuse rw,uid=1000,user,noauto      0   0
</pre>

to your <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> and then use <tt>mount
/home/&lt;youruser&gt;/IITM_Mirror</tt> to mount and <tt>umount /home/&lt;youruser&gt;/IITM_Mirror:</tt> to unmount the FTP directory</p>



<p>(Change uid of 1000 to the userid you get when you type <tt>id</tt> on your
console).</p>

<h3>Is that all?</h3>
<p>So, do you think this is cool? Don't say no before you have seen the other
possibilities at the <a
href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/FileSystems">FUSE
file system list</a>. There are some very useful file systems to
be explored; do try them out. Also, FUSE is not restricted to just
network based services; it acts as a layer for using various
filesystems and external devices as well. For example,
<tt>gphotofs</tt> mounts a GPhoto compatible camera as a file
system. <tt>DVDfs</tt> allows a DVD video structure to be recreated
on another disk. A filesystem for mounting iPods is also
available. The possibilities with FUSE are endless!</p>

<h3>A Tip</h3>

<p>Before signing off, I'll give you one tip which might be
useful. Sometimes, especially when you have an erratic network connection,
the network based FUSE filesystems might not respond well, and cause a bit
of trouble. Under those situations, you may not be able to do a clean
unmount using <tt>fusermount -u</tt>. Under those situations, you can
force a <em>lazy</em> unmount using <tt>fusermount -u -z</tt> and try
mounting the file system again.</p>

<p>Although I know that I haven't written much in this article, I hope
that it was sufficient to provide you with a glimpse of how powerful and
convenient FUSE can be, with two sample file systems. Please try it
out, and enjoy the benefits of mounting almost anything as a file
system; be sure to try out other file systems, especially the popular
<tt>gmailfs</tt>, <tt>smbnetfs</tt> and the like.</p>
