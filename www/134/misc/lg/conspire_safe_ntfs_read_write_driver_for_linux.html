(I'm posting that URL for future reference, since I expect to keep
hearing people say for <em>years</em> into the future that Linux NTFS 
support is unsafe.)

The author is the same gentleman who wrote ntfsresize, and helped me
extensively with my knowledgebase's article on NTFS resizing.

   [announcement] ntfs-3g: open source read-write driver  
   2006-07-14 10:39
</p>

<p>
   As part of the Linux-NTFS project, I'm happy to announce my
   contribution to ntfsmount and libntfs which resulted ntfs-3g, a
   read-write ntfs driver, capable for unlimited file creation and
   deletion.
 
   The driver was successfully tested very exhaustively for a longer
   period of time by many ways and methods, creating and destroying
   millions of files and directories on newly created images, and on
   over 40 real, very diverse NTFS images collected over the last four
   years.
 
   The README file is copied below which includes more general,
   performance and quality information with answers and future plans.
 
   Please make a backup of your NTFS volume by ntfsclone and try to
   reproducible break ntfs-3g, if you can. If you are able to do so
   then please let us know, preferable providing your NTFS metadata
   image, if it couln't be reproduced by other ways.
 
   The driver can be downloaded from
 	
   <a href="http://mlf.linux.rulez.org/mlf/ezaz/ntfs-3g-20070714-BETA.tgz">http://mlf.linux.rulez.org/mlf/ezaz/ntfs-3g-20070714-BETA.tgz</a>
 
   Please note that I'm leaving for an over 5,000 km long Far North and
   Arctic Ocean advanture on Sunday morning (European time) and won't be
   able to read and answer emails for almost a month (no, I'm not
   escaping, I plan to come back alive ;). Originally I planned to fix
   all the minor issues listed below but no more time left for me and I
   think it's better to release now, in case I would get lost somewhere
   on the road ;) Well, actually I hope that most issues will be
   resolved when I'm back!
 
   Happy testing, problem reporting and coding,
 
        -- Szaka

I expect I'll be needing to Google-search this post quite a lot, in the
future, to refute the inevitable claims to the contrary.

&gt; More FUSE fun in progress: ZFS!

<p>
Go, Ricardo Correia!
</p>

<p>
FUSE rocks.  It's especially nice with NTFS, for two reasons:
</p>

<p>
1.  NTFS is pretty darned complex, and so Szaka's driver's implementation
is necessarily likewise, even though it still punts (non-corruptingly) on
about a dozen corner cases and doesn't yet handle permissions and
ownership:  When implemented in userspace, filesystem code choking can't 
bring down the entire system.
</p>

<p>
2.  Red Hat (and perhaps others) still declines to include any NTFS
driver in Linux distro kernels, on what are suspected to be patent
grounds.  FUSE lets people easily retrofit Szaka's ntfsmount fork
without touching their kernels.
</p>

<p>
Even with the theoretical overhead of running entirely in userspace,
Szaka's driver yields test results (using bonnie++) several times faster
than ext3's.  Adding support for file rights and those corner cases will
undoubtedly slow it down, but still....
