Open Source Petition
</font>
</H3> 
<P> 
Date: Sat, 05 Dec 1998 15:20:19 -0500<BR> 
A petition has recently been launched asking the General Services
Administration of the US Government to evaluate Open Source software
(OSS) alongside commercial software whenever it buys or upgrades
computers. The goal of the petition, written by Prof. Clay Shirky and
sponsored by the Open Source Iniative and O'Reilly and Associates, and
hosted on www.e-thepeople.com, is to point out that OSS has reached a
level of quality, reliability and support that makes it competitive with
existing commercial products. 
<P> 
The ultimate hope is to get vendors of Open Source software included
in contract bids for Federal Government work.
<P>

Debian Project Adopts a Constitution
</font>
</H3> 
<P> 
December 14, 1998<BR> 
The Debian Project adopted a constitution which can be viewed at 
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/devel/constitution/">
http://www.debian.org/devel/constitution/</A>.  The highlights of the 
constitution include the creation of the Technical Committee, the Project 
Leader postion, the Project Secretary position, Leader Delegate positions 
and a voting proceedure.  The constitution was proposed in September 1998, 
and after a discussion period the vote took place in December 1998.  It was 
virtually unanimously in favor with 86 valid votes.
<P> 
The discussion about the constitution began in early 1998 and was carried 
out on the Debian mailing lists.  Most of the discussion can be found in the 
archives of the debian-devel mailing list at http://www.debian.org/Lists-Ar
chives/.  Details of the vote can be found at http://www.debian.org/vote/19
99/vote_0000.
<P> 
The constitution describes the organisational structure for formal 
decisionmaking within the Debian Project.  As Debian continues to grow, this 
will be a valuable document to ensure that Debian continues to evolve and 
grow with the input and contributions from its membership.

NetBeans Announces Support for the Java Development Kit 1.2
</font>
</H3> 
<P>
New York, Java Business Expo, December 8, 1998 - NetBeans today announced
that its Java(tm) IDE, NetBeans DeveloperX2, supports and runs on Sun
Microsystems, Inc.'s Java Development Kit (JDK version 1.2).  This
latest release of the JDK provides a rich feature set of new class
libraries and tools, making it easier than ever for developers to create
portable, distributed, enterprise-class applications.  Sun's announcement
of the availability of the next version of the JDK was made today during
the Java Business Expo in New York.  NetBeans Developer X2 2.1
(beta) supports JDK 1.2 and uses it internally.  It is available to
NetBeans' Early Access Program participants. 
<P>
In addition to overall performance improvements, Sun's new version of the
JDK enhances the NetBeans IDE by offering features such as drag 'n drop,
Beans enhancements, collections, JDBC 2.0, and Swing 1.1.  Among other new
features, NetBeans DeveloperX2 will utilize the new APIs for grouping
and manipulating objects of different types and for extending server
functionality.  JDK 1.2 will also strengthen NetBeans users' ability to
design more user-friendly interfaces, process images, address multilingual
requirements, use stylized text, and print.
<P>
The final release of NetBeans DeveloperX2 2.1 will be available in
January, 1999.  NetBeans Developer will also be available in a concurrent
version, which will continue to support JDK 1.1.x.  NetBeans Enterprise,
a multi-user edition of the IDE due in Beta version in January, 1999, will
support JDK 1.2.  The full release of this edition of the IDE is due in
Spring, '99.

KDE on Corel's Netwinder
</font>
</H3> 
<P>
Ottawa, Canada--November 25, 1998--<BR> 
Corel Computer and the KDE project today announced a technology relationship
that will bring the K Desktop Environment (KDE), a sophisticated graphical
user environment for Linux and UNIX, to future desktop versions of the
NetWinder family of Linux-based thin-clients and thin-servers. A graphical
user interface is a necessary element for Corel Computer to create a family of
highly reliable, easy-to-use, easy-to-manage desktop computers. The alliance
between Corel Computer and KDE, a non-commercial association of Open Source
programmers, provides NetWinder users a sophisticated front-end to Linux,
a stable and robust Unix-like operating system.
<P>
Corel Computer has shipped a number of NetWinder DM, or development
machines, to KDE developers who are helping to port the desktop environment.
Additionally, NetWinder.Org developers, Raffaele Saena and John Olson,
were responsible for championing development of KDE on the NetWinder. Corel
Computer plans to announce the availability of desktop versions of the
NetWinder running KDE beginning in early 1999. Early demonstrations of
the port, such as the one shown at the Open Systems fair in Wiesbaden,
Germany, in September, have been enthusiastically received by potential
customers.
<P>
Based on the Open Source model, Corel Computer is devoting internal
development resources to the improvement of the KDE project including rigorous
testing of the environment on the NetWinder. As a developing partner, Corel
Computer will release its work back to the KDE development community.

New Perl Module Enables Application Developers to Use XML
</font>
</H3> 
<P>
Date: Wed, 25 Nov 1998 06:36:08 -0800 (PST)<BR> 
Sebastopol, CA--Perl is the language operating behind the scenes of
most dynamic Web sites. XML (Extensible Markup Language) is emerging as
a core standard for Web development. Now a new Perl module (or
extension) known as XML::Parser allows Perl programmers building
applications to use XML, and provides an efficient, easy way to parse
(break down and process) XML document parts.
<P>
Perl is renowned for its superior text processing capabilities; XML is
text that contains markup tags and structures. Thus Perl's support for
XML offers a natural expansion of the capabilities of both.
<P>
XML::Parser is built upon a C library, expat, that is very fast and
robust. Perl, expat and XML::Parser are all Unicode-aware; that is,
they read encoding declarations and perform necessary conversions into
Unicode, a system for "the interchange, processing, and display of the
written texts of the diverse languages of the modern world"
(http://www.unicode.org/). Thus a single XML document written in Perl
can now contain Greek, Hebrew, Chinese and Russian in their proper
scripts. Expat was authored by James Clark, a highly respected leader
in the SGML/XML community.
