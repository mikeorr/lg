<h1>Away Mission - 2008 in Review - part 2</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>

<p>
March is conference madness month in the San Francisco Bay Area with
week-to-week events that sometimes overlap. For the last few years, Open
Source developers and entrepreneurs have had EclipseCon, Dr. Dobb's
Software Development Conference (SD West), and the Open Source Business
Conference to choose from. Starting in 2008, if that audience was
interested in FOSS on mobile platforms, there was also the Emerging
Communications Conference (eComm), which was reviewed in <a
href="../159/dyckoff.html">part 1</a> last month.
</p>

<h3>EclipseCon-08</h3>
 
<p>
This conference actually went up a little in value in 2008 even with a
higher price because the tutorials were open to all conference
attendees. 
</p>

<p>
While EclipseCon is primarily about the Eclipse platform and the tools
for its myriad projects, it is also about community and the larger Open
Source ecosystem. There are sessions on creating and nurturing
communities, on the future directions of Java, and on the new scripting
languages that are supported on the Eclipse platform. There are
presentations and panels on software deployment, modeling languages, and
even SQL. In short, it's a really big tent.  The tracks were well defined
and taken all together were very comprehensive. Among the track topics were
Eclipse as a Platform, OSGi, SOA, Modeling, Performance, Web Tools, and
Emerging Technologies among others. However, some topics have sessions
that are scattered across different rooms. The EclipseCon color codes help
a bit with this to a degree, but with 8-10 simultaneous sessions, you could
be in for a little exercise.
</p>
 
<!--Previous paragraph's laundry list is incoherent, and what's with the
capitalization? Not sure where to go here.  KTO) -->

<p>
IBM held its own track on Tuesday, featuring its OpenUP Agile toolset and
the Agile-oriented Jazz collaboration suite, both heavily based on Eclipse.
In Jazz, and in Rational Team Concert, the team process is selected from
process templates including Scrum, OpenUP, and the Eclipse Way (or EPF,
the Eclipse Process Framework). You can also mix elements from these
processes in custom configurations reflecting the actual work process at
your own company or organization. Jazz uses Eclipse technology on both the
client and the server, and Team Concert provides agile teams with an
integrated tool set including source control, work item tracking and build
management with continuous integration.  The EclipseCon sessions are
<a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2008/?page=sub/&amp;id=593">summarized here</a>.
</p>

<!-- I have no idea what "team process is selected from" means  KTO) -->

<!-- As I understand it, it's a decision on which methodology the team will
use in order to accomplish their task. All of the above workshops are about
frameworks that are used to structure large projects. - Ben -->

<p>
This is a very good set of collaboration tools, having been tested within
Eclipse Projects for more than a year and also getting the benefit of
IBM's own experience with the Rational RUP methodology, now available
as OpenUP. Some of this effort is occurring via the Project Zero website at
<a href="http://projectzero.org">http://projectzero.org</a>.
</p>

<p>
The presentations from the IBM Track are not in the EclipseCon archive for
2008, but here's a <a
href="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/rtc/v1r0m0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.team.platform.doc/topics/c_jazz-platform-about.html">
link</a> to a representative Jazz web site at IBM Rational.</p>
 
<p>
I also attended a great late session on Groovy, a dynamic scripting
language that runs on JVMs. Groovy reduces the usual Java scaffolding for
developing code and simplifies Java syntax. Semicolons are optional and it
doesn't require getters and setters for each property; Groovy just does the
right thing. Groovy also simplifes testing right out of box, working
directly with JUnit. Groovy objects are called POGOs which are like Java
POJOs on steroids.
</p>

<p>
POGOS write their own property accessors and provide a default constructor
with named parameters. And like JRuby, Groovy compiles down to byte code.
Check out the PPT-formatted presentation here:
<a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2008/sub/attachments/Introduction_to_Groovy.ppt">Introduction to Groovy</a>.
</p>

<p>
EclipseCon offers lots of BOFs at night and several evening receptions with
food and drinks. I especially recommend the annual Poster Session where new
projects are presented by their developers with a pleasant dinner buffet.
The Higgins credential framework, for example, was just such a poster
presentation four years ago and is now widely used.
</p> 

<p>
Each morning had Euro breakfasts: brioche, bagels, and pastry with coffee
and tea. Sit-down lunches were the pattern again, with each table sporting
signage for different Eclipse topics and projects (EMF,RCP, AJAX, etc.)
There was plenty of choice here and lots of special meal categories were
coordinated. And beside networking opportunities, the food was pretty good.
The conference bag for 2008 was unfortunately just a canvas tote, but it did
have a zipper closure. Previous years have had distinctive backpacks.
</p>
 
<p>
EclipseCon generally gives attendees USB thumb drives with about half of
the conference presentations. The other presentations are available a day
or two after their sessions and can be added at update stations. Some
sessions show up weeks later. I personally think that is a problem for
attendees planning their day with so many sessions overlapping. Moreover,
many of the sessions on the USB drive get revised right before being
presented. Consequently, the update sessions are very busy and are a bit of
a bottle neck.
</p>
 
<p>
I also have to report a flaw in what is normally a very well organized
mid-sized conference. The check-in process on the first tutorial day backed
up badly and many attendees had to wait in line for 20-35 minutes. Clearly,
they didn't have enough stations and personnel to check IDs and hand out
badges and bags. But it was also asymmetric! They had 6 stations set up,
each handling 4 letters of the alphabet, the last station also handling Y
and Z. Last year, the A-D group was twice as long as any other and took the
longer 35 minute interval. They should have gone through the list of
registrants and set the letter groups up for roughly equal numbers of
attendees. So plan on showing up at least 30 minutes before your tutorial
if you want to attend EclipseCon this year.
</p>

<p>
Last year,  EclipseCon was be held March 17-20, the week before the Open
Source Business Conference (OSBC), but for 2009, EclipseCon is March 24-27,
and overlaps OSBC.
</p>

</p>

 
<h3>The Business of Open Source - OSBC</h3>
 
 
<p>
OSBC started a few years ago by discussing issues in OSS and legal
ramifications. In prior years, a lot of energy went into software patents
and the then-new <a
href="http://gplv3.fsf.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">GPLv3</a>. But in
2008, with few dragons left to slay, it was mostly about successful
adoption of OSS at the enterprise level. There were several presentations
on best practices and several case studies. For example, Weather.com and
Kaplan.com, the learning center company, revealed the works behind the
curtains a bit.
</p>

<p>
There are four tracks that run consistently over the two days of the conference:
one for CTOs, one for CFOs, one for lawyers or those interested in legal
topics, and a product and service track which also doubles as a track for
emerging trends. Each track has a dedicated room in close proximity to the
other sessions. There is little exercise in changing tracks here.
</p>

<p>
The agenda page lists the four parallel sessions and also has links to the
those presentations that are available online. Unfortunately, some of the better
presentations are not included, such as the opening keynote.
</p>

<p>
A more concrete presentation on the merits of going Open Source showed how
two developers moved the back end at the New York Times to FOSS. That led to
indexing 11 million PDF files, over 1.5 TB of data, in 24 hours with Amazon
Web Services and Hadoop for only $240. Now those files can be served with
the existing infrastructure and no new hardware. That presentation is here:
<a href="http://akamai.infoworld.com/event/osbc/08/docs/CIO-CTO-Gottfrid-Harris.pdf">http://akamai.infoworld.com/event/osbc/08/docs/CIO-CTO-Gottfrid-Harris.pdf</a>
</p>

<p>
OSBC takes place at the Palace Hotel on Market Street in San Francisco,
near an exit of the Montgomery Street BART station and near several major
bus lines. This is a great location and allows attendees to use public
transportation easily. It is also a nice venue with a touch of Victorian
ambiance. However, power for laptops is an issue. Some rooms have power
strips near the front, but this is up to the organizers and was not true of
all session rooms. There are no power strips in the keynote room. The
moral here is to bring your own extension cord and maybe a multi-outlet
adapter to encourage sharing. We can all get along, right?
</p>

<p>
OSBC has usually provided a full breakfast buffet in the mornings, which is
taken away just before the keynotes start. So come fairly early to enjoy it
and to get a good seat.
</p>

<p>
The Open Source Business Conference will be held March 24-25, 2009. Last
year, OSBC followed EclipseCon, but in 2009, they will overlap.
</p>

<p>
For 2009, OSBC will have keynotes from Ron Hovsepian, CEO of Novell; Jim
Whitehurst, CEO of Red Hat; Jonathan Schwartz, CEO of Sun Microsystems; and a
mystery speaker from Microsoft (yes, Redmond has a presence at OSBC.) There
will also be a keynote panel on the topic of "End Users and Linux: Do We
Have a Participation Problem?" led by Jim Zemlin, Executive Director of the Linux
Foundation.
</p>


<h3>SDWEST-08</h3>

<p>
Software Development West, or SD West, usually occurs in early March. Like
EclipseCon, SD West is held at the Santa Clara Convention Center. But the
perks and grub are more limited. The dates for 2009 are
March 9-13. This year, SD West is co-located with the Mobile Connect
conference.
</p>

<p>
The tracks here are expansive and cover most of the software development
lifecycle. The SD conference organizers claim to provide a global view of
the software industry and technological developments. There are separate
tracks for Java, C++, .Net, Web services, Agile processes, and security,
among others. New this year is the topical Cloud Computing and also a track
on Parallelism in software.
</p>

<p>
Another nice feature is the range of vendor-sponsored free technical
sessions. This year some of those sessions will be conducted by Coverity and
Open Make.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately for our readers, SD conference archives and presentations are
only available to conference attendees. The parent company for SD and Dr.
Dobbs - CMP - resells the content. So you have to go to SD West to get it.
</p>

<p>
I attended a lot of sessions on Agile process, modeling, and data
architecture. Many of these sessions were led by Scott Ambler or other
Agile leaders. I was generally satisfied with the sessions. I also attended
sessions on Web services and XML servers and distributed Ruby applications
which discussed SOAP4R, DRb and Rinda (which is a Ruby version of Linda, a
primitive paradigm for parallel processing).
</p>

<p>
An informative session on the developments surrounding HTML 5 was led by
Elliot Rusty Harold. Work around this emerging standard began accelerating
in 2008, because Microsoft finally decided to support the new standards
as the default behavior in IE-8. If they hadn't, it would have been a big
stumbling block.
</p>

<p>
Another somewhat tongue-in-cheek session discussed "Anti-Patterns in
Software Development".
</p>

<p>
The presenter, Rob Daigneau, was Director of Architecture at Monster.com
and currently host of www.designpatternsfor.net (he will also appear again
at this year's SD West, speaking on "Design Patterns for Domain Services").
Fortunately, he posts his presentations on that Web site and a 2007 version
of the slides are available <a
href="http://www.designpatternsfor.net/Presentations/AntiPatternsInSoftwareProjects.TheHumanFactor.V2.pdf">there</a>
as well.
</p>

<p>
Anti-patterns look like a good idea but backfire badly when applied. Here,
the anti-patterns referred to are ones of human behavior in SW projects, based
on roles and on personality types. Many of these behaviors impede the
success of a SW project. Among the personalities discussed were Code
Controllers, Perfectionists, Workaholics, and other behavior patterns for
managers and leaders.
</p>

<p>
The underlying anti-patterns include a lack of trust in team mates, or
optimizing too soon and too often, or - for Workaholics - too readily
accepting a culture of burnout at the companies we work for.
</p>

<p>
Daigneau spoke about larger organizational factors: a Fight Club mentality
that no one talks about with conflicts between groups or between tech leads
and architects and even between top executives. Daigneau noted that "fish
rot from the head down", meaning that real and sustained changes require
acceptance and support from top executives, who ultimately have
responsibility for lingering organizational problems.
</p>

<p>
What if the boss is a repeat offender? Daigneau says there are 3 choices:
adapt and adopt your boss' point of view, getting your boss or bosses to
change their practices, or to move on. That's the way the project
crumbles!
</p>

<p>
SD West has a lot of traditions and one of those is its campy Developer
Bowl, where teams from leading ISVs compete in a contest of technical and
industry trivia. Over the years the questions and the answers have gotten
pretty broad. Two years back, when Microsoft fielded a team, they appeared
in costume: Darth Vader and two Imperial Storm Troopers.
</p>

<p>
There are two matched competitions and then the winners of each face off. The
Developer Bowl in 2008 featured the return of Team Google, last year's
winner. But first up was CodeGear vs. IBM, last year's second place winner. IBM
passed them with ease to win the first set.
</p>

<p>
Second up was Google and Intel. Tim Matson of Intel introduced himself as a
kayaking instructor after his more senior team mates had introduced
themselves with variously 12 to 22 years of experience at Intel. The
Googlers responded with a wry ploy of each claiming 42 years of work at
Google, an indirect tribute to Douglas Adams of "Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Universe" fame. Intel, initially behind, pulled ahead on the last question
after a long tie.
</p>

<p>
In what was a close match with a tie score, IBM pulled ahead of Intel
during overtime. Several of the last computer trivia questions stumped both
teams, e.g.: "How are Dr. Dobbs and Kurt Cobain related?" (Answer, via
Courtney Love who was a relation of Dr. Dobbs). IBM prevailed in the end
after receiving the question about the number of "pockets" on an old punch
card reader - easy trivia for old IBMers. (The answer was a non-metric
'12', something typical of original IBM equipment. And for readers not old
enough to remember, the size of an IBM punch card matched the size of a
1950's dollar since every card reader represented cash for IBM.)
</p>

<p class="editorial">
[ Unfortunately, this is incorrect: the IBM card of the 1950s - actually
designed in 1928 - was 7.375" by 3.25" in size, while the US dollar bill,
the current size of which was set in 1929, is 6.14" by 2.61". The origin of
this myth is relatively obvious: the original Hollerith card of 1887 was
indeed the same size as the (large) US paper dollar of that time.
Suggestions for the choice of size were that the inventor, H. Hollerith,
felt that people would treat it with respect due to the similarity; that
boxes for currency were cheaply available; and that equipment for handling
media of that size was already being made for the US Treasury. However,
there is no actual evidence or support for any of these, and they must
remain urban legends. -- Ben ]
