I am a member of the network group at a university in Atlanta Georgia,
some time ago we had a minor DOS from off campus to our main DNS server,
at that time we decided to only allow outside connections from our
service provider (Peachnet) and block all others with our firewall. We
seem now to have a problem with the root "EDU" servers.
<pre>
;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
edu.                    172800  IN      NS      M3.NSTLD.COM.
edu.                    172800  IN      NS      A3.NSTLD.COM.
edu.                    172800  IN      NS      C3.NSTLD.COM.

They cannot resolve anything in our domain including our primary DNS
server. Do we need to include these servers in our rule base ?
How do we protect against a DOS attack on our DNS servers ?

I'm not really sure that this has anything to do with Linux, but since
running a DNS server is such a common thing to do on a Linux box, I'll
give a shot at answering this one.
</p>

<p>
I certainly can't call myself a DNS guru, but the problem as stated
seems a bit simplistic (if an upstream non-authoritative server can't
get to your server to do a transfer, then - of course - it's not going
to be able to resolve for you once that refresh interval has elapsed.)
However, if you're asking something more complex than that - and I have
a feeling that you are - then you need to a) frame your question beter
(i.e., what is in your rule base? What transfer method are you using?
What DNS server software? What firewall method?) and b) give us more
pertinent information (i.e., what have you already tried?  What
information did you get from your troubleshooting so far? What IP/domain
name[s] are you using? [1])
</p>

<p>
Ron, I suggest that you take a look at "Asking Questions of The Answer
Gang" at '<a href="../../../tag/ask-the-gang.html">http://linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html</a>' and see if
following the suggested process brings up any new insights. If you still
don't have it solved, feel free to write us again - but do include as
much relevant information as possible next time.
</p>


<p>
[1] This may not matter much, given your stated firewalling policy, but
we might have somebody here who has access to Peachnet and can do some
DNS lookups. Stranger things have been known to happen.

Good, complex question. The answer is, "it's tough but there are some
things you can do to both prevent and mitigate it." On a larger scale,
the problem is like that of spam: it's going to take a critical mass of
smart, educated sysadmins and self-policing in the DNS world to really
bring that stuff to a halt. Here are the things that you can do (other
folks with a DNS clue, feel free to jump in):
</p>

<p>
1) Vet your rule set carefully to prevent UDP-based spoofing.
</p>

<p>
2) Configure your servers to do recursive look-ups for your other DNS
servers <strong>only</strong> (by "your", I mean "domains you trust" - not necessarily
servers under your direct control.) <strong>Don't</strong> do recursion if you don't
need to.
</p>

<p>
3) Delete RR records for expired domains.
</p>

<p>
4) Ask your ISP to find out what they're using - if anything - to detect
and block that kind of traffic. If they're not, use your leverage to
gently hint (using a large, blunt implement if necessary) that they
should visit the year 2006 once in a while.
</p>

<p>
5) Get familiar with how these attacks work. I recommend the
well-written "DNS Amplification Attacks", by Randal Vaughn and Gadi
Evron ('<a href="http://www.isotf.org/news/DNS-Amplification-Attacks.pdf">http://www.isotf.org/news/DNS-Amplification-Attacks.pdf</a>') - it
focuses on DDoS attacks, which are a superset of DOS attacks. The
authors have suggestions of of their own, which are also important:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
*    DNS name servers facing the world should not be the same ones
     serving users or clients in your network.
*    Limit usage of the DNS name server and the recursive functionality
     to your network.
*    Implement spoofing counter-measures such as those suggested in BCP
     38 and SAC004.
</pre>
That should be enough to keep you busy for a while. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
