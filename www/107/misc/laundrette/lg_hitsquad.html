<p>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
Jimmy, who did you have to take out this time?  

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Uh... yeah, ignore my last e-mail. It was a knife fight. You should
see the other guy.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Yeah, but did you apply the coup-de-grace and leave our business card?

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
"Business card". That little flick of the knife always did give me trouble. 

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Come <u>on</u>. We practiced, over and over. I mean, how hard is it to carve
that little trademark symbol, after all? Sure, the blood tends to
obscure that 14-pt Tekton Italic script you prefer, but I'd <u>told</u> you
you should have stuck with 24-pt Verdana. I mean, if people can't see
our name, how do you expect to get new business? The TV ad was a <b>flop.</b>

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
I keep telling you, if it has more of a look of the occult, it's more likely 
to make it into the news.

<p>"Do you have people problems? We can help you remove any obstacles in your 
life". In hindsight, of course they were going to think we're a self-help group. 

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
And did you remember to bill the client? It's those little details that
mean so much.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
I don't have to remember, they do. I'll get you a cuckoo clock. 

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Oh yes... right. <u>I'm</u> the one that prefers to keep it on a friendly
basis with the clients; you <b>like</b> squeezing the cash out of them when
they forget.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Hey, look, just because I like to remind them that it's not just a job, it's 
also my hobby...

<p>I just prefer the psychological angle. If I can have the ... "other person" 
do most of my work for me, all the better. 

<p>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
And stop hanging around Ben.  He's a bad influence on you.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
What are you <u>talking</u> about? It's a partnership. Jimmy takes care of
the "wet work" on his side of the Atlantic; I take care of any
assasination contracts that come up over here (I also have quite a fine
side business in mutilation, murder, mayhem, and, umm, Maytag washers
and dryers. Where did you think the term "wholesale slaughter" came
from? [1]) We're thinking of branching out to the Eastern markets, too,
but we're arguing over the name: I think "Youth in Asia" has quite a
ring to it, but Jimmy insists that it's just <b>too</b> cute for this type of
serious business. Now, I ask you: if you can't laugh at people's guts
being blown through their spines by a 50-cal slug, or someone strangling
on sulfuric acid in their Heart-Healthy (tm) salad, or some shmuck being
incinerated in his shower (ahh, the wonders of liquid sodium), what
<b>can</b> you laugh at?

<blockquote>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Ben, how many times? You don't laugh; you cackle, you grin, but if at all 
possible, you toss out a deadpan one-liner.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Oh. Right, yes. Emphasis on "dead", although I'd initially read it as
"debian one-liner". Which reminds me - we could hook up a bunch of TNT
inside a computer case, to be triggered by a specially-crafted TCP
packet... it would have to run Wind0ws, of course; a Linux firewall could
shoot that plan down in flames. So to speak.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
I'm not sure if that'd work - how can we be sure it'd run long enough
between crashes to be activated? On the other hand, it'd bring a whole
new meaning to ... no, I won't go there.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
And "Youth in Asia" - come on, after that TV ad, we're going to have to turn 
away Boy Scouts. Though a lot of the skills <b>are</b> the same - rope work, 
knife handling... 

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
..., rope work, Girl Scout handling... perhaps we should consider a
sideline? I mean, we've already spent the money on the ad; might as well
take advantage.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
OK, but no cub scouts - just teenagers, who should be feeling pretty
murderous anyway.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
<p>[1] Other than pTerry, that is.

<blockquote><em> [Nope, it's a first. pTerry did have</em> 'The place looked 
as though it had been visited by Genghiz Cohen. *

<p>* Hence the term "wholesale destruction."'
<cite>"Lords and Ladies"</cite>

<p><em>The only quote I can find mentioning pTerry and "wholesale slaughter" 
is <a href="http://members.tripod.com/neil_hopkins/docs/pratchet.htm">here</a>:</em>

<p>
'Opening the discussion out to questions from the floor, Terry talked about 
his love of the 'Tombraider' games with the improbably large breasted Lara 
Croft. He excused the wholesale slaughter of endangered species on the 
grounds that they get in the way of the gorgeous scenery. He then wondered 
where all of the stuff that you find in these games appears from - "Perhaps 
there should be a 'Tombstocker' game where you run around a large maze filling 
it with guns, ammo and keys ..."']

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Hey, I didn't violate any international treaties or nuthin'. Well, not
any important treaties.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Darn. We usually get to charge a hefty premium for those. See if you can
negotiate that up-front, next time; I've never liked taking a client to
court over those finicky little details.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
"Court". Ben, you have such a magical way with words  :) 

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Well, we have to keep it in polite terms. Somebody here could faint.

I bloody knew it! All this spam is actually carrying encrypted messages

[Rolling eyes] Man, don't you recognize business correspondence when you
see it? I swear, we're going to have to hire a secretary if you keep
going on like this. Look:

<b>Sigh</b> Sorry. Too many late nights, you know?

The target. Looks like one of those foreign types... Minnesota or
Wisconsin or something. Might be one of yours, of course - Manx or
Scottish, possibly. We'll have to hit the Yellow Pages.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Manx, probably. Although there have been some Polish people moving in
around here recently...

<pre>
Recently you filled out a information request form regarding
                                      ^^^^^^^

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Well, he's <u>polite,</u> anyway. Some clients figure they can order you
around, just because they're paying a measly coupla hundred grand... I
swear, I'm getting tired of being so <u>nice</u> to people. The other day,
some guy wanted to argue with me when I got ready to put a .45 slug in
the middle of his forehead - I mean, <b>really,</b> what's the world coming
to? "Behind the left ear with a .380," he says to me, "is how the guy on
TV always does it. This forehead stuff won't <u>look</u> right!" Now, I'm as
much of a people person as the next guy, but that was just <u>too</u> much; I
just walked away. Let <u>him</u> do it to himself if he thinks he's so
clever!

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Sheesh. Some people just don't have any appreciation.

<p>
<strong>[Brad]</strong>
Since when do you have a .45? I thought you were a rifle sniper! And
what about your dark glasses?

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
It's all about using the right tool for the job - well, OK, sometimes
it's about taking bets to see how far the blood will fly, but mostly
it's about taking distance, target area, etc. into account.

<p>
<strong>[Brad]</strong>
So a .45 is good for a back-alley ruckus but the sniper rifle is
reserved for long-distance snipping?

<blockquote>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Yeah, something like that. I prefer the personal touch - you know, get
to really know the person. I like to feel we get to know each other well
enough that they'd rather do my work for me. <b>Really</b> cuts down the
paperwork.
</blockquote>

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
What, you want the secrets of our business, just like that? This ain't
Open Source, buddy... Of course, you could always apply for a job here.
We'd start you off slowly, garroting and leg-breaking and such, but if
you work hard and persevere, you'll get the full company training
package. It's really wonderful; they start you off with Steely-Eyed
Glare 101 and Wearing Your Weapons With Style, and go on from there.

<blockquote>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Make sure you stick around for <b>all</b> of the classes though. You can't
use "Steely-Eyed Glare" without "Knowing Smile", for example, and you
really don't want to use "Wearing Your Weapons With Style" until you've
learned "Custom Tailoring". "Wearing Your Weapons With Style" will teach
you some of the basics, or course, like having a few inches added to the
chest of a jacket, or the various tradeoffs between cuff sizes, but not
how to look for possible snag areas.
</blockquote>

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Oh, and we have a very progressive health plan, all handled in-house:
"Doctor" Louie (you <b>don't</b> want to know why they call him that) has
discovered that no matter how bad something hurts, he can make you
forget <u>all</u> about it, almost instantly.

<blockquote>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Just always have a supply of whiskey is all I'll say.
</blockquote>

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
(You may want to buy some supplementary medical care, just in case. All
the rest of us do; odd coincidence, that.)

<blockquote>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Yeah. You get to pick the drink, and actually drink some of it.

Ah. So, <i>mort</i> - not mutilation or extortion or anything like that.

Oh fooey. No fun.

Oh, more than one target, eh? Good, good. I'm starting to see some money

Holy Moly, now that's what <b>I</b> call a real spree! I guess he wants to
disguise who the actual targets were...

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Just as long as that is it - and not a "We're not sure who we're looking
for, here's a vague description" thing. Those get really tedious.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Oh. He wants a discount, eh? Well, it's not much of one - and the times
are kinda lean. We'll give it to him, on the condition that he won't
tell anyone - which means that everyone in town will hear about it by
tomorrow. [wink] That's the right way to do advertising.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Tomorrow? <b>Groan</b> Busy night ahead then. And I'd just started reading
"The Adventure of English" too.

<pre>
YOU ARE ONE OF THE 100 individuals.
</pre>

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Looks like a threat, huh? Well, it's not really - just a penalty clause
for non-completion, fairly standard. If we somehow manage to miss these
guys, I'll take my rocket launcher to his house and we'll, umm,
renegotiate.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
So it's OK for a renegotiation, but not when collecting payment? I mean,
come on! When's the last time you had a payment collection where they
didn't try to renegotiate?

<pre>
You have limited time to apply for this offer.
</pre>

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
He wants it done quick, too.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Right. No torture sessions. Fine by me - I start to run out of ideas
after about 60 people.

And, of course, an MD5 checksum of this last para is the number of the
Swiss account with the payment. All a standard form sort of thing,
really.

<p>

Gah. Just got back from there, and I'm getting pretty sick of chocolate.
This summer, we switch banks to somewhere like the Cayman Islands, OK?
