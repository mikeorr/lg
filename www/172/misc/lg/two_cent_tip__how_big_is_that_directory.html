<p>
At times, you may need to know exactly how big is a certain directory
(say top directory) along with all its contents and subdirectories(and
their contents). You may need this if you are copying a large diectory
along with its contents and structure.  And you may like to know if what
you got after the copy, is what you sent. Or you may need this when
trying to copy stuff on to a device where the space is limited. So you
want to make sure that you can accomodate the material you are planning
to send.
</p>

<p>
Here is a cute little script. Calling sequence::  
<pre>
howmuch &lt;top directory name&gt;
</pre>

<p>
You get a summary, which gives the total size, the number of
subdirectories, and the number of files (counted from the top
directory). Good for book-keeping.
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
###########start-howmuch-script
# Tells you how many files, subdirectories and content bytes in a
# directory
# Usage :: how much &lt;directory-path-and-name&gt;
 
# check if there is no command line argument
if [ $# -eq 0 ]
then
echo "You forgot the directory to be accounted for !"
echo "Usage :: howmuch &lt;directoryname with path&gt;"
exit
fi
 
echo "***start-howmuch***"
pwd &gt; ~/howmuch.rep
pwd
echo -n "Disk usage of directory ::" &gt; ~/howmuch.rep
echo $1 &gt;&gt; ~/howmuch.rep
echo -n "made on ::" &gt;&gt; ~/howmuch.rep
du -s $1 &gt; ~/howmuch1
tree $1 &gt; ~/howmuch2
date &gt;&gt; ~/howmuch.rep
tail ~/howmuch1 &gt;&gt; ~/howmuch.rep
tail --lines=1 ~/howmuch2 &gt;&gt; ~/howmuch.rep
cat ~/howmuch.rep
# cleanup
rm ~/howmuch1
rm ~/howmuch2
#Optional -- you can delete howmuch.rep if you want
#rm ~/howmuch.rep
 
echo "***end-howmuch***"
# <strong>  </strong>
 
 
########end-howmuch-script

Pretty much anything sent to TAG, other than flames and spam, is fodder
for discussion and publication; that's what we're all about. Now, as to
the script itself -
 
<pre class='code'>
###########start-howmuch-script
# Tells you how many files, subdirectories and content bytes in a
# directory
# Usage :: how much &lt;directory-path-and-name&gt;
 
# check if there is no command line argument
if [ $# -eq 0 ]
then
echo "You forgot the directory to be accounted for !"
echo "Usage :: howmuch &lt;directoryname with path&gt;"
exit
fi
 
echo "***start-howmuch***"
pwd &gt; ~/howmuch.rep
pwd
echo -n "Disk usage of directory ::" &gt; ~/howmuch.rep
echo $1 &gt;&gt; ~/howmuch.rep
echo -n "made on ::" &gt;&gt; ~/howmuch.rep
du -s $1 &gt; ~/howmuch1
tree $1 &gt; ~/howmuch2
date &gt;&gt; ~/howmuch.rep
tail ~/howmuch1 &gt;&gt; ~/howmuch.rep
tail --lines=1 ~/howmuch2 &gt;&gt; ~/howmuch.rep
cat ~/howmuch.rep
# cleanup
rm ~/howmuch1
rm ~/howmuch2
#Optional -- you can delete howmuch.rep if you want
#rm ~/howmuch.rep
 
echo "***end-howmuch***"
# <strong>  </strong>
 
########end-howmuch-script
</pre>

<p>
One of the standard practices in shell scripting is to stay away from
temporary files unless they're necessary (e.g., if you need to use a
program that <em>only</em> takes files as input.) What would happen, for
example, if you already had a file called 'howmuch.rep' in that
directory? For example, if you had run this script for, say, the 'foo'
directory yesterday, forgot about it, and wanted to get the results for
the 'bar' directory today? The first file would be gone - and you
wouldn't know anything about it until you wanted the data.
</p>

<p>
This is why the standard practice is to construct every program as a
filter - that is, arrange it so that it takes data in, transforms it,
and outputs it to STDOUT. What this mostly means with regard to coding
is using pipes instead of temporary files. For example (I'm going to
make an explicit effort to replicate your script's output here):
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
#!/bin/bash
# Created by Ben Okopnik on Wed Feb  3 21:57:05 EST 2010
 
[ -d "$1" ] || { printf "Usage: ${0##*/} &lt;directory&gt;\n"; exit; }
 
pwd
echo -e "Disk usage of directory ::$1\nmade on ::`date`"
du -sk "$1"
# You could use 'tree "$1"|sed -n "$p"' - or stick with the standard toolkit
ls -lR "$1"|awk '/^\//{d++};/^-/{f++}END{print d-1" directories, "f" files"}'
</pre>

<p>
This will do essentially the same thing as your script, but without any
temp files. The output can be saved to a specified file simply by
redirecting it, or it can be further filtered/modified by piping it to
another program.
</p>

<p>
YES I agree. Your script is better than mine. If you authorise me, I will
resubmit my stuff using your script (after I add a comment line
acknowledging your contribution). Or I can just use the script for my
internal usage and not submit for publication.
</p>

<p>
I thank you for your frank opinion and CONSTRUCTIVE criticism. That is how
we all learn.

Oh-oh. Context error warning! <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Partha, this wasn't any sort of competition; as an example of what
happens here, I've just sent in a Two-cent tip about using 'wget' to
download files based on directory listings - and I fully expect that
someone here will tell me that I could have done all that by using the
"--download-all-the-files-in-the-directory-listing" option or something
like that. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> The thing is, though, that it wouldn't be a question of
"better" or "worse": both methods are useful. E.g., I'd learn about the
option from the follow-up post; someone else might learn about Perl
regular expressions, which I used in my tip, from my post.
</p>

<p>
My overall point is that we share this information, these ideas, with
the Linux community - and all of us get to learn from <em>all</em> the
information in the exchange. So, my answer isn't necessarily "better"
than yours; yours may well be more useful for someone else's purposes.

<p>
There's nothing to resubmit, or authorize: TAG is open to our readers
for the exact purpose of hosting this kind of discussion. As I mentioned
the last time, all TAG content, minus flames and spam, gets published in
the Mailbag section of LG - so readers get to see the whole exchange.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; I thank you for your frank opinion and CONSTRUCTIVE criticism. That is how we
&gt; all learn.
</pre>

<p>
You're welcome! And you're right - this is indeed one of the best ways
to learn. TAG was one of the keystones of my own learning process about
Linux, especially in the early days - and it still remains a useful tool
that keeps up my skills, among other things.

<p>
Although I do not show up too often on TAG, believe me I read every issue of
LG and of course Two-cent tips.
</p>

<p>
I do use these ideas often both for myself and for teaching.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for all the great job you are doing.
