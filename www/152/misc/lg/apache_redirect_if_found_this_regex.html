Try something like this line here.
</p>

<p>
Redirect 301 /howto.jsp <a href="http://yourdomain.org/howto/index.php">http://yourdomain.org/howto/index.php</a>
</p>


<p>
Just create a new file in your conf.d directory(redirect.conf is what I 
use) put your information in it and then just restart apache.

But for all jsp files to be redirected do it need to do anything with
</p>

<p>
"FilesMatch " Directive

<p>
I can think of two ways off the top of my head:
</p>

<p>
-create symlinks with a loop that will link the "old" .jsp files to the new .php files
</p>

<p>
-use mod_rewrite:
<pre>
Options +FollowSymlinks
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^(.*)\.jsp$ $1.php [nc]
</pre>
This will rewrite any requests for *.jsp to the equivalent *.php.
</p>

<p>
I hope this helps.

<p>
The path of previous jsp files may not match to the current php files path.
</p>

<p>
So it might through 404 , am i right

Comparing this with your original mail:
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I have recently upgraded all of my jsp's to php's and pointed my rr
&gt; to the new server.But for the backward compatibility How do i say to
&gt; apache "if it finds request for any "jsp " go to this php page"

<p>
...it turns out that the right answer depends on what you actually want
to do. Once you've got that clear in your head, the path to the answer
will probably be more obvious.
</p>

<p>
As a first guess, if you mean "when the client requests any url ending
in .jsp, ask the client instead to request one specific url /this.php
instead", then in the manual where you read about the Redirect already
mentioned, look down a bit further for RedirectMatch. Something like
</p>

<p>
RedirectMatch \.jsp$ <a href="http://www.example.net/this.php">http://www.example.net/this.php</a>
</p>

<p>
might do. But that probably isn't what you wanted, based on the follow-up
emails.
</p>

<p>
As a next guess, if you mean "when the client requests any url ending in
.jsp, ask the client instead to request another url which can be derived
from the original one", then you probably still want to use RedirectMatch,
but this time include the grouping parentheses.
</p>

<p>
If you have a consistent layout across the old and the new servers,
this might work for you.
</p>

<p>
A more complicated example would be if you mean "when the client requests
one of these specific urls, ask the client instead to request a different
url, where the mapping from old to new is defined over there". In that
case your best bet is probably to look for RewriteMap in the mod_rewrite
manuals.
</p>

<p>
With a complete list of old jsp urls and equivalent new php urls, you
could try the RewriteMap thing in combination with "internal redirects",
so that instead of asking the client to make a new request of a new url,
you return the content that the new request would have returned directly.
It's easy to do that wrong, though, so an explicit redirect is probably
the way to go.
</p>

<p>
And also, although this one is probably also not directly useful in your
case, there's no reason why a PHP script needs to be accessed at a url
that ends ".php". To avoid breaking old urls, you could configure your
new apache to process urls that end in ".jsp" by sending the associated
file through the PHP processor.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and stealing a .sig that is relevant here:
