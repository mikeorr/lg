Hello,
</p>

<p>
Well one of the things at least!
	<a href="http://sam.zoy.org/zzuf/">http://sam.zoy.org/zzuf/</a>
(Also available in Debian testing of course!)
Quite a neat toy!
</p>

I seem to recall a couple of programs in the Debian kit that do
something like this by feeding random data to apps, but this one seems
to be a real star. E.g., <a href="http://sam.zoy.org/zzuf/lol-firefox.gif">http://sam.zoy.org/zzuf/lol-firefox.gif</a> crashes
my Firefox (1.5.0.11) very nicely - one-click functionality. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
I wonder if it'll compile under Solaris? I just might try it out next
week, while I'm in Atlanta. I haven't taught a security class in a
while, but it seems like 'zzuf' would make a <em>very</em> nice teaching aid
for when I'm explaining vulnerability discovery. Given that Sun is
pretty much abandoning CDE, buffer overflows and such are becoming
harder to demonstrate...

<p>
Did you know that CDE was sometimes considered an acronym for
Colossal Disk Eater?
</p>

<p>
I know there are KDE fans out there but that was thought of similarly
... except that it is in German.

<p>
Returning to the original post about "fuzz testing". One of the early
programs that did this (which I used to convince people to switch to
Linux) was "crashme". This was basically a program that trapped all
trappable signals, generated a random chunk of data and then jumped
to the start of this data *as code*. Since the handler did not do
much except to reset the traps and jump back, the loop was rather
tight and a number of O/Ses failed this test and crashed completely.
</p>

<p>
The nice thing about "zzuf" is that the test is with "random" data
but is repeatable. Moreover, now that kernels usually pass the
"crashme" test, one can concentrate on testing programs, device
drivers, filesystems and libraries.
