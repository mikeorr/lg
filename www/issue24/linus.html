To be fair to Intel, I want to tell people that Intel (a) did approach
me too, and that (b) the BSDi patch was in fact unauthorized by intel
and had to be withdrawn by BSDi. 
<P>
So intel actually did pretty much do the correct thing this time.  Sure,
they pissed me off a lot when I heard that BSDi had gotten the patch,
but when it became clear that they hadn't _meant_ it that way, their
approach was actually totally understandable. 
<P>
Essentially, they asked everybody to sign NDA's in order to let
_everybody_ in on the fix to the problem, and not have anybody be the
&quot;first&quot; one. 
<P>
Now, I personally think that asking people to sign NDA's for a <B>bug</B> that
they themselves had introduced is pretty stupid, which was the reason I
refused when they contacted me.  In this case, that turned out to be the
right solution, because then when BSDi did make the patch available
despite the NDA my hands weren't tied in any way. 
<P>
Note that we would probably have figured out the fix even without BSDi,
although it might have taken a day or two more.  Ingo Molnar had already
found another way to make the problem go away (with a very bad
performance impact, admittedly), but there were people working on
approaches that would probably eventually have ended up with what we
have now anyway. 
<P>
As to today, intel seems to be quite open about the problem, and they
have even given me their own patch for fixing this in 2.0.x (which does
essentially the same thing that we already did, but with a few
improvements actually). 
<P>
ftp.kernel.org has my latest 2.0.32 pre-patch in the directory
&quot;pub/<B>linux</B>/kernel/testing&quot;, and I'm just about to do another 2.1.x
release with most of the obvious problems fixed.
