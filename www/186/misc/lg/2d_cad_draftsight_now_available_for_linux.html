This was submitted yesterday, but I figure that it's interesting enough
for anyone here that might be interested in high-end CAD (I dimly recall
a conversation about it here...) that I'd give you folks an early
preview. IIRC, Dassault Systemes produces the CAD system thar was used
to design the Airbus.

Hi Ben,

<p>
The wait is over – free 2D CAD software DraftSight is officially available for

DraftSight is thrilled to be able to offer it to everyone today.  The news just
crossed the wire early this morning and I wanted to make sure you had all of
the details.  The full release is embedded below.  Please let me know if you
have any questions or would like screenshots.

<p>
Thanks!
