<br><br>
We have several <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>/Linux 
workstations around the office that
contain both SCSI and IDE devices. Now we almost exclusively use
SCSI hard drives but occasionally we will stick an extra IDE drive
into a box when more disk space is needed. My problem is this, when
we recompile a new kernel after a security patch of fix, and then
run lilo it gives the error `Warning:/dev/sda2 is not the first
disk`. So then I have to halt the machine, physically remove the IDE
device, boot with a rescue disk, rerun lilo, halt the machine,
reinstall the IDE device and reboot. Now while I admit that this
does work, it can be a real pain to have to do that to every
workstation we have that has mixed devices installed.

	Normally there is no problem with integrating SCSI and 
	IDE drives in a system (under Linux).
<br><br>

	However I think I have a hint as to your problem.  
	A normal PC BIOS will boot off of the first IDE drive
	on a system.  It will <em>only</em> look at the MBR (master
	boot record) on the first hard drive (usually after
	looking for a boot record on <em>only</em> the first floppy).
<br><br>

	The normal consequence of this is that you usually have
	to install your OS on the first hard drive.  IDE drives
	conform to an interface which is built into the BIOS.  
	With SCSI there is a BIOS extension on the controller's
	ROM that allows the system to boot.  
<br><br>

	BIOS extensions are code that's contained on the ROM's of any
	expansion card -- so long as it contains a specified header
	and calling convention.  Part of a normal PC boot process is
	to scan the reserved address space between A0000 and E0000 (or
	so -- it might be from B0000 through D0000, I don't have a
	BIOS reference handy) for this "BIOS extension signature" ---
	and then to call setup routines an give offsets from any of
	these signature blocks that it finds.  That is how SCSI
	controllers and ethernet boot PROMS (and other "bootable"
	devices) work.
<br><br>

	The problem is that most SCSI controllers and PC BIOS' will
	give the IDE drives precedence over any SCSI drives. 
<br><br>

	One approach would be to let the system have "its" way
	and let lilo write the MBR to the IDE drive.  So long
	as your BIOS (with extensions) can <em>see</em> the SCSI drives 
	it doesn't matter that the lilo boot block refers to another 
	drive.  
<br><br>

	An odd and confusing thing about Linux is that the boot
	block, the kernel, and the root filesystem can all be
	on different devices.  In fact you don't need a "boot block"
	at all --- you can use LOADLIN.EXE to start a Linux kernel
	(I've heard it can be used to load a FreeBSD kernel, too ---
	but they have their own program for that anyway).  
<br><br>

	So, if you have a <tt>/etc/lilo.conf</tt> that looks like:

<pre>
boot=/dev/hda
read-only
prompt
timeout=200

image = /vmlinuz
root = /dev/sda1
label = example
</pre>

	... and you run  <tt>/sbin/lilo</tt> to "compile" this set of 
	configuration directives into a boot block here's what 
	it will do:
    <blockquote>

		Write the boot block to <tt>/dev/hda</tt> 
    <br><br>

		note: we use the raw device, so it goes to the MBR, 
		if we use <tt>/dev/hda1</tt>, it goes to the "logical boot 
		record" or "superblock" of the specified (first) 
		partition.
    <br><br>

		The 'read-only' directive is passed to any Linux
		kernels that you load --- it specifies that the 
		root filesystem will be initially mounted read-only
		to allow the fsck to work properly on it.  
    <br><br>

		The 'prompt' directive is used to control the behavior
		of the LILO boot program at it's runtime (it forces it
		to print an interactive prompt to the console during boot)
		and the 'timeout' directive specifies how long the 
		prompt will wait before continuing to the default 
		boot "stanza" (the first, and in this case, only one).

    <br><br>
		The image directive points <tt>/sbin/lilo</tt> to the location
		of a kernel image (file).  Note the distinction between
		/sbin/lilo's "compile time" and the lilo boot code's
		"run time" (that's why I push this analogy of treating
		the lilo package as a "boot block compiler" --- it 
		helps put these distinctions in familiar terms).
    <br><br>

		This directive causes <tt>/sbin/liloi</tt> to "map" the device
		number and address of the image file.  That address can
		be in different formats depending on whether the 
		"linear" directive is used to inform <tt>/sbin/lilo</tt> that the
		device is being accessed through "sector translation."
    <br><br>

		The 'root' directive specifies where the root filesystem
		for this "stanza" is located.  That is passed to the 
		kernel unless over-ridden by parameters that are entered
		interactively at the prompt.
    <br><br>

		Obviously the 'label' directive allows the user to
		select different boot stanzas by name at the lilo
		prompt.  (Not that the "lilo prompt" refers to <em>run-time</em>
		rather than "compile-time" --- it is the "boot block code"
		that is doing the prompting and <tt>/sbin/lilo</tt> is utterly
		uninvolved at that point).
    </blockquote>

	I've played with a number of configurations of lilo.conf over
	the years.  I've written boot blocks to floppies, specified
	image files that were on mounted (non-root) filesystems, 
	and done other silly things.  Lilo's flexibility can be 
	very confusing and I've tried many things that didn't work
	(usually for good reason --- Lilo is constrained by the
	limitations and conventions employed by your BIOS).
<br><br>

	If you try this and it doesn't work you might need to 
	put a tiny partition on that drive.  You can put a
	very small minix filesystem on that (conceptually you 
	could put a kernel and no fs in a single track --- 
	but <tt>/sbin/lilo</tt> doesn't have a way to "find" that).
<br><br>

	For that matter you can put a Linux kernel file on 
	<em>any</em> fs that you put on that IDE drive.  If you
	put a kernel image on an MS-DOS filesystem and 
	run <tt>/sbin/lilo</tt> <em>while that fs is mounted</em> (it will
	complain if it cant find the kernel images at 
	"compile time") you should be fine (until you run a
	DOS defrag utility!).
<br><br>

	A wholly different approach is to to lie to your CMOS 
	setup and tell <em>it</em> that you have no IDE drives 
	installed.  
<br><br>

	Linux doesn't rely on your CMOS settings or BIOS to 
	detect or use IDE drives.  So, once Linux is loaded
	you should be able to see your IDE drives even if they
	are not listed in your CMOS configuration.
<br><br>

	(I'm pretty sure I did that once and I don't remember
	having to do any tweaking to get it to work.  It might
	be dependent on your kernel version and compilation
	options, though).
<br><br>

	Obviously, you're doing something a little different
	--- most people who mix IDE and SCSI drives start with
	the IDE's and always let them be the boot devices.  That's
	the path of least resistance.  However, you can try
	the tricks I've described --- let me know if removing
	the CMOS parameters for the drives works (or if I'm 
	suffering from delusional memories).

<br><br>
Thanks for your prompt reply. Many of the things you mentioned we have tried
at one time or another with limited results. We are suing Asus P2L97
motherboards which have the ability to set in the BIOS which drive type you
want it to look at first. We have even removed the IDE drive from the BIOS
settings. The problem is that since Linux does not rely on BIOS settings for
IDE drives it always detects them first. And typically we are adding old
extra IDE drives for expanding storage or the CD-ROM drive in the machine is
an IDE.

	It's true that Linux doesn't rely on BIOS settings. 
	However, the lilo boot loader <em>does</em>.  It is the boot loader
	that is looking in the wrong place.  This is probably a 
	bug in your BIOS (or still in your configuration of that
	BIOS, as it sits in the CMOS registers).

	align="left" border="0">
I have yet to try setting boot=/dev/hda and root=/dev/sda in the lilo.conf.
I was under the impression (mistakenly I guess) that the MBR and root disks
had to be on the same partition.
</strong></p>

<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)" width="50" height="28"
	align="left" border="0">
	The fact that this is a very common misconception explains
	why I take such pains to explain it in so much detail.  
	I must have gone over this about twenty times in LG and
	about a hundred in the newsgroups.
<br><br>

	Also, a nitpick, don't think of them as "root disks" ---
	think of them as root filesystems.  
<br><br>

	An MBR consists of a boot record and a partition table. The
	boot loader points to a kernel (or several) --- or it might
	point to a secondary boot loader.  The Linux kernel contains a
	pointer to the default root fs.  The LILO boot loader (from
	the MBR or from a floppy or any logical boot record) may pass
	parameters (such as video mode and root fs parameters) to the
	kernel to over-ride the one that's built-in.  The '<tt>rdev</tt>'
	command can write a new rootfs string into a kernel (and it
	can tweak other values like "video mode" --- look at the
	'<tt>rdev</tt>' man page for details).
