Hi,
<P> 
  Like the Linux Gazette but would you please (for us linear thinkers)	
put some navigation aid so we can go to next and previous pages?
I don't like clicking back to the menu, I like flipping through
things...
<P> 
Thanks for the work, appreciated. <BR>

<B>Subject: Linux trademark issues. <BR> 
From: Earl Stutes estutes@palladium.corp.sgi.com </B>  <BR> 
<P> 
Yet again, it appears someone is attempting to make a buck on something
that most of the rest of us feel should be a free or at least public
domain thing.  In this case the word Linux.  I don't have any
suggestions as to how "we" deal directly with this issue, but I
certainly hope that all of you folks that are a part of the growing
Linux commercial community will take the lead in fighting this yo-yo. 
Of course part of my contribution to support you is the fact that I buy
the magazine from the newstand(fatbrain.com, actually) every month.
<P> 
I have enjoyed your magazine right from the beginning, and will continue
to be a supporter over the long term.
<P> 
Thanks for listening

<b>Subject: LG Issue #9 <BR> 
From: Dave Pearson davep@hagbard.demon.co.uk </B> <BR> 
<P> 
Hi.
<P> 
First, I'd like to say congrats on taking over support of the LG, it's
a very handy resource and it's nice to see it getting continued
support.
<P> 
However, I've got a question about how you are going to handle it.  In
the past I've always downloaded a copy of the latest issue of LG and
installed it on my own machine so that I could read it at my
leisure. IIRC, each issue included a new top level index file that
would list the TOCs of all issues, this ment it was simple and easy to
install and to quickly search for a specific article.
<P> 
Correct me if I'm wrong, but issue 9 does not appear to follow this
install style. Was there a reason for this?
<P> 
Thanks for your time.
<P>

(You are not wrong. I did change it, not realizing what a hassle it
was going to cause some people.
The reason for part of the change that will most likely
remain, is that I wanted to be able to keep issues 1-8 exactly as
they were when John put them out -- i.e. not changing the front
page, etc. The way it works now should not be that different.</i>
<P> 
<i>The front page offers a spot to click for the TOC of issues 1-8 and
a spot for TOC 9. When 10 comes out next month, it will be on top of
TOC 9. I personally thought that having each TOC in a separate file
would make it easier -- perhaps I was wrong, it's been known to happen.
I'm considering a search program, when I have time to set it up, and
in the meantime, I will add an index containing all TOCs. --Editor)</I>

<B> Subject: new LG issue <BR> 
From: Larry Ayers layers@vax2.rain.gen.mo.us </B> <BR> 
<P> 
Last night I saw the new LG issue on the SSC website.  So
evidently in the last week of August writers came through for you.
There are some great articles in issue 9; an auspicious beginning
for SSC's sponsorship (and your editing duties).
<P> 
By the way, I got an email the other day from another LG reader,
complaining that the graphics from the TkDesk article I wrote in LG
#8 were not accessible to a web-browser.  I loaded the article into
Netscape (from the SSC website) and found this to be true.  Perhaps
the directory structure was changed somehow when LG #8 was put on
the site, rendering a link inactive?  I just checked issue 8 again,
and found that most of the inline images in my pieces won't display.
I think the problem is that the directory which John Fisk used was
./gx/ayers, whereas it looks like SSC's gazette graphics all go in
./gx.  
<P> 
Regards, Larry Ayers

<I>(Thanks. Yes, authors did come through for me, including you, and I

<i>Sorry, I know about the problem with the links, and it is now fixed.
The directories were set up correctly; there were just a lot of missing
files. --Editor) </I>

<P> 
I just tried to take a look at the Linux Gazette Issue #9. 
Unfortunately, I did not find the "I'll read it myself" button at the
top of the index that would allow me to see the whole thing at one
time and print it out for later reading at home.  I would appreciate
if you could add this option back, rather than causing me to have to
go into each section to print it out so that I can read it later at
home.

Thanks.

<B>Subject: Re: Linux Gazette <BR> 
From: tinus@betterthan.northstar.k12.ak.us (Sunit Das) </B> <BR> 
<P> 
Hello! I was wondering if you have an archive with the past issues of the Linux
Gazette(tar-ed and gzip-ed) so that us (the readers) can download and browse
at our leisure? If not, would it be too much trouble to do so? I hope I'm not
imposing too much, but I am on a shared phone line, and much as I would like to
stay on the net all day (it's tempting), I can't. Thanks for *any* help!
<P> 
--Sunit Das
<P> 
<blockquote> <I> 
(No problem. tar files are available, I've just been having technical difficulties
-- they were unreadable. At any rate John Fisk sent us new files that are
now up at ftp://ftp.ssc.com/pub/lg/. Also, our issue 10 file,
lg_issue10.tar.gzp and all issues (1-10) file, LinuxGazette_oct96.tar.gzp are
located at that site. --Editor) </I>

<B>Subject: Suggestion: Search Engine <BR> 
From: "Johannes Norinder" dante@inferno.skurup.se </B> <BR> 
<P> 
My suggestion is that you ought to have some kind of simple search engine
so that you easily can search for phrases within one or all of the issues
of LG. As is it's hard to know if you've covered Iomegas Zipdrive, for
example.
<P> 
Otherwise thanks for a great service.

<P> 
<blockquote> <I> 
(I agree. In fact it's something that I have already thought about.
There is a search engine for Linux Journal, and I will
probably use the same one for the Gazette. However, it means doing a lot
of front end work to get it set up. When I'll have time to do this is
not certain, but it is definitely on the list. --Editor) </I>

<B>Subject: Linux Gazette <BR> 
From: Bill Cronk bcronk@nvl.army.mil </B> <BR> 
<P> 
I am very glad to see a new issue put out. I was sad thinking that it had
gone by the wayside.
<P> 
I would like to see a section of tips and tricks devoted towards the novice
user who needs to learn the tricks to setting up hardware, software and all
the other things that come along. I remember when the first Byte magazine
came out and for the longest time there were articles on hardware and software
for the novices. After a while that ended as people grew up and demanded
more in depth articles. I would think that most people would have a hard time
finding those back issues. In the case of the Gazette all the back issues
will most likely be archived and if a basic index was published once or twice
a year many new people to the world of Linux would have all kinds of useful
tips and tricks to read through.
<P> 
Either way I enjoy reading the Gazette and will look forward to new issues.
I wish you success in publishing the Gazette.
<P> 
In the future, maybe the far future, I will be able to provide an article
now and then on some hardware and software items related to laboratory
instrumentation interfacing and controlling of automated test equipment.
<P> 
Best wishes,<BR> 
Bill

From: gv.livingston@brokersys.com (G.V.Livingston II) </B> <BR> 
<P> 
Wondering if there are any copies of the Gazette in HTML format with 
DOS filenames?  I would like to set up a personal mirror of all issues on 
a DOS machine that I use regularly but unTARring the files from the FTP 
site is fruitless because the filenames are made DOS compliant and the 
links no longer match what is in the directory.
<P> 
I basically want my "site" to exactly mirror the SSC pages.
<P> 
Thanks for any help you can provide.

<B>Subject: COOL it works with LINUX <BR> 
From: Paul Bingman &lt;paul@edgewood.net&gt; </B> <BR> 
<P> 
I suspect many/most of you have seen the new logo promoted by Linux
Journal, that can be licensed for $1 a year, to show that your software or
hardware product works with Linux.  See: <BR> 
  <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/cool.html"> 
http://www.linuxjournal.com/cool.html</a> <BR> 
<P> 
What is a very pleasant surprise is to see that logo starting to appear in
the mainstream trade press.  On page 41 of the September 16, 1996,
InfoWorld, is a half-page Equinox ad for their multiport serial cards. 
The COOL logo is the first one displayed, before Windoze, Novell, or SCO.

<B>Subject: LG : french translation + mirroring ? <BR> 
From: Patrick Mevzek &lt;Patrick.Mevzek@Babbage.espci.fr&gt; </B> <BR> 
To: fiskjm@ctrvax.Vanderbilt.Edu <BR> 
<P> 
Hi,
<P> 
I discovered your Linux Gazette some months ago, and it's great and
very interesting. I've discovered Linux a little before, because I
will need to install here at my school (you know I'm only a student
like you ;-) !!) a small LAN of computers for students, with PC (Win
95) and one LINUX-PC (which will be a firewall-mailhost-webserver,
etc...). So I'm quite interested with everything in relation with
Linux.
<P> 
In fact, I can propose you to translate the LG in French.
I would be very pleased to do that.
But I can promise you I will always have enough time to do it quickly,
because first I'm a student, and therefore I've exams, (you know
that...), and second, like I said before, I have to work a lot to
install students'LAN.
<P> 
So, let me know if I can help you that way !!
<P> 
BTW, because I will be the maintainer of the web server of the
students too, it could be possible, somewhat in January or February 97
to start mirroring the LG, here at the ESPCI. I can't promise you big
things, because mainly in 3 years I won't be in that school anymore,
and I can't say that the next webserver maintainer will keep mirroring
LG !!
I hope to hear from you soon
<P> 
Regards,<BR>

(Glad you like the magazine. John Fisk forwarded your letter to me as SSC is

I think it would be wonderful if you were to translate the LG into French,
whenever you have time. It would certainly give the Gazette a
wider French audience. We have very liberal copying requirements,
especially if you are a mirror site (virtually none).
We always welcome another mirror. Thanks for your interest. -- Editor)
