For 2.6.17-rc1 upwards you should try out "uswsusp" which tries to
sort out problems with prior suspend(s).
</p>

<p>
My current situation is quite happy vis-a-vis both suspend to disk
suspend to ram. I use the "stock" Debian linux-image-2.6.17-2-686
(version 2.6.17-8) and initramfs-tools (version 0.77b) with
aforementioned uswsusp (0.2-3).
</p>

<p>
Everything "works" out of the box except for a minor hiccough with
suspend-to-ram which required some hacking as follows. 
<pre>
	a. Save current device config to disk 
		cat /proc/bus/pci/00/02.0 &gt; /var/lib/acpi/vid_0
		cat /proc/bus/pci/00/02.1 &gt; /var/lib/acpi/vid_1
	b. Suspend-to-ram
		echo -n mem &gt; /sys/power/state
	c. Restore device state on resume
		cat &gt; /proc/bus/pci/00/02.0 &lt; /var/lib/acpi/vid_0
		cat &gt; /proc/bus/pci/00/02.1 &lt; /var/lib/acpi/vid_1
</pre>
The developers of suspend are undecided on whether they should wait
for the kernel to fix this or just make the change to s2ram since the
problem seems to be for specific hardware combinations like the
thinkpad R51 with intel graphics (or perhaps only for that
combination!).
</p>

<p>
I should perhaps also mention that suspend worked fine on my laptop
with Ubuntu Dapper which I tested out.
</p>

<p>
Generally, I have found that "suspend-to-disk" works out-of-the-box
with all laptops that I have come across; "suspend-to-ram" seems more
tricky. Given my experience, I would say that Ben is singularly unlucky :-(

I've kept this email in my inbox as a motivator, and finally got around
to playing with a new kernel. It seems that upgrading to 2.6.17.13 does
make a difference, after many, many ugrades that haven't: I've just
managed a suspend-to-disk not only from the console but from X -
something I'd never managed before.  Mind you, I haven't tested it
thoroughly yet and don't know how well it will work under various
conditions, but being able to do it at all is a BIG plus.
</p>

<p>
As to suspending it with 'mem'... eh, I'm afraid it's not soup yet. I've
tried an exhaustive combination set with the 's2ram' options and
reported the tabulated results to the fellow at SuSE who is developing
it, but although the results are better than before (I can at least get
disk activity with 'ls -lR' after resuming), none of the combinations
make the display light up again. :( Yes, even when starting with
'init=/bin/bash'. Maybe soon.

I'll keep hold of this for future reference; I may need it once they get
a few more bugs worked out.

<p>
Given the general reports on how it works for many others, I agree.
Between that and the nearly-random sound system failure to initialize on
startup (which can't be fixed without removing the battery and
disconnecting, then reconnecting power), the Acer 2010/2012 is not
something I'd recommend to anyone wanting to set up Linux on a laptop.

Unfortunately an all too common problem on laptops in general I'm afraid.
For a very long time, the boot log would show an "ACPI broken
implementation" error on this machine.  Eventually the kernel people
caught up with the (IMO intentionally) quirky BIOS ACPI code on these
particular models.  The broken / buggy BIOS on the Inspirons used to be
widely talked about; maybe it's different with current models, but somehow
I doubt it.
</p>

<p>
Aside from that, the nvidia video BIOS seems to deviate from the DPMS
standard, causing the machine to ignore commands to shut off the LCD
backlight.  I hacked a work around implementing a call to the vbetool
code to do it, so that the light won't stay on indefinitely after the
screen blanker kicks in.
</p>

<p>
The I8000 I was using before it had some weird BIOS / hardware bugs that
would cause the text on the screen to flash at various frequencies below
10 Hz or so, triggered every once in a while by various combinations in
the ordering of text attributes and / or characters being displayed at the
time,  A warranty service call tech replaced the LCD, the video card (not
nvidia) and finally the mobo, which fixed the problem, but left it as a
latitude.  I'm kinda curious what would happen if I flash it with an
Inspiron BIOS. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
