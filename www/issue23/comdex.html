Las Vegas, Nevada is host each year to one of the
largest technology trade shows in the U.S.--COMDEX/Fall.
This year nearly 220,000 industry
professionals lined up to find, test and research the latest
technologies from the leading industry vendors.
<P>
Earlier in the year the staff of <I>Linux Journal</I> volunteered to
coordinate the COMDEX/Fall
Linux Pavilion. Coordinating the event turned out to mean hours of
preparation,
and, luckily, vendors were quick to lend a hand. Kit Cosper of Linux
Hardware Solutions managed to talk the spirit of Linux into
Softbank, the sponsor of the COMDEX show. As a result, COMDEX personnel
were very cooperative and worked with us to ensure that the floor space
for the pavilion was in the best possible site; that is, we weren't hidden
away in a back corner.
<P>
Attendees seemed pleased to find many of their favorite
Linux vendors in one convenient and easy-to-find area.
Vendors present
included Caldera, Linux Hardware Solutions, Enhanced Software Technologies,
S.u.S.E., Red Hat Software, Hard Data, Quant-X, Infomagic, LinuxMall, Linux
International and, of course, <I>Linux Journal</I>.
<P>
Jon "maddog" Hall barely held his own against the hordes of Linux
enthusiasts visiting the Linux International booth. Several
members of the Linux community kindly volunteered their time to
staff the Linux International booth, answering questions and
spreading the word about Linux. Volunteers included Marc Merlin,
Ira Abramov, Dan Peri and Richard Demanowski.
<P>
Red Hat Software announced the December 1 release of Red Hat Linux 5.0.
To mark the event, Red Hat balloons filled the Linux Pavilion area of
the convention center. The Linux mascot, Tux the penguin, was carried away
in all of the excitement (see photo).
<P>
S.u.S.E., a popular European Linux vendor, also announced the latest
release of their Linux distribution, S.u.S.E. 5.1. This was S.u.S.E.'s
first appearance at COMDEX, and considering their rapid growth in the
U.S. market,
it will most likely not be their last. Their distribution demonstrations
proved to be great crowd pleasers, compliments of Bodo, Rolf, Michael and
James Gray, the President of S.u.S.E. U.S. (See review of S.u.S.E. in this
issue.)
<P>
Clarica Grove, Britta Kuybus and I staffed the <I>Linux Journal</I> booth.
We were quite pleased with the turnout of this year's show.
During last year's COMDEX, we were kept busy explaining what Linux is
to all comers.
We were pleased to find that this year's COMDEX attendees had remembered
and done their
homework from last year. Not only did most people we
spoke with know about Linux, but many of them are using it and very
excited with their results.
It goes to show that the popularity of Linux is indeed growing.
Linux is being looked at more than ever as a cost-effective, viable
operating system. Thanks to years of dedicated work by all of the Linux
vendors, Linux International and the Linux community, we are now able to
begin enjoying the success of Linux. This year's COMDEX Linux Pavilion
was a showcase of this success.
<P>
Linux Journal would like to thank everyone involved with this year's
show--look forward to seeing you there next year.
