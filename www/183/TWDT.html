<p>
Hi all,
</p>

<p>
[This might help drum up conversation here, if nothing else, but I
appreciate it's not really Linux-centric.]
</p>

<p>
Some of you might recall some years ago the following:
</p>

<p>
<a href='../141/misc/lg/shuttle_sd39p2__should_i_buy_one.html'>http://linuxgazette.net/141/misc/lg/shuttle_sd39p2__should_i_buy_one.html</a>
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, said machine literally went up in white smoke just before
Christmas.  From what I can tell, an integrated circuit on the motherboard
blew, as the PSU is still intact, according to my volt metre, as are the
harddrives, etc.  The point is, it's something esoteric, and not the usual
suspects I would expect to have blown, else I could have replaced those
parts.
</p>

<p>
However, because it's a Shuttle, replacing the motherboard outright is not
an option either, as it's an integrated system due to its cooling fans, etc.
Not to mention the apparent cost of doing so amounts to an equivalent cost
of the Shuttle overall.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">  Buying a new machine therefore seems logical.
</p>

<p>
So, would anyone be able to help me in replacing my Shuttle with a modern
equivalent?  When I say equivalent, I mean:
</p>

<p>
* Must be of a similar size to the Shuttle (form-factor).  If this implies
  mini-itx, that's fine.
* Should be as low-powered as possible -- i.e., not consuming the planet.
  Think green.
* Would need space for at least two hard drives minimum.
* Minimum of two PCI slots (one of which must be an PCI-e slot.)
* Support for dual-head graphics a must.
* On-board wireless would be nice (without the need for an additional card)
</p>

<p>
I appreciate some of the above might not necessarily fit any one system, and
I'd be willing to sacrifice on-board wireless for one of the PCI slots (as
my Shuttle only had two PCI(e) slots anyway), but who knows what's possible?
<img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
I don't know an awful lot about hardware, so any thoughts/suggestions are
gratefully received.  Of course, the systems should support Linux/*BSD [1] -- I
don't want to have to grapple with anything Windows-specific. 
</p>

<p>
Any help is thankfully appreciated.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
TIA,
</p>

<p>
[1] I've been using OpenBSD for a long time now, so anything to help further
that is definitely a bonus.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

A while back LG created an facebook 'group', but that didn't work out
so well. We have now created a Linux Gazette facebook page where
instead of 'joining' all you need to do it 'Like' it. Once you do
that, you will automatically receive updates from LG on your facebook
wall.
</p>

<p>
I am also linking the twitter account to the facebook page, so updates
there will show directly onto facebook (when twitter isn't overloaded
<img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">).
</p>

<p>
And finally, through a Linux Gazette facebook you will be able to
share our updates onto your wall as well.

Amusing example of serendipity: one of our readers just sent me an email
letting me know that a link to a SourceForge project in one of our
articles was outdated and needed to be pointed to the new, renamed
version of the project. I changed it after taking a moment to verify the
SF link - and noticed that some of the project functionality was
relevant to Neil Youngman's question of a couple of months ago.
</p>

<p>
Pulling down the (small) project tarball and reading the docs
supported that impression:
</p>

<pre>
  'repeats' searches for duplicate files using a multistage process. Ini-
  tially, all files in the specified directories (and all of their subdi-
  rectories) are listed as potential duplicates.  In the first stage, all
  files with a unique filesize are declared unique and are  removed  from
  the list.  In the second stage, any files which are actually a hardlink
  to another file are removed, since they don't actually take up any more
  disk space.  Next, all files for which the first 4096 bytes (adjustable
  with the -m option) have a unique filehash are declared unique and  are
  removed from the list.  Finally, all files which have a unique filehash
  (for the entire file) are declared unique  and  are  removed  from  the
  list.   Any remaining files are assumed to be duplicates and are listed
  on stdout.
</pre>

<p>
The project is called "littleutils", by Brian Lindholm. There's a number
of other handy little utilities in there, all worth exploring.

<h3>Odd system load situation</h3>

<p>
Hi, all -
</p>

<p>
I've got something odd going on, and I'm trying to get some perspective
on it. Perhaps someone here can cast a light.
</p>

<p>
I'm running a long-term rsync job (a full backup, after way too long of
a hiatus. I know - <strong>really</strong> *bad* for someone who hounds people to keep
on top of their backups professionally... but you know the saying about
the cobbler's kids being the last to have new shoes.) It's copying the
files to an external drive, connected via USB. Here's the problem: now
that it's running, my system has become extremely "sensitive" to any
additional loads - even very light ones. Firing up an xterm visibly
spikes the CPU (which, with nothing more than two xterms open, is
running at a load average of ~4.) Starting 'vim' takes about 4 seconds.
Opening a PDF with the rather lightweight 'xpdf' takes about 9 seconds.
Reformatting a paragraph in 'vim' turns the xterm gray for a good 5
seconds and almost freezes the cursor. Opening Firefox <em>does</em> freeze the
cursor and prevents me from being able to tab between open applications
for a good 30 seconds - and when it's open, the system is essentially
useless for anything else. Needless to say, all but the last one are
usually nearly instant, and Firefox normally takes just a couple of
seconds, and doesn't lock anything up while loading.
</p>

<p>
Here's the kicker: "top" shows... nothing particularly unusual.
vmstat/iostat report essentially the same story.
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
$ (vmstat -a;iostat)
procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ----cpu----

          16.70    0.20    3.81    5.71    0.00   73.59

</pre>

<p>
Memory usage is reasonable, swap is barely being touched, the CPU is
spending 3/4 of its time being idle, even the number of context switches
is very reasonable as compared to the I/O rate. If I saw this on a
remote machine, I'd figure it was being under-utilized. :\ 
</p>

<p>
Now, it is true that I'm not running some mad smokin' powerhouse machine
that requires a dedicated nuclear power plant:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo|egrep '^(processor|model name)'
processor       : 0
model name      : Intel(R) Atom(TM) CPU N270   @ 1.60GHz
processor       : 1
model name      : Intel(R) Atom(TM) CPU N270   @ 1.60GHz
$ cat /proc/meminfo|grep MemTotal
MemTotal:        1016764 kB
</pre>

<p>
It's just a little Acer laptop... but this is usually enough for pretty
much anything I need, including serving fairly heavy-duty Perl and PHP
scripting via Apache. So... what's going on? What is "rsync" doing that
is essentially invisible but is enough to make this thing behave like a
286 with 64k of memory? I thought I understood what the above numbers
mean, and could reasonably estimate system state from them - but it
seems that I'm wrong.

<h3>Bypassing GRUB</h3>

</p>

<p>
I often experiment with multiple distros (for learning/teaching value), by
installing them on my machine side by side. I then get to use a
specific distro/kernel by selecting it through GRUB, at boot time. Is there
some way to by-pass GRUB altogether and boot a specific kernel
manually ?
</p>

<p>
Let me be clear, I want to bypass GRUB and choose the kernel/distro
manually. It is not about  replacing the sick GRUB by a healthy GRUB.
</p>

<p>
I would appreciate any clue or pointer.
</p>

<p>
Thank you,

I've just read Don's article and think there is a sshd_config option

  PasswordAuthentication no

<h2>Distro News</h2><h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Debian 6.0 Squeeze to have Completely Free Linux Kernel</h3>

<p>Debian is inching toward the full release of a major 
update of its Linux distro that will be a major milestone for the 
Linux Community.  That release has been rescheduled to February 5th or 
6th and should include a fully open source distro with earlier, 
optional non-free elements in a separate branch.</p>

<p>The Debian project has been working on removing non-free firmware from 
the Linux kernel shipped with Debian for its past two release cycles 
but it was not yet possible to ship Linux kernels without non-free 
firmware bits - until now.</p>

<p>In December, they announced that all issues were fundamentally solved 
and they will be able to deliver a Linux kernel which is completely 
'Free', according to the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG), with 
Debian "Squeeze"  or version  6.0.</p>

<p>Recognizing that some users may require the use of works that do not 
conform to the DFSG and might include non-free firmware bits, for the 
time being, there will be a non-free area in the archives for 
alternative installation images and additional packages for Debian 
Squeeze that include non-free firmware bits needed for specific pieces 
of hardware. These elements  cannot and will not be supported to the 
same extent as the Free firmware.  </p>

<p>This is the first Debian release that supports the Haskell Platform, 
in version 2010.1, including the ghc compiler in version 6.12.1, and 
ships more than 200 additional Haskell libraries.  This version of 
Debian Linux will also sport a graphical installer.</p>

<p>As of mid-January, there were 4 blocker bugs for the release of 
Squeeze, but all of them are fixed in the unstable/sid release.</p>


<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">New Release of OpenIndiana, an Open Source Solaris</h3>

<p>December saw a new release of OpenIndiana, version oi_148.  This 
version may shortly form the basis for the project's first stable, 
production-ready release.</p>

<p>OpenIndiana continues the OpenSolaris legacy and aims to be binary and 
package compatible with Oracle Solaris 11 and Solaris 11 Express.</p>

<p>Version oi_148 fixes Java SSL crypto problems, adds PostgreSQL 
packages back in, and has admin improvements.  Since several users of 
this version and oi_147 are applying it to production servers, the 
project community is considering applying several package fixes and 
security updates to oi_148.</p>

<p>The release would be planned for February or March with a limited set 
of server-oriented packages and may be called  "Open Indiana 2011.02". 
It would be based on oi_148 with only the Text Installer and Automated 
Installer ISOs.  To make the release easier to manage, versions of 
Apache, PHP, MySQL, Tomcat, etc, would match the same versions shipped 
in RHEL 6/CentOS 6.</p>

<p>From the September 2010 announcement on the forming of the OpenIndiana 
project:</p>

<p>"OpenIndiana is a brand new distribution of OpenSolaris, constructed 
by the community, for the community. Our primary goal is to be a 
binary and package compatible drop in replacement for the official 
OpenSolaris and forthcoming Solaris 11 and Solaris 11 Express 
releases."</p>
<p>"This project was created to address the longstanding issue that the 
OpenSolaris distribution has constructed entirely by Sun/Oracle, not 
by the community. Depending on a single commercial entity has led to 
several issues, notably that bug fixes and security updates are only 
available via a paid for support subscription, that community 
participation has been limited in steering the direction of the 
operating system, and that commercial decisions have led to stricter 
licensing terms."</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Zend Studio 8.0 PHP IDE Released</h3>

<p>Zend Studio 8.0 Streamlines PHP Application Development in VMware 
Virtualized Environments and Features Enhanced Support for Building 
Ajax and PHP Applications.</p>

<p>In November, Zend Technologies  announced the general availability of 
Zend Studio 8.0, its leading Integrated Development Environment (IDE) 
for professional PHP developers. The new release helps PHP developers 
streamline development and testing processes through integration with 
VMware Workstation and revamped support for servers running on-premise 
or in the cloud. Zend Studio 8.0 also delivers extensive support for 
the development of rich Internet applications that use JavaScript 
front-ends and PHP back-ends. </p>

<p>Zend provides ready-to-use virtual images for Zend Server to further 
optimize the debugging experience.  A new pricing model was also 
announced for Zend Studio 8.0, making it accessible to more 
developers.</p>

<p>"VMware is committed to increasing the productivity of software 
development organizations and evolving application and data delivery 
environments into a user-centric model," said Parag Patel, vice 
president, Global Strategic Alliances at VMware. "Our partnership with 
Zend brings the full benefits of virtualization to PHP developers, 
enabling them to accelerate software development times and reduce 
hardware costs."</p>
<p>Developing PHP code on a remote server running on-premise or in the 
cloud is significantly easier in Zend Studio 8.0, with its simplified 
workflow and improved performance. SSH or FTP connections can be used 
to import projects into Zend Studio, and then export them back to the 
remote server to be run or debugged.</p>

<p>Zend Studio 8.0 enables faster coding of PHP and JavaScript 
applications through the built-in Content Assist support for many 
JavaScript-based libraries including jQuery, Dojo, Ext JS and 
Prototype. A new set of integrated Ajax tools simplifies debugging of 
PHP and JavaScript applications by supporting debugging of the 
JavaScript front-end and the PHP back-end in one combined session.</p>

<p>For more information about the new features and functionality in Zend 
Studio 8, please visit <a href="http://www.zend.com/products/studio">http://www.zend.com/products/studio</a>.</p>

<h1>Unattended stream recording with MPlayer</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/brownss.html">Silas Brown</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>The Linux movie player program MPlayer has an option to
record an Internet-broadcast video stream for playing later. 
The recording can be done from the command line.  This is useful
for two reasons: (1) you can record at a time when you are too
busy to watch, (2) if your Internet connection is poor for
realtime video but reasonable for non-realtime bandwidth (some
low-end cable connections are like this), then you might get
better results by using <tt>ssh</tt> to log into a
well-connected remote box, record the broadcast from there, and
then download the resulting file in non-realtime (assuming the
broadcast is short, otherwise this might not be practical).</p>

<p>However, many versions of MPlayer have trouble doing this
unattended.  Firstly, if the connection to the stream goes down
for whatever reason, MPlayer makes no attempt to re-establish
it, and secondly it's difficult to tell MPlayer when to stop
recording (there are command-line timing options but they don't
always work, and interrupt signals can be ignored).</p>

<p>One workaround is to write a script in Python (or some other
language) that runs MPlayer inside a "pseudo-terminal" and
control it via this terminal.  The script can then take
responsibility of restarting MPlayer if necessary, and sending a
keystroke to close it down at the end.</p>

<p>The script below will do this.  You will need to change the
variables at the beginning (unless you want to record an episode
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuowen_Jiezi_%28television_program%29">Shuowen
Jiezi</A>); it's probably a good idea to set the recording to
start slightly before the scheduled start time and to finish
slightly after the scheduled finishing time, just in case the
studio doesn't keep perfect timing.</p>

<pre class="code">
stream = "mms://65.49.26.231/suntv"
prefix = "/tmp/shuowenjiezi"
program_time = (20,05) # in your timezone
program_length_mins = 8

import pty, time, os, signal

t=time.localtime()
t = t[:3] + program_time + (0,) + t[6:]
startTime = time.mktime(t)
if time.time() &gt; startTime:
    # missed today's program_time, wait for tomorrow
    startTime += 24*3600
endTime = startTime + program_length_mins*60

os.system("rm -f "+prefix+"*") # delete any previous recording
fileNo = 0

class TimeoutException: pass
handlingTimeout = False
def alarm(*args):
    if handlingTimeout: raise TimeoutException()
signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, alarm)

print "Waiting to record %d minutes at %d:%02d" % ((program_length_mins,)+program_time)
time.sleep(max(0,startTime - time.time()))
while endTime &gt; time.time():
    pid,fd = pty.fork()
    if pid==0: # child
        pty.spawn(["/bin/bash","-c","mplayer \"%s\" -dumpstream -dumpfile \"%s%02d.asf\"" % (stream,prefix,fileNo)])
        raise SystemExit # shouldn't get here
    print "mplayer started in background pty, monitoring"
    
    # Monitor the process, restarting if necessary, until time to finish:
    while os.waitpid(pid,os.WNOHANG)==(0,0) and endTime &gt; time.time():
        # Need to read from fd to ensure its buffer is clear
        # but don't block on the reading - use signal to time out
        # (otherwise we might fail to stop the recording on time)
        signal.alarm(1)
        try:
            handlingTimeout = True
            os.read(fd,1024)
            handlingTimeout = False
        except TimeoutException: continue
        except OSError: continue
        time.sleep(1)
    fileNo += 1

print "Time to finish"
# Send it a Ctrl-C on the terminal
# (SIGINT doesn't always work, neither does -endpos)
os.write(fd,chr(3))
time.sleep(1) # just in case
os.close(fd)
</pre>

<h2>Legal and traffic-flow issues</h2>

<p>In countries that have television licensing, a license is
usually needed to view or record any television broadcasts in
<em>any</em> form, including over the Internet, provided that
your reception occurs at the same time as the broadcast is being
shown on air i.e. it is "live".  (If the Internet stream is a
second or two behind due to various packet delays, I think that
would still count as "live".) The license is usually needed for
the premises where the recording computer operates, which might
be different from the premises where you will watch the result.
The fact that the broadcast is coming from outside your country
does not usually let you off (after all, people with normal televisions
can't get out of it by promising to tune to foreign channels);
however, it's <em>possible</em> that a license is not required
if the on-air broadcast is <em>completely unavailable</em> in your country
i.e. it cannot possibly be received even via satellite (so if it
<em>is</em> carried by a satellite then that satellite had better not
serve your side of the planet).  This does not constitute legal advice;
you need to check your local laws, and they might change.</p>

<p>You should also consider any network bandwidth regulations
that you are subject to (some universities forbid unauthorized
television downloads; you would need to ask permission).  If you
are using a remote computer to record the broadcast, you need to
consider any relevant bandwidth restrictions from that computer
also.  Double-check the size of the stream's output files to
make sure they are within reason.</p>

<p>Finally, remember that the recorded broadcast is almost
certainly copyright and would be illegal to redistribute.  The
recording should be for yourself only.</p>

<h1>Away Mission - RSA 2011</h1>

<p>

<p>
  As usual, the annual RSA Conference is arguably the most comprehensive
one-stop forum in information security.  Although there are many
conferences  that are more technical, the breadth of the sessions and the
caliper of some speakers makes this a not-to-miss event for those
interested in the security of computer systems and networks. And, yes, RSA
has moved from March in recent years to February 14-18 this year. Happy
Valentines Day, hackers and crackers.
</p>

<p>
  There is a lot to do on RSA Monday - besides getting chocolate for your
significant other - and most of it is free with an Expo Pass.  And many
attending vendors will happily send you an Expo registration code.  I have
one listed below from Fortify.	   With the Expo Pass, the keynotes and
Town Hall events are available as well as several vendor-sponsored
sessions.  So come for Monday and come back if you can.  There are many
rewards for being a full attendee, or delegate, but the full freight will
be $2,195!  A Delegate One-Day Pass (Tue-Fri) costs a mere $995. See, 
Monday is a deal.
</p>

<p>
  So what's included??	First off, there is the all morning Cloud Security
Alliance Summit 2011. And in the afternoon there is the Innovation Sandbox
covering the best new security solutions - this actually requires a
Delegate Pass or an Expo Plus registration.  But there's more.
</p>

<p>
  That same afternoon, there are the Corporate Research Labs, which run
from 2-4 p.m. You can join interactive discussions from CA and RSA Labs
researchers on recent security technology.  And the Trusted Computing Group
returns again for its own set of presentations from 11-3, with lunch
included.  This half-day workshop will discuss the role of trust with
hardware-based security - the now-common Trusted Platform Module (TPM).
</p>  

<p>
  After that, you can attend the Trailbreakers Panel which celebrates
those technology leaders who weren't afraid to buck the status quo and
introduce innovative approaches that overcame mediocrity. Dr. Hugh
Thompson, Chief Security Strategist, People Security, and RSA Conference
Program Committee Chairman, will moderate the discussion of technology that
can change the world as we know it. And guess who is on the panel? HD
Moore, Chief Security Officer at Rapid7 and Chief Architect of Metasploit.
</p>  

<p>
If that wasn't enough, Fortify has a vendor code to get a free Expo
Pass and is also hosting its own all-day developer systems security 
conference.  But you have to register by Feb 11, the Friday before RSA.  
No pre-registration is required for the Fortify Developer Seminar.  To
register for your complimentary Expo pass (a $100 value), enter code
SC11FTS upon RSA Expo registration check out.

<p>
  For each RSA event since 1995, a unique theme has highlighted a
significant historical contribution to cryptography, mathematics or
information security. This spans from World War II Navaho Codetalkers to
the Chinese Remainder Theorem.	 For 2010, it  was  the influence of the
Rosetta Stone - literally code cracking.  This year, its about security
roles and Identity, with the longish theme name of The
Adventures of Alice &amp; Bob. Ron Rivest of the RSA algorithm fame used
these as placeholder names to explain the RSA encryption method and the
steps involved in the complex system. Alice &amp; Bob were born to make the
subject matter easier to grasp - replacing Person A and Person B.  Over
the years other characters have been added to make technical topics more
understandable. This cast of friends and enemies - including Eve the
Eavesdropper, Mallory the Malicious Attacker and Walter the Warden, among
others - populate Alice &amp; Bob's universe and are now common parlance in
cryptography and computer security.
</p>


<p>
  You can review several podcasts of interesting RSA sessions at your
leisure.  The address for the 2010 previews is
<a href="https://365.rsaconference.com/community/connect/rsa-conference-usa-2010?view=video">https://365.rsaconference.com/community/connect/rsa-conference-usa-2010?view=video</a> -
and out of that list, I'd suggest listening to Mark Risher, Sr.
Director or Product Management at Yahoo, on his HT1-301 session: "Yokai vs.
the Elephant: Hadoop and the Fight Against Shape-Shifting Spam", which is
about discovering polymorphic spam.  You can find that one here:
<a href="https://365.rsaconference.com/videos/1009;jsessionid=D39EC9C6A573499321B59ACEC09859DB.node0">https://365.rsaconference.com/videos/1009;jsessionid=D39EC9C6A573499321B59ACEC09859DB.node0</a>
</p>

<p>
  Another memorable moment was Bruce Schneier's reflections on RSA
Conference via an RSA Conference Bingo card of security problems, like
witnessing WiFi sniffing. Here's the full card to enjoy:

<p>
  This address is for this year's RSA 2011 Preview Podcasts:

This will give you a taste of the upcoming sessions.
</p>

<h3>Keynotes</h3>

<p>
  Among several keynote sessions for 2011, William Lynn, Deputy Secretary
of Defense, will be speaking on "Defending a New Domain: The Pentagon's
Cyber Strategy."  James Lewis, Director at  the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, will be moderating a panel on  "Cyberwar,
Cybersecurity, and the Challenges Ahead." And, on the last day of RSA,
42nd President Bill Clinton will be speaking.
</p>

<p>
  The Cryptographers Panel, following the first keynote of RSA 2010,
featured crypto legends Ron Rivest and Adi Shamir (the R and the S of RSA
fame) and also Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman (of Diffie-Hellman fame
in Public Key Exchange). They talked about the recent history of
cryptography and current challenges, also sharing some insight into the
relationship between academic research and NSA capabilities.
</p>

<p>
  For the 2010 RSA Keynotes and Industry Panels, go here:  <br>
<a href="http://www.rsaconference.com/2010/usa/recordings/catalog.htm?utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=connectmar30">http://www.rsaconference.com/2010/usa/recordings/catalog.htm?utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=connectmar30</a>
</p>

<p>
  There are 17 2010 Keynote sessions posted plus 14 Industry sessions
posted, but some of them are videos of full track sessions.  Unfortunately,
you need 2010 Delegate credentials to view the full sessions.  But do check
out the links.
</p>

<p>
  Among my favorite sessions over the previous several years were technical sessions led
by engineers from Mandiant and technical sessions led by instructors from
SANS course. The latter group led a mini-class and Q/A session on advanced
hacking techniques. This later SANS session was led by SANS faves Ed
Skoudis and Johannes Ulrich. Skoudis noted that  the best anti-virus
software was falling to under 80 percent detection for the newer
polymorphic malware and recommended using both signature and
behaviour-based detection for better results. He also described a newly
detected vulnerability in SSL key renegotiation that required patching in
all OSes. I believe everyone learned something and the applause at the
end was long and sincere. I'd recommend going to any session with
speakers from SANS or Mandiant.
</p>

<p>
  If you make to this year's RSA, keep these sessions in mind. And bring
your own chocolate.
</p>

<p>
  Something to keep in mind for March is the Linux Foundation End User
Summit, March 1-2, in Jersey City, NJ. See
<a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/end-user-summit">http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/end-user-summit</a> for more details.

<h1>Ten Things I Dislike About Linux</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/grebler.html">Henry Grebler</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<p>
I've written about things that irritate me in Bill's platforms. Here,
to show that I can be an equal-opportunity
disparager/disdainer/curmudgeon, are 10 things I dislike about Linux.
</p>


<p>
First, some ground rules. I'm not impressed by the argument, "But
that's how $PLATFORM does it" (where $PLATFORM is some other
platform). And, if your friend Jeffrey jumped off a cliff would you
follow him?
</p>

<p>
LG is about
</p> 

<blockquote>
<em>	...making Linux just a little more fun!</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
and I claim that the things I'm grumbling about diminish the fun I get
out of Linux.
</p>

<pre>

	- I don't think I can get her to do it.
	- You mean it'll be difficult.
	- Very.
	- Well, this is not Mission Difficult, Mr. Hunt, it's Mission
	  Impossible. Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.

	-- <a href="http://www.subzin.com/s/Difficult,+not+impossible">Mission: Impossible II</a> 

</pre>

<p>
Sure, some of the things I grumble about will be difficult to change.
But some wouldn't be so difficult. What did JFK say about that?
</p>

<pre>

	[We do these things], not because they are easy, but because
	they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and
	measure the best of our energies and skills, ...

		-- <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/We_choose_to_go_to_the_moon">John F. Kennedy, "We Choose to Go to the Moon"</a> 
		Delivered at Rice University in Houston, Texas on 12 September 1962.

</pre>

<p>
Clearly, I subscribe to the notion that difficulty should not prevent
us from attempting to make things better.
</p>

<p>
Please don't say the GNU software is not Linux. If that's your
argument, then read the title of this article as Ten Things I Dislike
About GNU/Linux.
</p>


<p>
So here, in no particular order are ten things I dislike about Linux.
</p>


<h3>1. Silly restrictions</h3>

<pre class="code">
    mkdir /tmp/example
    cd /tmp/example
    rmdir .

    rmdir: .: Invalid argument
</pre>

<p>
But "rmdir ../example" is OK. <em>You know what I mean. Just do it.</em>
</p>

<p>
Ben Okopnik reminded me of:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    cp /tmp/foo             # Isn't it bloody OBVIOUS? Copy it *here*!
</pre>

<p>
especially since
</p>

<pre class="code">
    ln -s /tmp/foo
</pre>

<p>
does exactly the corresponding task.
</p>



<h3>2. Backward compatibility</h3>

<p>
There are countless examples. Here are a few:
</p>

<p>
The glibc fiasco. The C compiler disaster. Dynamic libraries in
general. Every new version of emacs.
</p>

<pre>

    When you upgrade to Emacs 22 from a previous version, some
    older versions of external Lisp packages are known to behave
    badly. So in general, it is recommended that you upgrade to
    the latest versions of any external Lisp packages that you are
    using.

    The following input methods were removed in Emacs 22.2, but
    this was not advertised...

</pre>

<p>
Compare that with FreeBSD:
</p>

<pre>
	In most cases a package created for an older version of
	FreeBSD can be installed and used on a newer system without
	difficulty since binary backward compatibility across major
	releases is enabled by default.

</pre>

<h3>3. Multiple distros</h3>

<p>
Are they really necessary? Fedora is not Ubuntu's
primary enemy. Surely that role ought to be reserved for Microsoft. In
the meantime, Bill has an army of technical people all marching to the
beat of a single drummer, while every 2 or 3 Open Source people are
creating their own separate orchestra. There is one Microsoft, one
Apple and countless flavours of Linux.
</p>

<p>
In my opinion, FreeBSD gets the balance just about right. Very little
is forced upon the user. The range of packages is huge. There is a
single (default) structure or framework with which all packages have
to comply. But, within the framework there is ample opportunity to
satisfy almost every conceivable whim.
</p>

<p>
FreeBSD is far from perfect; I might write about that one day, but
this is a Linux forum.
</p>


<h3>4. Too many desktop producers trying to emulate the offerings from Bill</h3>

<p>
I don't do Windows. There are many reasons, but one of them is look
and feel. The way Windows does many things messes with my head. I
could go on at length - I have in the past. But this article is about
Linux.
</p>

<p>
All I'm trying to suggest is that Linux does many (most) things really
really well. Let's celebrate those things and let's celebrate the
difference.
</p>


<h3>5. Uninterruptible commands</h3>

<p>
There are various examples, but I'll use network file systems.
</p>

<p>
You NFS-mount a disk on a remote system, e.g.
</p>

<pre class="code">
    mount tsf2:/spare /p6/spare
</pre>

<p>
For some reason, the remote machine is inaccessible; perhaps the
network is down, perhaps the machine has halted.
</p>

<p>
You now issue a df command (because you weren't concentrating):
</p>

<pre class="code">
    df -h
Filesystem                         Size     Used    Avail Use% Mounted
/dev/hdc9                          4.6G     4.3G      67M  99% /
/dev/hdc2                           97M      16M      76M  17% /boot
tmpfs                              363M        0     363M   0% /dev/shm
/dev/hdc7                           20G      16G     3.4G  83% /home
/dev/hdc8                          7.4G     851M     6.2G  12% /opt
</pre>

<p>
... and then the session just hangs. You can't use any key to regain
control. In such situations, when I've SSHed into a machine, I often
find it quicker to go
</p>

<pre><strong>
    RETURN
    ~.
</pre></strong>

<p>
to abort the entire ssh session and SSH back in, rather than wait for
the df command to return control to me.
</p>

<p>
You are supposed to be able to use one of <code>^C</code> or
<code>^\</code> but often both are powerless. Sometimes <code>^Z</code>
works (followed by something like "<code>kill %1</code>");
but that's unnecessarily obscure, and it doesn't always work.
</p>

<p>
Surely you can create a command that means "<em>I understand the
consequences, just do it.</em>" (Or even "<em>hang the consequences, just do
it.</em>") In effect, I've shown that disconnecting the SSH session achieves
the required result. Just give me a keystroke to do it.
</p>

<p>
Also, of course, shutting down the machine seems to make all sorts of
magic possible. It's just that shutting down the machine is somewhat
drastic.
</p>


<h3>6. Network file systems</h3>

<p>
This applies to both NFS and Samba.
</p>

<pre class="code">
    # umount /mnt/tsf500/C
umount: /mnt/tsf500/C: device is busy
umount: /mnt/tsf500/C: device is busy
</pre>

<pre class="code">
    umount -f /mnt/tsf500/C
umount2: Device or resource busy
umount: /mnt/tsf500/C: device is busy
umount2: Device or resource busy
umount: /mnt/tsf500/C: device is busy
</pre>

<p>
<strong><em>I'm</em></strong> the <em>!@#$%^&amp;*</em> human.
</p>

<p>
However, I have learnt about the "-l" option:
</p>

<pre>
       -l     Lazy unmount. Detach the filesystem from the filesystem  
              hierarchy now, and cleanup all references to the filesystem
              as soon as it is not busy anymore.
</pre>

<p>
It's not perfect, but it is better.
</p>


<h3>6. Memory handling</h3>

<p>
My example here is Firefox. I'm certain that Firefox leaks memory. And
I understand that I am an extremely heavy user of Firefox. As I write,
I have 7 Firefox windows running for a total of 40 tabs. And I am
trying very hard to restrain myself. I'm annoyed at how often I lose
my machine. I could easily be running 4 or 5 times as many Firefox
sessions.
</p>

<p>
As Firefox consumes more and more resources, in particular memory,
things start to go critical. Sometimes, if I'm quick, I can start
deleting sessions and get control back. Other times, I'm left in a
state where only a reboot can give me back control.
</p>

<p>
I surmise that what happens is that, after Firefox has used too much
memory, Linux cannot recover. It doesn't have to be that way. On my
FreeBSD system, I've gone through the same scenario, but the only
thing that suffers is Firefox itself. I get a message telling me that
Firefox has misbehaved and has been killed. The OS survives.
</p>


<h3>7. iptables</h3>

<p>
I miss ipfilter. Where is the equivalent of "ipf -F a"?
</p>

<p>
Part of the problem arise from the fact that iptables is incoherent.
There is a set of commands to do various things ("iptables ..."), but
a completely different syntax is used in iptables-save and
iptables-restore.
</p>

<p>
Further, there is asymmetry. On a machine on which no iptables
commands have been issued, iptables-save produces an empty answer
(zero lines). But once iptables has been invoked, one cannot get
back to this state with only iptables commands.
</p>

<p>
I have written a script to achieve what I want, but it just shouldn't
be that difficult.
</p>


<h3>8. Dot files</h3>

<p>
Here's one of my directories:
</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<p>
How do I select just the ones which begin with a dot?
</p>

<p>
I can do it, but I have to use excruciating contortions. For 'ls', I can
use the very unsatisfactory
</p>

<pre>
    ls  -lA | fgrep ' .'
</pre>

<p>
For many years I have used the close approximation
</p>

<pre>
    ls -d .??*
</pre>

<p>
to refer to entries which begin with a dot but exclude . and .. with
reasonable success.
</p>

<p>
Further, what if you want to do some form of treewalking? You want all
entries (except . and ..) irrespective of whether their name begins
with a dot or not.
</p>

<p>
Recently I discovered bash's
</p>

<pre>
    shopt -s dotglob
</pre>

<p>
which does not help with ls, but does have the redeeming virtue that
it "flattens out" the name space and treats all entries uniformly
whether the entry starts with dot or not. Now the problem of selecting
files that begin with a dot reduces to the problem of selecting any
group of files with some commonality.
</p>

<p>
Further, because it excludes . and .. it allows simple constructs like
</p>

<pre>
    file */*/*
</pre>

<p>
to behave nicely. See also nocaseglob.
</p>


<h3>9. Mouse Selection</h3>

<p>
I know that this applies to all platforms and most products. I'm
complaining here because, in my mind, Linux is about freedom - and I
would hope that means freedom from stupidity. This applies to Firefox
and, from my experience, most GUIs.
</p>

<p>
Here's a bit of screen:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    Line 1
    Line 2
x   Line 3
    Line 4
    Line 5
</pre>


<p>
The "x" represents the cursor position. I press-and-hold the left
button, and begin to swipe downwards and to the right. As the mouse
hits one of the L's (say the first character in "Line 3"), all the
text above this point is highlighted. I know that Microsoft does it
that way, but why?
</p>

<p>
It's not as if I am able to select an area. If instead I start with my
mouse over the "n" of "Line 3" and I swipe downwards and to the right,
I won't only pick up text to the right of the "n" in the next line,
I'll get all of the next line.
</p>

<p>
So it understands lines, but it behaves as if that understanding only
applies sometimes. It seems to me that this violates the Principle of
Least Surprise.
</p>

<p>
Where it's particularly galling is when the text I'm swiping is near
the top of what I can see, because then I don't realise that the stuff
above has been selected - until I paste what I believe is a couple of
lines only to discover that I have pasted several hundred lines. Oops!
Talk about Least Surprise; I'm astonished!
</p>

<p>
What I want is that, if I put my cursor somewhere on a line and
select, I only pick up from the original point of my cursor to the
right and down. Too difficult, you say? Well, maybe. But consider
this. My workaround for this scenario is to select from the other end
and swipe to the left and up to the beginning. So, if I want to select
Lines 3 and 4, I place my mouse out to the right on line 4 (sometimes
a long way out), like this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    Line 1
    Line 2
    Line 3
    Line 4          x
    Line 5
</pre>

<p>
And, guess what. First, it works! If I begin to swipe to the left and
up, I do NOT get any of Line 5 in my selection. And, second, surprise,
surprise, as I continue to swipe to the left, no matter how far left
of the L in Line 3 I go, I never get anything ABOVE Line 3 - even if I
go out of the window and off the screen to the left!
</p>

<p>
As far as I'm concerned, don't tell me it can't be done (that's
virtually never true), or that it's too hard (that's just a matter of
will) - just do it.
</p>


<h3>10. Filetypes</h3>

<p>
Why did Linux decide to do away with filetypes?
</p>

<p>
I think the various DEC operating systems had the best handle on
filetypes. Let's say I wrote a script, <code>pdfsplit.sh</code>. I could have the
filetype "sh" to indicate that this script is intended for execution
by /bin/sh, but I could invoke it either by using the full name, or
simply by using the part of the name to the left of the dot, <code>pdfsplit</code>
in this case. It's just a little more elegant.
</p>

<p>
Then executables, e.g. 'ls', could be called something like ls.exe or
ls.bin but still be invoked with "ls". When you list a directory, you
would be able to tell what type most of the files were without having
to run "file".
</p>

<p>
Magic numbers could still serve the purpose they have now.
</p>


<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
So there you have them. I'm not even saying they are the 10 most
annoying things. I'm sure other people would not be as irritated as I
am with the items on the list. They might have a different list. I
even suspect that, were I to start from scratch, <em>I</em> would
produce a different list.
</p>

<p>
I am hoping to provoke some sort of response, preferably
recommendations for mechanisms people have discovered to ameliorate
the annoyance.
</p>

<p>
And, who knows? Perhaps in the long term, some people will agree with
some of my grumbles and work towards improvement.

</pre>


<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>

Most flavours of Unix/Linux/BSD are broadly alike. But they are often
subtly different (sometimes, not so subtly).
</p>

<p>
At the moment, I work in an environment where I have inherited a large
number of Unix-like machines. The platforms include mainly CentOS
and Solaris, but I've seen references to FreeBSD and others. When I
have to work on a machine, I want to concentrate on <b>what</b> I have
to do, not <b>how</b> to do it.
</p>

<p>
In the past, I have worked on different platforms for other reasons.
One company I worked for supported several different Unix-like
platforms: Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, IRIX, SCO; all considered to be
flavours of Unix, yet all different.
</p>

<p>
That's part of the reason for having an abstraction layer: to work in
an environment which allows me to be unconcerned about the specific
details of the underlying platform.
</p>

<p>
Another reason is to provide myself with a toolkit of commands that
conveniently perform common tasks.
</p>

<p>
In the very early days, I was trying to smooth the transition from
DEC's VMS to Unix.
</p>

<p>
Ultimately, HAL is an aspiration. Probably, it can never be achieved,
in part because it is aimed at a moving target. Operating systems keep
evolving; and I keep searching for the ultimate environment. As long as
these change, there will be a requirement to modify or refine my
HAL.
</p>

<h3>Motivation and Direction</h3>

<p>
A reader has asked for more information on my HAL. Perhaps he did not
expect as much as he is going to get. I'm going to try to juggle
keeping things interesting with a how-to which will allow people to
create their own PAL (Platform Abstraction Layer).
</p>

<p>
If you want to run HAL exactly as I do, I don't mind. I just don't
think it makes much sense. First, as no two people are exactly alike,
I suspect no other person would be completely comfortable in my world.
</p>

<p>
Second, as I trawled through my HAL recently in preparation for making
it available, I discovered to my horror how much obsolete material I
had accumulated over 20 years. There are scripts there I don't even
remember writing.
</p>

<p>
I don't know how far I will take this, but I suspect there will be
several articles. Unfortunately, there's a bit of a learning curve.
Consequently, this episode is likely to be a little disappointing. But,
if you stay with me, I think you'll find the next episodes much more
rewarding.
</p>

<p>

<h3>Look and Feel</h3>
</p>

<p>
What does it feel like to live in my world? Here's how it begins:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">

Starting .bash_profile
Start .bash_profile

End of .bashrc
<b>freew:~-20:40:29-bash$</b>
</pre>

<p>
Some quick observations.
</p>

<p>
Usually, if I've set up my environment, when I log in, I get pretty
much what you see above. I'll take you through it a little later.
However, for the purpose of this exercise, I've arranged that someone
could log in as themselves, unpack a package containing my HAL and
simply invoke a single command to jump into my world.
</p>

<p>
That's what you see in the first line.
</p>

<p>
I usually log in as <tt>henryg</tt> but I've created a special account
<tt>henryx</tt> which has none of my HAL by default, so that I can be
as like a vanilla user as possible. I then run <b>GO.sh</b> to invoke
HAL.
</p>

<p>
Next you'll notice that my world is quite chatty. When I first
encountered Unix - in 1985 - I read somewhere that Unix commands do
their work silently. I've never been comfortable with that, perhaps
because I'd previously worked for a computer marketing company, Prime.
When we were to do presentations to prospects, the Branch Manager
would say, "Tell 'em what you're gonna tell 'em; tell 'em; then tell
'em what you've told 'em."
</p>

<p>
I want my world to do it; and tell me that it has done it.
</p>

<p>
I'm not clear why people want commands to execute silently. I've seen
too many examples of things going wrong silently. Perhaps, in the early
days of Unix, when interaction occurred on a Teletype - slow, noisy
and consuming paper - silent made sense. But now?
</p>

<p>
Mind you, one needs balance. Too much output and one will miss
important messages in the chatter. The above is starting to get too
noisy.
</p>

<p>
I suppose, also, that the verbosity of the output reflects who I am. I
may have few faults :-), but I'll admit to a tendency to prolixity.
</p>

<p>
I've noticed a few errors in the above. These relate to elements of my
HAL that I have started to weed out because they are so old and no
longer the least bit relevant. I'm going to leave them for the moment,
for several reasons. It will confirm for you that I am human; and as
fallible as any other human. 
</p>

<p>
It will show that things don't have to be perfect to be good. In fact,
as Ben says, and as I've written before, perfect can be the enemy of
good.
</p>

<p>
One can aspire to perfection. Perhaps one ought to aspire to
perfection. I've spent a lot of time in the business world. Every
choice must be weighed up in terms of cost/benefit. Even in the
non-business world, there are limited resources. The time I spend
cleaning up my examples has to be weighed against the time I spend
writing this explanation. I am not blessed with unlimited time.
</p>

<p>
Even if I'm not in business, in the end, it's a business decision.
</p>




<h3>A walk through the setup</h3>

<p>
The script <b>GO.sh</b> creates an environment similar to that of a
user who has logged in. It is near enough if one is on a platform that
uses bash. 
</p>

<ul>
	In my login-time script, <b>.login_sh</b>, there is code to
	search for the best shell. In the early days, my login shell
	could be sh or csh; the script would search in various places
	for bash or ksh and, if one were found, promote my
	environment.
</ul>

<p>
<b>GO.sh</b> invokes bash explicitly because every Linux comes with
bash. If you prefer some other shell, you will have to adjust some
scripts.
</p>

<pre>
	When bash is invoked as an interactive login shell ..., it
	first reads ... /etc/profile [then] looks for ~/.bash_profile
	...

		-- from the BASH(1) man page
</pre>

<p>
So the first thing you see above is the invocation of
<b>~/.bash_profile</b>. My <b>~/.bash_profile</b> explicitly sources 
<b>$HOME/.bashrc</b>. It then explicitly sources <b>.login_sh</b>.
</p>

<p>
This perhaps leads to some redundancy, where some scripts are invoked
twice. But, better some redundancy than that a script be omitted.
</p>

<p>
You will see messages indicating the invocation and termination of
these scripts in the messages above.
</p>

<h3>The Startup Scripts</h3>

Here is a map of the scripts involved in startup and how they are
invoked. If there is no path, the scripts are relative to $HOME.

<pre class="code">
.bash_profile
	. $HOME/.bashrc
	        source ~/bash/csh-compat
	        source ~/.ENV./.cshrc_bash
		        source $HOME/scripts/Uts_setup
	        source ~/.ENV./.kshrc_bash
			`$HOME/.ENV./set_gnutar.sh`
	source .login_sh
		`$HOME/.ENV./.login.set_terminal`
		. $HOME/.ENV./.login$xxx.optimation_sh
		. $HOME/.ENV./.login.`uname`
		. /tmp/HMGUSESHELL
</pre>

Here's what they do (in brief):

<pre class="code">
.bash_profile	login-time startup file for bash

		wrapper; basically, gets things going

.bashrc		Bourne Again SHell init file

		configures tty settings
		sets various path variables, other environment variables
		defines some "su" functions
		defines many aliases
		displays my motd (message of the day)

csh-compat	C-shell compatibility package

.cshrc_bash	a script file to be shared between csh and bash

		mainly aliases

Uts_setup	specific to an old project

.kshrc_bash	a script file to be shared between ksh and bash

		mainly functions

set_gnutar.sh	set GNUTAR environment variable 

.login_sh	login time setups

		tty settings
		Set PATH
		Set other paths
		Set DISPLAY
		Platform-specific settings
		work-specific settings
		Calculate shell to use

</pre>


<h3>The Rest of the Login Messages</h3>


<p>
The message <i>Setting up for UTS</i> (followed by an error message)
dates back to 1991; it's obsolete, referring to a project I was
working on back then.
</p>


<p>
The line beginning <i>GNUTAR</i> dates back to 1995 when I was working
on machines which had rather feeble versions of <b>tar</b>. Where
possible, I would assign the environment variable <i>GNUTAR</i> to
refer to a more feature-rich version of tar, usually, GNU tar.
<i>GNUTAR</i> was used in several functions.
</p>

<p>
We then have several <i>Dropping</i> messages. These come from
<b>.login_sh</b>. Since different flavours of Unix had software in
different places, I used to set the PATH variable to every possible
place on every possible platform. I then realised that this was
dreadfully inefficient (probably while trawling through a Solaris
truss output). So I changed the logic. I set another variable to every
possible path; then tested if the path actually existed on the current
platform before adding it to <b>PATH</b>. Those that didn't were
dropped.
</p>

<p>
The next 3 lines refer to my search for an appropriate DISPLAY variable.
</p>

<p>
Finally, there are a couple of messages to do with other environment
variables.
</p>

<h3>Wrap Up</h3>

<p>
That's probably enough for Part 1.
</p>

<p>
In subsequent episodes I hope to walk you through various parts of my
HAL, stopping along the way to examine various bits in some detail.
</p>

<p>
For now, if I've done my job, you ought to be able to <a
href="misc/grebler/HAL_ROOT.tar.gz">obtain the package</a>, unpack it and invoke it
- and find yourself in my world.
</p>

<p>
I'm not suggesting that you want to live in my world, but you might
find bits that you like and can use for yourself.

<h1>Enlightened Distros</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/hoogland.html">Jeff Hoogland</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<p>
 I've developed a bit of an obsession with the <a href="http://jeffhoogland.blogspot.com/search/label/enlightenment">Enlightenment</a>
 desktop of the late. Even though this desktop is fantastic there are
currently not very many distributions that utilize it. Today I would like
to take the time to mention those that offer a version with my favorite
desktop.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.pclinuxos.com/">
</a><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://www.pclinuxos.com/">PCLinuxOS</a>:</span>
</p>

<p>
<img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="misc/hoogland/pclinuxos.png" alt="" border="0" />
</p>

<p>
  The biggest name distribution to (currently) offer an "official"
Enlightenment variation is PCLinuxOS. PCLOS is an RPM based distribution
that uses apt-get for its package manager. As this is an official
PCLinuxOS variation it is fully compatible with and uses the standard
PCLinuxOS repositories. PCLinuxOS E17 currently has the beta 3 EFL packages
in its repositories and stays regularly up to date.</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://www.sabayon.org/">Sabayon</a>:</span>
</p>

<p>
<img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="misc/hoogland/sabayon.png" alt="" border="0" />
</p>

<p>
 Sabayon is a derivative of <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a> that is fully backwards compatible. They recently released an "experimental" spin that utilizes the Enlightenment desktop. This spin is based on the latest version of Sabayon. You can find more information on it <a href="http://forum.sabayon.org/viewtopic.php?f=60&amp;t=22208&amp;start=0">here</a>
.</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://bodhilinux.com/">Bodhi Linux</a>:</span>
</p>

<p>
<img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 400px; height: 250px;" src="misc/hoogland/bodhi.png" alt="" border="0" />
</p>

<p>
  Bodhi Linux is an Ubuntu derivative that uses 10.04 as a base, but back
ports newer software from Maverick and even Natty repositories. It receives
regular Enlightenment updates and currently features the EFL beta 3
libraries. It is fully backwards compatible with Ubuntu 10.04 packages.</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://macpup.org/">Macpup</a>:</span>
</p>

<p>
<img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="misc/hoogland/macpup.png" alt="" border="0" />
</p>

<p>
 Macpup is a distro based on <a href="http://www.puppylinux.org/">Puppy Linux</a>
. Macpup's latest release is based on "Lucid Puppy" a version of Puppy that
is compatible with binaries made for Ubuntu 10.04. Macpup ships with ELF
beta 1 version of the Enlightenment files compiled from SVN revision 52995.
Something worth noting is that Macpup feels a bit incomplete as certain
Enlightenment features do not work (such as shutting down). Finally I'd
like to note that if you want to update Enlightenment under Macpup you will
need to compile and install the updates yourself from source.</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://www.unity-linux.hu/unite17/">Unite17</a>:</span>
</p>

<p>
<img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 400px; height: 225px;" src="misc/hoogland/unite17_2010_02.png" alt="" border="0" />
</p>

<p>
 Unite17 is the first derivative built on top of <a href="http://unity-linux.org/">Unity Linux</a>, which in turn is a derivative of <a href="http://www2.mandriva.com/en/">Mandriva</a>
.  Unite17 is a Hungarian Enlightenment distribution that has a large 
default application set. Unite17 was formly known as PCe17OS.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://jeffhoogland.blogspot.com/2010/03/elive-20-distro-review.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Elive</span></a>
:</p>

<p>
<img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 400px; height: 320px;" src="misc/hoogland/elive.png" alt="" border="0" />
</p>

<p>
  Elive is based on Debian stable (5.0), over time it has become what I
believe to be kind of the defacto standard of Enlightenment distributions.
While it does work well and is more than elegant all of its packages are
fairly old. Even its Enlightenment packages are dated at this point, its
last release was over nine months ago.</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://www.pentoo.ch/">Pentoo</a>:</span>
</p>

<p>
<img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 400px; height: 320px;" src="misc/hoogland/pentoo.png" alt="" border="0" />
</p>

<p>
  Pentoo gets its name from its Gentoo base and its function for network
penetration testing. It utilizes Enlightenment more for its speed than
for its elegance. It is backwards compatible with Gentoo, but its last
release is over a year old at this point.</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://moonos.org/">MoonOS</a>
:</p>

<p>
</span><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 400px; height: 320px;" src="misc/hoogland/moonos.png" alt="" border="0" />
</p>

<p>
  MoonOS is an Ubuntu derivative whose last release used 9.04 as a base. It
is important to note that MoonOS no longer receives updates as 9.04's life
span has run out. Still, it is nice looking and if you are willing to
compile your own Enlightenment updates it can work just fine as an OS
(after upgrading Ubuntu versions). This 9.04 version is the last copy of
MoonOS to use the Enlightenment desktop, an announcement was posted that
future versions will be using the Gnome desktop.</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://www.yellowdoglinux.com/">YellowDog</a>:</span>
</p>

<p>
<img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 400px; height: 229px;" src="misc/hoogland/Yellow-Dog-Linux_1.jpg" alt="" border="0" />
</p>

<p>
  Yellow Dog is an Enlightenment distro that works on PowerPC and Cell
processor architectures. It is designed for home use (on the PS3/PPCs Macs)
and server use/cluster computing. It is built on top of the community
version of Redhat Linux known as CentOS and is maintained by the company
Fixstars.</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://opengeu.intilinux.com/">OpenGEU</a>:</span>
</p>

<p>
<img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 400px; height: 320px;" src="misc/hoogland/opengeu.png" alt="" border="0" />
</p>

<p>
  OpenGEU is another Ubuntu derivative (there are always lots of those)
whose most recent version is built on 8.10. It has been a long while since
we saw any new releases from the OpenGEU team, but they promise us a Debian
based release at some point in the future.</p>

<p>
  I think I covered most all the Enlightenment based Linux distributions -
really shows how few there are that I can list them all like this in one
post! If I missed anything please drop a comment below to let me know.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  When a server environment is created using virtualization software or a
cloud service, the number of servers tends to increase rapidly. Software
installation and configuration are required every time a server is
created. Further, synchronizing server configurations requires additional
effort such as writing shell scripts.
</p>

<p>
  In this article, we will describe how to build a server environment
automatically using a relatively new software tool called Puppet. Although
this tool is typically used to manage large-scale server infrastructure
(such as a data center or a Web service with a large number of users), it
can also be used to manage a small number of servers. However, Puppet is a
newly developed tool, and the existing documentation and the articles
on Puppet are still somewhat cursory.
</p>

<p>
  Here, we will show you simple examples that you can use to configure
common server settings using Puppet without any difficulty. Using Puppet,
you can create a new server instantaneously by entering only a few
commands. Puppet will also periodically synchronize the coniguration of the
created servers.

</p>

<p>
 Note that it will be especially useful for configuring and maintaining
common security settings including <em>sudo</em>, <em>sshd</em>, and
<em>iptables</em>. In this article, we have also described some of our
original and simple but powerful common security settings that have
actually been used in our server environment.
</p>

<p>
  We have tested all the examples using the CentOS 5 operating system.
However, you can apply the described techniques to Linux and other
operating systems.
</p>

<h3>Installing Puppet</h3>
<p>
  Puppet adopts a server-client architecture. Each client periodically
communicates with one (or more) master servers and synchronizes the
configuration (every half hour by default). So, first you need to prepare
at least two server instances; one would be the Puppet master server and
the others would be the Puppet client servers.
</p>

<p>
 Now, let us proceed to install Puppet. <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL">Fedora EPEL</a>
 provides the Puppet Yum package. If your servers do not have EPEL, please
install it before proceeding:
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo rpm -Uvh http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm
</pre>

<p>
 Then, install the <em>puppet-server</em> package on the master server that
manages the other servers and <em>puppet</em> on the client servers:
</p>

<p>
  On the master server:
</p>

<pre class="code">
$ sudo yum -y install puppet-server
$ sudo chkconfig puppetmaster on
$ sudo service puppetmaster start
</pre>

<p>
  On the client servers:
</p>

<pre class="code">
$ sudo yum -y install puppet
$ sudo chkconfig puppet on
$ sudo service puppet start
</pre>

<p>
  In addition, if your master server is placed behind a firewall and you
want to use Puppet on servers that are outside the firewall, you need to
open TCP port 8140.
</p>

<h3>A very brief introduction to Puppet</h3>
<p>
 In Puppet, all configurations are described as <em>resources</em>.
Resources can be <em>files</em>, <em>software packages</em>, <em>server
services</em>, etc. For example, the following <em>file</em> resource
represents a very basic <em>/etc/passwd</em> file that is owned by root and
has permission settings of '644':
</p>

<pre class="code">
file { '/etc/passwd':
    owner   =&gt; root,
    mode    =&gt; 644,
}
</pre>

<p>
 The following configuration installs the <em>openssh-server</em> package,
enables the <em>sshd</em> service by default, and ensures that <em>sshd</em>
is running:
</p>

<pre class="code">
package { 'openssh-server':
    ensure =&gt; installed,
}

service { 'sshd':
    enable  =&gt; true,
    ensure  =&gt; running,
    require =&gt; Package['openssh-server'],
}
</pre>

<p>
 Now, let's apply these configurations to your servers. In Puppet,
<em>site.pp</em> is a special file that is included by default. If the
server configuration is not complex, it might be advantageous to write all
the configuration settings in this file. To do so, please paste the above
code into your <em>/etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp</em>.
</p>

<pre class="code">
file { '/etc/passwd':
    owner   =&gt; root,
    mode    =&gt; 644,
}

package { 'openssh-server':
    ensure =&gt; installed,
}

service { 'sshd':
    enable  =&gt; true,
    ensure  =&gt; running,
    require =&gt; Package['openssh-server'],
}
</pre>

<p>
 Next, you need to register and sign the client servers to the master
server.<br />
 Please execute the following command on the client servers:
</p>

<pre class="code">
$ sudo puppetd --test --waitforcert 30 --server MASTER_SERVER_ADDRESS
</pre>

<p>
  and run the following command on the master server.
</p>

<pre class="code">
$ sudo puppetca --list
(YOUR CLIENT_SERVER_ADDRESS IS DISPLAYED HERE)
$ sudo puppetca --sign CLIENT_SERVER_ADDRESS
</pre>

<p>
 Then, back on the client server's console, you will notice that all the
above configuration entries have been applied automatically by Puppet.<br />
Further, you will need to add the following parameter to <em>/etc/puppet/puppet.conf</em>
 in order to specify the address of the master server to the clients.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[main]
    server = MASTER_SERVER_ADDRESS
</pre>

<p>
 Now, Puppet will automatically synchronize the server configurations every
30 minutes. You can confirm this in <em>/var/log/messages</em>:
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo tail /var/log/messages
</pre>

<h3>Configuration examples</h3>
<p>
 In this section, we will provide several basic configuration examples. If
you want to use them, please paste them into your <em>site.pp</em>.
</p>

<h4>Add administrative user</h4>
<p>
 Puppet provides a <em>user</em> resource that enables us to manage user
accounts. The following configuration adds user <em>admin</em> to your server:
</p>

<pre class="code">
# Add "admin" account
user { 'admin':
    home       =&gt; '/home/admin',   # home directory is /home/admin
    managehome =&gt; true,            # manage the home directory by Puppet
    groups     =&gt; ['wheel'],       # the user belongs to wheel group
    password   =&gt; 'PASSWORD_HASH', # hashed password text
}
</pre>

<p>
PASSWORD_HASH is a basic password hash, similar to those used in
<em>/etc/shadow</em>. You can generate it manually using the following
commands:
</p>

<pre class="code">
$ sudo yum -y install ircd-ratbox-mkpasswd
$ /usr/bin/ircd-mkpasswd -m -s 'SALT' -p 'PASSWORD'
</pre>

<p class="editorial">[ Standard <code>crypt(3)</code> password creation is
also available without installing any additional software; running, e.g.
<span id="stdout">perl -wle 'print crypt "PASSWORD", "SALT"'</span> or <span id="stdout">python -c
'import crypt; print(crypt.crypt("PASSWORD", "SALT"))'</span> will generate
one. -- Ben ]
</p>

<h4>sudo</h4>
<p>
 The following configuration installs the <em>sudo</em> package and
modifies <em>sudoers</em> by using <a href="http://augeas.net/">augeas</a> to
allow users belonging to the <em>wheel</em> group to use <em>sudo</em>:
</p>

<pre class="code">
# Install sudo package
package { 'sudo':
    ensure =&gt; installed, # ensure sudo package installed
}

# Allow users belonging wheel group to use sudo
augeas { 'sudowheel':
    context =&gt; '/files/etc/sudoers', # target file is /etc/sudoers
    changes =&gt; [
        # allow wheel users to use sudo
        'set spec[user = "%wheel"]/user %wheel',
        'set spec[user = "%wheel"]/host_group/host ALL',
        'set spec[user = "%wheel"]/host_group/command ALL',
        'set spec[user = "%wheel"]/host_group/command/runas_user ALL',
    ]
}
</pre>

<h4>SSH</h4>
<p>
 This configuration enables you to install and use <em>ssh</em> on your
server. It also changes <em>sshd_config</em> to deny root logins and logins
with empty passwords.
</p>

<pre class="code">
# Install openssh-server package
package { 'openssh-server':
    ensure =&gt; installed,
}

# Enable sshd service
service { 'sshd':
    enable  =&gt; true,                      # execute sshd on startup
    ensure  =&gt; running,                   # ensure sshd running
    require =&gt; Package['openssh-server'], # require openssh-server before applying this config
}

# Change sshd configuration
augeas { 'sshd_config':
    context =&gt; '/files/etc/ssh/sshd_config', # target file is /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    notify  =&gt; Service['sshd'],              # restart sshd after applying this config
    changes =&gt; [
        # deny root logins and logins with empty passwords
        'set PermitRootLogin no',
        'set PermitEmptyPasswords no',
    ],
}
</pre>

<h4>iptables</h4>
<p>
 To configure iptables using Puppet, you'll need to install an external module
called <a href="https://github.com/kbarber/puppet-iptables/">puppet-iptables</a>
. You need to download and install it from GitHub.
</p>

<pre class="code">
$ cd /tmp
$ wget --no-check-certificate "https://github.com/kbarber/puppet-iptables/tarball/master"
$ tar xvzf kbarber-puppet-iptables-1.2.0-2-g9deddbb.tar.gz
$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/puppet/modules
$ sudo mv kbarber-puppet-iptables-9deddbb /etc/puppet/modules/
</pre>

<p>
 Also, you need to add the following parameters to your <em>/etc/puppet/puppet.conf</em>
 in both the master server and the client servers:
</p>

<pre class="code">
[main]
    libdir = /var/lib/puppet/lib

[puppetd]
    pluginsync=true
    plugindest=/var/lib/puppet/lib
</pre>

<p>
 Now, you can use <em>iptables</em> resources. The following is a basic
firewall configuration that only accepts packets over existing connections,
those from the localhost and the LAN, and those that come in via SSH.
</p>

<pre class="code">
# Allow packets that belong to or related to an existing connection
iptables { 'allow established, related':
    state =&gt; ['ESTABLISHED', 'RELATED'],
    proto =&gt; 'all',
    jump  =&gt; 'ACCEPT',
}

# Allow all packets from localhost
iptables { 'allow localhost':
    source =&gt; '127.0.0.1',
    proto  =&gt; 'all',
    jump   =&gt; 'ACCEPT',
}

# Allow all packets from LAN
iptables { 'allow LAN':
    source =&gt; '192.168.0.0/16',
    proto  =&gt; 'all',
    jump   =&gt; 'ACCEPT',
}

# Allow all packets to SSH
iptables { 'allow ssh':
    proto =&gt; 'tcp',
    dport =&gt; 22,
    jump  =&gt; 'ACCEPT',
}

# Drop all incoming packets by default
iptables { 'drop incoming packets':
    chain =&gt; 'INPUT',
    proto =&gt; 'all',
    jump  =&gt; 'DROP',
}
</pre>

<h1>The reason why I have switched to zsh - Part 1</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/silva.html">Anderson Silva</a> and <a href="../authors/woodson.html">Matt Woodson</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>The short answer: It's all Matt's fault!</p>

<p>The proper article-formatted answer: I've been a one-shell kind of person for
	 the past 15 years using bash on Linux (and more recently on Mac OS X as
	 well). Over the years, I have blown the minds of so many Windows users with
	 the power of the shell that I cannot help but smile when I think about it.
	 Yet I have never given much thought to other shells. Although, for the
	 record, I didn't just start using bash because it was the default option on
	 my Linux distribution of choice. My uncle, back in 1995, introduced me to
	 Linux and csh, which was his choice of shell at the time. I've also played
	 around with tcsh as well, but it just did not stick with me. I am going to
	 guess that having bash as the default shell on my distribution helped, but
	 it wasn't the defining factor. Maybe the fact that there are so many
	 examples, articles and books written about bash programming contributed to
	 my affection for bash over the years.</p>

<p>Then at work, a new guy came onto my team and over time started to show all
	 of us the kinds of things he can do with zsh to make his life a bit less
	 annoying, and his work a bit more efficient as a release
	 engineer/programmer/system administrator.</p>

<p>As the New Year approached, I decided I wanted learn about something new,
	 fun, yet relevant to my job; something that I could research on my own, and
	 maybe even write an article about. (Note: the key word for me here is fun;
	 there's plenty of stuff to learn about in the Linux world, but so much of
	 it I find it so boring. Shells isn't one of those things :-))</p>

<p>In early January, I approached Matt, the new guy, and asked him to give me a
	 tour of the zsh. Not only did he gave me an overview of the things zsh can
	 do, on top of the virtually backward compatible functionality with bash, he
	 also took my .bashrc file and converted it to a .zshrc with quite a few
	 goodies added to it.</p>

<p>These 'goodies' are the reason I am sticking with zsh, and the reason
	 why Matt and I are writing this series of articles to share them with
	 you.</p>

<h3>First Things First</h3>

<p>Before showing you some tricks on zsh, let's make sure you can run it:</p>

<p>To install on Fedora:</p>

<pre class="code">$ yum install zsh</pre>

<p>To install on Ubuntu:</p>

<pre class="code">$ apt-get install zsh</pre>

<h3>Create a .zshrc before starting zsh</h3>

<p>Now that zsh has been installed, and assuming you have never ran zsh before,
	 let me give you the first tip Matt gave me regarding zsh: "Skip the .zshrc
	 wizard menu, find an existing .zshrc instead."</p>

<p>The wizard menu to create a .zshrc can be a bit overwhelming, but feel free
	 to try it out. Matt has been kind enough to make his .zshrc available to
	 the public, so you can download it and start your zsh experience at full
	 speed. Throughout the next few months, we will go through some of his zsh
	 settings as well.</p>

<p><a href="misc/silva/zshrc.gz">Download</a> Matt's .zshrc.</p>

<h3>Starting zsh</h3>

<p>You can manually switch to zsh any time, if all you want to do it give it a
	 try:</p>

<pre class="code">$ zsh</pre>

<p>Or if you want to make zsh your default shell:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ chsh
Changing shell for afsilva.
Password:
New shell [/bin/bash]: /bin/zsh
</pre>

<p>Now, zsh should be your default shell the next time you login.</p>

<h3>The Goodies</h3>

<p>Hopefully you are up and running on zsh now, and I should be able to share
	 some of the first things that Matt showed me when he introduced me to zsh.
	 They are:</p>

<h3>Changing the prompt</h3>

<p>Many of zsh functions come in the form of loading zsh shell function modules.
	 One of the modules that can be seen immediately is the promptinit module. 
	 Using this promptinit module, you can quickly change the default zsh
	 prompt:</p>

<p>To load the prompt shell functions:</p>

<pre class="code">
	$ autoload -U promptinit
    $ promptinit
</pre>

<p>You can see the available prompts by running the command:</p>

<pre class="code">$ prompt -l
Currently available prompt themes:
adam1 adam2 bart bigfade clint elite2 elite fade fire off oliver pws 
redhat suse walters zefram
</pre>

<p>To use or tryout a prompt:</p>

<pre class="code">$ prompt redhat</pre>

<h3>Intelligent tab completion (more than bash)</h3>

<p>I am a Fedora user, which is a Red Hat based distribution, and if you are
	 familiar with either of them, you know that the proper way to restart a
	 service is to run:</p>
	
<pre class="code">$ service some_service restart</pre>

<p>But, in my laziness, I always used:</p>

<pre class="code">$ /etc/init.d/some_service restart</pre>

<p>This is because I want bash to auto complete 'some_service' when I enter
	 'som' and hit tab afterwards. If I use the proper way, I have to spell out
	 the service name, which I usually forget or mistype.</p>

<p>Well, in zsh, hitting tab will not only auto-complete a command name, but it
	 will also auto-complete or give you options for parameters on many major
	 commands you may use on a daily basis.</p>

<p>So, something like:</p>

<pre class="code">$ servi&lt;tab&gt; some&lt;tab&gt; res&lt;tab&gt;</pre>

<p>Will auto-complete your request to:</p>

<pre class="code">$ service some_service restart</pre>

<p>I don't care who you are, that's nice right there! :-)</p>

<h3>Menu listing of options used with tab completion</h3>

<p>If you are used to tab auto-complete in bash, you should know that if bash
	 isn't able to find the unique command that matches your entry, it will tell
	 you the other commands it has found in its PATH. Like:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ serv&lt;tab&gt;
servertool service
</pre>

<p>In zsh, when it finds more than one matching command or parameter (wink,
	 wink) it will give you selectable menu of the available options when you
	 hit tab twice, and you can use the arrow keys to navigate through the
	 options and take your pick.</p>
	
<p><img src="misc/silva/image0.png" height="222" width="584"></p>

<h3>Enabling Auto-completion and Menu listing:</h3>

<p>To enable the features above, add the following lines to your ~/.zshrc:</h3>

<pre class="code">
    autoload -Uz compinit
    compinit
</pre>

<p>Next month, Matt and I will write some more about about other zsh features
	 like: spelling correction, globbing, aliases, floating point math, and
	 setting version control information on your prompt. Meanwhile, feel free 
	to look around <a href="http://www.zsh.org/">zsh website</a> and the man
	 pages (<em>man zshall</em>, for the meta man page).</p>

<p class="editorial">"Foolish Things" is a now-and-again compilation we run
based on our readers' input; once we have several of these stories
assembled in one place, we get to share them with all of you. If you enjoy
reading these cautionary tales of woe, proud stories of triumph, and just
plain weird and fun things that happen between humans and silicon, that's
great; if you have some to share so that others may enjoy them, even
better. Please send them to <a href="mailto:editor@linuxgazette.net">editor@linuxgazette.net</a>.

<p class="editorial">You can even tell us that it happened to A Friend of
Yours, and we'll believe you.</p>

<h3>Copy and Paste, Repent at Leisure</h3>
<p id="by"><b>Paul Hernaus</b><br></p>

<p>
This reminds me of a disaster I created.
</p>

<p>
I was working on a Sun Sparc, running Solaris and was trying to get a
program to work. The main problem was to get the LD_LIBRARY_PATH set to
a value so that all shared objects could be resolved.
</p>

<p>
Of course, 'ldd' is your friend. Now look for a moment at the output of ldd
on Solaris. Unfortunately I don't have a Solaris system at hand, but it
would look something like this (fortunately on Linux the output is less
dangerous):
</p>

<pre>
   &gt; /lib/libc.so libc.so
   &gt; /usr/lib/libwhatever.so libwhatever.so
</pre>

<p>
etc. I'm sure this is not completely accurate.
</p>

<p>
So, I had an xterm full of output like that. Then I wanted to grab the
mouse, and had an unfortunate motion control problem: I moved the mouse
and by accident hit the left mouse button and immediately after that the
middle mouse button. Result: I copied and then pasted a large part of
the xterm contents into my (root) shell. Immediately afterward I got a
message saying "session closed by peer" or something along those
lines...
</p>

<p>
<strong><em>Oops...</em></strong>
</p>

<p>
I thought I should share this with you. I can now laugh about it, but
when it happened it wasn't funny.

<h3>B****, What's My Name???</h3>
<p id="by"><b>Ben Okopnik</b><br></p>

<p>
This one happened a while ago. I still blush when I think of it - and
I'm not the blushing type. I'm reminded of it now because I am again doing
a backup and a distro upgrade - but this time, having learned my lesson,
I'm doing it the right way.
</p>

<p>
I was about to upgrade the distro on my laptop, and being a good little Linux
hacker, I first ran a backup to an external USB drive. Had to let it run
overnight - "USB" still meant "very slow" back then - but in the morning,
it was done. I wandered over to the machine, half-asleep<a id="lg_foolish.html_1_back"></a><a href="#lg_foolish.html_1">[1]</a>, 
plugged in a USB dongle, and fired up the program that would install a bootable
version of the distro on the dongle. Yeah, choose the ISO file, OK... oh,
look, the USB device is already selected, great... says that it needs
formatting - OK, click "Format this device"...
</p>

<p>
At which point, my brain caught up with my fingers. Um... oh-oh. The name
of the USB device that was listed in the one-line window was that of the
backup drive. The dongle was there too - but it was <em>below that
window</em>, where you'd have to scroll down to see it. I had just
formatted the backup drive that I had spent all night filling up.
</p>

<p>
No, 'gpart' and friends were of no help. Not only did the partition info
get wiped out, but the drive had also been reformatted to VFAT - since
that's what was used for setting up the bootable distro. A few moments of
half-awake typing was all that was necessary to scrap a night's backup.
</p>

<p>
These days, whenever I'm doing any disk formatting or any similar
operations, I 1) unplug any unnecessary storage devices, 2)
<strong>always</strong> triple-check the device name, and 3) make sure that
I'm fully awake and focused on the task. Certain things really do require all
your attention.
</p>

<p>
<a id="lg_foolish.html_1"></a><a href="#lg_foolish.html_1_back">[1]</a> I know, I know. Most of you are probably screaming "NOOOOOO!!!" because
you can see what's coming. Just like a horror movie, isn't it?

Ben is the Editor-in-Chief for Linux Gazette and a member of The Answer Gang.
</p>

<p>
<em>
Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became interested in electricity
at the tender age of six, promptly demonstrated it by sticking a fork into
a socket and starting a fire, and has been falling down technological
mineshafts ever since. He has been working with computers since the Elder
Days, when they had to be built by soldering parts onto printed circuit
boards and programs had to fit into 4k of memory (the recurring nightmares
have almost faded, actually.)
</p>

<p>
His subsequent experiences include creating software in more than two dozen
languages, network and database maintenance during the approach of a
hurricane, writing articles for publications ranging from sailing magazines
to technological journals, and teaching on a variety of topics ranging from
Soviet weaponry and IBM hardware repair to Solaris and Linux
administration, engineering, and programming. He also has the distinction
of setting up the first Linux-based public access network in St. Georges,
Bermuda as well as one of the first large-scale Linux-based mail servers in
St. Thomas, USVI.
</p>

<p>
After a seven-year Atlantic/Caribbean cruise under sail and passages up and
down the East coast of the US, he is currently anchored in northern
Florida. His consulting business presents him with a variety of challenges,
and his <strike>second brain</strike> Palm Pilot is crammed full of alarms,
many of which contain exclamation points.
</p>

<p>
He has been working with Linux since 1997, and credits it with his complete
loss of interest in waging nuclear warfare on parts of the Pacific Northwest.
