<p> <strong>This example in the 4th exercise works great.Just one problem that 
  I have with all these AJX &amp; XMLHTTPREQUEST is that the user's browser (IE) 
  prompts every time at the call-back that the page is trying to access off-site 
  pages that are not under its control, and that it poses a security risk. How 
  do you get past this without asking the user to turn off the security settings?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Take for example a real-world scenario where a transactional page must 
  get a real-time transaction back from another server-based page. Then upon clicking 
  something like a SUBMIT button, the user is going to get this little message 
  popping up, stating that it is a security risk. Any ideas?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks in advance.</strong></p>

  <p>Hi, Willem -</p>
  <p>First off, please turn off the HTML formatting when emailing TAG. Many people 
    in help forums, including a number of people here, will not take the trouble 
    to answer you if you require them to wade through HTML markup, and will discard 
    your mail unread; others will just be annoyed at having to clean up the extraneous 
    garbage. In addition, you've tripled the size of your message. I've corrected 
    the above problems, but some information may have been lost in the process. 
  </p>
  <p> Pardon me... you've used 'IE' and 'security' in the same sentence, without 
    the presence of modifiers such as 'bad' or 'non-existent'. I'm afraid that 
    makes your sentence unparseable. :)</p>
  <p>As I sometimes point out to people, the term &quot;Linux&quot; in &quot;Linux 
    Gazette&quot; tends to imply certain things - one of which is that answering 
    questions like &quot;How do I make IE do $WHATEVER&quot; comes down to &quot;use 
    Linux&quot;. Asking us how to fix broken crapware in a legacy OS is, I'm afraid, 
    an exercise in futility; the very concept of &quot;security settings&quot; 
    in a *browser*, a client-end application designed for viewing content, is 
    something that can only be discussed after accepting the postulate that water 
    does indeed run uphill, and the sun rises in the west.</p>
  <p>Perhaps your client can mitigate the problem somewhat by running a browser 
    that isn't broken-as-designed; Mozilla Firefox is a reasonable example of 
    such a critter. For anything beyond that, I'd suggest asking in Wind0ws- and 
    IE-related forums.</p>

<p> Re multi-seat computers, I think you are heading for much pain to use the 
  /dev/input/X devices directly!<br />
  If USB devices are powered on in a different order, these will move around!</p>
<p>Use Udev rules, and symlinks....</p>
<p>I have 4 mice on my system (don't ask why!); here is my config in case it is 
  useful:</p>
<pre class="code">
/etc/udev/rules.d/10-local.rules
------------------------------------------------------
#Rules for the various different mice on the system (the PS/2, Synaptics and Trackpoint)

#PS/2 mouse (usually /dev/input/mouse0)
#Symlink as /dev/input/ps2mouse
BUS="serio", kernel="mouse*", SYSFS{description}="i8042 Aux Port", 
NAME="input/%k", SYMLINK="input/ps2mouse"

#Synaptics touchpad (in mouse mode) (usually /dev/input/mouse1)
#Symlink as /dev/input/synaptics-mouse
BUS="usb", kernel="mouse*", DRIVER="usbhid", 
SYSFS{bInterfaceClass}="03", SYSFS{bInterfaceNumber}="00", 
SYSFS{interface}="Rel", NAME="input/%k", SYMLINK="input/synaptics-mouse"

#Synaptics touchpad (in event mode) (usually /dev/input/event5)
#Symlink as /dev/input/synaptics-event
BUS="usb", kernel="event*", DRIVER="usbhid", 
SYSFS{bInterfaceClass}="03", SYSFS{bInterfaceNumber}="00", 
SYSFS{interface}="Rel", NAME="input/%k", SYMLINK="input/synaptics-event"


#Trackpoint (usually /dev/input/mouse2)
#Symlink as /dev/input/trackpoint
BUS="usb", kernel="mouse*", DRIVER="usbhid", 
SYSFS{bInterfaceClass}="03", SYSFS{bInterfaceNumber}="01", 
SYSFS{interface}="Rel", NAME="input/%k", SYMLINK="input/trackpoint"

#WizardPen (usually /dev/input/event6)
#Symlink as /dev/input/wizardpen
BUS="usb", kernel="event*", DRIVER="usbhid", 
SYSFS{bInterfaceClass}="03", SYSFS{bInterfaceNumber}="00", 
SYSFS{interface}="Tablet WP5540U", NAME="input/%k", SYMLINK="input/wizardpen"
-----------------------------------------</pre>
<p>Then I can configure paragraphs in xorg.conf like this:</p>
<pre class="code">
Section "InputDevice"
     Identifier "ps2mouse"
     Driver "mouse"
     Option "Device" "/dev/input/ps2mouse"
     Option "Protocol" "ExplorerPS/2"
     Option "ZAxisMapping" "6 7"
EndSection

Section "InputDevice"
     Identifier "trackpoint"
     Driver "mouse"
     Option "Device" "/dev/input/trackpoint"
     Option "Protocol" "ExplorerPS/2"
     Option "ZAxisMapping" "6 7"
         #We want to use emulatewheel + emulatewheelltimeout.  But need Xorg 6.9 for that
         #Option "EmulateWheel" "on"
         #Option "EmulateWheelButton" "2"
         #Option "EmulateWheelTimeout" "200"
         #Option "YAxisMapping" "6 7"
         #Option "XAxisMapping" "4 5"
         #Option "ZAxisMapping" "10 11"
EndSection</pre>
<p>[Bob] - Picture Bob smacking his head and saying &quot;Doh!&quot; You are right 
  and the next article, the one where I get it *all* working, will use udev and 
  symlinks.<br />
  Using /dev/input was not too bad since the USB bus is enumerated the same way 
  on each power up. I only had to move things around once right after the initial 
  set up.</p>
<p>[[RichardN]] - I shall be interested to see how it goes, especially if you 
  can make the resulting system stable. Also, I wonder whether you can use udev 
  to distinguish between 6 different copies of a nominally identical item? Some 
  may let you use a serial number. Using the BUS id would be cheating - one ought 
  to be able to plug it together randomly and have it work!</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>P.S. An interesting challenge would be to get separate audio channels working 
    (eg a 5.1 channel motherboard could give 2 1/2 stereo outputs!) Or you could 
    use alsa to multiplex all the users together so that everyone can access the 
    speakers (and trust the users to resolve conflicts).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Ben] - </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&gt; I have 4 mice on my system (don't ask why!); here is my config in case 
    <br />
    &gt; it is useful:</p>
  <p>All right, I won't ask.</p>
  <p>...</p>
  <p>OK, maybe I will. :) So, why do you have _4_ mice on your system? And what's 
    the difference between 'mouse mode' and 'event mode'?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[RichardN]] - OK. I have an IBM ultranav keyboard containing a trackpoint 
  and a touchpad.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>1)The trackpoint is my primary mouse.</p>
  <p>2)The touchpad is also used as a mouse (mainly for scrolling). It appears 
    as 2 different devices, so you can either treat it as a mouse (I called this 
    mouse-mode), or as an event-device. The latter is the way to use its advanced 
    features with the synaptics driver, but I'm not actually doing this for now.</p>
  <p>3)A regular, PS2 mouse, for things like PCB design.</p>
  <p>4)A Graphics tablet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Ben] - Perhaps you should just write an article on Udev. :)</p>
<p>[[RichardN]] - You're very kind. But there is one already: <a href="http://reactivated.net/udevrules.php">http://reactivated.net/udevrules.php</a></p>

  
<p>[Ben] - [snip code] I can see a lot of sense in that. Judging from this example, 
  I should be able to figure out a config file that will keep my flash drive at 
  a single, consistent mountpoint (instead of having to do &quot;tail /var/log/messages&quot; 
  and mounting whatever random dev it managed to become.) I've heard of Udev before, 
  and even had a general idea of what it did, but never really explored it to 
  any depth. Nice!</p>
<p>[[RichardN]] - Indeed. You'll get a random /dev/sdX, but a consistent symlink 
  /dev/my_flash_drive (which you specify). Then, you can specify where it should 
  be mounted via options in fstab.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Even better: you can specify that a digital camera should have umask and 
    dmask (in fstab), which will fix the annoying tendency of JPGs to be marked 
    as executable!</p>

<p><strong>Have you tried a USB audio solution for each station as well, and how 
  would that be worked into the configuration?</strong></p>
<p>[Bob] - I have not tried it yet and do not know. The keyboards in my system 
  have a built in, 1 port hub. I was going to try to tie that hub to the user 
  at that keyboard. So, a flash drive plugged in would only be visible by that 
  user. Kind of the same with audio; they would have to bring their own audio 
  set but it would work if they plugged it in. </p>

<p>I do a lot with LTSP, so I'm familiar with sharing a machine between multiple 
  users. KDE's kiosktool will let you do quite a bit to disallow the more CPU 
  intensive screensavers. Verynice is also helpful in keeping rogue processes

<p>Wed Mar 8 22:24:36 PST 2006</p>
<p><strong>I had worked on this multi terminal setup for around 6 months(from 
  dec 2004 - july 2005) with RHEL 3.0 and RHEL 4.0, I made this setup with ati 
  and nvidia cards. But my biggest problem was that many application makes problems 
  on running on suh a setup especially sound applications. I rectified many of 
  the things thru some wiered ways. But some apps like the SWF plugin for mfirefox 
  made the big problems as only one instance of the plugin can be used, bcos the 
  sound is redirected to the same device always, say /dev/dsp.To solve this problem 
  we used a very ugly way,that we mounted the same /tmp folder for all the users 
  and made the app thinks that it was using a seperate /temp and the device is 
  always /dev/hda.This actually ruins the security of linux to a big extend.while 
  some other apps like tuxracer, konquest etc,which using the videocards directly(DRI 
  enabled).So I think the application design plays a vital role in such a setup. 
  Though the last kernel i used was 2.9.11, I didn't tried any new patches or 
  solutions aroused in last 8-10 months,but i am just sharing My other observations 
  also:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) I tried to make this setup on mother boards that of Intel make, 
  whic was an unsuccessful attempt, for which i don't get a good explanation </strong></p>
<p><strong>2)These setups are working good on AMD,and Some MSI mother boards, 
  with Intel or NVIDIA chipset with Nvidia cards.</strong></p>
<p><strong> 3)The NVIDIA AMD combination shows excellent performance over others</strong></p>
<p><strong> 4)The applications like mplayer shows certain level of uncertainity 
  even we configured it properly</strong></p>
<p><strong> 5)If u are using audio/visual applications u the application should 
  be configurable(eg: mplayer on which we can select the audio device from the 
  configuration options whic also supports the alsa devices).</strong></p>
<p><strong> 6) For a normal user it's not possible to configure applications like 
  swf plugin for firefox for all the six users.</strong></p>
<p><strong> 7)this setup is best suited for a lab environment,and newbies bcos 
  for advanced users the CPU speed may not be sufficient(like a kernel compilation 
  fatally degrades the performance of the whole system)</strong></p>
<p><strong>I Dont know these observations are correct or not as per current situation.but 
  I think most are still relevent. <br />
  regards<br />
  vineesh</strong></p>
<p>[Bob] - Thanks, Vineesh.<br />
  My solution to the sound problem was to turn it off for everyone -- not a very 
  elegant solution. A couple of readers have pointed out a system that would break 
  the PC into six separate systems, each with its own sound, X, and especially 
  important, security. The virtual server page is at http://linux-vserver.org. 
  I have not tried it yet but it looks promising.</p>

<p> <strong>Hi Bob,</strong></p>
<p><strong> I've been posting on Chris Tylers blog regarding my Multiseat configuration. 
  I've also had problems with a kernel Opps when the last person (seat 1 of a 
  two seat configuration) logs out. I was looking at you kernel opps message and 
  the call trace is very similar to yours. I was wondering if you still have that 
  system running, and if so could you send me a copy of an 'lspci -vvv'. Also, 
  I'm interested in hearing your experiences using the 'nv' driver. Were you having 
  a similar Opps?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Best Regards,<br />
  Chuck Sites</strong></p>
<p>[Bob] - The system is not running right now but I can set it up again fairly 
  easily. What did you want to know from the 'lspci -vvv'?</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>I tried both the nv and vesa drivers. Neither could successfully get all 
    six heads working. The nVidia driver was easily the best driver I tested. </p>
