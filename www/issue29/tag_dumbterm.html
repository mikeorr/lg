Connecting a Dumb Terminal to your Linux System
</H3>

<p><strong>From Mark Cohen on 07 May 1998 

<br><br>
Jim,

<br><br>
My name is Mark, I met you at the 
	<a href="http://www.balug.org/">balug</a> meeting this week. I 
just wanted to shoot off a note to you about getting <tt>getty</tt> to 
work on my linux box (RH5.0)  Im trying to connect my dumb terminal to 
it (pilot)

<br><br>
Any help would be greatly appreciated!

<br><br>
-Mark

	The simplest method that I know of is to add a line like
	this to your <tt>/etc/inittab</tt> file:

<pre>
t1:23:respawn:/sbin/agetty -L 38400,19200,9600,2400,1200 ttyS1 vt100
</pre>

	... assuming you have '<tt>agetty</tt>', that you want to use a null 
	modem on COM2 (use ttyS0 for COM1 etc), and that your 
	communications package on the PalmPilot will do vt100 
	emulation).

<br><br>
	If you don't have a copy of '<tt>agetty</tt>' you can use a line 
	like:

<pre>
t1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty ttyS2 DT38400 vt100
</pre>

	... assuming you have a reasonable <tt>/etc/gettydefs</tt> (like
	the default one that used to come with Red Hat 4.x --- and
	is probably unchanged in newer releases).  I won't go into
	the details about how the gettydefs file is constructed,
	let's suffice it to say that the syntax was "baroque".

<br><br>
	It's undoubtedly possible to use <tt>uugetty</tt> and 
	<tt>getty_ps</tt> with these as well --- though I haven't ever 
	bothered with those packages.  It should also be possible to use 
	<tt>mgetty</tt> (which I use for modem dial-in lines and incoming 
	fax support).  However that doesn't seem to work even when I use 
	the <tt>-r</tt> switch as specified in the manual.

<br><br>
	Definitely don't try this with <tt>mingetty</tt> --- that is designed
	purely for use with virtual consoles.

<br><br>
	In any event, these examples use "<tt>t1</tt>" as the inittab
	entry "id" and I have them enabled at different runlevels
	(since these examples are from different machines on my 
	network).  Read the <tt>inittab(5)</tt> man page for details about
	what the fields mean.

<br><br>
	After you've edited this file simply issue the command:

<br><br>
		'<tt>telinit q</tt>'

<br><br>
	... to "tell init" to re-read it's configuration file and	
	implement your changes.  In a few seconds you should be 
	able to login on that line (you might have to hit [Enter] 
	a couple of times to get a login prompt).  

<br><br>
	If you don't get a login  prompt, or you see a console message 
	like: "<tt>respawning too fast.... disabled for five minutes</tt>" 
	(check your <tt>/var/log/messages</tt> file for this and similar 
	errors from init and/or from any '<tt>getty</tt>' that you happen 
	to be using), you should double-check the syntax of your entry, 
	double-check which serial port you're plugged into (remember Linux' 
	numbering of serial and printer ports sometimes doesn't correspond to
	DOS/BIOS extensions --- some crufty hardware may cause confusion),
	and check for IRQ conflicts and cabling errors.

<br><br>
	If you still have problems with it after you've double and 
	triple checked every detail than you have some troubleshooting
	choices:

<ul>
	<li>buy a cheap "breakout" box and watch how the
		  LED's respond to your software activity.	

	<li>connect another system, even a DOS laptop and
		  run <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/">C-Kermit</a> 
		or <a href="http://delta.com/">Telix</a> or 
		whatever you like in "host mode" and try to access that 
		port from the other direction.

	<li>connect a normal external modem to the box and 
		  see if you can connect and so simple AT commands
		  to it.

</ul>
	In any of these cases you can play with a wide variety of 
	'<tt>setserial</tt>' and '<tt>stty</tt>' commands to try and get 
	the serial port to respond and/or behave properly.  Before you spend 
	too long with those, however, I have to say that the times
	when I've resorted to them as part of my troubleshooting 
	have consistently been fixed by untangling an IRQ conflict
	or replacing a bad serial port (usually a whole multi-function
	controller, actually).

<br><br>
	I personally have given up on the cheap $15 IDE/floppy/serial
	cards and I pay a bit extra for the 
	<a href="http://www.quickpath.com/">QuickPath</a> "FlexPort"
	cards (which usually come in at close to $100 US).  Serial
	ports are hard enough to deal with without having flaky
	hardware underneath it.  (Luckily most of the modern 
	motherboard that have built-in serial ports have stopped
	putting in really cheap ones --- but it used to be that 
	they were often junk and sometimes could not be disabled
	--- even if they had jumpers that purported to do so).

<br><br>
	Anyway, good luck.

<br><br>
	Personally I usually configure a "dumb terminal" port
	for all of my Linux boxes (eventually).  This serves two
	important purposes:  It is the most convenient way for me 
	to get files to and from my laptop (for which I don't have 
	a supported ethernet card).  More importantly it gives me
	an extra troubleshooting option if my system "seems" hung.
	I can just plug in the old null modem and give it a go.

<br><br>
	It can mean the difference between a clean shutdown and a
	game of "red-switch" roulette.

<br><br>
	(Although it hasn't happened for any of my systems in so 
	long I've almost given up on seeing it at all 
	<img src="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" alt=";)" 
	width="20" height="24" align="absmiddle"> --- but it 
	used to be possible for the Linux console driver be completely
	unresponsive, and even for the network subsystem to be dead 
	while the serial lines were still accessible.   However, if
	you don't configure the terminal line in advance you don't have
	the option when you want it).
