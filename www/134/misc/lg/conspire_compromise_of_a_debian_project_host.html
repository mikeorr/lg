Subject: [conspire] Compromise of a Debian Project host
</pre>
Early in the morning (European time) of last Wednesday, July 12, the
Debian Project figured out that one of its shared Internet hosts,
"gluck.debian.org", had been security compromised, and immediately took
it down to be studied, rebuilt from trusted program files, and back
within a day.  It look like, as with last time this sort of thing
happened, they detected the compromise pretty much immediately --
probably courtesy of monitoring from the intrusion detetion software
"AIDE".  As before, the package archives weren't penetrated.  ("gluck"
currently fills these roles via DNS aliases:  "cvs", "ddtp", "lintian",
"people", "popcon", "planet", "ports", and "release".  The machines
where packages are created and cryptographically signed are much more
heavily restricted.)
</p>

<p>
Their quick detection and correction are worth noting.  So is the avenue
of compromise (detailed below).  
</p>

<p>
Also worth noting is that, if you use your security token on a
compromised machine <em>anywhere</em>, it's equally prone to be stolen
regardless of whether it's a strong or weak password, or a public SSH
keypair, etc.  
</p>

<p>
Debian believes in transparency on security matters, which is why the
earlier (2003) compromise of "klecker", "gluck", "master", and "murphy"
was immediately and extensively analysed in public, on a set of pages
maintained by Wichert Akkerman:  <a href="http://www.wiggy.net/debian/explanation/">http://www.wiggy.net/debian/explanation/</a>
</p>

<p>
...which I then wrote about, here:  <a href="../../../issue98/moen.html">http://linuxgazette.net/issue98/moen.html</a>
I'm looking forward to a similar disclosure about the 2006 compromise.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, there's this Debian News article: <a href="http://www.debian.org/News/2006/20060713">http://www.debian.org/News/2006/20060713</a>
</p>

<p>
   At least one developer account has been compromised a while ago and
   has been used by an attacker to gain access to the Debian server. A
   recently discovered local root vulnerability in the Linux kernel has
   then been used to gain root access to the machine.
</p>

<p>
   At 02:43 UTC on July 12th suspicious mails were received and alarmed
   the Debian admins. The following investigation turned out that a
   developer account was compromised and that a local kernel
   vulnerability has been exploited to gain root access.
</p>

<p>
This reminds me a lot of the infamous circa-2001 compromise at
$LINUX_FIRM, where a developer's shell account at public shared server
shells.$DOMAIN was stolen because his SSH credentials were stolen from
him at yet <em>another</em> shared-resource machine (probably a college shell
server), the bad guy SSHed into shells.$DOMAIN masquerading as him and
rooted &amp; trojaned that host, and then that same bad guy stole an SSH
token exposed there by a careless $LINUX_FIRM sysadmin, and used it to
invade the corporate network and compromise everything there on account
of Swiss-cheese internal security on the corporate LAN, hanging out
there until out of boredom he logged onto the internal IRC server and
taunted the $LINUX_FIRM CTO.
</p>

<p>
The Debian Project didn't have that order of disaster, detected
<em>their</em> breach(es) much sooner and more competently, and did not have
the crown jewels (master software archives) exposed to risk from shared
developer boxes.  
</p>

<p>
Stealing a developer's SSH login credentials, in itself, just gets the
bad guys <em>in</em> (as a grunt user).  What they really want over the long
term is root-user authority.  Ergo, they must find some way to _escalate
privilege_.  In this (last Tuesday's) case, it was a <em>very</em> recently
discovered 2.6 kernel bug:
</p>

<p>
  The kernel vulnerability that has been used for this compromise is
  referenced as CVE-2006-2451. It only exists in the Linux kernel 2.6.13
  up to versions before 2.6.17.4, and 2.6.16 before 2.6.16.24. The bug
  allows a local user to gain root privileges via the PR_SET_DUMPABLE
  argument of the prctl function and a program that causes a core dump
  file to be created in a directory for which the user does not have
  permissions.
</p>

<p>
  The current stable release, Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 alias 'sarge',
  contains Linux 2.6.8 and is thus not affected by this problem. The
  compromised server ran Linux 2.6.16.18.
</p>

<p>
  If you run Linux 2.6.13 up to versions before 2.6.17.4, or Linux
  2.6.16 up to versions before 2.6.16.24, please update your kernel
  immediately.
</p>

<p>
Note that the 2.4.x kernels are not affected.  (2.6 kernels have been a
bit harder to keep security-fixed, for reasons that would take a while
to explain.)
</p>

<p>
I'll keep an eye out for a write-up similar to Akkerman's 2003 pages.

<p>
One of the reasons I look forward to the write-up is to see the
rationale for what they're doing to improve security prospectively, and
why.  Quoting
<a href="http://news.com.com/Debian+locks+out+developers+after+server+hack/2100-7349_3-6094335.html">http://news.com.com/Debian+locks+out+developers+after+server+hack/2100-7349_3-6094335.html</a> :  
</p>

<p>
  "At least one developer account has been compromised a while ago and
  has been used by an attacker to gain access to the Debian server,"
  Schulze wrote.
</p>

<p>
  The developer said the attacker then used a recently discovered
  vulnerability in the Linux kernel to gain root--or admin--access on
  the server.
</p>

<p>
  "An investigation of developer passwords revealed a number of weak
  passwords whose accounts have been locked in response," Schulze wrote. 
</p>

<p>
Encouraging shell users on shared machine to use strong passwords is 
perhaps worthwhile, but failures to do so on "gluck.debian.org" might
well have been fundamentally irrelevant -- depending on how and where 
the developer account got compromised.
</p>

<p>
Let me give an example:  Let's say I let about a dozen of my friends and
acquaintances have shell accounts on my Linux box.  Let's say I'm being
something of a security fascist, and configure my local password
management to require eight-character passwords of mixed lettercase
including at least one digit and one special character, with dictionary
words disallowed, mandatory password changes every two months, and an
enforced prohibition against re-using any of the prior 20 expired
passwords.
</p>

<p>
Friend George, like basically all the rest of us, can't remember very
many passwords accurately, and so he tends to use the same passwords for
his accounts on multiple systems.  One day, one of those <em>other</em> systems
has a security breach.  The bad guys manage to steal George's password
on that system.  They see from his .bash_history file that he SSHes to 
linuxmafia.com, and on speculation try SSHing into my machine using the
same username/password George uses elsewhere.  Because of George's
memory-assisting shortcut, it works.  
</p>

<p>
Or:
</p>

<p>
Trying to be even <em>more</em> of a security fascist, I disallow incoming
password authentication entirely, permitting use only of prearranged
SSH public keypairs.  George uses such a keypair, and uses it to SSH 
in from a remote host -- which for entirely local reasons becomes
root-compromised by the bad guys.  The bad guys use their surreptitious
root access to install a "trojaned" SSH client, rigged to capture
outbound sessions' security credentials and secretly convey those to the
intruders.  George in all innocence SSHes into linuxmafia.com, and his
private key and passphrase get captured.  The next day, the bad guys are
able to enter linuxmafia.com, masquerading as George -- and then seek
there a path to root escalation, as they did on "gluck".
</p>

<p>
My point is that these paths to compromise would work against my machine
_even though_ I was doing everything right.  From what we know of last
Tuesday's Debian compromise, such might well have been the case there,
too -- which would make Martin Schulze's better-passwords effort (quote
above) almost completely irrelevant to the problem.
</p>

<p>
My Internet systems live with essentially the same risk that "gluck"
faces, and my planning must include the possibility of compromise
through theft elsewhere of user-access credentials, even if I implement
my own security policy flawlessly.  Short of adding a second category
of authentication (e.g., SecureID tokens or biometrics), it's not a
problem with a ready solution.
</p>


<p>
Oddly enough, Jon Corbet at Linux Weekly News is probably feeling like
Cassandra right now:  On July 12, 2006 -- the very same day that "gluck"
was compromised -- he castigated, echoing correspondent Paul Starzetz
(<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/191089/">http://lwn.net/Articles/191089/</a>), two authors (for "rpath" and Ubuntu)
who'd described a 2.6 kernel bug as (merely) a "denial of service attack"
bug, when very obviously it was a likely path to local root escalation:
"Denial of reality vulnerabilities" (<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/191080/">http://lwn.net/Articles/191080/</a> -- 
readable by non-LWN-subscribers starting Thursday, July 20).  And that
<em>was</em> the exact kernel bug used to crack root on "gluck".
</p>

<p>
I'll not quote extensively from Jon's editorial for the obvious reason
that it's a subscription-supported magazine (and deserves all of our
support), but I <em>will</em> quote one very important sentence:
</p>

<p>
   Lest it seem that rPath and Ubuntu are receiving too much grief: as
   of this writing, five days after disclosure, rPath, Ubuntu, and Red Hat
   are the only distributors to have fixed this problem.
</p>

<p>
If you're running a 2.6-kernel-based system with remote shell access,
especially from multiple users, you should take careful note.
</p>

<p>
(Feedback to the LWN editorial reveals that Fedora Core 4 and 5 had
2.6.17.4 kernel updates in the testing area on July 12, Gentoo had
updates to 2.6.16.24 and 2.6.17.4 on July 6 and 7, and Debian "stable" 
aka sarge's default 2.6 kernel, 2.6.8, didn't include the vulnerable code.
Other 2.6 distros may remain unfixed, and are of significant concern.)

If it's the latter - is there a solution other than carrying your own

highly problematic avenues if you're borrowing someone else's machine
for a quick round of email.

&gt; the meaning of "security token", above - are you talking about just
&gt; typing a password, using two-factor auth, or perhaps both?
</pre>

<p>
Genuine two-factor authentication <em>is</em> a proper fix for the problem,
because it means you no longer have to trust both ends of the
connection.  Ordinarily, one of the designed-in limitations of the SSH
model is that its security is only as good as that of both endpoints;
with an RSA Security SecureID fob (or equivalent), a fingerprint reader,
or the use of one-time keys, you can instead be SSHing in from an
untrusted host, e.g., PuTTY on J. Random User's virus-infested Windows
box or a cybercafe terminal.
</p>

<p>
My point, however, was that people have a tendency to assume they're
fixing the authentication problem merely by using better single-factor
authentication -- stronger passwords, public-key crypto keypairs,
whatever -- but that such is false assurance, because any such token can
be stolen while you're using it on an (untrustworthy) compromised
originating host.  The quotation from the Debian guy suggests they
<em>might</em> be going down that mistaken path -- though it's difficult to tell.
</p>

<p>
Technically speaking, the generated crypto steam from a SecureID fob can
be stolen when used, too, as can the one-time key you generate to use
with the OPIE or S/Key one-time extensions to OpenSSH -- but not
usefully, because they're only valid once and hence useless to the
eavesdropping bad guys.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; If it's the latter - is there a solution other than carrying your own
&gt; laptop wherever you go?
</pre>

<p>
Carrying your own laptop is ideal in the sense that (unless someone
gimmicks it when you're not looking) it's entirely under your control.  
The next best thing is... debatable.  The easiest solution would be,
indeed, to carry a Knoppix or similar disk around -- with the obvious
hole in that model being at the hardware level, e.g., the cybercafe
machine you're using having a keylogger dongle that you didn't notice.
</p>

<p>
A bit more trouble, but a slightly more foolproof remedy, would be to
run a second SSHd on a non-standard port, configured via PAM to accept
only one-time keys.  You could then use compromised cybercafe machines,
etc., without exposing tokens reusable by the bad guys for the simple
reason that you're using one-time tokens.  All your data <em>on</em> the 
compromised machine could get stolen, right down to the last keystroke,
but not your remote access.
</p>

<p>
This would also be, as you say, less of an imposition on people whose
machines you're using.  On the minus side, managing one-time keys is a
genuine pain in the neck.  You end up either using PalmOS apps such as
PilOTP / PalmKey[1], or carrying around a sheet of one-time keys in very
small type -- and having to generate new sets of keys frequently.

  Jon Corbet, are you feeling like Cassandra, yet?  I note, in last
  Wednesday's LWN, the editorial "Denial of reality vulnerabilities"
  (<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/191080/">http://lwn.net/Articles/191080/</a>), tsk-tsking a couple of security
  advisories' mischaracterisations of CVE-2006-2451 in 2.6 kernels from
  2.6.13 up until just before 2.6.16.24 and 2.6.17.4 as merely a "DoS
  vulnerability", when the bug created an obvious path to local root
  escalation.
 
  ...which was in fact exploited on gluck.debian.org (aka cvs, ddtp,
  lintian, people, popcon, planet, ports, and release), the very same day:

The Knoppix solution needs to be augmented with some mechanism to
carry (a) your private key and (b) the public key of the host(s) that

Otherwise, you end up using passwords with untrusted hosts.

Thanks; you had me a bit worried (mostly, about having to invest lots of
time researching some kind of a solution.) I spend a fair amount of time
on the road, and not having secure SSH access would be a Really Bad
Thing.
</p>

<p>
The fact is that 99%+ of the time, I'm either using my own laptop or
banging on a keyboard from a machine inside a Sun center; these places
are usually firewalled, the machines are kept reasonably well patched,
and they get completely flushed and rebuilt once a week. Nevertheless,
the more secure the communication system I use, the happier I am.

[nod] At this point, even cracking 8-char passwords is getting to be a
reasonably accessible task on commodity hardware. Single-factor auth
is getting progressively less useful as time goes on.

That was my (admittedly slightly rusty) take on it as well. I thought
you were saying that this had somehow become more vulnerable, and was
confused. Thanks for the explanation.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; A bit more trouble, but a slightly more foolproof remedy, would be to
&gt; run a second SSHd on a non-standard port, configured via PAM to accept
&gt; only one-time keys.  You could then use compromised cybercafe machines,
&gt; etc., without exposing tokens reusable by the bad guys for the simple
&gt; reason that you're using one-time tokens.  All your data <em>on</em> the 
&gt; compromised machine could get stolen, right down to the last keystroke,
&gt; but not your remote access.
</pre>

<p>
This is a scenario that would suit me to a tee, actually. Pretty much
the only reason I would be logging in from untrust(ed|worthy) hardware
is 1) while travelling <em>and</em> 2) somehow separated from my laptop, <em>and</em>
3) if there was some relatively urgent reason to check my email at that
specific time. Well, to be absolutely honest, "relatively urgent" is not
an absolute: #3 could mean "I haven't looked at my mail in a couple of
days". Anyway, I would have no concern for any data on the machine I'm
using, other than as some variety of a guest's responsibility.

&gt; [nod] At this point, even cracking 8-char passwords is getting to be a
&gt; reasonably accessible task on commodity hardware. Single-factor auth
&gt; is getting progressively less useful as time goes on.
</pre>

<p>
Occasionally, I devote a few cycles to worrying whether brute-forcing
7-8 character SSH passwords is a realistic concern -- and then dismiss
it as nothing of the kind by orders of magnitude.  For one thing, I
think I'd notice my logfiles suddenly overflowing /var like the old
Zuider Zee[1] coming south to visit Amsterdam in a bad mood.  
</p>

<p>
The point of my earlier post (just to make sure I was clear; not saying
you didn't get it) is that the bad guys don't <em>need</em> to break passwords;
they just steal tokens when you use them on compromised systems,
instead.

I'm not sure about that, Rick. If you use [a-zA-Z0-9], which is what
most people do, you're only looking at about 3.5 x 10^12 possibilities
for a 7-char password - and ~200 x 10^12 for an 8-char. These days,
claims of 15 million passwords per second (on a 1GHz CPU) are fairly
common on the Net (e.g., '<a href="http://www.forensics-intl.com/breakers.html">http://www.forensics-intl.com/breakers.html</a>');
that gives us, what, about three days for the first one, and less than 6
months for the second one? That's worst-case scenarios, of course.
Crackers can be pretty patient - and they don't have to do anything
except start the process and wait for the results to pop out.
</p>

<p>
If we move to "all printable characters" as a field, it gets somewhat
better - ~6 x 10^15 for 8 chars - but CPUs are constantly getting
faster. And, if I decide to get just a little paranoid (as a proper
sysadmin should), dedicated hardware isn't all that expensive - at least
for government agencies with $$$BUDGETS$$$. "Well under $1B" is a figure
I heard being loosely connected with No Such Agency, and that was about
five years ago.
</p>

<p>
I agree that it's not a huge problem yet... but when I was teaching
security classes, I managed to crack more than half my student's
passwords by the end of the week. It wasn't a normally-programmed part
of the class, but it made a <em>damn</em> effective demo.

Well, since I don't have a 24x7 connected machine of my own that I can
use as a server, playing with this would be purely for my own education
(and thus, a relatively low-priority task; I can think of many different
bits of learning that I want to pick up that come ahead of it.) I may
get a wild hair someday, though. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

I've sorta wondered about that. Why is it that Italy itself hasn't sunk
a few miles and tilted up all of Europe and Asia accordingly? Is it
because there's so much gold in Chukotka [1] acting as a counterweight?

<p>
[1] Easternmost region in Russia. All that Alaskan gold and oil? Hah.
It was just a tiny crumb of the humongous pie. Although the people that
opposed Seward <em>were</em> idiots.

To stdout or a local filesystem, yes.  But fed one at a time to a remote
sshd on a busy PIII on a DSL line?  And you'll note what I said about
my /var falling over, from several million sshd connections in a week or
so, being more than a tad suspicious.

Theoretical lab attacks are interesting, but not to be confused with

<p>
The main reason <em>Venice</em> hasn't circled the drain and disappeared is
that they realised that tapping the local aquifer for industry was a
really bad idea, and stopped doing that.  Venice now has stopped sinking
quite so quickly -- but is still at the mercy of any severe winter storm
surge combining with high tide.  Which is an absurd situation to
persist, since they know how to fix it.
