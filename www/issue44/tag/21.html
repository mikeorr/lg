SCSI Resets Due to Command Timeouts

<P><STRONG>
Hi,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I was hoping you could help. I have a Gateway P6-200 With an
Adaptec 2940 SCSI card. The trouble is upon boot I receive timeout
errors from the controller. I installed an IDE drive on a second
system pulled the SCSI cable off the disks (ST32155W little SCSI
cable,effectively disabling the drives) and was able to install on
an IDE drive from the SCSI CD (SCSI-2 I think old style cable).
</STRONG></P>

I think you should take a deep breath, drink some coffee
or tea, and re-read that.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I'm not sure quite what you meant but it sounded like you
were having problems with your SCSI chain while you had the
hard drive attached.  You installed an IDE hard drive,
disconnected the SCSI hard drive (leaving the SCSI CD-ROM
drive attached) and you were able to install Linux.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Is that about right?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
That would suggest that the cabling, termination or
drive are the source of the problem.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
However I would like to install on my system ( that 2nd system was
sort of hijacked once Linux was installed on it).  I've been in
the SCSI bios and turned down the speed settings from 20 to 8 ,
and turrned off syncronous and probably fiddled with all the
setttings at some time.  I've booted off the CD (RedHat 6.0) and
floppy (RedHat 5.2) to no avail.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
I'd suggest resetting them all back to the factory
default before trying any further experimentation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
This is a system supplied by my employer so I would prefer not
adding an IDE drive supplied by me (my home systems have RH4.2 and
RH6.0). Any help would be appreciated. Oh yeah the bios on the AHA
seems to auto assign the SCSI-IDs, do you think that could be the
trouble? (I haven't tried forcing the IDs set.)
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
It sounds like some "Plug n Pray" stuff.  I'd disable that
and manually assign the IDs yourself.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"

TIA for any help you can supply.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>

Hope you don't mind a syslog from the RH5.2 boot dump detailing
the errors (it is sort of long).

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Did your check on your termination?  It's attempting
to auto terminate --- but you can't be sure of
what that's doing.  Check that only the devices at
the ends of your SCSI chain are terminated.  If you
have not external devices then the SCSI host adapter
is at one end of the chain (and should be terminated).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Contrary to what you read in most places, I've seen and
heard that <EM>longer</EM> SCSI cables can be more reliable than
shorter ones (within limits, of course).  I assume that
this is NOT differential SCSI.  As such it can be
extremely sensitive to the quality of cable used to
connect these devices.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If the drive works fine when the CD-ROM is disconnected,
and the gives these errors again when you reconnect it
that suggests that both the CD drive and the hard drive
are terminated (or they they are trying to use the
same ID).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Make sure that the CD-ROM or the hard drive is not
terminated.  Try swapping them them (cables <EM>and</EM>
termination).

This line suggests that you're some how using two different
sorts of cables connected to the same controller.  Is this
really a 2940 PCI card?  Does it have headers (attachment

cables?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Don't discount the possibility that the hard drive is
just <EM>bad</EM>.  Try it in another SCSI machine.  Look up
these drive and adapter models at their respective

Since it's a system provided by your employer ---
it's not unreasonable to expect them to get the hardware

Hi again,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks for your advice.  It was indeed the "Plug &amp; Play Scam" causing the
problem. Once I disabled it the system wouldn't correctly scan the SCSI IDs
from within the BIOS (or boot NT (of course)). So I shutdown the system
configured on of the HDs to be SCSI ID 1 and powered back up.  I was able
to boot into NT then, I put the RH6.0 CD in and once it scanned the SCSI
busses I knew it was going to work.BTW "Plug &amp; Play Scam" is the actual
name within the Adaptec BIOS, I guess that should have tipped me off

Actually I think SCAM is supposed to be an acronym for
some sort of SCSI Configuration Automation Method (or
something like that).  However, it may be an unfortunately
apt term.

<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=";-)"

wouldn't be readable (sybase "load database" command) into a linux sybase
server ( I've got sybase 11.03 for linux and solaris)? (Hey it is a shot in

I'd ask the Sybase support team if there are any

It sounds, from these errors, like the load database
command doesn't recognize the  file you're providing
as one of it's dump images.  You're using a Sybase SQL
command to generate this greg9915.dump file, aren't you?

(I wouldn't expect anything involving the Solaris 'dump'

When trying to transfer data from one database to another

Hello again,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
WOW that was fast, you know what's funny I've been using Linux for about 6
years and never expected any "real" help especially this fast (I
originally used TAMU distribution because I was able to download it onto
1.2 Mb floppies w/o X11).  And other than a question I had about 1 1/2
years ago I never really got info by asking around (I would fumble around
till it worked or I gave up.) I don't think I ever got this response time
from my own company (I also used to be a field service rep fixing
mini-computer systems).  I can't thank you enough for the generosity or time.

I wish I could offer such high service levels to all

volunteer work.  That's why I was happy to see
companies like Linuxcare come in to provide the commercial

for them; but that's another story).

From what I understand from their download page there is no support for the
Linux port. So the answer to the 1st question is "good question", and
apparently we have problems doing a dump/load to other platforms (we
support Solaris, HP-UX and AIX), sorry I guess I should have asked around
here instead of wasting band-width and thinking it was "only" Linux that
couldn't read a .dump file

If you did an strace (Linux) or truss (Solaris) on the
process while it was running this command, or issued a
'file' command on the resulting dump file (try to look
up its &quot;magic number&quot; you might find out the underlying
file format being used.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It may be that your isql command is passing the data
into the system's copy of the 'dump' command. Those
are NOT platform independent.
