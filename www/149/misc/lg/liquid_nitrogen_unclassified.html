Hello Answer Guy 
</p>

<p>
I was wondering if it is possible to cool a small amount of  water for
drinking purpose  using a small cilinder of liquid fill nitrogen (by letting
the water around the cilinder) is this possible and how long will the water
remain cool?
</p>

<p>
Thanks

Woo-hoo! Rhubarb warning!

</p>

<p>
In classic TAG fashion, however, I'm going to try to answer your
question... for whatever that's worth. Probably not much, since my years
of using LN2 (radar-absorptive foam dipped in the stuff makes a dandy
black-body radar target) are long behind me - but what the heck.
</p>

<p>
Cooling water for drinking purposes by dipping the LN2 cylinder in it
suffers from a number of problems - and no benefits that I can think of.
Problems, right off the top:
</p>

<p>
1) Your temperature control options range from extremely crude
(immersing more or less of the cylinder in the water) to
disproportionately complex and expensive (finding a way to vary the
amount of insulation around the dewar containing the LN2.) 
</p>

<p>
2) Replenishing the stuff, unless you work for a supplier and are doing
it on the premises, or own an LN2 generator, is going to be A Very Large
Hassle.
</p>

<p>
3) Essentially, you're relying on the imperfections in the insulating
process - something that, by definition, is not controllable in a
reasonable fashion - for your heat sink. This is somewhat like trying to
evaporate gasoline by holding a match "just far enough away" from it;
not the most brilliant method ever invented.
</p>

<p>
4) Since you appear to be quite unfamiliar with the properties of this
stuff, I suggest that you run away from it very, very quickly. In fact,
emigrating to another country, changing your name, and getting some
plastic surgery would be safest. And even then, you should request
police protection. [1]
</p>

<p>
Those are pretty large problems. The thing that makes it all really
silly, though, is - why would you bother? There are plenty of good,
simple methods (e.g., a Peltier junction immediately comes to mind; a
small pump cycling, say, alcohol through an expansion valve - if you're
mechanically minded - is another possibility) available. This seems like
going the long, long way around the barn.
</p>



<p>
[1] It's not as bad as chlorine trifluoride - that shit sets sand and
<strong>asbestos</strong> on fire - but screwing around with LN2 while ignorant of its
properties is an excellent precursor to autoDarwination.

as long as it take for the nitrogen to evaporate and the water to thaw

My favorite by far is the (almost) instant ice cream. No fussing around

<p>
Back when I lived with a rocket scientist, LN2 ice cream became a
standard stunt at our house parties and spacegeek events. Compared to
making ice cream using more traditional methods, (aside from the
techical expertise to safely handle LN2), making LN2 ice cream is dead
simple. No worrying about whether there's too much alcohol in the
mixture to freeze, for instance. 
</p>

<p>
I got really creative with flavors as a result. Bananas Foster frozen
yogurt, lemon blueberry, a Persian spice blend usually used for savories
(baharat, also known as advieh). . .

Hm.... is that "ready made" stuff then frozen or did you get fruit ice
nice and creamy? I tried a few old recipes from a grandmothers cook
book which has ice cream version -- but most are based on egg, cream,
vanilla, chocolate,..
</p>

<p>
When I tried to improvise something more "fruity" less/no cream it did
not stay creamy, even shock frosted like this. Developed not that
little ice crystals.... Any trick to avoid that? cream after all?
alcohol? Or do I have to get close to somebody from the Italian Mafia
for real good ice recipes?

<p>
There are two basic "ice cream" recipe styles. A milk and cream (usually
uncooked) base, and one that requires a cooked custard. (There are other
frozen desserts with different starting points, but I'm not going to get
into that here.)
</p>

<p>
I made my ice creams "from scratch", except where I used pre-made
yogurt. As I recall, the lemon blueberry was actually a frozen yogurt
made with lemon-flavored yogurt.

<p>
Recipes involving just fruit, without any milkfat, require something
like eggwhites to provide creaminess and stability. I've never tried
making a LN2 sorbet.
</p>

<p>
I found that the microcrystallization from the quick freezing meant that
standard ice cream recipes tasted oily, and so my basic starting point
was usually equal amounts of half-and-half[1] with heavy cream[2]. Wikipedia
notes:
</p>

<p>
"Making ice cream with liquid nitrogen has advantages over conventional
freezing. Due to the rapid freezing, the crystal grains are smaller,
giving the ice cream a creamier texture, and allowing one to get the
same texture by using less milkfat. However, such ice crystals will grow
very quickly via the processes of recrystallization thus obviating the
original benefits unless steps are taken to inhibit ice crystal growth."
</p>

<p>
This is my experience as well. LN2 ice cream is best shortly after it's
made.
</p>

<p>
The best strawberry ice cream I ever made was by simply macerating[4]
good sliced strawberries in some sugar, and then mixing the resulting
fruit slurry into my basic LN2 ice cream base. I expect that other fruit
would work as well. You really do need to add enough sugar or the fruit
will end up like rocks. It's also best to slice the fruit rather small.
</p>


<p>
[1] 12.5% butterfat cream, known as "half cream" in the U.K.
</p>

<p>
[2] 36% butterfat cream. This is very difficult to find in the U.S.
without carrageenan added in. I dislike that version, as it makes LN2
ice cream have a slimy mouthfeel.[5]

<p>
I actually did enjoy it - once. Usually, it just doesn't taste like much
of anything at all (I don't actually find the stuff terrifying or
repulsive... except, as Kat notes, for dramatic effect - at which point,
I reel about with an expression of imminent demise and a hand to my
fainting brow.) Besides, we were already married at the time. I'm pretty
sure that we weren't when I first tasted it, at which point my opinion
was "Meh. This is what all the fuss is about?" I also happen to think
that the reported smell is mostly imaginary... although looking at the
stuff can certainly put you in mind of some very smelly substances.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
Like many other Japanese foods, the stuff has to be literally perfect -
top grade, made in the last 3.2 seconds of a blue moon (underwater, by
40-year-old virgins, etc.) to be really good. At that point, however,
they're usually really good. Even natto can be described as "OK". <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Dear Sam
</p>

<p>
 Avogadros law states nPV = T, which states the relationship between
pressure, volume and temperature for gasses (where [n] is one mole or
approximately 6.22*10^23 gas molecules).

 Liquid nitrogen is not cold when contained in a pressurised container,
but only cools through evaporation.  An analogy to this would be liquid
butane in a butane lighter.  At minus 196 degrees celcius (or 88 Kelvin)
and at atmospheric pressure however, liquid nitrogen is constantly
boiling, turning from a liquid into a gas.  Your small flask of water
would be cooled to this temperature while the liquid nitrogen lasts, if
the liquid nitrogen were to be allowed to remain at atmospheric
pressure.
</p>

<p>
 It would theoretically be possible to constrain the amount of
evaporation of the liquid nitrogen through use of a pressure valve
coupled to a thermostat, thus keeping the water (and liquid nitrogen)
just above the freezing temperature for water whilst ensuring optimum
efficiency for usage of your nitrogen.  Under these circumstances, and
depending on the amount of heat allowed into the container, your
nitrogen might last quite a long time.
</p>

<p>
... and yes, you might equally use such a system to cool beer ...
</p>

<p>
 Having said that, the above is completely off topic.

 This mailing group is associated with the Linux Gazette, and is meant
to answer questions related to the use of this most amazing operating
system.  If you wish to know anything at all about Linux, feel free to
ask.  However, I doubt you will have much more luck here for answers to
questions about basic chemistry and physics.

The less-than-perfect sealing of the standard industrial dewar, however,
always results in a tiny amount of evaporation - which, of course, leads
to a nice bit of condensation or even a tiny bit of frost on the outside
of it, even in the hottest summer.
