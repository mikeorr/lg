Hi,
You recently stated:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>

</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000066"><EM>
You can set up inetd.conf to call simple chroot call to a
jail before launching ftpd -- which will automatically use
the <TT>/etc/passwd</TT> that's relative to the chroot directory.  The
You can even use shadow passwords in the chroot.
</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000066"><EM>
It does take a bit of tweaking -- but it can be done.
</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000066"><EM>

</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Could you point me to a FAQ or HowTo for this?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I'm upgrading a 4.2 based firewall system to 5.1, and already tried
the obvious tricks of copying the <TT>/lib/security</TT> and 
<TT>/etc/pam.d</TT> directories to the playground/jail directory.
</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>
Thanks,

I don't know of an FAQ or HOWTO on this.  I haven't
had time to write one myself.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
One trick is to use the '<tt>ldd</tt>' command extensively to identify
shared libraries that must be copied into the 'chroot()'
jail.  Another is to use '<tt>strace</tt>' to capture system call
traces of each program (particularly those that fail
to run properly in the jail) and compare the calls to
'<tt>open()</tt>' between the version run in the jail and the one
that works normally within your normal environment.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The brute force method is to simply install a whole
distribution unto another filesystem.  Mount that as
the jail and trim out everything you don't need.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It should be noted that '<tt>chroot()</tt>' jails are not "root safe"
under normal implementations of Unix and Linux.  If an
attacker does successfully gain '<tt>root</tt>' privileges with the
jail it is a simple matter to "break out."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
'<tt>securelevel</tt>' is a set of features in BSD (Free|Net|Open and
BSDI/OS) to minimize the <EM>persistence</EM> of such compromise.
These try to prevent root from exercising various privileges
while the system is in "server" or "production" or "secure" mode.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There were some patches for '<tt>securelevel</tt>' that were under
development for Linux.  However, Linus rejected them and has
accepted an alternative that may offer more flexibility,
finer grained control and still allow for relatively easy
"securelevel emulation."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
These features (what POSIX.1e refers to as "capabilities
lists" but which are better described as "VMS like
privileges") are built in the 2.1.x kernels and will almost
certainly be part of 2.2.   In addition to the possibility
that these will allow us to "emulate 'securelevel'" these
may also prevent many forms of process subversion that
lead to '<tt>root</tt>' compromise.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Normal '<tt>securelevel</tt>' does <EM>nothing</EM> to prevent 
the attacker from gaining root.  It doesn't very little to limit 
what the attacker can do with that privilege during the session in
which it is obtained.  In other words the successful
attacker still has control of the system.  '<tt>securelevel</tt>'
primarily prevents persistent changes to the filesystems (no
changing immutable flags to mutable and "append-only" files
to random access read/write, no remounting read-only
filesystems in read/write mode, etc).  Some other
securelevel features prevent loading of kernel modules and
access to <TT>/dev/kmem</TT> (<tt>/proc/kmem</tt> for Linux users).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This doesn't address the mechanism by which the attacker
gained '<tt>root</tt>' and only places relatively minor limitations
on what '<tt>root</tt>' can do to the state of the system.  Those
limitations mostly prevent sniffing on other processes,
hiding the attacker tracks, and leaving '<tt>rootkits</tt>' laying
around.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
With the "privs" features the Linux kernel add more
fine-grained delegation and limitation semantics.  One
can provide a process (and its descendents) with the
ability to open a "privileged" TCP port (below the
conventional Unix 1024 watermark) and/or with just read-only
access to <EM>all</EM> files, without allowing that process to
write to, change the ownership or permissions/mode or
filesystem dependent attributes/flags on them, etc).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Basically these "privileges" split the implications of
"SUID root" into separately maskable and delegateable items.
Instead of one "god flag" we have a whole pantheon of them,
each with its own sphere of influence.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The kernel support for this is just the tip of the iceberg.
Consequently we probably won't see effective use of this
for several month after Linux ships and it will be much
longer until we have "full" support for this security model.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Currently the only way to use these features with 2.1
kernels would be to write wrapper programs that set/mask the
privilege sets (there are "allowed, effective, and
inheritable" sets; the "inheritable" set is a mask which
strips these privs from children).  These wrapper/launchers
could then start processes with small lists of required
privileges and some (small?) assurance that these processes
couldn't perform some forms of mischief directly.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To emulate '<tt>securelevel</tt>' you'd write wrappers that started
'<tt>init</tt>' and/or '<tt>inetd</tt>' and various daemons like 
'<tt>sendmail</tt>' and your web server with a set of privileges masked off.
These processes and their children would be unable to
exercise certain sorts of system calls (possibly including the
equivalent of '<tt>chroot(..)</tt>' to chdir/chroot <EM>out of</EM> a jail)
and file operations.  They would not be able to inherit
these privileges even from an SUID '<tt>root</tt>' program --- such
programs would only be able to exercise the subset of
privileges that were inherited and allowed. (*)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><ul>
<li>(The attack vector would then have to be
via subversion of some running process that
retained its privileges i.e. via some form of
interprocess communication rather than by direct
execution.  If '<tt>init</tt>' was stripped of its
"<tt>chatter +i</tt>" priv then <EM>no</EM> process on the system
could make immutable files mutable.  Naturally
you'd construct the wrapper or patches to '<tt>init</tt>'
such that these features would be enabled at
specific runlevels or disabled with certain
boot-time parameters).
</ul></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Later it will be possible to store these privilege sets
as attributes of executable files.   Thus the '<tt>rsh</tt>' and
'<tt>rlogin</tt>' commands would have their "bind to privileged
IP port" bit set, and all others would be unset.  (Note
we're not <EM>masking off</EM> the other privs, we're merely
not <EM>granting</EM> them).  Thus the reason why these two
command are "SUID 'root'" is accounted for, without
giving these programs a host of other system privileges
that are not <EM>required</EM> for their proper operation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The filesystem support for these features will presumably
be added in the 2.3 kernel series.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It looks like Linux 2.3 will mostly be about filesystems,
"large" file support, ACL's, logging/journaling, b-tree
directory structuring, and other features of that sort.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's not clear whether these will be rolled into ext2 or
whether they will be incorporated into a new ext3.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If this whole "privs" security model seems complex and
difficult to administer and audit, then you're reading me
loud and clear.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Determining the precise set of requisite flags for each
program and process will be a monumental pain.  It is
unclear how effective these efforts will eventually be.  VMS
has had these sorts of features since its inception, and
they are similar to features in MLS/CMW (multi-level
security for compartmented mode workstations) versions of
Unix (usually billed/sold as the B2 Security Package,
Option, or Version --- and generally only used by the
U.S. military or similar organizations).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Personally I would like to see a "true capabilities"
subsystem implemented.  This is a completely different
security model that is so much unlike Unix, NT, and
other identity/ACL based systems that you may have to
spend a year or two <EM>unlearning</EM> what you know about
operating systems design before you "get it."  (It took
me about two --- but I'm unusually stubborn).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've talked about this security model in this column
before. Do a keyword search on EROS (extremely reliable
OS) and/or KeyKOS to find some links about it. Ironically
I've never used a system that incorporated "capabilities."
However, I've grudgingly come to the conclusion that they
represent a better security model than the ones we use
in all major software today.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The catch is that programs would have to be significantly
retooled to work under such a system.  There's also been
almost no interest in this from the programmers that I've
talked to.  (That would suggest that I'm just a ranting
crackpot --- since I'm not a programmer myself).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In any event, hopefully these "privileges" will make
your system somewhat more secure and make a <tt>chroot()</tt>
jail more than just a cardboard box.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If security is not your primary concern -- if all you want
is to provide virtual FTP hosting, just look at <tt>ncftpd</tt>
and or ProFTPD.
