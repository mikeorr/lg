	What a month.  Actually, two months.  Last month I was busily working
	on putting together an entry for the IRTC using BMRT.  At the same time
	I was trying to teach myself enough about the RenderMan Interface
	Specification to put together the second of three articles on BMRT.  
	I didn't succeed in the latter and ended up postponing the article 
	by one month.  Because I did this 
	I was able to focus more on learning the interface and worry less 
	about writing.  I think this strategy worked.  The scene I rendered for this 
	month's IRTC is the best I've ever done and I managed to gain enough
	experience to write a meaningful article on the RenderMan Shading Langauge.

	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	One of the reasons I enjoy doing this column is because it exposes me to
	all sorts of people and software.  The world of computer graphics for
	Linux is constantly growing and the software constantly improves.  I
	hear about new products just about once or twice a week now and I hear
	about updates to existing packages all the time.  It's very difficult to
	keep track of all the changes (and the fact that I haven't made any updates
	to the Linux Graphics mini-Howto in some time reflects this), but I enjoy
	the work.

	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	Since things change so often I have found it's never clear how many 
	announcements I'll have for any one month.  It's gone from famine to 
	feast - with this month being the feast.  Most of the announcements in
	this month's column are from April alone.  I don't know what happened -
	maybe all the bad weather around the globe kept people inside and busily
	working and now that the sun's out they're starting to let loose what
	they've done.  I only wish I had the time to examine everything, to play
	with them all.  But my employer would rather I finish my current project
	first.  Has something to do with keeping my salary, so they say.

	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	In this month's column, I'll be covering only two related items.  The
	first is a case study on learning to use BMRT.  When you submit an image in
	the IRTC, you are required to submit an ASCII text file describing your
	image and, to some extent, how you created it.  Some people don't put much
	work into this.  I just about wrote a book.  Since the information I
	provided covered more than just BMRT, I thought it would be relavent to this
	column.  

	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	The second item is the long-awaited (well, I waited a long time to
	finish it anyway) 2nd article on BMRT that covers the RenderMan Shading
	Language.  I think this article came out quite good.  I've included quite a
	few samples and some general explanations on what they do.   I want to
	say right up front that I couldn't have done this without lots of help from
	BMRT's author, Larry Gritz at Pixar.  He was a very willing teacher and
	critic who offered many tips and ideas for my IRTC entry.  Most of that
	also ended up in this article.  Many thanks, Larry.

	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	I know I said I'd do an HF-Lab article this month too, but that IRTC
	entry took more time than I expected.  It was quite addicting, trying
	to get things just right.  I have started to review HF-Lab once again
	and will make it my first priority for next month's column.  I've already
	figured out how to use the output from HF-Lab to produce height fields with
	BMRT.  It's quite simple really.  Anyway, I hope you enjoy this month's
	articles.

	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	Note:  I've been asked by a couple of readers about support for 3D
	hardware support in the various X servers.  I'm going to contact the
	X Server vendors (Xi Graphics, MetroLink, The XFree Project) 
	as well as Brian Paul (the MesaGL author)
	and see what they have to say.  If you are connected with these folks
	and have some insight, I'd love to hear what you have to say.  Please
	<A HREF="mailto:mjhammel@csn.net">email me</A> if you know if such
	support is forthcoming and I'll include it in an upcoming Graphics
	Muse column.

		I found this in my /tmp directory while getting ready for this month's

		Pixcon & Anitroll is a freely available 3D
		rendering and animation package, complete with source.
		Pixcon is a 3D renderer that creates high quality images by using a
		combination of 11 rendering primitives.  Anitroll is a forward kinematic
		heirarchical based animation system that has some support for some
		non-kinematic based animation (such as flock of birds, and autonomous
		cameras).  These tools are based upon the Graph library which is full
		of those neat rendering and animation algorithms that those 3D faqs
		keep mentioning.  It also implements
		some rendering techniques that were presented at Siggraph 96 by Ken 
		Musgrave and was used to generate an animation for Siggraph '95.
		
		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		New features since version 1.03:

		WebMagick Image Web Generator
		</H4> 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
		WebMagick is a package which supports making image collections available
		on the Web. It recurses through directory trees, building HTML pages,
		imagemap files, and client-side/server-side maps to allow the user to
		navigate through collections of thumbnail images (somewhat similar to
		xv's Visual Schnauzer) and select the image to view with a mouse click.
		
		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
		WebMagick is based on the "PerlMagick" ImageMagick PERL extension rather
		than external ImageMagick utilities (as its predecessor "Gifmap" is). This
		alone is good for at least a 40% performance increase on small images.
		WebMagick supports smart caching of thumbnails to speed montage generation
		on average size images. After a first pass at "normal" speed, successive
		passes (upon adding or deleting images) are 5X to 10X faster due to the
		caching.
		 
		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
		WebMagick supports a very important new feature in its caching subsystem:
		it can create and share a thumbnail cache with John Bradley's 'xv' program.
		This means that if you tell 'xv' to do an update, WebMagick montages will
		benefit and you can run WebMagick as a batch job to update xv's thumbnails
		without having to wait for 'xv' to do its thumbnail reduction (and get a
		browsable web besides!).
		
		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
		WebMagick requires the ImageMagick (3.8.4 or later) and PerlMagick (1.0 or
		later) packages as well as a recent version of PERL 5.

				as points in a definable 3-D space to create a height field roughly
				equal to real topography.
		</I>
		<P>A: The easiest way is probably to write a PGM file.
			I wouldn't use longitude and latidude because the length of one degree

		<A NAME="rib-csg"></A>
		<I>Q: I've been fiddling with some simple CSG using BMRT and have run
			into a problem.  I'm trying to cut a square out of a plane that
			was created from a simple bilinear patch.  Whatever I use to define the
			square (a box actually) comes out white instead of the background color
			(black in this case).  I dont know what I'm doing wrong and was
			wondering if someone might take a peek at this for me.
		</I>
		<P>A: 
			There are several problems with your RIB file, as well as your use
			of CSG.  The two biggies are:

			<P>You just can't do this:

			<PRE>
            ObjectBegin 2
               SolidBegin "primitive"
               TransformBegin
                  Translate -1 0 0
                  Rotate -90 0 1 0
                  Patch "bilinear" "P" 
                     [ -1 -1 0   1 -1 0 
                       -1  1 0   1  1 0  ]
               TransformEnd
               ... etc.
            ObjectEnd
			</PRE>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
		Transformations just aren't allowed inside object definitions.
		Remember that object instances inherit the entire graphics state
		that's active when they are instanced -- including transformations.
		So all primitives within the instanced object get the very same
		transformation.  If they're all bilinears like you have them, that
		means that they will all end up on top of one another.

		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
		For this reason and others, I urge everybody to <I>not use instanced
		objects at all</I> for any RenderMan compliant renderer.  They're quite
		useless as described in the RenderMan 3.1 spec.
		Yes, I know that <B>RenderMan Companion</B> has an example that does
		exactly what I said is illegal.  The example is wrong, and will not
		work with either PRMan or BMRT.

		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
		Solid (CSG) operations are meant only to operate on <I>solids</I>.
		A solid is a boundary representation which divides space into three
		distinct loci: (a) the boundary itself, which has finite surface area,
		(b) a (possibly disconnected) region of finite volume (the "inside"),
		and (c) a connected region of infinite volume (the "outside").
		You can't subtract a box from a bilinear patch, since a bilinear patch
		isn't a solid to begin with.

		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
		If you want a flat surface with a square hole, there are two methods
		that I'd recommend:  (a) simply use several bilinears (4 to be exact)
		for the surface, like this:

		This past 2 months I've been hard at work on an entry for this
		round of the IRTC, the Internet Ray Tracing Competition.  In 
		previous rounds I had submitted entries using POV-Ray, but for
		this round I switched to BMRT, mostly so I could learn the RenderMan
		API and how to write shaders using the RenderMan shading language.
		This month's main article is the second of a three part series on 
		BMRT.  The BMRT package is written by Larry Gritz, and Larry was
		gracious enough to offer some wonderful critiques and tips on 
		my image.  
		
		<BR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		During out email correspondence, Larry noticed I had overlit my
		scenes quite badly.  While we tried to figure out what was causing
		this (it turned out to be a misuse of some parameters to some 
		spotlights I was using) he asked if I had gamma corrected for my
		display.  Gamma correction is a big issue in computer graphics, one
		that is often overlooked by novices.  I'd heard and read quite a 
		bit about gamma correction but had never really attempted to determine
		how to adjust the gamma for my display.  Larry offered an explanation,
		a quick way to test the gamma on my system, and a tip for 
		adjusting for gamma correction directly in the BMRT renderer, rendrib.
		I thought this would be a great thing to share with my readers, so
		here it is.
		
		<BR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Rendrib produces linear pixels for its output -- i.e. a pixel with
		value 200 represents twice as much light as a pixel of value 100.
		Thus, it's expected that your display will be twice as bright
		(photometrically, not necessarily perceptually) on a pixel of 200
		than one of 100.
		
		<BR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		This sort of display only really happens if you correct for gamma, 
		the nonlinearity of your monitor.  In order to check this,
		take a look at the following chart.  Display the chart as you'd
		view any image.  You'll notice that if you squint, the apparent
		brightness of the left side will match some particular number on
		the right.  This is your gamma correction factor that must be
		applied to the image to get linear response on your particular
		monitor.

<tr>
	<td valign=top width="54%">
		<BR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		If your display program uses Mesa (as rendrib's framebuffer display
		does), you can set an environment variable, MESA_GAMMA, to this value
		and it will transparently do the correction as it writes pixels to the
		screen.  Most display programs let you correct gamma when you view
		an image, though I've had trouble getting xv to do it without messing 
		up the colors in a weird way.
		
		<BR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Another alternative is to put the following line in your RIB file:
		
<PRE>
          Exposure 1 &ltgamma&gt
</PRE>

		where gamma was what you measured with the chart.
		This will cause rendrib to pre-correct the output pixels for the
		gamma of your display.  
		I think it's important to gamma correct so that at least you're
		viewing the images the way that rendrib "expects" them to appear.
		It can't know about the nonlinearities of your CRT without you
		telling it.

		Larry has more on the gamma issue on his own pages.  You can find
		it at
		<A HREF="http://www.seas.gwu.edu/student/gritz/gamma.html">
		http://www.seas.gwu.edu/student/gritz/gamma.html</A>.
		He also asked me to mention that he got this chart from
		Greg Ward, but we didn't have any contact information for him.
		Hopefully he doesn't mind our using it.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Readers should note that the image displayed in this article may
		not provide accurate information for adjusting gamma since your
		browser may dither the colors in a way which changes what the
		actual value should be.  Also, this image is a JPEG version of
		the original TIFF image Larry supplied.  It's possible the conversion
		also changed the image.  If you're interested in trying this out you
		should grab

The following links are just starting points for finding more information
about computer graphics and multimedia in general for Linux systems.  If
you have some application-specific information for me, I'll add them to my
other pages or you can contact the maintainer of some other web site.  I'll
consider adding other general references here, but application or site
specific information needs to go into one of the following general 
references and not listed here.
