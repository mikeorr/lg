Totally off-topic, but NIN have released two albums this year; "Ghosts
I - IV" (a collection of ambient improvisations) and "The Slip" (a
'proper' album) under the Creative Commons Share Alike Non-Commercial
licence.

An interesting move in the age of DRM. They also have a remix site
(<a href="http://remix.nin.com">http://remix.nin.com</a>) where they offer the 'source' for Garageband,
ableton Live, as well as plain old wav format files for each track.

I bought Ghosts I-IV for 5$ and was surprised to find not only the 320
kbit/s MP3s but also a PDF with artwork for every song in print quality.
And in addition Trent has a strong opinion about others who did almost
the same, but not quite:

I am pretty convinced that the age of DRM will not last very long

nice letters to companies promising money in return for them to actually
sell what they promise).

Ah, that was the other cool thing I forgot - they also offer 'higher

I hadn't really been keeping up with Nine Inch Nails since 'With
Teeth', and a lot of this seems to be a reaction to their record
label's actions in promoting the album after that: it was a concept
album set in a dystopian future, and they use a set of websites to set
up an alternate reality, based on the concept
(<a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/02/22/year-zero-project-way-cooler-than-lost/">http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/02/22/year-zero-project-way-cooler-than-lost/</a>).
</p>

<p>
Part of their plan was leaking MP3s on USB drives left in bathrooms in
different venues on their European tour, which had information in the
ID3 tags giving clues for the next part of the game. But 'According to
Billboard.com, the RIAA sent cease-and-desist emails to web sites that
posted the tracks, leading one industry source to say, "These f***ing
idiots are going after a campaign that the label signed off on."'
(<a href="http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=69841">http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=69841</a>)
</p>

<p>
So, I don't think it looks good on the DRM front.

I missed that, but it's a really great idea.

Well, music-wise there's been some success banning DRM, but it's
different with TV/radio broadcasts and cinemas. We had to buy a TV set
yesterday and the whole market has gone digital. Some European countries
already changed their broadcast systems as well (at least for the TV
signal). The good old radio is collecting enemies, too:
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/06/24/drwg_report/">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/06/24/drwg_report/</a>
</p>

<p>
A friend of mine told me about cinemas converting their projectors to
digital "tape". The side effect is that this introduces DRM into
cinemas. Then the studios can
</p>

<pre>
 - limit the validity of decryption keys (i.e. they can force the cinema
   to show the movies only at certain times and dates, choose the size
   of the audience room, etc.),
 - control the display quality (i.e. "no, you are not allowed to view
   what you paid for"),
 - control which parts of the movie can/must be played,
 - use watermarks,
 - distribute the content by using networks (so there are no more
   hardcopies going around) and more.
</pre>

<p>
The above list is an excerpt from the German Wikipedia entry
<a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitales_Kino">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitales_Kino</a>
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_cinema">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_cinema</a> lacks the list of
implications). A friend of mine told me about a producer of documentary
films who toured cities and countries asking cinema owners to play his
film. When he asked cinemas that we already "upgraded" to digital
projectors, they had to decline since the projector would only play
signed content. Guess who signs the data and controls the certificate
authority.

Heh. Well, NIN have featured in some of our off-topic ramblings
before, so they at least hit the 'somewhat relevant' button. Unlike
the PR stuff I get, which is all about Windows software.
