Subject: <B>Photogrammetry tools for Linux? </B> 
<P>
I am looking for a Linux program to do some close-range photogrammetry.
Close range photogrammetry is a technique that enables to reconstruct 3D
images from a series of 2D pictures.
There are a few powerful (and relatively inexpensive) tools for Windows
but none so far for Linux, that I know of. There was something once upon 
a time called Photo4D. Despite my massive Internet search, any occurrence
of Photo4D seems to have been wipe erased from the face of earth. It 
is listed in SAL but all the links fail.
<P>
I don't want to resort to buy and use Windows software for this. Help, anyone?
<P>

I recently came across an excellent mini-howto on overcoming some of the
pitfalls of having a dynamic IP address
(ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/unmaintained/mini/Dynamic-IP-Hacks).
<P>
Reading this document has refueled my desire to learn shell scripting,
sed rules and the like.  My search of the Internet for information on
these topics has, however, been fruitless.
<P>
I would be most grateful if someone could point me to a good shell
scripting tutorial or book.

Thanks in advance.

<P>
    I think the Coldiron article on replacing NT with Linux is the best 
thing I've seen in the gazette. Congratulations. More such 
articles are needed. I am especially interested in an article explaining 
why Linux doesn't come with a "system requirements" box 
on the package (no package??). Seriously, though, I am a computer dealer 
and have many times advised people to buy their 
application software first then buy a computer that will run that 
package. If I tell my customers to go out and buy a 386 with 16 
MB of ram and a half MB video card and a 200 MB hard drive, they 
will think I am [characterization deleted!] in the head. 
And maybe they'll be right. How much difference does the underlying 
hardware make to the user of an X application, and how 
can I assess (for them) the varying cost effectiveness of a faster 
processor versus more RAM versus a SCSI disk versus just a 
bigger IDE disk. Maybe you can commission an article like this. (Don't 
even THINK of asking me). Someone of your loyal 
readers must have relevant experience to write up. 
<P>
Great magazine, keep up the good work. If ever you find yourself in northern 
BC I will happily buy you a beer.

<P>
Recently I was looking at the Gazette and I think I have a good
suggestion of an article that will be very useful for the Linux
community.
<P>
I have had some technical difficulties of having two simultaneous
versions of Kernels in my system. I mean a stable one and a developing
one. I searched the net looking for information of how to co-exist
both but it's completely fragmented. 
<P>
If somebody more experienced could put all this information together,
it will certainly help a lot of people from kernels developers to
end-users.
<P>
Thanks a lot for your patience. <BR> 
Renato.

<P>
I have been reading a lot of speculation about whether Linux can ever
displace Microsoft on the desktop. In the course of wading through a lot
of hype I haven't seen much actual experience reported about an ordinary
computer user installing Linux on their PC. I don't mean someone who is
already a Linux enthusiast and I don't mean someone with a computer
science degree either. Just an ordinary computer user with an IQ bigger
than a shoe size, sitting down with a brand new Intel box and a Red Hat
5.1 package, say, and going through the hoops up to the point where X
starts up okay and the modem is a working Internet device. This ought to
be compared to such a person doing the same operation with a new box and
a copy of W98. I think that would make a useful comparison.

<P>
Okay, I am pretty new to Linux and am trying to learn it. The main problem is,
is that I always have my desktop tied up doing more important things, and also
don't have the room on it to hold Linux. My solution is to pull out my old 286
laptop (old but very good) and use that to start learning Linux. My big
problem, though, is finding a version that will run on that. I have the Debian
1.3, but min reg. are 386+. Is there a ver. that will run on 286 - and where
can I get it?

Subject: <B>Communication Problem</B> 
<P>
I have a problem communicating with Compuserve through Seyon
since I installed a 16650A serial card on my Dell 486DX2 66MHz
running RedHat 4.1 Kernel 2.0.17.  and a USRobotics SportsterMessagePlus
<P>
modem. Before, I used a 14.4 Hayes compatible modem connected to
a serial port with a 16450 IC, in that configuration everything was slow
<P>
but OK.
I am connecting to a Compuserve server with baud rates to 28.800bps.
The characters in the Seyon terminal form unreadable garbage, and I
cannot find out how to parameterize the connection to get it right.
To complete the information, when I make a ppp connection to a
56kbps server of Compuserve and use Netscape communicator, everything
runs perfectly well, so I guess the Seyon problem is not related to
kernel parameters but rather to xterm?
<P>
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: <B>Article on home networking.</B> 
<P>
     I just read a reply to the home networking article by Mr. Gray and I 
     agree that home networking is cheap and easy.  I disagree somewhat 
     about the 100baseT.  I've just upgraded from 10baseT to 100baseT.  The 
     hub was $100USD for an eight port hub with uplink and the cards were 
     $30USD (Dec Tulip chip set).  I've heard there may be some cheaper NICs 
     now $20~25USD. My upgrade cost was $250 for 5 machines - 3 Win95, 
     Linux server, multi-boot Linux/win95/NT - the cable was CAT5 to begin 
     with.  The additional cost of putting in 100 vs 10 is so slight, about 
     $115 in this case as the cable is the same, that it isn't worth 
     installing 10baseT.  The advantage is that 100baseT and a reasonably 
     fast Linux machine allows a Win95 machine to access apps almost as 
     fast (in some cases faster) from the network than from its own drive.  
     Note that I too build from junk as much as possible and the children's 
     machines (the Win95 ones) are very low end Pentium and have old slow 
     small drives than contain only the OS and swap.  Everything else is on 
     the server (install once use many!).   
<P>     
     There is a caveat to this of course.  100baseT NICs for ISA machines 
     are VERY expensive so if you have ISA machines, your only realistic 
     choice is 10baseT.  The one 100baseT ISA NCI I priced (3Com) cost more 
     than all the PCI NICs for my upgrade.  
<P>     
     Just my $0.02 or so.  Keep up the good work, I really enjoy the magazine.

Subject: <B>Comment about LG last review</B> 
<P>
It took me 3 tries to get the full article about "Replacing NT by
Linux" but I finally
did it. I am very pleased to see people from the "real-world" as they
call themselves
to admit that Linux can avoid lot of people using bad softwares. There is
only one thing
that make me sad, the only people who are going to read this article are Linux
users.
<P>
Is there any solution to make "real-world" people reading such article?
I not talking of a holy war against M$, but I think the worse thing
for Linux
and other brilliant systems or soft is that the end user never heard of
this solution.
<P>
The fact that Netscape has moved to Open Source Software was a big
advert
for the GNU/Linux solutions. I hope we will be able to take advantage of
it to say
to managers "Hey, we can do every thing you want, and in a better way
than it is done yet by Micro$oft and Co. You just have not to think in
buying a
solution 60,000$ each year for updates but paying someone 60,000$ a year
for
building you the exact solution you need using Open Source Software.
Which
means for you having a *personal* *reliable* *IT* solution."
<P>
That is the challenge: teach them that a man or a woman is more
important than
a soft, because this man or this woman can adapt (him|her)self to the
need of a
firm, and is more important for the end user as a spring of information
than a
bad-written manual.
<P>
Keep on LG, the job you are doing is brilliant.

Subject: <B>Simple Suggestion</B> 
<P>
To further Linux in this world of ours, I think it fitting that Linux 
Programmers look at two different ways this can be accomplished:
<ol>
<li>Applications -
    This does not end in Word Processors... Desktop Publishing systems, 
a simple database system, Accounting Software, the whole nine yards. If 
we focused on software that companies use at a lower price (or freeware) 
than Windoze, and comparable or better performance, then Linux would be 
more acceptable world wide.
<li>Games -
  As much as I hate to admit it, Games are a must in this PC world. 
There are versions of popular games for linux, but there are no MAJOR 
companies designing games for Linux. If we can get a 
Doom/Myst/DeerHunter type game specifically designed for Linux, then 
Linux will definitely have more interest in the market.
</ol>
That's my two cents...

Subject: <B>Suggestions to improve readability</B> 
<P>
First, I would like to express my appreciation to all the authors
for taking time to write excellent articles. 
<P>
I do, however, have a suggestion or two that will make the
accessibility of the zine that much better.
<P>
As background, I am one of your readers that prints out the zine,
then reads it.  It is much easier for my tired old eyes that way,
and I also get a nice resource to use when the screen is cluttered
with windows of different things for the project I am working on.
<P>
With that said, I have a couple problems that can be easily solved. 
<ul>
<li>The first thing is links in the articles.  The usual standard one
sees on the net is to put the URL in the body of the article and
then link it.  This way us off-line readers can fire up a browser
later and go directly to the site mentioned without having to find
the link in the online version of the article.

<li>Secondly, and this came up in the latest issue BTW, when giving
source code, config or other text-based examples, please keep them
as text.  Putting backgrounds behind the code makes them hard to
read, and if they are in fact graphics, one has to type in the code
by hand.  A better way is to delineate it with some sort of
blocking character string and use the appropriate HTML tag to show
it is an example.  I tend to use the following to start and stop
sections of code:
<P> 
#-----------------------------
<P>
(Note: it is a pound sign with a bunch of dashes).
<P>
This will speed loading into browsers online, allow cut and paste
operations, and ensure readability for the off-line printout
readers.  (I know that more people that just I do this!)
</ul>
Thanks again for a great zine!
<P>
Brian
<blockquote> <I> 
(Okay, one, I'm guessing you are objecting to the practice of using word instead
of the address in the link so the text version only shows the word and
drops the address. I can make sure this happens in sections that I do
myself, but I really don't have time to do it for every article. I will
print your letter and maybe that will give authors a push in the right
direction.
Second, I use whatever the authors send as listings and most do keep them 
between &lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; tags without backgrounds. Mr. Coldiron article last
month did use backgrounds. His article has been quite popular.
Thanks for writing, --Editor)
