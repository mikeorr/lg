Hi,
</p>

<p>
I read that you are using the above Shuttle and I am thinking about
getting one myself. I was wondering though what graphics did you use
and whether it is so silent that you do not notice it or that you can
hear it but it is not bothering at all. I am thinking about getting a
8800gts, but am not sure whether it will be too loud for the system..
I would appreciate your info!
</p>

<p>
Paul

[ I'm CCing TAG, since you'd have read this in the linux gazette.
It's only right the reply ends up there. ]

I'm using an NVidia graphics card (GeForce 7300).   This is actually a
PCI-express card.  I don't notice it, although it can put out a fair
amount of heat -- this is normal for most graphics cards.   It's not a
particularly powerful one, either.  I don't play games (unless you
count moon-buggy) so I wasn't interested in anything more than this.
</p>

<p>
The ICE system in the shuttle really works well.   There's some nice
BIOS options for it which allow's one to control the speed the fans
are set at.  It's quite clever in how it works too.  Cool air is drawn
in from one side of the shuttle, which is blown through it and emitted
out the other side.  By default, these fans are set to "Smart Mode" in
this BIOS, which means they're controlled by the BIOS as to how fast
or slow they need to spin.  Even on a hot day here (where the room
temperature was ~30C) the system temperature overall was only about
50C -- that's not bad going at all.
</p>

<p>
There is <strong>some</strong> tiny hum from the Shuttle regarding these fans, but
it's barely audible, and I'm sat right next to thing.  What I do tend
to hear, perhaps more than I'd like is the damn hard drive being
accessed.  I suspect that's my fault -- I should check to see that I
screwed the thing in properly.
</p>

<p>
What is it you were thinking of using it as?  I would be hesitant to
suggest you leave it on 24/7 like some other machines --- you have to
be slightly careful that the hard drive(s) don't emit too much heat.
I've read reports that the heat from some drives can be troublesome,
although given the hard drives are mounted at the very top of the
case, this can only help to dissipate the heat.
</p>

<p>
I'm really pleased with it, as I said.  It's a brilliant machine.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
