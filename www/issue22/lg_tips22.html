 Lynn Danielson asked:<p>
<p>I downloaded Netscape Communicator just a few weeks ago from 
the Netscape site.  I'm not sure older versions of Netscape are still 
available. I'm probably wrong, but I was under the impression that 
only the most current beta versions were freely available.  
<P>
Answer:<p>
A quick search through Alta-Vista for Netscape mirrors showed a couple of
different listing for mirror sites.  I perused a few and found most either
didn't have anything or had non-English versions, etc.  One site I did find
with all the appropriate pieces is:
<P>
<a href="ftp://ftp.adelaide.edu.au/pub/WWW/Netscape/pub/">

ftp://ftp.adelaide.edu.au/pub/WWW/Netscape/pub/
</a>

<P>

Its a long way to go to get it (Australia), but thats all I could find.  If
you want to go directly to the latest (4.03b8) Communicator directory, try:
<P>
<a href="ftp://ftp.adelaide.edu.au/pub/WWW/Netscape/pub/communicator/4.03/4.03b8/english/unix/">
 ftp://ftp.adelaide.edu.au/pub/WWW/Netscape/pub/communicator/4.03/4.03b8/english/unix/
</a>
<P>
I did notice once while trying to download from Netscape that older
versions were available, although I didn't try to download them.  I noticed
this while looking for the latest download of Communicator through their
web sites.  Can't remember how I found that, though.
<P>
The 3.x version is available commercially from Caldera.  I expect that the
4.x versions will be as well, though I don't know if Caldera keeps the beta
versions on their anonymous ftp sites.
<P>
BTW, the Page Composer is pretty slick, although it has no interface for
doing Javascript.  It has a few bugs, but its the best WYSIWYG interface
for HTML composition on Linux that I've seen.  Its better than Applix's
HTML Editor, although that one does allow exporting to non-HTML stuff.
Collabra Discussions sucks.  The old news reader was better at most things.
I'd still like to be able to mark a newsgroup read up to a certain point
instead of the all-or-nothing bit.
<P>
For anyone who is interested - 4.x now supports CSS (Cascading Style
Sheets) and layers.  Both of these are *very* cool.  They are the future of
Web design and, IMHO, a very good way to create Multimedia applications for
distribution on CDs.  One of C|Net's web pages (I think) has some info on
these items, including a demo of layers (moves an image all over the screen
*over* the underlying text - way cool).  The only C|Net URL I ever remember
is www.news.com, but you can get to the rest of their sites from there.

From: Ivo Saviane <a href="mailto:saviane@astrpd.pd.astro.it">saviane@astrpd.pd.astro.it</a> 
<P>


<p>Dear LG,
<p>it always happens to me that I spend a lot of time finding out how to
do a certain thing under Linux/Unix, and then I forget it. The next time 
I need that information I will start all the `find . ...', `grep xxx *' process 
again and waste the same amount of time!
<p>
To me, the best way to avoid that is to send a mail to myself telling how
to do that particular operation. But mail folders get messy and, moreover,
are not useful to other users who might need that same information.
<p>
Finally I found something that contributes solving this problem. I set up
a dummy user who reads his mail and puts it in www readable form. Now it is
easy for me to send a mail to news@machine as soon as I learn something,
and be sure that I will be able to find that information again just 
clicking on the appropriate link. It would also be easy to set up a grep
script and link it to the same page.
<p>
The only warning is to put a meaningful `subject: ' to the mail, since 
this string will be written besides the link. 
<p>
I am presently not aware of something similar. 
At least, not that simple. It you know, let me know too!
<p>
If you want to see how this works, visit
<p>
<a href="http://obelix.pd.astro.it/~news">http://obelix.pd.astro.it/~news</a>
<p>
A quick description of the basic operations needed is given below.
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
The following lines briefly describe how to set up the light news server.
<p>
1. Create a new user named `news' 
<p>
2. Login as news and create the directories ~/public_html 
   and ~/public_html/folders (I assume that your http server is configured
   so that `http://machine/~user' will point to `public_html' in the user's
   $HOME).
<p>
3. Put the wmanager.sh script in the $HOME/bin directory. The script follows
   the main body of this message as attachment [1]. The script does work
   under bash.
<p>
   The relevant variables are grouped at the beginning of the script. These
   should be changed according to the machine/user setup
<p>
4. The script uses splitmail.c in order to break the mail file in sub-folders
   The binary file should be  put in the $HOME/bin dir. See attachment [2].
<p>
5. Finally, add a line in the `news' user crontab, like the following
<p>
   00 * * * * /news_bin_dir/wmanager.sh
<p>
   where `news_bin_dir' stands for $HOME/bin. In this case the mail will be
   checked once every hour.
<p>

Making Changing X video modes easier
</H3>
<P> 

Date: Thu, 28 Aug 1997 20:29:59 +0100<br>
From: Jo Whitby <a href="mailto:pandore@globalnet.co.uk">pandore@globalnet.co.uk</a><br>

Hi
<P>

In issue 20 of the Linux gazette there was a letter from Greg Roelofs on
changing video modes in X - this was something I had tried and had found
changing colour depths awkward, and didn't know how to start multiple
versions of X.
<P>
I also found the syntax of the commands difficult to remember, so here's
what I did.
<P>
First I created 2 files in /usr/local/bin called x8 and x16 for the
colour depths that I use, and placed the command in them -
<P>
for x8
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
startx -- :$* -bpp 8 &
</pre>
<P>
and for x16
<P>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
startx -- :$* -bpp 16 &
</pre>
<P>
then I made them executable -
<P>
<pre>
chmod -c 755 /usr/local/bin/x8
chmod -c 755 /usr/local/bin/x16

</pre>
<P>
now I simply issue the command x8 or x16 for the first instance of X and
x8 1 or x16 1 for the next and so on, this I find much easer to
remember:-) An addition I would like to make would be to check which X
servers are running and to increment the numbers automatically, but as I
have only been running Linux for around 6 months my script writing is
extremely limited, I must invest in a book on the subject.
<P>
Linux is a fantastic OS, now I've tried it I could not go back to
Windoze and hate having to turn my Linux box into a wooden doze box just
to run the couple of progs that I can't live without (Quicken 4 and a
lottery checking prog), so if anyone knows of a good alternative to
these please let me know, the sooner doze is gone for good the better -
then Linux can have the other 511Mb of space doze95 is hogging!
<P>
ps. Linux Gazette is just brilliant, I've been reading all the back
issues, nearly caught up now - only been on the net for 3 months. I hope
to be able to contribute something a little more useful to the Gazette
in the future, when my knowledge is a little better:-)
<P>
keep up the good work.

<p>
Regarding your question in the Linux Gazette, there is a program that
can interpret postscript for different printers. It's called Ghostscript.
<p>
The smartest thing to do is to encapsulate it in a shell-script and then
call this script from printcap.

You should only have to change the resolution <tt>-r</tt> and device <tt>-sDEVICE</tt>
options to something more suitable to your printer. See <tt>gs -?</tt> for a list
of supported devices. I'd suggest you try the cdeskjet or <tt>djet500c</tt>
devices. Do a <tt>chmod 755 &lt;scriptname&gt;</tt>, and copy it to /usr/local/bin as
root. 
<p>
Next you should add a Postscript printer to your /etc/printcap file. Edit
this file as root.
<p>
<pre>
-------- printcap excerpt -----------<br>
ps|HP LaserJet 5L as PostScript:\
    :lp=/dev/lp1:\
    :sd=/var/spool/lp1:\
    :mx#0:\
    :if=/usr/local/bin/pslj:sh<br>
-------- printcap excerpt ------------</pre><br>
<p>
This is the definition of a printer called <tt>ps</tt>. It passes everything it
should print through the pslj filter, which converts the postscript to
something my Laserjet 5 can use.
<p>
To print Postscript, use <tt>lpr -Pps filename</tt>.
<p>
change this to reflect your script name.
<p>
Hope this helps!

Realaudio without X-windows</h3>

This is more of a pointer than a tip, but your readers might want to check
out traplayer on sunsite, it lets you play realaudio without starting up
an X server on your screen. Kinda useful if you don't like to use
memory-hog browsers just to listen to realaudio.
<p>
The file is available at sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux in the Incoming
directory (until it gets moved), and then who knows where. It's called
traplayer-0.5.tar.gz.

There is a program called bootpc (a bootp client for linux). 
From the LSM entry (maybe there is a newer version now):<p>
<pre>
Title:          Linux Bootp Client
Version:        V0.50
Entered-date:   1996-Apr-16
Description:    This is a boot protocol client used to grab the machines
                ip number, set up DNS nameservers and other useful information.
Keywords:       bootp bootpc net util
Author:         ceh@eng.cam.ac.uk (Charles Hawkins)
Maintained-by:  J.S.Peatfield@damtp.cam.ac.uk (Jon Peatfield)
Primary-site:   ftp.damtp.cam.ac.uk:/pub/linux/bootpc/bootpc.v050.tgz
Alternate-site:
sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Network/admin/bootpc.v050.tgz
Platform:       You need a BOOTP server too.
Copying-policy: This code is provided as-is, with no warrenty, share and

The package inludes a shell script to set up the ethernet card, send the
bootp request,
receive the answer and set up everything needed. 
<p>
I hope this helps

Running commands from X w/out XTerm</h3>
Date: Fri, 26 Sep 1997 18:28:51 -0600<br>
From: "Kenneth R. Kinder" <a href="mailto:Ken@KenAndTed.com">Ken@KenAndTed.com</a><p>
I often found myself running XTerm just to type a single shell
commmand.  After a while, you just wish you could run a single command
without even accessing a menu.   To solve this problem, I wrote exec. 
As the program name would emply, the exec program mearly prompts (in
X11) for a command, and replaces its own process with the
shell-orriented command you type in.  Exec can also browse files, and
insert the path in the text box, incase you need a file in your command
line.  Pretty simple huh?  Exec (of course!) is GPL, and can be
downloaded at http://www.KenAndTed.com/software/exec/ -- I would
appreciate it if someone would modify my source to do more! =)

Ascii problems with FTP</h3>
Date: Wed, 24 Sep 1997 12:42:05 -0400<br>
From: Carl Hohman <a href="mailto:carl@microserv-canada.com">carl@microserv-canada.com</a><p>
Andrew, I read your letter to the Linux Gazzette in issue 19. I don't
know if you have an answer yet, but here's my 2 bits...
<br>
If I understand correctly, you are using FTP under DOS to obtain Linux
scripts. Now, as you may know, the line terminators in text files are
different between Unix systems and DOS (and Apples, for that matter). I
suspect that what's happening is this: FTP is smart enough to know about
terminator differences between systems involved in an ascii mode
transfer and performs appropriate conversions silently and on the fly.
This give you extra ^M's on each line if you download the file in DOS
and then simply copy it (or use an NFS mount) to see it from Unix. I
suspect that if you use a binary tranfer (FTP> image) the file will
arrive intact for Linux use if it originates on a Unix server.
<p>
Hope this helps.<br>
