heya bro,

I have a problem w/ the graphics on my intel system.  They don't work.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I installed Redhat Linux onto my CA-810, but the only thing I can do is
getinto nongraphix mode.  Now, I can get into root, but am not very
fimiliar w/ workig there and would very much like to be.

I didn't know what a CA-810 when I read this question.  However, a
quick trip to Google's Linux pages (<A HREF="http://www.google.com/linux"
	>http://www.google.com/linux</A>)
and the search string: "ca-810 intel video" did net me the
following links:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
That told me that the CA810 is a line of integrated motherboards by
Intel.  Some of them have integrated video and ethernet.  They seem
to be primarily used for 1U (one rack unit: 1.75 in.) rackmount and
slim case ("pizza box") systems.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Then I went back and changed my search query to "ca810 intel video"
to find this link:

</DL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Then I used "find in page" (the "<TT>/</TT>" key in lynx) on the term
"video" to find that this board includes a comment to the effect
that "the video is the Intel 82810" and that the SVGA X server
is appropriate for that video chipset.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I tried to cross-check that at the XFree86 web site
(<A HREF="http://www.xfree86.org"
	>http://www.xfree86.org</A>) which maintains a list of supported
chipsets (<A HREF="http://www.xfree86.org/3.3.5/README3.html"
	>http://www.xfree86.org/3.3.5/README3.html</A>).  However, I
didn't find the 82810 listed there, and the only Intel video
chipset listed was the i710.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So I went back to Google and tried a few searches on variations
of "82810" with words like: intel, xfree86, x windows, xwindows,
eventually finding references to this as the "Camino" chipset
and to some discussions on the Linux kernel list (kernel panics and
"oopsen" from overheating issues), and a reference to an XFCom_i810
server in <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">S.u.S.E.</A> version 6.3 (back in December of 1999).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I also found a kernel patch updating the list of PCI id codes with
a set of 82810 chipsets.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I also found another "Ask Slashdot" thread that referred to this
as compatible with the XFree86 SVGA (generic) driver.  Finally I
followed up by looking at the S.u.S.E. site and searching through
their list of X servers (supported video chipsets).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
S.u.S.E. has often offered support for video chipsets before they
were available in the XFree86 sources.  They've contributed back to
XFree86 wherever possible.  However, some of these were done with
Precision Insite and some of them involved NDAs (non-disclosure
agreements) with the video chipset manufacturers.  Sometimes Linux
and X programmers will sign NDAs in order to produce freely
distributable but closed source support for some hardware.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Anyway, that was about 10 minutes of searching at Google.  If I
really needed to I could probably dig up more at Yahoo!
(<A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com"
	>http://www.yahoo.com</A>), Deja News (<A HREF="http://www.deja.com/usenet"
	>http://www.deja.com/usenet</A>) or
Alta Vista (<A HREF="http://www.altavista.com"
	>http://www.altavista.com</A>).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(In fact, I did go a bit further. From Deja I found that the
unique thing about this chipset is that it uses main system memory
for the video framebuffer (presumably by using the PCI chipset to
reserve a block of motherboard/main RAM for its use.  That's a
clever trick, and potentially very handy for servers where you
don't usually want to waste memory on graphics at all, but certain
legacy operating systems, like MS Windows NT, can't be installed
or operated with using a GUI.  That and another reference to an
old kernel issue involving the hardware clock support).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
O.K.  So this particular motherboard has had some issues.  It is
not well supported, but it is apparently quite inexpensive, thus
making it popular.  Naturally many people have gone out and bought
them and found that Linux might have some problems with them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It sounds like the main kernel issue (the hardware clock support)
was fixed back in December; so a recent kernel will fix that.
Linux doesn't require a GUI for any normal server operations, so
most of the core users and target for this product aren't affected
by that chipset.  Some people have gotten it working fine under
the SVGA XFree86 driver, and none of them reported any special
steps (like CMOS settings) as necessary to make that work.  Some
others have reported that a S.u.S.E. XFCom_* server/driver works
for them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've gone into considerable detail about how I did these searches
so that you, and my other readers and see how that's done.
Remember that, at first reading your question, I'd never heard of
this Intel "Camino" CA810 motherboard with it's "82810/82810-DC100
Graphics and Memory Controller Hub."   With only about 20 minutes
of research and another 20 minutes of typing in this buffer I could
sound like an expert on the bloody thing.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now back to your question:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
First of all I need help installing the required patch to enable the
graphics, I hear it has something to do w the chipset. I think I have
the right patch from Intel,  (Maybe you can send me the download?) but I
can't even get Linux to run the floppy from root. Computer illeterate???
I'd like to change that.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

If you think you have the "right patch from Intel" why would you
want me to take up my time and bandwidth hunting it down and
sending it to you.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I presume that your reference to your floppy problems is to warn me
that you have no idea how to do perfectly mundane tasks under
Linux.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Indeed, your writing is so disjointed that I should probably insert
a translation to see I understand it correctly:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
&quot;I don't know how to get X Windows (or other graphics software)
working with <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> Linux on my Intel CA810 system.  I can get
into text mode.  But I don't know what to do with that.
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
First, I need help installing the required patch.  I've heard
that it has something to do with my chipset. I think I have the
right patch from Intel. But I don't know what to do with it.
I don't even know how to access my floppy.  (Like I said, I
need to learn more about Linux, and writing).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I'm also looking for a good tutorial on using and administering
a Linux system.  I need to know how to work as root.  About all
I know so far is how to cd (change directories), and run ls
to see my files.  I've seen people do alot more, and I know that
much more sophisticated interfaces are available.  I would love
to be more proficient with Linux.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Hmm.  That flows much better.  (Of course I realize that my own
writing is not perfect.  I leave the occasional typo, am prone to
some run-on sentences, meander and digress incessantly, and exhibit
a poor sense of paragraph structure.  However, I do try to put
enough into it that people can read through my prose without too
much effort).  Note that my "translation" is actually about 20%
shorter than your message.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I still don't know what patch you think you got from Intel.  Is
it on a floppy?  Where did you get it?  What's the filename?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you downloaded something from Intel's web site to a PC running
MS-DOS or MS-Windows, and copied that out to a floppy, then you
should be able access that under Linux using the 'mtools' commands,
or the '<tt>mount</tt>' command with one of the MS compatible filesystems
(msdos, umsdos, vfat, or uvfat).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Linux supports a number of variations of msdos/vfat filesystems.
The "msdos" is the most basic support for "FAT" (file allocation
table) filesystems.  The umsdos variant of that supports Linux
meta data, long filenames, owner and group association and
permissions, by maintaining a set of "hidden/system" files which
are transparent to MS-DOS and the Linux "userspace."  The vfat
filesystem support Win'9x long filenames (the VFAT feature), and
the uvfat variant of that hides Linux/UNIX metadata thereunder.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You're kernel might be built with any or all of these.  Possibly
these drivers are linked in. More likely your copy of Red Hat has
them available as loadable kernel modules (under the <TT>/lib/modules</TT>
directory tree).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Generally it is somewhat easier to access your MS-DOS floppies
using the MTools package.  So you can put your floppy in "drive A:"
and just type the command '<tt>mdir</tt>' to see a list of MS-DOS files.
You can use the '<tt>mcopy</tt>' command to copy files to or from the
floppy.  The <tt>mdel</tt>, <tt>mcd</tt>, <tt>mmd</tt>, <tt>mrd</tt>, <tt>mtype</tt>, <tt>mren</tt>, <tt>mmove</tt>, <tt>mattrib</tt>,
<tt>mlabel</tt> commands all work pretty much like their MS-DOS counterparts
(DEL, CD, MD, RD, TYPE, REN, MOVE, ATTRIB, and LABEL, etc).  If you
look closely you'll find that all of these "m*" commands under
Linux are actually just links to the same file -- the 'mtools'
program.  Basically this one program is acting in different modes
depending on the name under which you called it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So the following would get a file named <tt>foo.zip</tt> into your <TT>/tmp</TT>
directory:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
mcopy a:/foo.zip /tmp
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
...NOTE:  you should probably avoid trying to use wildcard
patterns like *.TXT, with mtools until you understand UNIX
"globbing" (UNIX' way of handling wildcards is different than
the way MS-DOS does it).  Also note that UNIX is case-sensitive
so you should type any filenames you pass to mtools commands
exactly as you see them in your '<tt>mdir</tt>' and '<tt>ls</tt>' commands.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's also possible to "mount" an MS-DOS FAT for MS Win '9x VFAT
filesystem into a Linux directory tree.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Under UNIX filesystems are not accessed through device names like
A:, C:, etc.  That's a feature that MS-DOS, and Windows NT borrow
from the TOPS-10, TOPS-20, and VMS family of operating systems.
(MS-DOS is a descendent of CP/M, which is basically a cousin to
TOPS-10, an old OS for the PDP-10 family of computers).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Under all UNIX systems and clones, filesystems (peripheral storage
devices) are "merged" into a single directory tree.  For example,
it is common to have a small root filesystem which stores the
kernel, the minimum necessary utilities to bring up the rest of the
system, and to troubleshoot and repair it, etc. The generally also
have a larger filesystem which stores all of the major applications
and the less fundamental and non-critical utilities that are
commonly needed by users.  That is usually mounted under the <TT>/usr</TT>
directory.  As networked filesystems became commonly supported
under UNIX it was common to group quite a bit of the documentation
and many other files unto a file server.  That filesystem was
"exported" to the others which normally mount it under <TT>/usr/share</TT>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
All of this is done using the <tt>mount</tt> command.  It's also possible to
detach a filesystem using the <tt>umount</tt> command.  (I know, it should
be "unmount" but whatever!  UNIX programmers have a tradition of
leaving one or two characters off of a command for function name
--- though usually they pick on vowels).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, you can usually mount your "C:" drive under Linux using a
command like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>mount -t msdos /dev/hda1 /mnt/c
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... or:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>mount -t uvfat /dev/sdb2 /mnt/e
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Here I'm using a common convention of mounting "temporary" and
"removable" filesystems under <TT>/mnt</TT>.  First you'd have to create
your "mountpoint" directories using the Linux mkdir command (you
can't use the 'MD' command from MS-DOS).  You can name the
mountpoint pretty much anything you want.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Once a filesystem is mounted you can access the files and
directories under using all of the normal UNIX/Linux command
names (<tt>ls</tt>, <tt>cp</tt>, <tt>mv</tt>, <tt>cat</tt>, etc).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To access your MS-DOS floppies under Linux you might create a
use a command like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>mount -t msdos /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Personally I prefer to access MS-DOS floppies using mtools, since
it let's me get at my files with just one or two commands instead
of having to mount it, get at them, and then remember to umount it
when I'm done.  (Actually I use whichever technique makes sense for
what I'm doing.  Usually I want to just get a file unto or off of
my system.  If I need to really work with a file, will mount it
up).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So that gives you a brief run down on accessing floppies under
Linux.  Now, I have no idea what sort of file you MIGHT have (I'm
not even sure if your comment on floppies has anything to do with
the rest of your questions, or if you were just citing it as an
example of your own unfamiliarity).  Consequently I have no idea
what you'd do with some file that you got from Intel.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Notice that I never came across any reference to any Intel drivers
or support for Linux on these motherboards.  Those, like most Linux
and XFree86 drivers seem to have been done independently of the
manufacturers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, how would you get X working on this system.  Well, you might
start by running the <tt>SuperProbe</tt> command.  This might recognize your
video chipset and tell you how much video memory it reports as
available.  That's a standard trick for looking detecting video
cards.  Of course we think we know which chipset this motherboard
is using.  However, there are a number of models of the CA810
motherboard out there.  It's certainly possible that your's is
different. (It's also tragically common for manufacturers to change
chipsets and components in their motherboards --- often without
changing the name or model number).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Anyway, running SuperProbe (which comes with XFree86) can also
let us know if our chipset is NOT recognized.  That might mean that
we need a newer copy of XFree86.  You don't way which version of
Red Hat Linux you have installed there.  It might be that you want
a newer version, or that you want to download updated XFree86 RPMs.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
RPMs are Red Hat Package Manager files.  The RPM system is used by
several Linux distributions, including Red Hat, Mandrake,
S.u.S.E., <A HREF="http://www.caldera.com/">Caldera</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.turbolinux.com/">TurboLinux</A>.  You can download RPMs for
various distributions at the web sites of their respective
distributors.  I should note that some RPMs are not interchangeable
among distributions.  This is particularly likely for the "core"
packages that are part of a distribution.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you do have to upgrade your XFree86 RPMs you can probably
download them Red Hat's FTP site (<A HREF="ftp://updates.redhat.com"
	>ftp://updates.redhat.com</A>).  You
might manage to find it somewhere on their web site.  As Red Hat
has gotten larger and "more corporate" I've found their web site to
be far less useful.  Looking there for "updates" at this point
seems to push for you to pay for their "priority update service"
and seems to make it more difficult to actually get what you came
for.  I can understand it in some ways --- they need to make their
money somehow.  They still do make the updates freely available;
you just have to know more about how to find them.  So, use FTP
in this case.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, just downloading the one or two RPMs might not be
enough. XFree86 is a complex program.  It is the largest
and most complex subsystem that comes with most Linux systems.  It
is dependent on many of system libraries. In other words you might
have to upgrade many of the other packages on the system in order
for a new XFree86 RPM to work.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is often easiest to upgrade the whole system at once.  If there
is a newer version of Red Hat available, you might be better
installing that.  (You're definitely better off getting a new CD
than downloading a whole ISO image.  The few bucks you spend at
Cheap Bytes (<A HREF="http://www.cheapbytes.com"
	>http://www.cheapbytes.com</A>) or even for a whole new
"Official Red Hat Linux" boxed CD set is well worth all the time
and bandwidth you'll save.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Anyway, then you try running <tt>XF86Setup</tt> (note the case) and/or
<tt>xf86config</tt>.  The former is a graphical menu-driven configuration
program.  The latter is sort of like a shell script --- it spits
out lists of options on the screen and prompts for your
information.  Give it your best shot with the former.  If that
doesn't work, then try xf86config.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If neither of these works then its possible that someone might be
able to get it working by manually tweaking your XF86Config file
(usually stored in <TT>/etc/X11</TT> these days).  However, I can't describe
how to do that here.  (It's pretty hard to explain, and I prefer to
avoid doing it when I can).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If all else fails you can try one of the commercial X server
packages.  XFree86 is the popular free and open source X server for
Linux.  There's a couple of commercial ones including the X-Inside
package from Xig (<A HREF="http://www.xig.com"
	>http://www.xig.com</A>) and Metro-X from Metrolink
(<A HREF="http://www.metrolink.com"
	>http://www.metrolink.com</A>).  These often offer support for video
chipsets that aren't supported by XFree86.  That happens with
hardware manufacturers refuse to release sufficient technical
specifications for the open source community to write a driver.
Sometimes these software vendors (Metrolink and Xig) donate drivers
to the XFree project.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Remember that there might be a driver to support this at the
S.u.S.E. site.  You might down load that.  It's possible that the
S.u.S.E. XFCom_i810 driver will support your motherboard.  That
might install O.K. under Red Hat, or you might have to fuss with
it.  You might even want to just switch to the
S.u.S.E. distribution in that case.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Obviously I could go on and on.  You'll just have to try a few
things.  In many cases I'm suggesting an "easy" way even for
situations where I might be able to get it working differently (and
less expensively).  Linux is very flexible.  It's possible to do
almost anything with it if you have the time, expertise and energy.

Secondly,  Maybe you know a good tutorial in this respect.  Dealing
with, and getting around in root.  I get th cd/thing (i.e.  cd/usr gets you
into usr and you can ls the stuff to see what's there)  that's
aboutwhere i am.  I have seen alot more happen and know that total

You should start with the Linux Documentation Project's
"Installation and Getting Started" (by Matt Welsh et al):

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You can read the entire book online.  In fact, like most of the LDP
you might find that there are already copies installed under
<TT>/usr/doc</TT> on your system (or on your Red Hat CDs).  There are many
other Guides, FAQs and HOWTOs at the <A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">LDP</A> site: <A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org"
	>http://www.linuxdoc.org</A>
LDP is the free documentation project which is a major part of the
whole Linux movement.  In fact, the Linux Gazette, and this column
is part of the LDP.  That's one of hte reasons I spend so much time
writing it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is also another book, "Running Linux" by Matt Welsh, Lar
Kaufman, et al which shares some chapters with LIGS, but is a bit
different in other respects.  This latter book is published by
O'Reilly &amp; Associates and you can read more about it at:
<A HREF="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/runux3/index.html"
	>http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/runux3/index.html</A>.    Of course
there are many other books on Linux out there.  The only other one
I really recommend for a beginner at this point, is Mark
G. Sobell's  "Practical Guide to Linux"
(<A HREF="http://www.sobell.com/LINUX/linux.html"
	>http://www.sobell.com/LINUX/linux.html</A>).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I did a review of "Running Linux, 3rd edition" for <A HREF="http://www.linuxcare.com/">Linuxcare</A> (my
employer) a few months ago.  That's at:

</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Anyway, this has hopefully given you some ideas on how to do a
search to find information about Linux.  As you can see, most of
it is available online and quite a bit comes with your system and is
installed under <TT>/usr/doc</TT>.
