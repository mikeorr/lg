Hey Everyone,
  A friend of mine asked the following question and as far as I know its 
not possible but if I am wrong please correct me.
</p>

<p>
  Basically what he wants to do is share files with windows systems over 
samba (with write/delete access) and restrict the number of files a user 
can delete at a time. So if a user (suramya) wanted to delete 2 files 
the system would let him delete it, but if he tried to delete 50 files 
it would stop it.
</p>

<p>
  What do you think? Is it possible? What I told him was that either you 
give a user delete access or not but you can't limit by the number of files.
</p>

<p>
The easiest way I have found to remove delete access is to remove the 
write access to the parent directory containing the files. But the 
downside of this is that the users can't add new files. In this case 
since the users are programmers they have to have the ability to add new 
files to the directory.
</p>

<p>
So what are his options?
</p>

<p>
I'm not enough of an expert on SAMBA to know if it is easy to hook into SAMBA 
and implement custom functions hooked to deletion. I think it's unlikely to 
be easy. There might be ways to do it based on fuse 
<a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/">http://fuse.sourceforge.net/</a>, but again I'm no expert.
</p>


<pre>

<p>
Possibly FUSE, but a simpler approach would be master and shadow directories. 
Let them do what they like in the shadow directory, but there is a process or 
cronjob that either propagates changes to the master directory or reverts any 
changes that aren't permitted.

<p>
The traditional way to handle this kind of permissions problem is via an
SUID program: you deny delete perms to the user, allow them for a
"special" user that you create, and set up the program to be SUID
that special user.
</p>

<p>
These are also the scenarios in which you need to be <strong>extremely</strong>
paranoid about privilege escalation - the only thing standing between
your users and full rights on the remote system is a single program bug.

Thanks for the info. I don't think I want to go that route as its too 
complicated to setup and I don't want to be responsible for maintaining 
it. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Maybe something else is enough -- at least with *nix filesystems
(etx2/3,xfs,..) you can set a sticky bit on directories. These cause
that everybody can delete his OWN files but not other files but can
creat (i.e. write) as he wants.
</p>

<p>
If a user wants to destroy all information this still allows him to
overwrite all files with zeros -- but an accidential delete will ownly
destroy the files of the user -- which might be educational at least. 
</p>

<p>
Setting a dir this way is done by:
<pre>
chmod 4755 dir
</pre>

<p>
samba will pass this on if users are conneting with different user names.

Hey Everyone,
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Hm.... no idea with out of the box tools. 
</pre>

<p>
I looked into this some more and have figured out a way that somewhat 
does what my friend wants to using rsync. Basically we maintain two 
copies of the data, one which the user(s) write to using samba and the 
second which is our master copy. Once every few hours we sync the two 
directories and if the number of files to be deleted exceed a given value we 
send out an email and sync the files without deleting anything. If the 
value is not exceeded we go ahead and delete the files in the master 
copy also.
</p>

<p>
Below is the script I wrote that does the above:
<pre class='code'>
--- Start SafeSync.sh ---
 
#!/bin/bash
MAX_DELETE=3
SOURCE_DIR="Projects/"
TARGET_DIR="Projects_Master"
 
PARAMETERS=" -avrz --log-file=/tmp/rlog 
--backup-dir=/home/suramya/Preserve -b $SOURCE_DIR $TARGET_DIR "
 
rsync -n --max-delete=$MAX_DELETE --delete $PARAMETERS
e=$?
if test $e = 25; then
    touch /tmp/deletedList
    touch /tmp/TodeleteList	
 
    rsync -n --delete $PARAMETERS |grep delet &gt; /tmp/TodeleteList
 
    printf "The sync program tried to delete more than the allowed no of 
files($MAX_DELETE). \n\nThe following files remain in the delete queue: 
\n\n`cat /tmp/TodeleteList`. \n\nPlease delete the files manually from 
'$TARGET_DIR' to avoid this warning." &gt; /tmp/message
 
    ./sendEmail/sendEmail  -f suramya@suramya.com -t suramya@suramya.com 
-u "Test"  &lt; /tmp/message
 
# Now we sync the remaining files so that we have a synced directory
 
    rsync $PARAMETERS
 
    rm /tmp/TodeleteList
    rm /tmp/message
else
 
# We didn't trip the max delete flag so we go ahead and sync the files
    rsync --max-delete=$MAX_DELETE --delete $PARAMETERS
 
fi
exit $e
</pre>

<p>
In this script, the user will have to manually delete the files in the 
Master directory if the number of deleted files exceed the MAX_DELETE value.
</p>

<p>
I know that the script is not very efficient. I have to run rsync twice, 
first to check if the sync would fail, then we do the actual sync or get 
the list of files that would have been deleted. Is there a way I can do 
this without having to run the command twice?
</p>

<p>
Is there anything else that you think I should change in this to make it 
better?
</p>

<p>
Looking forward to your feedback.
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
  Suramya
</p>

<p>
PS: I use the ./sendEmail/sendEmail to send the email as I found it 
easier to configure for SMTP servers than mail. You can use either one.

Seems to me like running 'rsync' once and then interpreting the results
would make sense.

<p>
<pre class='code'>
#!/bin/sh
 
MAX=3
/usr/bin/rsync --max-delete=$MAX --delete [ ...whatever parameters... ]
if [ "$?" -eq 25 ]
then
	printf "$MAX files deleted, the rest ignored. Next time, we'll poison your puppies.\n"
	# Send mail, whatever...
	exit 1
fi
printf "You got away with deleting my files _this time,_ but I'd watch it if I were you.\n"

Hey Ben,

<p>
True, but I wanted to avoid deleting files if I could. I know we could 
restore them from the backup directory but thats just extra work for the 
person maintaining the system.
</p>

<p>
Plus having a list of files that were supposed to be deleted when more 
than the allowed number was being deleted would let the admin figure out 
if the deletion is to be allowed or not.

<p>
Ah - I'd misunderstood. I thought you wanted to delete no more than $MAX
files, which is what that 'rsync' switch does. From the 'rsync' man
page:
</p>

<pre>
 
 --max-delete=NUM        don’t delete more than NUM files
 
[...]
 
EXIT VALUES
 
[...]
 
       25     The --max-delete limit stopped deletions
</pre>

<p>
I.e., there shouldn't be anything for you to restore: 'rsync' will
actually stop deleting at that number of files.
</p>

<p>
If you don't want to delete anything at all once the user exceeds a
given number of files, then doing it the way you are is reasonable -
or maybe doing a comparison using 'diff -r /dir/source /dir/target' 
would give you what you're looking for.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Plus having a list of files that were supposed to be deleted when more 
&gt; than the allowed number was being deleted would let the admin figure out 
&gt; if the deletion is to be allowed or not.
</pre>

<p>
Either of the above approaches would give you that.
