I need help in finding information regarding how sockets are
established (not how to code them). In other words, I know that
there is a standard procedure followed (SYN,SYN/ACK,ACK) in
getting a device talking with a server.

This is referred to as a "three way handshake."
The "SYN" flags are requests by the TCP stack at one
end of a socket to synchronize themselves to the sequence
numbering for this new sessions.  The ACK flags
acknowlege earlier packets in this session.  Obviously
only the initial packet has no ACK flag, since there are
no previous packets to acknowlege.  Only the second
packet (the first response from a server to a client)
has both the SYN and the ACK bits set.

I am more curious in determining how, where, and who actually
handles this on the Linux server.
</STRONG></P>

The kernel.

As an example - I have inetd looking at port 226 for me that will
start a program that will read from the socket. If this program
terminates (kill,alarm,etc...)  then the device attempts to
re-establish (sends a SYN). Then one of two things happens
depending on how the program was stopped. Either the server never
responds until the device sends a reset or the server sends a
SYN/ACK and then sends a packets saying that it is finished
sending data. My questions are on the level of does RESET reset a
port or a socket, and why would a server send a finish sending
data flag if the device is requesting a connection. I have been
unable to find info about the protocols of communications that
should be taking place. Any help would be appreciated!

I don't really understand what you're asking or what
situation you are trying to describe.  Giving examples
of what you see and the specific diagnostic commands
you're using to gather your data on the problem (ps,
netstat, lsof, etc) would probably help.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, I can take a guess at what you might be seeing.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is also a three way handshake at the termination
of a TCP session.  Either side sends a packet with the
FIN (final) flag set, and waits for the other side to
acknowlege that with another FIN packet.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
After the local process as attempted to close the
socket (and the TCP stack has sent the FIN packet to the
remote system) the process will be listed as being in the
FIN_WAIT stat when you do a 'netstat' command.   Buggy
TCP clients may just close their end of the connection
without completing the three way session termination.  This
seems to be mostly from certain MS Windows FTP clients.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There seems to be no "timeout" for how long a processes
will sit in FIN_WAIT.  When I managed a busy FTP server
farm for McAfee Associates (a shareware company with lots
of MS-DOS and Windows products) I used to see alot of zombies
which were children of FTP daemon processes that were in
FIN_WAIT.  I had a skulker script that would find the
parents of the zombies, check their age and argument list
and summarily kill them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I don't know the details about the TCP RST (reset) process.
I've at the extreme edge of my knowlege of TCP in this
message --- so I can't go into any greater detail on this.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, I've heard that the best sources of information
about TCP protocols are a couple of books.  One would be the
O'Reilly volume by Craig Hunt (the crab book), <em>Understanding
TCP/IP</em> <em>[ Actually, the "crab book" is 
	<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/tcp2/index.html"
	>TCP/IP Network Administration</a>, now in its 2nd edition.
	-- Heather ]</em>,
 the other would be a three volume set by Comer and
Stevens <em><a href="http://www.prenhall.com/allbooks/esm_0132169878.html"
>Internetworking With Tcp/Ip: Principles, Protocols, and Architecture</a></em>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As you've suggested these are written more with the
programmer in mind.  However the O'Reilly book seems to be
more suitable for sysadmins and users (besides being a
paperback, and therefore much less expensive than the three
volume hardcover text books from Prentice Hall).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
One of these days I'll get around to reading that one.
I'd been holding out for one that covered IPv6 in the
hope that IPv6 would be deployed more widely by the time
I got around to learning all the gory details.  However,
it looks like we'll still be dealing with IPv4 (the
current suite of protocols) for the foreseeable future.
