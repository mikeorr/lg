Hi there,
Just want to say thank you for putting this up again. LG #134 dropped
this section and I was so disappointed because I look forward to it
every month. It is fun playing with terms and find out lots of holes
in my knowledge.
Thank you again.

<strong>blush</strong> You are quite welcome! I feel honored that people are actually 
taking part in the puzzle (was not sure if anyone would really take a stab 
at it) and that you would miss it.
</p>

<p>
The reason #134 did not have a geekword was I was in the middle of 
studying for and taking my final exams for the fall semester (I am 
currently an undergraduate at Boston University). There was also something 
about final papers, but the whole month turned into one big blur for me.
</p>

<p>
If you have any input on making the puzzle better, sub-topics of 
FOSS/Linux that you would like to see, etc. then please let me know. I am 
always open to suggestions.
</p>

<p>
Depending on the amount of time I have next month I may try to write a 
15x15 (standard size) grid. However, a puzzle that size would probably be 
a once in a blue moon deal as my schedule tends to be rather tight these 
days.
</p>

<p>
Thank you again and I hope that you continue to enjoy the geekword,
</p>

How exactly are you determining the questions?  Do you have a stock list
of questions you're somehow arbitrarily using each month, or do you have
some other method of working?
</p>

<p>
I've been casually glancing at the crossword, and intrigued by some of
the clues, insofar that they're occasionally hit and miss, but that
could be just me.  (Why so many people use `echo ... | sed | awk` when
awk can do it all is beyond me.
</p>

<p>
Intersting, nevertheless.

<p>
This is more easily explained if I recant my whole process:
(1) Create the grid in a spreadsheet file.
(2) Write the answers into the spreadsheet. This, as you can imagine, is 
the hardest and most time consuming part.
(3) Write the clues based on the answers. Sometimes I will already have a 
clue in mind for an answer, sometimes not.
(4) Check for errors. *shifty eyes*
</p>

<p>
As you can see I am creating all clues and answers fresh for each issue. 
The only "list" I might use is a wordlist when I need to apply regexp to 
my vernacular, but my brain does not want to do so itself. Most of the 
non-software/technical names that you will see in the geekword are a 
result of this; for example, 1D in LG #133. However, I try to limit my 
usage of wordlists to near zero, preferring the classic art and feel of 
writing purely from the brain (many crossword puzzle authors these days 
would call that "insane").

&gt;
</pre>

<p>
I think this is because sed tends to be synonymous with string replacement 
on the command line. I only do it in the puzzle because I want people to 
be made aware of both programs. In the future I will see if I can just use 
both programs elsewhere in the puzzle, allowing more concise clues. 
However, I would not consider using `sed | awk` "wrong", but just a 
different, potentially longer, approach.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for the input,
</p>

<p>
Me, I wonder why people do it in AWK when Perl is available. Although
doing it in assembler would be even better. On the other hand, a Turing
machine using black and white jellybeans would be even more elegant. Or
perhaps everyone should just be forced to use Boole's pivoting wooden
slats - choice and preference be damned, there's only one right way to
do it!
</p>

<p>
...or not. I happen to like living in a world where there are multiple
paths to accomplishing a positive result.
