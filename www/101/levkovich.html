<h1>Home Folder Server For Windows Clients</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/levkovich.html">Avinoam Levkovich</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>
One of the strategies to protect the data on user's personal computer is
using a Home-Folders Server. This server contains folders for each user
where the user can save his precious data, the server is backed up every
night. At login, the Home-Folders Share (which contains your home folder)
is mounted on the local machine, and the user can access it like any other
local drive.

<p>
Home-Folders Server has a big overhead for the IT staff. Managing the
ownership, shares, quota, permissions, and the never ending changes isn't
one of the most pleasant tasks for any Sys-Admin.

<p>
The story begins when my organization old Home-Folders Server started
showing signs of retirement wishes, we decided that it is time to build a new
Home-Folders server. We started looking for a solution that will take the
management overhead from the IT stuff, since our budget was low we wanted
cheap but reliable system. Naturally, we started thinking about building a
Linux server. We wanted this system to perform the following tasks:

<b>
<ol>
<li>This system will be integrated into the organization's existing Win-2K
active directory infrastructure.

<li>
The system should function automatically. When we add a new user to the
domain, the system will automatically create his home folder, grant the
appropriate permissions and configure the user's quota.

<li>
We will map the home-folder by using login scripts (<a href="http://www.kixtart.org/">KIX</a>).

<li> The System will monitor the Server RAID-System, when the RAID is out of
sync (damaged disk, Bad Controller, etc.) the script send a warning e-mail
to the IT staff.
</ol>
</b>

<p>
Since our budget was low, we decided to save money and still get good
performance by using a new desktop PC (P4 1.6GHZ, 1GB RAM). To make the
system reliable we decided to use four HDs (IDE, 120GB each) configured as
RAID-5, for the Home-Folders partition. All other system partitions will use
two HD (IDE, 12GB each) with RAID-1 (mirror). To get the extra IDE
controllers I used PROMISE 133TX2, IDE Card (PCI), which works great with
RedHat.

<h2>The Home-Folder System Installation and Configuration</h2>

<p>
After installing Linux (we used Redhat) and configuring the RAID system,
take the following steps to finish the configuration of the Home-Folders
Server:

<ol>
<li>Install and configure the Samba server, share the Home-Folders partition
with read/write permission (we will limit the access to the users' folders
by using the system permissions.)

<li> Configure Winbind. Winbind is part of the Samba package which makes
the integration to the windows domain easy.

<br> By using Winbind, Windows Users can access the Linux server using their
logon credentials. Winbind verifies the user with the domain controller like
any other Windows server. You can find more info on Winbind installation in
this article : <a
href="http://us2.samba.org/samba/docs/man/winbindd.8.html">http://us2.samba.org/samba/docs/man/winbindd.8.html</a>
<br>
After installing Winbind, check its functionality by running the command:

<pre>
# getent passwd
</pre>

The output should be the list of users in the domain. If you do not receive
this output, check your Winbind configuration.

<li>  Configure quota support for the Home-Folders partition. You can find
more info about quota configuration here:
<a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Quota.html">http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Quota.html</a>

<br>
Next, plan and decide how much space you wish to grant to each user, create a
template user and assign a quota equal to the amount of space you decided.
Later on we will use this user as a quota template.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> this step is optional and only required if you want to use the quota
system.
</ol>

<h2>Home-Folders Creator Script</h2>

The following script is the heart of the system, the script retrieves the
domain users list from the domain controller server into a file and removes
all the unneeded data from the list. At this stage the system verifies that
each user in this list owns a home-folder. If the user already has a
home-folder the system write the char "." to the stdout and moves on, if
the user is a new user and he still doesn't have a home-folder, the system
will create a folder (the folder name will be the same as the username),
grant ownership to the user, and apply the quota for this folder by copying
the quota from the template quota user to this new user.

<p>
The system will log the new users home-folder creation to the system log file
(/var/log/messages).

<p>
The Home-Folders creator script can be found <a
href="misc/levkovich/home-folders.bash.txt"><b>here</b></a>.

You need to change the following parameters to reflect your server configuration:

<p>
<b>HOME_FOLDERS_PATH</b> - Assign the path to the Home-Folders
Directory/Partition, it is essential to put the character "/" at the end of
the path (e.g. /home/).

<p>
<b>SEPERATOR</b> - Assign the Winbind separator as it configured in the smb.conf
file.

<p>
<b>TEMP_USER</b> - (OPTIONAL) if you want to use quota, you should uncomment this
variable and Assign the username you created to act as a quota template. if
so please remember to uncomment the line "edquota -p $TEMP_USER $DOMAIN$SEPERATOR$Folder_Name"

<h2>The RAID system watchdog script</h2>

<p>
The following script creates an endless loop that check the RAID system
every 5 minutes, if the RAID is out of sync (damaged disk, Bad Controller
etc..) the script will send an e-mail to a predefine mail address ( change
the MAIL variable to reflect your mail address).

<p>
you can use this script as an independent RAID WatchDog for your other
RAID-Systems.

<p>
In order to start this script automatically after reboot, you can add the
path to the script to your rc.local file.

The script can be found <a
href="misc/levkovich/watchdog.bash.txt"><b>here</b></a>.

<p>

<h2>Make the system function automatically</h2>

<p>
To automate the system you should execute the Home-Folders creator script
as root at predefined intervals. By adding the following line to the root's cron
jobs (using "crontab -e"), the Home-Folders script will execute every hour.
(Change the script path to match your configuration.)

<pre>
*/59 * * * * /etc/Home-Folders-creator.sh
</pre>

<h2>Mapping the Home-Folder to the users during the logon process</h2>

<p>
By using a simple logon scripts system (I use <a
href="http://www.kixtart.org/">KIX</a>) you can map the Home-Folder Samba
share during the user login process.
