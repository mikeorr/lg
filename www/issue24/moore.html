<P>Applixware is is an excellent "office suite"
that may open doors to wider use of Linux.

<P>Applixware features a word processor, a spreadsheet, a presentation
graphics tool, a drawing tool, an e-mail client, database
connectivity and an object-oriented application builder. For some
time, this professional set of programs has been available for other
Unix platforms, including HP-UX, Solaris, AIX and Digital Unix,
and now Applixware is available for Intel-compatible Linux machines and Microsoft
Windows; at the time of this writing, the NT version is out and the 95
version is in beta testing.

<P><CENTER><B>An Applixware On-Line Book</B></CENTER>

<P>If you install Applixware on your system, you'll notice an impact
on system resources. A complete installation with the included Red Hat
RPM files requires 210MB--if that's more than you have available,
you can make a partial installation from a live,
"unpacked" directory on the CD-ROM. In fact, Applixware
can be launched and used directly from the CD-ROM, though this
makes program operation a little leisurely. I was
using Red Hat Linux 4.0 when I reviewed Applixware,
but the software should work fine on other
distributions, and installation instructions are
included.

<P>The CD speed may not seem bad if you're using a 486DX25, on which
Applixware is fast enough to be usable, but probably too slow for a
production environment; I found my meager CPU power to be a real
problem only when I started using the graphics tools.

<P>This is not an application for low-memory systems. As
cheap as RAM is today, this shouldn't be too painful a state to
rectify. With 16MB of RAM, the word processor was snappy enough with
X and the Afterstep window manager running, but having much else
loaded caused so much paging of virtual memory I needed something to
read while waiting.

<P><CENTER><B>Applix Words</B></CENTER>


<P>Not much reading material comes with Applix--at least, not on
paper. Back when it was known as Asterix and also in version 3.x of
Applix, there was a manual for each module, but either with the Linux
version or with the later releases, virtually all documentation is in
the "On-Line Books". Use the on-line tutorials if you're
new to the system, or the on-line help if you just need a reference.

<P><I>Applix Words</I> is a full-featured word processor with
everything you'd expect to find in a modern product. That is, unless
you're looking to do something which really should be done
using desktop publishing software. By the way, one thing you
never want to do with it is embed, oh, 80 or so large,
256-color GIFs in a single document--at somewhere around 8MB,
application behavior gets a bit wacky. Linking is much,
much better.

<P><I>Words</I> gives you tables, borders, shading, embedded equations and
calculations, conditional text and cross-referencing, international
dictionaries, thesauri and a multi-font, multi-size WYSIWYG
display. You can rely on multiple undo and redo, and when you're done,
you can save PostScript and PCL printer files or send them directly to
a networked printer.

<P><CENTER><B>Applix Graphics</B></CENTER>

<P>HTML is easy with the Applix HTML authoring tool. Documents can be
imported from Applix or another popular word processor using one of
the format filters or created from scratch with the same ease as a
word processing document. Clip art, GIFs and linked or embedded
Applix Graphics images are converted seamlessly. <I>Applix
Spreadsheets</I> documents and queries from the database interface
application, <I>Data</I>, can be included, too. Tables, colors, and
more than 25 standard HTML styles are all under your control.

<P><I>Applix Graphics</I> is a terrific drawing and presentation graphics
tool. At your disposal are user-definable fill patterns, various
brush styles, shearing, drop shadows, incremental zoom, rotating,
scaling, color pixel editing and text wrapping, to name a few. Grid
snap, guide lines, rulers, and coordinates help create precise and
complex drawings quickly. I found graphics as easy to
produce with <I>Graphics</I> as with <I>Powerpoint</I>.

<P>The good news continues with <I>Applix Spreadsheets</I> with
calculation-based attributes, 3D charts, named views and dynamic
links to objects in other Applixware applications. When your linked
data from elsewhere changes, it is automatically updated in your
spreadsheet. There are live links to a relational
database through <I>Applix Data</I>, goal seeking, drag-and-drop,
projection tables and background recalculation. You can import those
old Lotus 1-2-3 and Excel spreadsheets, too.

<P>You might not think you need another mail client, but check out
<I>Applix Mail</I>. When you receive mail, a dialog box pops up with
the sender name and subject, giving you the options "Read
Now", "Read Later", and "Help". You can
attach Applix files to your mail messages and upon receipt, launch
the appropriate Applix tool for viewing. Mail can be marked
"Urgent", marked with a "Reply by" date, and
also sent by "certified" mail, giving you a receipt when the
recipient has read the mail. Of course you can "Cc" and
"Bcc" people. You also get shared mail folders, automatic
conversion of messages and documents to your preferences, encryption,
and mail filtering based on rules you specify.

<P><I>Applix Data</I> connects Applixware applications to SQL databases
like Informix, Oracle, Ingres, and Sybase, seamlessly querying data
from one or more tables, selecting information with query conditions,
and performing advanced queries and joins. Rows can be edited,
inserted, and deleted. A live link in your document to the database
means up-to-date data. <I>Data</I> provides a lot of capability when
teamed with ELF and <I>Builder</I>.

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="./gx/moore/0202f4.gif"></CENTER> 
<P><CENTER><B>Applix Builder</B></CENTER>

<P>The Extension Language Facility (ELF) is an interpreted language with
which users can build and deploy applications, front-ends to
applications, automate tasks and connect to databases and other
external sources of data. The Applix user interfaces are built with
ELF and ELF macros can be used to automate tasks in any of the
Applixware applications. Some capabilities include: TCP/IP socket
interfacing, remote procedure calls, interactive debugging, many
built-in macros, string manipulation, and arithmetic and Boolean
operators.

<P><I>Builder</I> is object oriented and gives you access to external data
sources as well as the capabilities of the Applixware application
suite for use in your custom applications. Also, full access to ELF
macros and functions, external objects, shared classes, RPC and shared
library support. Plus, the applications you develop in <I>Builder</I>
on one platform are portable to Applixware on other platforms without
modification.

<P>Applixware is a terrific package. When I heard it was available for
Linux, I knew I could let go of Microsoft Office (and MS Windows) forever.
