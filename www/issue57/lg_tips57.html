Dear Editor,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've got another 2cent tip for the Linux Gazette.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Many people have problems with the configuration of sendmail.
As far as I have learned about it yet, you can use the file genericstable in
the folder <TT>/etc/mail</TT> (or where your sendmail config files are)
to map local email adresses to email adresses on other servers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
#format of the file:
<BR>#&lt;local email adress&gt; &lt;real email adress&gt;
<BR>marndt@jerry.aknet.de  matthiasarndt@gmx.net
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
My file looks like the one above:
all email written under my local account (marndt) appears to come from my
Internet email.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A nice feature in sendmail..... and it makes things easier to set.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
hope this one helps, Matthias

Both will 2-up output from netscape.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The only difference is in size of the output. In the former, the
pages are 50% as large as the original, whereas in the latter the
pages are 70% as large. I find the larger print (70% scaling) more
readable than the 50% one, but your mileage may vary.

Dos files have &lt;CR&gt; &lt;LF&gt; at endlines,
Mac files have &lt;CR&gt; at endlines,
Unix files simply have &lt;LF&gt; at endlines.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
So who cares? Vim automagically understands any file upon loading. But...
You're using UNIX. When you have to send a colleague a text file (and they
have a mac or Windows box), first issue the following command...
:set fileformat=x
where "x" can be "mac" or "dos".
then save the file.

There are no "256"s in valid IP addresses.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
IP addresses are 32 bits, and are written in 4 octets of 8-bit numbers
expressed in decimal form. The biggest possible 8-bit number is 255,
which is 2^7 + 2^6
+ ... + 2^1 + 2^0.

A good explanation of IP addresses is in the Linux Network
Administrator's Guide, available in your favorite Linux distribution or
from linuxdoc.org.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You have gone way overboard to create a convoluted explanation where a
simple one would do.
There ARE 256 possibilities for an eight bit number. Not all are 'valid'
for an IP address, but that is another question. The reason the highest
number is 255 is because the lowest is <TT>-0-</TT> (ZERO), not <TT>-1-</TT> (ONE). When
you start counting with zero, the amount of numbers counted is one more
than the number reached. SO, you could do the 2^7+2^6+... bit, or you
could reach the same valid answer with a simpler 2^8-1.

Dennis,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Somehow, while flailing about in a kernel upgrade, I managed
to corrupt the boot.p? file.  After 2 days of struggling and
8 hours of searching, I was finally able to correct the
odious "hangs at LI" problem only by booting from a Windows
95 diskette and using 'fdisk <TT>/mbr</TT>' and then booting from a
linux diskette and running 'lilo'.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the meantime I read through dozens of posts on the
subject and worked all kinds of strong ju-ju:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
<TT>-I</TT> used 'linear'
<TT>-I</TT> set the BIOS to 'AUTO' and then back to 'LBA',
<TT>-I</TT> put 'disk=/dev/hda &lt;tab&gt; bios=0x81' in my lilo.conf
<TT>-I</TT> ran linux 'fdisk' and rewrote the partition info
<TT>-on</TT> and on and on.
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I had seen the '<TT>/mbr</TT>' fix earlier, but discounted it because
the instructions didn't mention that it could be used even
if you're <EM>not</EM> dual-booting.  I finally found the tiny bit

Hello there,
I allready read in an earlier posting, that somebody also had problems
with memory holes. I have a compaq proliant 2500 with 256 MB and it only
reads the first 16 MB. If you know alittle about linux you proberbly
would say add a kernel parameter with the amount of RAM and the job is
done. But this doesn't work, the machine works fine for half an hour and
later when the memory use increases the machine trips over the hole and
crashes.

My <A HREF="http://www.caldera.com/">Caldera</A> 2.4 installation is going to be used to test (all bash

At present I can send a test email to <A HREF="mailto:bfindlay@mydomain.com"
	>bfindlay@mydomain.com</A> using the
text based mail program.    When I view the
<tt>/var/log/mail</tt>
file I see that sendmail has correctly sent this mail on to the
Microsoft Exchange Server at 10.0.0.2.    I then want to use fetchmail
to bring the mail back to my test box (I want to ultimately script the
whole test so I need to stick with text based programs).

<em><p>This is an antispam feature.  If a machine's number does not
resolve in what is called "reverse DNS" and thus map to a name, it may
not be a real host on the internet at all, so Exchange is ignoring the
mail.  Lots of companies have hosts that they don't want the whole
world to know about, though they might want their inside servers to 
know them this way - for this, use an inside DNS server that contains
more information for your zone than the one outsiders are allowed to
see.  It's often called "split DNS" because the early implementations
of it involved hacking on the DNS software a bit.<p>

<p>Or, much easier, you could send your test mail from a host which
really reverse resolves correctly. -- Heather</p></em>

<!-- sig -->

<em><p>First apply the mask.  The idea is that the mask is a binary number
	that results from having 1's all the way down to a certain point.
	If it's a normal class A, B, or C, it's easy - everywhere that the 
	mask says 255, use the number from the IP address.  Where it says
	0, no bits are allowed to leak through, so use 0.
</p><p>
	The result is your network value.  Your gateway is often the
	next address (1 greater than the network number).  However you
	should check - some places swap broadcast and gateway (the
	broadcast is usually the highest legal address in the range).

Get hold of lftp. (I happen to be running lftp-2.2.4-2mdk) It's a
great improvement over regular ftp. But note that the regular ftp
client would also solve your problem. The reget command will fetch a
file from where a current version was left off. As far as what the
RFC provides, the only thing that I am aware of that the regular ftp
client does not provide is the ability to transfer a file from one
remote machine to another remote machine.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
But once you use lftp you'll never go back. It uses the readline
library, it does filename completion, it will background transfers,
plus a lot more.

I use ncftp.  It automatically tries to recover the partial download

<p><em>The point here, is a solution for problems that look like it
	may be a winmodem, but it's not. -- Heather</em></p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
One common problem with Modems when migrating to Linux is IRQ conflicts.
Many ISA Network Cards default to IRQ3, commonly used by the modem.  Under
DOS/Windows, this shows up as a non-working Network card, or may be overcome
by a plug-and-play configuration utility for the network card.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Under Linux, the Network card comes up first, and it's the modem that won't
work.  This can be very frustrating for a new user, since "everything works
fine under Windows", and nothing indicates what the problem is with the
modem (usually Linux utilities will just report that it's "busy").
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Make sure that the Modem and NIC are hard-configured or at least have their
ROM permanently set to different IRQ's, and the light will begin to dawn.

Just read a reply about a true modem. I've been searching for one ever since
a friend mentioned it to me. He has an ISA True modem. And wouldn't you know
it mine is not. It's a PCI and so far no luck finding a PCI True modem. Any
ideas on where I might score one?

<p>There's a HOWTO on Winmodems!!!

 --Mike</p>
<p>All the thing says is, "buggy proprietary drivers exist for _two_ modems. 
   Any others, you're SOL." -- Ben</p>
<em><p>
That's less than exciting news; there's better and _far_ more informative info at <A HREF="http://www.linmodems.org"

	>http://www.o2.net/~gromitkc/winmodem.html</A> <TT>-</TT> and they provide links to quite a bit of very creative software that lets you get a number of other uses out of winmodems (e.g., DTMF enc/decoder).
--Ben
</p></em>
<em><p>Okay, so maybe it should have been an Answer Gang thread, but it
	is rather short.  The Gromitkz site has an excellent set of guides
	about buying real modems in chain stores. It appears there may
	be support for 3 of these incomplete modems now, but it remains
	to be seen if any of them will port their efforts to the 2.4
        kernel. 
</p><p> 
	The state of the art in forcing Lucent's modems to work is
	<ul><li>fetch a raw-patched version of their module which 
		doesn't steal "register_serial" and "unregister_serial"
		(you can use theirs straight, if you don't use other
		serial gadgets at all)
	<li>use the 2.2.14 version of the ppp support module even if you're 
		in a later kernel. That will require also forcing the
		underlying slhc.o to load to make a complete ppp stack.

One question. In "file1", do you specify the entire pathname to "file2" in
order to run it? The reason that I ask is the quite often "cron" does not
have the PATH that you expect. This generally results in a "file not found"

The most likely reason is that the path is different or something else in the
environment. Stick an env command in File1. The output should be sent to you by
email from the cron job. Compare it to the env when you run File1 yourself. I
usually write full paths in cron scripts for this reason.

<P> You can use several programs to translate microsoft word "doc" files
to some other format. There is word2x (which works for word 6) or
mswordview (which work for MS Word Version 8, i.e. Office97). Or, you
can download the free version of WordPerfect which can read many Word
files. Another option is to download abiword, which can read
microsoft word files. I have automatically configured pine to call
abiword on ms word files by editing /home/matt/.mailcap and having
this line in it:

<P> Dear Mr. Train,

<P> This advice may be quite late (your original message
is nearly a month old), but I hope you haven't had any
problems...

<P> Typically, Windows overwrites the master boot record
when it is installed, and I've had worse things happen
(like the Windows installer corrupting the partition
table). The standard advice is to install Windows
before installing other operating systems. It sounds
like this isn't an option for you, but please be aware
that by installing Windows on top of Linux you're
likely to have frightening (or infuriating, if you
prefer) problems which may or may not require
re-installing Linux and restoring all your user data.

<P> Best of luck, in any case!

<P> Dear Mr. Benfell,

<P> Can't help you with POP over SSH, but can perhaps
explain why you keep getting prompted for passwords
(and why you should be *happy* about it:). 

<P> If you're not prompted to enter a password to
authenticate a connection, it's because your password
is stored on a machine somewhere, often as plain text.
In other words, storing your password is like writing
your PIN on your ATM card. If you care about privacy
enough to encrypt network transmissions with SSH (and
you should, with good reason), you probably also care
enough not to leave your password written on a scrap
of paper next to your computer, or sitting unencrypted
on a hard drive (possibly on a publically-accessible
server, or on your laptop, where a thief could get
access to it by booting with a rescue disk, thereby
granting themselves root). 

<P> Hope that makes the password annoyance more tolerable,
and sorry I can't help you with POP/SSH.


<BR>David Benfell &lt;<A HREF="mailto:benfell@greybeard95a.com">benfell@greybeard95a.com</A>&gt; replies:

This problem was solved a long time ago.  And I'm well aware of the
security issues.

<P> What you can do is run ssh-keygen on each machine that you want to be
able to communicate in this way. This produces two files: identity and
identity.pub. identity.pub from each machine must be copied into the
authorized_keys file of each of the others.

<P> The authorized_keys file can hold multiple keys. Each key takes one
line. So you copy the identity.pub file from each machine with
commands something like:

<PRE>
ssh-keygen
 scp .ssh/identity.pub user@remote-machine-1:.ssh/1.identity.pub
 cat .ssh/1.identity.pub &gt;&gt; .ssh/authorized_keys
</PRE>

<P> Remember that for this to work, each machine must have a copy of the
other machines' keys. So, you then log in to the remote machine and do
something similar:

<PRE>
ssh user@remote-machine-1
(enter the password on the remote machine)
ssh-keygen
scp .ssh/identity.pub user@local-machine:.ssh/1.identity.pub
cat .ssh/1.identity.pub &gt;&gt; .ssh/authorized_keys
</PRE>

<P> Why bother?

<P> So you won't have to type the password every five minutes for every
POP account you're accessing this way.  I have four e-mail accounts
and collect several hundred e-mails per day.  So I prefer to leave
fetchmail more or less continuously running.

<P> I used to do this with fetchmail's daemon mode.  But for pop via ssh,
this won't work.

<P> So I need to change my .fetchmailrc so it looks something like this
(for only one e-mail account):

<PRE>
 defaults
 protocol POP3
 is localuser here
 fetchall
 forcecr
poll remote.server.org port 11110 via localhost user username pass ********
 preconnect "ssh -C -f username@remote.server.org -L 11110:remote.server.org:110 sleep 5"
</PRE>

<P> It needs the password in the .fetchmailrc file but if you have a
reasonably secure system, this isn't a tremendous worry.  .fetchmailrc
cannot be world-readable (fetchmail will reject it if it is).  I'm not
that worried about people gaining access to my system as long as they
can't sniff the password in plain text off the internet (which they
can do with normal POP usage, and in my case, it was getting
transmitted every five minutes, so the bad guy wouldn't even have to
have been terribly patient).

<P> The password still has to be fed to the pop daemon, but this way, it
isn't crossing the Internet in clear text for feeding.

<P> Next, create a script like:

<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
ssh-add
while true; do fetchmail; sleep 5m; done
</PRE>

<P> I call mine "getmail".

<P> Then I can do:

<P> ssh-agent getmail

<P> It asks me for the passphrase once, then uses the keys to authenticate
my access to the remote systems.

RedHat (In particulay, it's my chosen Distro)

<P> Use FDISK (Windows version is fine) to create a partition LESS than the full
drive (Or two hard drives) - leave whatever you need for Linux EMPTY...
(Partition Magic to shrink the partition is fine as well) and install
Win9x/NT/2k

<P> Then, boot up with yer RedHat CD/Floppy, and install into the empty area...
The LILo config will see the Windows install, and add it to LILO for you..
(Install LILO into the MBR - overwriting the DOS MBR) and voila, Dual Boot -

Tue, 8 Aug 2000 15:07:50 -0500
<BR>From: Jonathan Hutchins &lt;<A HREF="mailto:hutchins@opus1.com">hutchins@opus1.com</A>&gt;

<P> You might be able to get a good idea of how to do this by studying the
"Amateur Radio" guides for Linux.

<P> In any case, I don't think it can be done with one CB radio, but it could be
done with two (at each end).

<P> Please note that doing this may be ILLEGAL.  It also violates the FCC rule
that requires you to include your license number in each transmission.

<P> One problem with this is that while telephony and modems are "full duplex",
which means that both ends can both speak and listen at the same time, CB's
are "half duplex", which means when one is "talking", the other must be
"listening".

<P> First, you have to separate the "send" and "receive" or "mic" and "earpiece"
channels.  In a telephone, this is accomplished by having both mic and
speaker "live", separated by a biasing transformer so that "your" mic is
"louder" on the output to the phone line, and "their" mic is louder on
"your" earphone.  For CB purposes this would be easiest to accomplish with a
modem that was set up for an acoustic adapter - one that you place the
telephone receiver in so that it doesn't actually plug in to the phone but
produces the equivalent tones through a speaker held next to the headset mic
and vice versa.

<P> The send output (or mic output for the coupler) goes to the mic in on one
CB, set to say Channel 10, with the Transmit switch strapped "On".  At the
other end, a CB would be set to listen to Ch. 10, with the output of the
speaker or headphone jack going to the earpice or receive circuit.  Repeat
the process in the other direction on channel 20.

<P> You now have monopolized two CB channels for miles around with earsplitting
noise which will bleed across adjacent channels (hence the large interval
between send and receive), but you may have reached something close enough
to a telephone connection that doing ATH1 on one end and ATA on the other
may get you a connection.

<P> If you had a couple of modems capable of doing a synchronous connection, it
wouldn't be too hard to wire something up for single-channel use, but it
would involve doing some interesting coupling between the sync signal or
DSR/DTR pair and the "Send" switch.

<P> On the other hand, there are lots of possible problems here.  How do you get
that "send" output isolated if you don't have an acoustic coupler?  Can you
be sure that the modems will sync?  What do you say to the guy from the FCC
who says he's traced the signal that's jamming everybody's CB's to your
rooftop?  And it's very likely you can't do more than 2,400 baud because of
the limited quality of the connection.

<P> You will find that unless you're a  real handy electronics hacker who knows
the guts of a telephone pretty well, this will be difficult enough that
you'll want to buy the pieces ready made, which means buying the Amateur
Radio gear if you can; which still means adapting it, and which means
spending real money.  Unless your time is pretty worthless, you and your
boss would probably be better off purchasing a wireless networking solution
from an existing vendor.

This is a new version of the bash based tree utility which was published in the
Linux Gazette about 2 years ago.  I've added the feature to display the files
inside the directories.  This tool displays the whole directory tree below the
PWD. You may supply an alternate starting directory on the command line.
This is a bash script so it is not very fast.
But obviously, it does its job.

<P> <A HREF="misc/tips/tree.sh.txt">tree</A>

<P>
To use the script, just cut and paste the code to your favourite editor.  Call
it tree and make the script executable using <STRONG>chmod u+x</STRONG>.  I
suggest copying it to <STRONG>/usr/local/bin</STRONG> as root and do a
<STRONG>chmod +x</STRONG> on it to make it available to all users on your
system.  The output goes straight to the <STRONG>stdout</STRONG>. This means
you can use I/O redirection to capture the resulting tree to a file.

<P> As on all of my releases of software for Linux, the <STRONG>GNU General
