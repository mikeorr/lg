<P> <A HREF="http://www.lutelinux.com">LuteLinux</A> at the Technical
Certification Expo 2000 revealed not only their new LuteLinux Lite software,
but also their training and certification plans .  In addition to offering
certification for various levels from user to specialist, LuteLinux will
also offer Trainer Certification. This will include training on teaching and
public speaking, classroom techniques for beginner to advanced users, as well
as common classroom scenarios and bridging the gap between the classroom
environment to the real world. Their certification not only qualifies you as a
LuteLinux trainer, but many of the techniques and lessons are easily
transferable to other training environments.

<P> LuteLinux is taking a new approach to certification.  They recognize that
multiple choice and even most simulation environments only provide for one
right answer, and most examinations don't respond to non-standard approaches
to a problem: something that is required on a daily basis in the real world.
LuteLinux is fixing that explains Mr. Daunheimer,  "our on-line LuteLinux
simulation responds to multiple approaches to a problem.  There is more than
one answer to the questions, just as there is more than one way to solve a
problem in the real world. There will be an ongoing assessment of responses
during the examination, and the questions which are presented are chosen by
a system that takes into account your last response."  Although it's easy to
talk about results, at LuteLinux they guarantee them. If any client is not
satisfied with their training, or feels unprepared to apply new skills on
the job, they will retrain them - for free. Examinations will be available
both in-house at one of their training centers, and on-line via their web
site.

<P> May 31st., 2000. Mexico City, Mexico. Bufete Consultor de

the launch of the new web site entitled 
<A HREF="http://gaceta.piensa.com"><EM>La Gaceta de Linux</EM></A> as
a Spanish version of the very well known electronic
magazine <EM>Linux Gazette</EM>, effective this June 1st.

<P> "We are searching for volunteers to enrich and enhance La
Gaceta de Linux in every aspect."; said Monique Ollivier,
 image and content managing editor of
the Spanish edition, "in first place, we need lots of support to
translate, in a monthly basis, the original articles in foreign
languages; mostly English; to ours, and maybe even more
important, we want <EM>La Gaceta de Linux</EM> to be an open forum to
whomever wants to write about Linux or just publish their work."

<P> "After the site launch, we will add more features and services to
<EM>La Gaceta de Linux</EM>, providing special benefits to the ones that
contribute to the site with a bit of their time as well as additional
services to the general public."

de Mexico, S.A. de C.V., CEO and General Director: "We want all this free and
open technologies and the broad experience that the global Linux community has
acquired, to be leveraged at the maximum by all those Spanish speaking
individuals and companies that across the globe."

<P> "Having a tool like <EM>La Gaceta de Linux</EM> and, of course, the web,
allows us to very efficiently promote Linux and all related technologies to be
used in real life industry, businesses and corporate use; for instance; in
Latin America, most of small to medium sized businesses do require IT services
and systems that really do work, and work well but, not at the very high cost
of the current "systems" that are well known to all company owners ... It is
our experience that Linux is an excellent alternative."

<P> "Another very important readers and users group for <EM>La Gaceta
de Linux</EM> is the academic one. That's where tomorrow's IT
people are and, we have to let them know about Linux and
what this new technology can provide. Educating people at
every level is the key and that is the most important goal of La
Gaceta de Linux."

<H4>The Editor asked Kaivo's PR man Anthony Benedetti
&lt;<A HREF="mailto:abenedetti@johnstonwells.com">abenedetti@johnstonwells.com</A>&gt;
how Kaivo is different from Cosource and SourceXchange, and he replied:</H4>

<P> While Cosource, SourceXchange and Kaivo all have common elements, Kaivo's focus and its audience are different from the others.  Both Cosource and SourceXchange excel at helping manage the development process of custom Open Source applications by bringing project managers and development talent together.

<P> Kaivo, on the other hand, is about delivering the full world of Open Source into a corporate setting.  Our end-user audience, IT executives, is assumed to be not as hands-on technical as the primary audience of the other sites. 

<P> We believe that our market has a need to understand what Open Source solutions exist (in contrast to proprietary models) and desires a simplified channel in which to procure those solutions.  So ours is a market place for software, hardware, services and solutions.  Kaivo is also designed as an educational site.

<P> In many ways, Cosource, SourceXchange and Kaivo are complementary.

<P> Concord, Mass., June 1, 2000 - API, 
(<A HREF="http://www.alpha-processor.com">Alpha Processor, Inc.</A>), announced
the UP1100, the latest addition to its Ultimate Performance Series
motherboards.  The UP1100 offers Alpha Linux developers a complete,
cost-efficient, entry-level Alpha board for Beowulf clusters, Web servers,
development systems and rendering solutions.

<P> API's high I/O and memory bandwidth technology, combined with the
UP1100's new features and the open source Linux software, enables
system integrators to build high-performance, scalable and reliable
systems.  The low profile UP1100 features the Alpha 21264 processor on
the UP1100 motherboard, allowing the overall cost of systems to be
reduced.  This provides research institutions, computer graphics
companies and enterprises a cost-effective system for powering
compute-heavy applications. 


<P> Doubling disk I/O performance over the UP1000, the UP1100 uni-processor
planar design includes on-board integrated sound and Ethernet on a
standard ATX form factor, providing a more robust Alpha solution for
developers.  The on-board Ethernet and sound preserves maximum
configurability of system PCI I/O slots, simplifies cluster configuring
and lowers the overall solution cost.


<P> The UP1100 will begin shipping in July.
