<p><strong>From Rafael on 10 May 1998</strong></p>

<p><strong>
Thanks Denis for your letter to DELL.

<br><br>
I bought some Dell stocks this year. Not much but that puts me in an
awkward situation. Dell is doing well but it realy bothered me that they
officialy issued that statement about Linux.

	As a shareholder, even of only a few shares, your message
	will probably get far more attention than mine.

<br><br>
	I would love to see your letter to them, expressing your 
	concerns both as a customer <strong>and</strong> as a stockholder.

I wonder if we could find other investors, Linux users, admins perhaps and
put a little pressure from that position. That would be even more
effective if we do it openly on the web.

	I agree.  You want to be even more "positive" in your tone
	since you actually have a financial stake in their future.

<br><br>
	You want to emphasize how big a market you believe the 
	Linux community to be --- point out that the first major
	company to offer Linux will probably remain at the top
	of that market for a long time, etc.

I know that Dell signed a letter with other CEO's in support of MS. What a
bummer.

</strong></p>
<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" width="50" height="28" alt="(!)"
align="left" border="0">
	I personally can understand their official statements of support.
	From an official standpoint they claim that MS places no 
	contractual restrictions on their choice of software bundles.

<br><br>
	We can presume that there are veiled, subtle "issues" which
	suggest that any support for alternatives might result in
	unusual delays and backlogs or Dell's order fulfillment and
	possibly delays in the negotiation of new contracts and terms
	for future versions of MS products.  It doesn't take much of
	this from a key supplier or customer (and MS probably does
	buy a large number of Dell workstations) to have a chilling
	effect.

<br><br>
	Unfortunately none of those assertions are likely to be
	revealed in court --- and there's simply too much "plausible
	deniability" for them to have any effect in any event.

<br><br>
	I'm not sure I can characterize it as a "bummer" --- since
	it is so utterly predictable.

<br><br>
	What we want to do is to recast Linux as an "opportunity" for
	a "win-win" situation for Dell <strong>and</strong> MS.  I think 
	we can do this by pointing out that Dell offering "fine print" 
	alternatives (No OS included, and Linux) will give the 
	<strong>appearance</strong> of greater competition in the marketplace.

<br><br>
	My plan is to outline this strategy to MS execs (I have a 
	mole).  Convince them that purely cosmetic notes in the
	marketing materials from Compaq will get the DoJ off their
	back and give them the ammo, in the arena of public opinion,
	to say:  "Look!  People have choices, and they still pick us
	almost all the time.  The free market is working."

<br><br>
	(This is bound to be more effective for them than that 
	pathetic attempt to fabricate a "ground swell of grassroots
	support" --- as was reported by the L.A. Times recently).

<p><strong>From Khimenko Victor on 10 May 1998</strong></p>

<p><strong>
You must know this already but just in case: in 
<a href="http://linuxwww.db.erau.edu/mail_archives/linux-kernel/"
	>linux-kernel</a> list there are quite a few questions like this:

	While I do read lkern -- I  queue up the digests for
	a week or so at a time and binge on them -- so I hadn't
	noticed these, yet.

	<br>I installed linux kernel 2.1.89 on a Dell with 2 Pentium Pros.  
	But now "<tt>ps</tt>" fails?! Says "No processes available". 
	During boot, I get error messages about various demons [sendmail, 
	syslog...]  trying to start, and this message gets printed for each 
	demon.  I think the demons are actually running, because [eg] if I 
	try to start syslog, it tells me that an instance is running.

	<br><br>
	I looked in <tt>/proc</tt>, and things seem ok. Eg 
	"<tt>cat /proc/cpuinfo</tt>" works, and shows both cpus.

	<br><br>
	Before this, I had already successfully installed 2.1.89 on an
	identically configured machine. ps worked there. And I'd also 
	installed 2.1.89 on 3 Dells, containing 4 cpus each.

	<br><br>
	Any suggestions?

	<br>I tried your io_apic.c fix on an Intel Alder 
	4x PPRO system (same motherboard,etc. as DELL PE-6100) and it had 
	no effect: boot dies after first line about Uncompressing... 
	OK booting...

	<br><br>
	I posted the log of a boot of 2.1.88 on the Alder earlier. Is there
	anything else I can tell you? By the way, 2.1.88 + aic7xxx 5.0.8 patch
	is VERY stable on these systems, and nothing else is right now.
	Also, I compiled 2.196 for a DELL 4200 (2x Pentium II) and it runs
	fine.

	<br><dl><dd><em>Hi,
	<br><br> 
	there's been some talk recently about patching 2.1.9x to support 
	dual PCI busses.  Does this mean that the 2.0.x series doesn't 
	support it?  If so, I might be in trouble... I've just ordered a 
	dual PII-333 Dell server which has dual PCI 2.1 busses on it.  
	This machine is to become our core mail, news, dns server for my 
	network, and so I want to run a relatively stable server (it's 
	replacing an aging Sun Sparc 5 which hasn't crashed for over year).

	<br><br>
	Am I going to have to risk the development series on a core server?
	Or will I be lucky....!

	<br><br>
	In the worst case, could I install a 2.0.x series and run it with a 
	single bus (cards on the second not recognised) ??</em></dl>

	Dual PCI busses should run fine with 2.0.x kernels as they locate PCI
	devices using the PCI BIOS which of course should handle the dual bus
	case. Since 2.1.9x we try to access the hardware directly in order to
	circumvent PCI BIOS bugs.  Anyway, in 2.0.x /proc/pci will show only
	the first bus.

At least this means that some of Dell customers are using Linux 
<img src="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" alt=":-)" width="20" height="24"
align="absmiddle">) And not only for jokes (if you'll just try to play 
some games with Linux you'll not going to buy dual Pentium II or 4x 
Pentium Pro server, right?). Thay just not tries to bother Dell with 
their problems since they are sure that Linux is not supported by Dell 
anyway...

	That is the point of my message.  We are somewhat self-sufficient
	and that is great for our userbase and developers.  However,
	as consumers we must communicate our requirements back to 
	the vendors --- and we must do so proactively.

		<p align="center">We demand recognition and support</p> 

<blockquote>
	... and we must back that up with action by shopping with 
	vendors that meet this requirement.

<br><br>
	If we fail to do so, and we scramble about to reverse engineer
	every new wrinkle then we are failing as consumers (no matter
	how we shine as engineers).  "They" won't (and shouldn't?) care 
	about the "silent minority."

<br><br>
	The risk and cost of this is that we may not always benefit
	from the same economy of scale that's enjoyed by the mass
	market.  We may have to pay a bit more (though not quite as
	bit of a premium as we used to see between PC's and Macs
	nor nearly the discrepancy that still exists between micros 
	and workstations).
