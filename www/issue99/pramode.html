<h1>Let's Build a Cool Linux Toy</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/pramode.html">Pramode C.E.</A></b></p>

<p>
Many of us  make a living out of Linux - but, if
somebody asks us why we are so crazy about it, one 
common answer would be `fun'. Playing with Linux is lots
of fun - with the added benefit that, most of the time,
you end up learning a lot. Recently, I happened to come
across a nice <a href="http://www.linuxtoys.net">book</a> which tries to emphasize the `fun' aspect
of Linux - it describes several small `projects' (a jukebox,
a picture frame, etc.) that a moderately experienced Linux
user may be able to implement on her own. One of the projects involved
interfacing with a temperature-sensing element and putting up
the temperature value on a Web page (or including it in your email
signature - and any other crazy stuff which you can imagine!). The
only trouble was that, in the <b>part of the world where
I live</b>, walking up to an electronics store and asking for an
<b>integrated, 1-wire temperature-sensing element</b> is 
more likely to yield a hard stare than anything else. Smart sensors that
can be directly interfaced to the PC with the minimum of fuss
are seldom available off-the-shelf - you will mostly have to `roll your own'
 - which adds to the fun and excitement. With a low-cost general purpose
microcontroller like the PIC16F628, bits and pieces of cheap, commonly available
electronics components, and LOTS of code, you can build many interesting `toys'
and hook them up to your Linux machine - a really great learning experience
for the hardware hacker who wants to learn Linux, or the Linux hacker who wants
to learn a bit of hardware. This article describes how I went about building
my temperature-sensing project - amateur Linux/hardware hackers might find some
of the ideas useful when they start building things on their own. 

<h2>Get a PIC micro, and set it up to work with Linux</h2>
<p>
This is the first step. <a href="http://www.microchip.com">Microchip</a> PIC controllers are commonly
available. If you are like me, working with a soldering iron
for more than 10 minutes would drive you crazy - so you have to
choose the right kind of PIC - the one that can be programmed
with the simplest possible circuit (connected to the PC parallel
port), preferably with a 5V supply. Look no further than the 
PIC16F628. This is a cool device that has lots of peripherals (except
the ADC - but then, we can roll our own crude analog-to-digital
converter with the comparator and pulse width modulation facilities
offered by the PIC) and supports a `Low-Voltage Programming Mode'. I
found a nice little circuit (the simplest circuit, and one
that works perfectly, out of the dozens I have seen on the Net)
designed by <b>Jim Paris</b> for a microcontroller programming laboratory
at MIT. Here is the circuit:

<p>
[<A HREF="misc/pramode/lvp.png">diagram</A>]
<p>

I assembled the circuit on a breadboard for testing in a
few minutes' time. 
<p>
<img src="misc/pramode/test.png">

<p>

<b>Jim Paris</b> has designed a program (called `jimpic') for 
burning machine code onto the flash memory of the microcontroller. It is
available for download from <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.115/www/pic.shtml">here</a>. I
wrote a simple assembly language program, converted it into
machine code with the help of the `gpasm' assembler available
as part of the <a href="http://gputils.sourceforge.net">GNU PIC
Utilities Project</a> and burned it onto the micro by running `jimpic'
with the `-b' option.

<h2>A Quick Introduction to PIC programming</h2>
<p>
A nice thing
about the PIC is that, if you have some background in general microprocessor
architecture and assembly language programming, you can become productive
with it in just about one or two hours' time. The instruction set is
very compact (35 instructions) and sufficient for most simple bit-twiddling
tasks. The PIC16F628 packs a decent 224 bytes of data memory with 2K of program
(code) memory. The peripherals include general-purpose digital I/O ports,
three timers, two analog comparators, on-chip voltage reference module,
Universal Synchronous-Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (for serial communication),
and Capture-Compare-PWM module. Special CPU features include a watchdog timer,
brown-out detect circuitry, and an internal RC oscillator (so that you won't be 
needing an external crystal if you aren't too concerned about precise timing).
<p>
The general purpose data RAM begins at address 0x20 (the locations below this
are Special Function Registers - basically memory mapped I/O ports,
control registers etc.). Here is an elementary assembly language program, which
simply stores the value 0 into the accumulator (the `W' register, in PIC
terminology). 
<p>
[<a href="misc/pramode/a.txt">Listing 1</a>]

<p> (Remove the .txt extension if you download the listing.  It's there only to
ensure browsers display it properly.)

<p>
We will now assemble the file:

<pre>
gpasm -a inhx8m a.s
</pre>

<p>
The result is an Intel hex format file, which can be given to `jimpic' for
burning. Each line of the hex file contains a few bytes of machine code,
the address at which the machine code is to be stored (in the flash memory
of the microcontroller), some kind of checksum, and some other information. Here
is the hex file generated by running `gpasm' over our assembly language program:

<pre>
:020000000030CE
:02400E00983FD9
:00000001FF
</pre>

<p>
The first line of our  program tells the assembler that
machine code is to be generated for the PIC16F628. The second line includes
a file (available with the `gputils' distribution) that contains lots
of symbol definitions. The third line, a __CONFIG directive, tells the
assembler what special features of the microcontroller (say, the Watchdog
timer) should be enabled/disabled by writing  bit patterns to a `magic'
`configuration word' within the PIC; _WDT_OFF means we don't want the watchdog
to be enabled, _INTRC_OSC_NOCLKOUT means we are going to use the internal
oscillator to provide the timing signals necessary for program execution.
You will have to refer to the 16F628 datasheet to know more about these 
configuration bits. The fourth line is the only proper assembly language
instruction in the program - it moves the `literal' (constant) value 0
to the `W' register. Note that each line begins with a tab.

<h2>Lighting up an LED</h2>
<p>
Here is a program that lights up an LED connected to the RB0 pin of
the microcontroller:
<p>
[<a href="misc/pramode/led.txt">Listing 2</a>]

<p>
PORTB is an eight-bit port - the direction of each pin (i.e., whether the
pin is to act as input or output) is controlled by individual bits of
the TRISB register - if a TRISB bit is set, the corresponding PORTB pin
is input - otherwise it is output. The PIC has the concept of `banked' addresses, which
is rather confusing to the beginner. (It's a headache even if you
are an `experienced' developer.) You visualize `banks' of special function
registers - the STATUS register is the same across all the banks while
the TRISB register is available only in bank 1. You are by default in bank 0.
To access TRISB, you have to `switch over' to bank 1. This is by setting the
RP0 bit of the status register. (When you read microcontroller manuals, you
will see that not only are the control registers given special names, even
the individual bits are named. Header files available with the development
kit for the microcontroller map these symbolic names to the numbers given in
the manual, making the life of the assembly programmer a bit easier.) The `bsf'
instruction (bit set f - `f' represents the fact that the number that comes
as the operand for the instruction represents a memory address or a special
function register and not a `literal') takes two operands - the first
one being the address of a RAM location or a special function register, and
the second, a bit number. The `movwf' instruction copies the contents of the
`W' register to the memory location whose address is the operand of
the instruction.

<h2>Building a `running' circuit</h2>
<p>
After assembling and burning the above program, we are ready
to see it in action. The running circuit can be built in a 
jiffy - place +5V on the VDD pin of the PIC (pin 14), connect 
Vss (pin 5) to circuit ground, connect MCLR (pin 4) to +5V through
a 2K resistor, connect the LED between RB0 and Gnd with a current
limiting resistor of say 1K in series - and that's all. You should
see the LED lighting up as soon as you apply power. Your next
attempt will be to make the LED blink - for that you will have
to read a little bit more about the PIC instruction set - the manual
will come in handy at this juncture.

<h2>Debugging tips</h2>
<p>
Here are some things that I have found handy while debugging:
<ul>
<li>Check the power supply
<li>Don't jump into conclusions that the hardware is
wrong - you might have misinterpreted the datasheet, your
program logic might be wrong, or
worse still - the data sheet might be WRONG. Which brings
us to the next rule, which is:
<li>Always read the manufacturers' errata - if they have
one. The 16F628 datasheet contains some  errors
- especially concerning writes to EEPROM data memory and
the behavior of the MCLR pin in low-voltage programming
mode.
<li>Don't think the hardware will never malfunction
- for example, the PIC might consume larger current when
writing to the internal data EEPROM; your battery-powered supply might
not be able to deliver the required current, and your program will
misbehave. If you have an external crystal, it might not be working
properly, and the micro might not be getting its clock.  
<li>Google Groups is your friend - use it wisely. Search the archive;
somebody might have experienced the same problem before. Post a message
if you feel that your problem is something `original'.

</ul>

<h2>The temperature sensor interfacing project</h2>
<p>

The <b>LM35</b> is a commonly available calibrated temperature sensor
that converts temperature (in degrees Celsius) to
voltage - each degree rise in temperature results in
10mV rise in output voltage. It's a three-pin device -
Vcc, Gnd, and voltage output. You can get the datasheet
from <a href="http://www.national.com/pf/LM/LM35.html">here</a>. Say the current temperature
is 23 degrees Celsius; the voltage output would be 230 millivolts.

<p>
The question is, how do you convert this voltage to a
digital value? The easiest way would be to use a 
commodity  analog-to-digital converter,
and interface it to the printer port. Another solution
would be to use a PIC with a built in ADC (say the 12F675).
The third would be to use some of the peripherals available
in the 16F628, write some code, and build a crude ADC of
your own. As I had explored the first two options a lot in
the past, I thought of trying out the third one.

<p>
Two peripheral features of the PIC are of interest to
us here - one is the builtin PWM module (Pulse Width
Modulation), which is capable of generating, in, hardware,
a continuous stream of digital on-off pulses whose duty
cycle can be varied simply by storing certain numbers in
specific special function registers. Once the PWM module
is initialized to generate a pulse train of a specific duty
cycle, it will keep on doing so without any software intervention -
our program can do something else.

<p>
The PIC is also equipped with two analog comparators, which
can be configured in a variety of ways. Let's say we are using
just one of the comparators. Two PORTA pins can be programmed
to accept voltage levels and transmit them to the Vin+ and Vin-
pins of the comparator. The comparator output is high if the
Vin+ voltage is greater than the Vin- voltage, and low otherwise.
The output can be made available on another PORTA pin, or it
can be simply read from a particular bit of the Comparator Control
Register, CMCON.

<h3>Filtering PWM pulses</h3>
<p>

<img src="misc/pramode/filter.png">

<p>
The figure shows a PWM pulse (off OV, on +5V) of period T being fed to an RC circuit (R*C &gt;&gt; T).
If the on-off periods are equal, the output seen across the capacitor
will be a constant DC level of magnitude 2.5V. Electrical engineering text books
should give you the reason why it is so - or, if you are not very sure of
the math involved (as I am), play with some R and C values until you get the
desired effect. Now what if you feed a PWM pulse whose on-time is less than
T/2? You will see that the output is again a DC level, but the magnitude has
come down proportionately. What if you increase the on-time? Again, the
output is a DC level, only thing is the magnitude has increased proportionately.
Now you have a cool way to implement a DAC, a digital-to-analog converter.
Say you want to generate a voltage of 0.449V. What if you program the PIC
so as to generate a PWM pulse train of period 256 microseconds and on-time
128micro. The output voltage would be 5V*(128/256.0) = 2.5V. Now, what if
the on-time is 23 micro seconds? The output is 5V*(23.0/256) = 0.449V. (I
use Python to do these quick-and-dirty calculations. It's one of my 
favourite uses of this great language.) The
on-time can be altered easily by writing some numbers to two registers, CCPR1L
and CCP1CON. A pure digital way to generate analog voltage!

<h3>From DAC to ADC</h3>
<p>

What has all this got to do with converting the LM35 sensor's analog
voltage output to a numerical value? Well, a DAC, together with a comparator,
builds up an ADC. How? Say the maximum and minimum temperatures at your
place of residence can never go above/below 45 degree Celsius and
20 degree Celsius. So the sensor's output will always be between
.45V and .2V (remember, 10mV per degree change in temperature). We 
start generating a PWM signal of period 256 microseconds. The RC-filtered
output is fed to Vin+ of the comparator, and the sensor's output is
fed to Vin-. Let's say the sensor output is .3V. If the PWM on-period
is 23 microseconds, the filtered DC level would be 5*(23.0/256) = 0.449V.
So, Vin+ is greater than Vin-, and the comparator output (as obtained
from a bit of the CMCON register) is high. Now, we start bringing down
the on-time. At a certain point, Vin- will go above Vin+, and the comparator
output drops to zero. The magnitude of the on-time at this point is
a true representation of the analog value of the sensor output. We communicate
this number to a program running on the Linux box through a serial
link. You can download the PIC assembly language program that does
all these tricks:
<p>
[<a href="misc/pramode/pwmadc.txt">Listing 3</a>]

<p>
Instead of performing a `linear' search from the high boundary  down to
the lower one, we can think of generating a voltage that lies in the
middle of this range and comparing it with the sensor output. If the
comparator says that the sensor output is higher, we can repeat the
same procedure on the upper half. This is the classical `binary search'
applied to solve a hardware problem! <b>Horowitz and Hill</b>, in their
book <b>The Art of Electronics</b>, have oscilloscope traces of this
binary search in action! Computer programmers should always show a good
amount of skepticism towards code that claims to do binary search - 
the algorithm looks deceptively simple - but is in fact not very easy
to implement correctly.
<p>



<h2>Back to Linux</h2>
<p>
The PIC micro sends the temperature data it has gathered out through
a port pin (RB2) in a serial manner - this port pin is directly connected to the
receive pin of the PC serial port. What remains is to write a program
that will read this data and process it in some manner. Even though
the RS-232C serial communication standard defines an `on' voltage to be
between -3 and -12V and an `off' to be between +3 and +12, I have been
able to get satisfactory results using the 0 and 5V logic outputs from
the PIC port pin - if it doesn't work out for you, you will have to
place a device like the MAX232 between the PIC port pin and the
PC serial port receive pin.

<h3>Interfacing with the serial port</h3>
<p>

Let's look at the simplest way to interface an external 
circuit to the serial port. (We won't be sending any data
out through the PC serial port - that would make the circuit
a wee bit more complex.)  Pin number 2 of
the 9-pin PC serial port connector is the receive pin, 3 the transmit
pin, and 5, Ground. Let's say the PIC is sending data out
through its RB2 pin at 9600 bits per second, 8N1 (8 data bits,
no parity, 1 stop bit) format. The UART that controls the 
PC serial port should be programmed for this particular baud
rate and data format. This can be done by writing magic bit
patterns to certain control registers. Once that is done, our
program can keep on polling a bit of the UART status register
to know whether a new data byte has arrived. Here is the code
listing:
<p>
[<a href="misc/pramode/recv.txt">Listing 4</a>]

<p>
The program has two disadvantages. One, it is using low-level
I/O calls, which, if they are to work properly, should be
preceded by an iopl() call. Only the superuser can call 
iopl() successfully - so the program should run under root privilege.
We are wasting CPU time when we keep polling for data in
a tight loop; that's another big problem. Both are solved by
not directly interacting with the hardware - we can make use of
system calls to talk to the serial driver within the Linux kernel -
which will do all the low level stuff needed to manage blocking,
interrupt driven I/O. 

<h3>Serial I/O in Python</h3>
<p>
The Python `termios' module can be used for doing serial comm
at a higher level. <b>Isaac Barona Martinez</b> has written 
a simple wrapper over `termios'. It is called <b>uspp</b> and
is available for download from <a href="http://balder.prohosting.com/ibarona/en/python/uspp/">here</a>. Using
this module, reading from the serial port is a breeze:
<p>
[<a href="misc/pramode/uspp.txt">Listing 5</a>]

<pre>

from uspp import *

# COM1 is initialized at 9600 baud. The
# default data format is 8N1

s = SerialPort("/dev/ttyS0", None, 9600)
s.flush() # discard unread bytes

print ord(s.read()) # s.read() returns a one-character
                    # string. We convert it into its ascii
                    # value

</pre>

Once you get this far, let your imagination run riot! 
<ul>
<li>Write a simple server that accepts connections over
the network and transmits the current temperature
<li>Write a program that keeps on reading the temperature at
say, half-hour intervals. The temperature reading, together
with some stupid message like `Oh - it's burning hot here' can
be placed at the end of your `.signature' file!
<li>Another idea would be to use something like the Python
`ftplib' to upload the temperature reading to your Web server
periodically.
</ul>
