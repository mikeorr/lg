<h2>News in General</h2>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Linux Foundation makes Kernel Developer Ted Ts'o new CTO</h3>

<p>The Linux Foundation (LF) named Linux kernel developer Theodore Ts'o 
to the position of Chief Technology Officer at the Foundation. Ts'o is 
currently a Linux Foundation fellow, a position he has been in since 
December 2007. He is a highly regarded member of the Linux and open 
source community and is known as the first North American kernel 
developer. Other current and past LF fellows include Steve Hemminger, 
Andrew Morton, Linus Torvalds and Andrew Tridgell.</p>

<p>Ts'o will be replacing Markus Rex, who was on loan to the Foundation
from Novell. Rex will return to Novell as the acting general manager and
senior vice president of Novell's OPS business unit.</p>

<p>As CTO, Ts'o will lead all technical initiatives for the Linux 
Foundation, including oversight of the Linux Standard Base (LSB) and 
other workgroups such as Open Printing. He will also be the primary 
technical interface to LF members and the LF's Technical Advisory 
Board, which represents the kernel community.</p>

<p>"I continue to believe in power of mass collaboration and the work that
can be done by a community of developers, users and industry members, I'm
looking forward to translating that power into concrete milestones for the
LSB specifically, and for Linux overall, in the year ahead," says Ts'o.</p>

<p>Since 2001, Ts'o has worked as a senior technical staff member at IBM 
where he most recently led a worldwide team to create an 
enterprise-level real-time Linux solution.  Ts'o was awarded the 2006 
Award for the Advancement of Free Software by the Free Software 
Foundation (FSF).</p>

<p>Ts'o is also a Linux kernel developer, a role in which he serves as 
ext4 file system maintainer, as well as the primary author and 
maintainer of e2fsprogs, the userspace utilities for the ext2, ext3, 
and ext4 file systems. He is the founder and chair of the annual Linux 
Kernel Developers' Summit and regularly presents tutorials on Linux and 
other open source software. Ts'o was project leader for Kerberos, a 
network authentication system. He was also a member of the Security Area 
Directorate for the Internet Engineering Task Force where he chaired 
the IP Security (IPSEC) Working Group and was a founding board member 
of the Free Standards Group (FSG).</p>


<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">2009 Linux Collaboration Summit Call for Participation</h3>

<p>The Linux Foundation has opened registration and announced a call for 
participation for the 3rd Annual Collaboration Summit which will take 
place April 8-10, 2009 in San Francisco.</p>

<p>Sponsored by Intel in 2009, the Collaboration Summit is an exclusive, 
invitation-only gathering of the brightest minds in Linux, including 
core kernel developers, distribution maintainers, ISVs, end users, 
system vendors, and other community organizations. It is the only 
conference designed to accelerate collaboration and encourage 
solutions by bringing together a true cross-section of leaders to meet 
face-to-face to tackle and solve the most pressing issues facing Linux 
today.</p>

<p>The 2009 Collaboration Summit will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Moblin Development Summit</li>
<li>High Performance Computing</li>
<li>Systems Management</li>
<li>the Linux ISV Summit</li>
</ul>

<p>LF workgroups such as Open Printing and the LSB will also hold 
meetings.</p>

<p>The Collaboration Summit will be co-located with the CELF Embedded Linux
Conference and the Linux Storage and Filesystem Workshop. The winner of the
"We're Linux" video contest (see next item) will also be revealed at the
Summit, where the winning video and honorable mentions will be screened for
the event's attendees.</p>

<p>For more information on the Linux Foundation Collaboration Summit, 
please visit:

<a href='http://events.linuxfoundation.org/component/registrationpro/?func=details&did=2'>http://events.linuxfoundation.org/component/registrationpro/?func=details&did=2</a>.</p>

<p>For the first time, the Linux Foundation is inviting all members of the
Linux and open source software communities to submit a proposal for its
Annual Collaboration Summit, its cornerstone event. CFP submissions are due
February 15, 2009. To submit a proposal, visit: <a
href='http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/collaboration-summit'>http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/collaboration-summit</a>.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Linux Foundation hosting "We're Linux" Video Contest</h3>

<p>In January, the Linux Foundation (LF) launched of its grassroots "We're
Linux" video contest.  The campaign seeks to find the best user-generated
videos that demonstrate what Linux means to those who use it and inspire
others to try it. The contest is open to everyone and runs through midnight
on March 15, 2009. The winner will be revealed at the Linux Foundation's
Collaboration Summit on April 8, 2009, in San Francisco. The winner will be
awarded a trip to Tokyo, Japan to participate in the Linux Foundation's
Japanese Linux Symposium.</p>

<p>In response to early and resounding community input, the campaign has 
been renamed from the original "I'm Linux" to the "We're Linux" video 
contest. This name better expresses how Linux is represented by more 
than any one person or company.</p>

<p>To become a member of the Linux Foundation's Video forum, view early 
submissions, or submit your own video for the "We're Linux" 
contest, visit <a href='http://video.linuxfoundation.org'>http://video.linuxfoundation.org</a>.</p>


<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">AMD plans dual-core Neo laptop chip</h3>

<p>At CES, AMD announced its platform for ultra-thin notebooks at an
affordable price. Previously codenamed "Yukon," the platform is based on
the new AMD Athlon Neo processor, ATI Radeon integrated graphics or Radeon
HD 3410 discrete graphics. The Neo platform debuts within the HP Pavilion
dv2 Entertainment Notebook PC ultra-thin notebook, which is less than one
inch thick and weighs in under four pounds.  The HP Pavilion dv2 has a
12.1-inch diagonal LED display, near-full-size keyboard, and an optional
external optical disc drive with Blu-ray capability.</p>

<p>In mid-January AMD also announced a dual-core Athlon Neo processor, 
code-named Conesus, which is planned by for mid-2009. The dual-core 
Neo and supporting chips provide for more operational capability than 
the current crop of netbooks powered by Intel Atom processors.</p>


<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Grid.org Open Source HPC Community Hits Visitor Milestone</h3>

<p>Grid.org, the on-line community for open source cluster and grid 
software, announced in January that the site garnered over 100,000 
unique visitors in 2008, with the highest traffic generating from the 
UniCluster, Amazon EC2 and HPC discussion groups.</p>

<p>Launched in November 2007, Grid.org is an open source community for 
cluster and grid users, developers, and administrators. It is home to 
the UniCluster open source project as well as other open source 
projects. For more information, go to <a href='http://www.grid.org'>http://www.grid.org</a>.</p>

<p>Recent focus on cloud computing and the announcement of UniCloud, 
UniCluster's extension into the Amazon EC2 cloud, have been popular 
topics resulting in an increase in traffic to the site.</p>

<p>"Having a vibrant community of users and thought leaders is the 
cornerstone of any successful open source software project," notes 
Gary Tyreman, vice president and general manager of HPC for Univa UD. 
"From our groundbreaking work in Amazon EC2 to the UniCloud offering 
for Virtual HPC management, Univa UD is committed to initiating and 
supporting the future of HPC technology, community and open source."</p>

<p>Charlie Boyle, Director of OpenSolaris Marketing, spoke with LG just 
after the announcement and explained that ZFS and tools like D-Light 
(based on D-Trace feature in Solaris) allow seeing what applications 
are doing in real time and allow developers to rapidly debug and 
optimize their applications. "OpenSolaris is optimized for 
performance on the latest systems. Users deploying OpenSolaris will 
get the most out of their systems with advances in scalability, power 
management, and virtualization."</p>

<p>Regarding the extension of Solaris support beyond 18 months, Boyle 
explained, "Customers can get support for as long as they have a 
contract on their system. We have removed the artificial 18 month 
window... we will take calls on whatever version a customer is running 
and get them the best fix for their situation."</p>

<p>In addition to performance gains, other enhancements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a new Automated Installer application, allowing users to decide which 
packages to include within the installation Web service;
<li>the Distro Constructor, enabling users to create their own custom image for 
deployment across their systems; 
<li>and a new storage feature, COMSTAR Storage Framework, that allows
developers to create and customize their own open storage server with
OpenSolaris.</ul>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Eclipse PHP Dev Tools (PDT) 2.0 Released</h3>

<p>Fully compliant with Eclipse standards, the new 2.0 release of the PHP 
Development Tools (PDT)  enables developers to leverage a wide variety 
of Eclipse projects, such as Web Tools Project (WTP) and Dynamic 
Language Toolkit (DLTK), for faster and easier PHP development. PDT is 
an open source development tool that provides the code editing 
capabilities needed to get started developing PHP applications. 
Version 2.0 was available in January.</p>

<p>To support the object-oriented features of PHP, PDT 2.0 now includes:</p>
<ul><li>Type Hierarchy view that navigates object-oriented PHP code 
faster and more easily.
<li>Type and method navigation that allows for easy searching of PHP 
code based on type information.
<li>Override indicators that visually tag PHP methods that have been 
overridden.</ul>

<p>More info is available here:
<a href='http://www.eclipse.org/projects/project_summary.php?projectid=tools.pdt'>http://www.eclipse.org/projects/project_summary.php?projectid=tools.pdt</a></p>

<p>The Java Source Helper plugin was also released in January.  Java 
Source Helper shows a block of code related to a closing brace/bracket 
if it is currently out of visible range in the editor. The Eclipse 
Java editor will check to see if the related starting code bracket is 
out of visible range and, if it is, it will float a window that shows 
the code related to that starting block. This is useful in deeply 
nested code. The feature is similar to one in the IntelliJ IDEA IDE.</p>


<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Cisco's Aironet 1140 Innovates 80.11n Access Points</h3>

<p>Cisco is now offering an enterprise-class next-generation wireless 
access point that combines full 802.11n performance with 
cost-effectiveness. The new Cisco Aironet 1140 Series Access Point 
supports the Wi-Fi Certified 802.11n Draft 2.0 access point standard 
and is designed for high-quality voice, video, and rich media across 
wireless networks.</p>

<p>Cisco delivered the first enterprise-class Wi-Fi Certified 802.11n 
Draft 2.0 platform in 2007. The Aironet 1140 offers full 802.11n 
performance and security while using standard Power over Ethernet 
(PoE). The new access point introduces Cisco M-Drive Technology that 
enhances 802.11n performance. The Aironet 1140 is the only dual-radio 
platform that combines full 802.11n Draft 2.0 performance (up to nine 
times the throughput of existing 802.11a/g wireless networks) and 
built-in security features using standard 802.3af Power over Ethernet.</p>

<p>ClientLink, a feature of Cisco M-Drive Technology, helps extend the 
useful life of existing 802.11a/g devices with the use of beam forming 
to improve the throughput for existing 802.11a/g devices and reduce 
wireless coverage holes for legacy devices.</p>

<p>Miercom, an independent testing and analysis lab, tested ClientLink 
and showed an increase of up to 65 percent in throughput for existing 
802.11a/g devices connecting to a Cisco 802.11n network. Unlike other 
solutions that do not offer performance improvements for legacy 
devices, ClientLink delivers airtime connectivity fairness for both 
802.11n and 802.11a/g devices. For the complete Miercom testing 
methodology and results, download the ClientLink report at:

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Next Gen Cfengine 3 released</h3>

<p>Cfengine is an automated suite of programs for configuring and 
maintaining Unix and Linux computers. It has been used on computing 
arrays of up to 20,000 computers since 1993 by a wide range of 
organizations. Cfengine is supported by active research and was the 
first autonomic, hands-free management system for Unix-like operating 
systems.</p>

<p>Cfengine 3.0.0 is a new and substantial rewrite of cfengine's 
technology, building on core principles used over the past 15 years, 
and extending them with technology inspired by Promise Theory. 
(Promise theory describes policy-governed services in a framework of 
autonomous agents. It is a framework for analyzing models of modern 
networking and was developed at the University of Oslo.)</p>

<p>The new cfengine enhances its support of configuration management 
with:</p>
<ul>
<li>A brand new language with a simple uniform syntax and powerful 
templating.
<li>Integrated self-diagnostics and automated self-healing 
documentation.
<li>Generic file editing with multiple models.
<li>Pattern matching and design features to match any environment, 
large and small.
<li>Integrated knowledge management using topic maps.
<li>Support available from cfengine AS at <a
href="http://www.cfengine.com">http://www.cfengine.com</a>.
<li>Upcoming Enterprise version in 2009 with extended features.
<li>GPLv3 code.</ul>

<p>Cfengine 3 also offers full integration with existing cfengine 2 
systems and auto-encapsulation of cfengine 2 for incremental upgrades.</p>

<p>Mark Burgess, author of Cfengine,  recently gave a presentation on 
Promise Theory and Cfengine 3 at Google on his way to LISA 08. It is 
now available at YouTube: <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCXs4Om5pY'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCXs4Om5pY</a></p>
