<center><b><font size=+1>TCP Wrappers</font></b></center>

<p>We are indebted to <a href="mailto:unixhelp@home.com">Rob Sellars</a>
for his excellent article: TCP Wrappers, Locked doors and a security camera for
computer!</a>

<p><b>How does <font color="#330000">"</font>tcp wrappers<font color="#330000">"
</font>work?</b>&nbsp; Many programs do not run all the time as they are
infrequently used and would create unnecessary overhead.&nbsp; The inetd
program is run takes care of this nicely.&nbsp; When a user tries to connect
to your computer, the connection is made up of a pair of data: an ip address
and a port. Inetd reacts to this connection by looking up the port number
in /etc/services, and then looking in the file /etc/inetd.conf for a corresponding
service, (program) and then runs the service. With tcp wrappers, inetd
is tricked into running tcpd instead of the service that would normally
be called. Tcpd checks it's rules in the /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny
files. It either accepts the connection and runs the service or denies
the connection based on it's rules.
<p><b>NOTE:</b> tcp wrappers only works for services that inetd starts!
Sendmail, apache, and named do not use inetd, and so they are not protected
via tcp wrappers.
<p><b>Check to see if tcp wrappers is installed.</b> Most distributions
install tcp wrappers by default. The easiest way to see if tcp wrappers
is installed is to view the /etc/inetd.conf file. If it is not installed,
a typical line looks like this:
<p>Do this:
<p><tt>ftp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stream&nbsp; tcp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nowait&nbsp;
root&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>/usr/sbin/ftpd&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ftpd -l -a</tt>
<p>and if it is installed, it looks like this:
<p><tt>ftp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stream&nbsp; tcp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nowait&nbsp;
root&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>/usr/sbin/tcpd</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ftpd -l -a</tt>
<p>The bolded part shows the difference. Assuming it is installed, you
must edit your /etc/host.allow and /etc/host.deny files to give tcpd the
rules it needs.
<p><b>Edit your /etc/hosts.allow&nbsp; and /etc/hosts.deny to limit access
to your computer's network services.&nbsp;</b> One of the nice features
of tcp wrappers is the ability to control access to your computers network
services and log failed or successful attempts. You can also perform certain
actions based on the users hostname.&nbsp; When someone tries to connect
to a network service on your computer, the tcp wrapper (tcpd) reads the
file /etc/hosts.allow&nbsp; for a rule that matches the the hostname of
the person trying to connect, if /etc/hosts.allow doesn't contain a rule
allowing access, tcpd reads /etc/hosts.deny for a rule that would deny
access to the hostname. If neither file contains an accept or deny rule,
access is granted by default.&nbsp; <font color="#330000">It's important
to note the sequence of events here.&nbsp; "hosts.allow" is read first
and overrides anything in "hosts.deny".&nbsp; As you'll see, we tell the
server to accept connections from specific machines in hosts.allow, but
via hosts.deny we tell our server to refuse access to anyone for any reason.</font>
<p>In the following examples we are going to&nbsp; deny all finger request,
and deny telnet access to all users from lamers.edu.&nbsp; The format of
the rules in the hosts.allow/hosts.deny files is as follows:
<blockquote>service: hostname : options</blockquote>
An example&nbsp;&nbsp; /etc/hosts.allow&nbsp; could look like the following:
<br>*****************************************************************************
<br><tt>ipop3d: ALL: ALLOW</tt><tt></tt>
<p><tt>in.telnetd: .myschool.edu : ALLOW</tt><tt></tt>
<p>*****************************************************************************
<br>Note: in the two rules above, each rule must be on ONE line, it may
appear as more than one line here due to article formatting.
<p>In the first line "ipop3d" is the service, the hostname is "ALL" which
means the rule applies to all hosts, and finally we tell tcpd to "ALLOW"
the connection.
<p>The second rule follows the same format as the first, it allows access
to telnet only for users from "myschool.edu".
<p>Again: Each rule goes on it's own unbroken line.
<p>The above example was given to explain rules tcp wrappers uses. Here
is what I have on my server for /etc/hosts.allow:
<p>*****************************************************************************
<br><tt># allow connections from my local network</tt>
<br><tt>ALL: A<font color="#330000">LL</font>@127.0.0.1 : ALLOW</tt>
<br><tt># allow all connections from computers on my network</tt>
<br><tt>ALL: A<font color="#330000">LL</font>@192.168.124.1 : ALLOW</tt>
<br><tt>ALL: ALL@192.168.124.10 : ALLOW</tt>
<br><tt>ALL: ALL@192.168.124.11 : ALLOW</tt>
<br><tt>ALL: ALL@192.168.124.20 : ALLOW</tt>
<br>*****************************************************************************
<p>This file allows permissions based on ip addresses instead of services.
Since it is a home network, all computers are trusted and listed. Obviously
ip spoofing needs to be fixed or this method is not secure. I want all
connects from outside my network denied and a message sent to me telling
me what happened. My /etc/hosts.deny looks like this:
<p>*****************************************************************************
<br><tt>ALL:ALL : spawn (echo Attempt from %h %a to %d at `date` | tee
-a /var/log/tcp.deny.log |mail jpollman@kulai.org )</tt>
<br>*****************************************************************************
<br>This needs to be on ONE line. And yes, I do get email from here - about
two a week. They look like this:<font color="#330000"></font>
<p><tt><font color="#330000">Attempt from gw.webec.com 209.98.44.94 to
in.ftpd at Mon Jul 5 21:44:54 EDT 1999</font></tt>
