<P>
Just thought the TAG group would appreciate this story.
</P>
<P>
I wrote a small script to handle scanning of all my financial documents into
my computer. It's real simple and easy to use. Well, I have moved since I
used it, about a year ago. So, now with tax time coming, I decided it was
time to start scannnig in all my financial papers and shredding the files I
do not need to keep. Plus, I can burn them to cd and have a backup for the
safety deposit box.
</P>
<P>
Well...
</P>
<P>
I did real well, when I moved last year. I didn't lose one thing. I really
mean it. I've been in the house and I haven't missplaced anything. Until last
weekend. I couldn't find that #@#%#! script anywhere. I searched all my
servers, and backup CDs. I was pretty ticked and about half way through
rewriting it, when I remembered something.
</P>
<P>
I wrote an email talking about it to my local LUG a couple years ago. After
digging in my mail for a while I found a reference that said, and I quote,
</P>
<P>
"If anyone is interested in the script scan_docs.sh, you can find it on my web
site <A HREF="http:///www.brayra.com/downloads/scan_docs.sh"
	>http:///www.brayra.com/downloads/scan_docs.sh</A>"
</P>
<P>
I am an idiot.
</P>
<P>
Expect some articles from me. I have many other little programs I've written
over the years. I need to write up nice documentation for them all and post
them for the gazette. I would hate to lose them too.

Richard, you might perhaps appreciate a quotation from the Penguinus Maximus:

Reading Linux Gazette is like a treasure hunt, you never know what you'll
find. Do you mean for this to be published?
<A HREF="../issue99/lg_mail.html"

Did you get cracked by a polite cracker?
A prankster on your staff?

I'm pretty sure she's referring to the tongue-in-cheek 31337-speak down
at the bottom of Dave Bechtel's letter.  Unless the Cookie Monster,
Oscar, Elmo, Snuffleupagus, and the Elite Sesame Street Crew have
suddenly turned malevolent, nobody has much to fear (or is that PH33R?).

[Faber] I must be missing something. If you simply want to print to
STDOUT, try this:
</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><CODE>
$( whereis libcrypto | awk '{print $3}' )
</CODE></STRONG></P>

<P>
That is in error, since in bash prefixing the variable name with a $
sign is returning/using the value given. It should read:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>robin=$(whereis libcrypto | awk '{print $3}') ; echo $robin
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
Whether Faber meant the initial '$' as the prompt or not... is
still ambiguous
