With the agreement of the original author of this article, I've listed
myself as co-author here, since I essentially rewrote the article that was
submitted. Normally, proofing an article and adding some HTML structure is
just part of the job here at LG; however, complete reformatting of idiom,
recasting of nearly every paragraph, and updating the technical information
is well beyond the scope of what is normal.
</p>

<p class="editorial">
I hate to reject an article that has excellent technical merit almost as
much as I want to avoid publishing one that would be unintelligible to many
of our readers (particularly those for whom English is not their primary
language, or who have difficulty parsing it for other reasons.) However, I
also feel that doing what is essentially a major rewrite of an article
should not go unrecognized.  Since this is the first time I've ever
explicitly taken credit for doing this kind of major reconstruction - and
since my own vewpoint here could be tainted by the fact that it's my work
that's involved - I want to solicit comments, ideas, and suggestions from
you, our readers. Anyone want to volunteer as a stand-by co-author? Got an
alien idiom-conversion ray that's been in your attic for the last hundred
years? Do you see some other obvious solution I've missed? Bring'em on; the
'Talkback' link at the end of this article is your friend.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
In this article, I will try to explain what DDoS is, and how it can be
prevented or mitigated. Many of the servers in datacenters these days are
Linux-based; hence, I'm going to discuss DDoS attack prevention and
mitigation for Linux servers.

<p>
DDoS happens due to lack of security awareness, application, or skill on
the part of the network/server owners or adminstrators. We often hear that
a particular machine is under DDoS attack, or that the NOC has unplugged a
given machine due to its participation in a DDoS attack. DDoS has become
one of the common issues in our world. In some ways, DDoS is like a disease
which doesn't have a countering antibiotic, and requires being very careful
while dealing with it. <em>Never take it lightly</em>. In this article,
I'll try to cover the steps/measures which will help us defend our machines
from a DDoS attack - at least up to a certain extent.

<h3>What Is A DDoS Attack?</h3>

<p>
Simply stated, DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) is an advanced version
of the DoS (Denial of Service) attack. Much like DoS, DDoS also tries to
block important services running on a server by flooding the destination
server with packets. The specialty of DDoS is that the attacks do not come
from a single network or host but from a number of different hosts or
networks which have been previously compromised.

<p>
DDoS, like many other attack schemes, can be considered to consist of three
participants; we can refer to these as the Master, the Slave, and the
Victim. The Master is the initial source of the attack - i.e., the
person/machine behind all this (sounds <em>COOL</em>, right?) The Slave is
the host or network which was previously compromised by the Master, and the
Victim is the target site/server under attack. The Master informs the
Slave(s) to launch an attack on the victim's site/machine; since the attack
comes from multiple sources at once (note that the Master is usually not
involved in this phase), it is called a <em>Distributed</em> (or
co-ordinated) attack.


<h3>How Do They Do It?</h3>

<p>
DDoS occurs in two phases. In the first phase, the owner of the Master host
compromises vulnerable machines in different networks around the world and
installs DDoS tools (i.e., programs that will perform the attack once
they're triggered.) This is called the Intrusion phase. In the next phase,
the Master sends out the triggering information to those compromised hosts,
which usually includes the IP to be attacked (conversely, that IP could
have been pre-programmed into the tools, and the attack could be
time-triggered - e.g., the Code Red virus DDoS against the
http://whitehouse.gov servers.) This is called the Attack phase.


<h3>What Allows Them To Do It?</h3>

<p>
The success of the Intrusion phase relies on the presence of vulnerable
machines on an arbitrary network. Unfortunately, there's a very large
number of naive computer owners and system administrators whose machines
are largely unprotected, and thus this phase will be easily accomplished by
the attacker in almost all cases.

<p>
Some of the factors that make the Slaves-to-be vulnerable are:

<ol>
<li> Vulnerable software/applications running on a machine or network.
<li> Open/unprotected network configuration. 
<li> Hosts configured without taking security into account.
<li> Absence of monitoring or data analysis. 
<li> No regular audit or software upgrades being conducted.
</ol>


<h3>What Should We Do If We Are Under Attack?</h3>

<p>
If your host is one of the Slaves in a DDoS, you will most likely never
even be aware of it - unless you carefully examine your logs and watch for
untoward network activity. If, on the other hand, you're the Victim, the
results will be dramatic and obvious.

<p>
Symptoms (Victim):
<ol>
<li> Programs run very slowly
<li> Services (e.g., HTTP) fail at a high rate
<li> Large number of connection requests from different networks
<li> User complaints about slow (or no) site access
<li> Machine shows a high CPU load
</ol>


If you discover that you're under attack, follow these steps:

<ul type="square">
<li><strong>Check if your CPU load is high and you a have large number of
HTTP process running</strong>
<br>
Check the load using the 'w' or the 'uptime' commands:

<pre class="code">
Blessen@work &gt;w
 12:00:36 up 1 day, 20:27, 5 users, load average: 0.70, 0.70, 0.57 
</pre>

<p>
Count the number of HTTP processes (it helps to know what your normal
count is for comparison):

<pre class="code">
[root@blessen root]# ps -aux|grep -i HTTP|wc -l 
23 
</pre>

<li><strong>Determine the attacking network</strong>
<br>
In a heavily-loaded server, the number of connection may be above 100 - but
during a DDoS attack, the number will go even higher. That's when we need
to find out, as quickly as possible, which networks are launching these
attacks. In a DDoS attack, the individual slave machine doesn't have much
importance; it is the network which matters the most, since an attacker
could be using any or even all of the machines on a compromised network.
Consequently, the network address is of crucial importance.

<p>
Executing the following command will show the IPs arranged in order of
established connections:

<pre class="code">
bash# netstat -lpn|grep :80|awk '{print $5}'|sort
</pre>

<p>
For an average host, if you have more than 30 connections from a single IP,
chances are that you're under attack. In normal operation, there is very
rarely any reason for that many connection requests from a single IP.
Identify these networks for later reporting, perhaps by using the 'whois'
command.

<p>
If more than 5 such hosts/IPs connect from the same network, that's a
very clear sign of DDoS.

<li><strong>Block the attacking network</strong>
<br>
This can be done by using 'iptables' or 'apf':

<pre class="code">
iptables -A INPUT -s &lt;Source IP&gt; -j DROP 
</pre>

<p>
If you're running 'apf', simply add these IPs to the
'/etc/apf/deny_hosts.rules' file. Continue this elimination process until
the attack on the machine is reduced (and hopefully, eventually stopped
altogether.) As a follow-up measure, contact the datacenter/NOC responsible
for that network to inform them of the compromised systems.

<p>
As a longer-term strategy, once the immediate attack is over (or, if you're
smart, you can do it right now :), install Portsentry (see the software
listed at the end of this article.)
</ul>


<h3>How can we prevent or defend ourselves from these attacks?</h3>

<p>
There is no complete or perfect solution to DDoS. The logic is simple: NO
software or countermeasures can stand up to attacks from, say, 100 servers
at once. All that can be done is to take preventive measures, and respond
quickly and effectively when the attack takes place.

<p>
As it is often said, an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure
- and this is very true in the case of DDoS. In the introduction, I had
mentioned that DDoS often happens because of vulnerable software/applications
running on a machine in a particular network. Attackers use those security
holes to compromise the hosts and the servers and install the DDoS
tools such as 'trin00'.

<p>
To prevent or mitigate future DDoS attacks, follow these steps:

<ul type="disc">
<li> Create and implement a good security policy
<li> Set up a firewall which does ingress and egress filtering at the gateway
(e.g., APF from <a href="http://www.rfxnetworks.com/apf.php">http://www.rfxnetworks.com/apf.php</a>) 
<li> Use host-based intrusion detection on your gateway/hosts to alert you
to port scans and break-in attempts (e.g., AIDE from
<a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/aide/">http://freshmeat.net/projects/aide/</a>)
</ul>

To prevent your network from being used as a slave, follow these steps:

<ul type="disc">
<li> Conduct regular audits on each host on the network to find installed
DDoS tools and vulnerable applications.
<li> Use tools like <a href="http://vancouver-webpages.com/rkdet">Rkdet</a>, <a
href="http://www.rootkit.nl/projects/rootkit_hunter.html">Rootkit
Hunter</a>, or <a href="http://www.chkrootkit.org">chkrootkit</a> to find
if a rootkit has been installed on your system.
<li> Perform a general security audit on your systems on a regular basis:

<ul type="none">
<li> Keep your systems up to date to minimize software vulnerabilities (kernel and software upgrades)
<li> Check for rootkits
<li> Check logs for evidence of port sniffing, etc.
<li> Check for hidden processes by comparing the output of 'ps' and 'lsof'.
<li> Use auditing tools (i.e., <a href="http://www.nessus.org">Nessus</a>,
<a
href="http://www.saintcorporation.com/products/saint_engine.html">SAINT</a>,
or <a href="http://www-arc.com/sara/sara.html">SARA</a>)
<li> Check system binaries with, e.g., Tripwire to see if they've been changed since your last snapshot
<li> Check for open email relays
<li> Check for malicious cron entries
<li> Check /dev /tmp /var directories for odd files (i.e., '...', wrong permissions/ownership on device files, etc.)
<li> Check whether backups are maintained
<li> Check for unwanted users and groups (examine /etc/passwd)
<li> Check for and disable any unneeded services
<li> Check for SUID, SGID, and 'nouser' files on your system with the 'find' command
<li> Check the system performance (memory and CPU usage); note the average levels
</ul>

<li> Create a DSE (Dedicated Security Expert) team for your company.

<li> Enforce and implement security measures on all hosts in the network.
The only hosts that should be allowed on your network are ones that have
been vetted by your security admin or DSE (Dedicated Security Expert).
All hosts on the network should be checked on a regular basis by your DSE team.

<li>
Collect your network and host data and analyze them
to see what kind of attacks are being run against your networks.

<li> Implement Sysctl-based protection. Enable the following in your '/etc/sysctl.conf':

<pre class="code">
# Enable IP spoofing protection, turn on Source Address Verification 
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1 

# Enable TCP SYN Cookie Protection 
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1 
</pre>

Conversely, you could add this code to your '/etc/rc.local':

<pre class="code">
for f in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/{conf/*/rp_filter,tcp_syncookies}
do
	echo 1 &gt; $f
done 
</pre>

<li> Install <a
href="http://linux.cudeso.be/linuxdoc/portsentry.php#config">PortSentry</a>
to block scanning hosts.

<li> Add 'Mod_dosevasive' to your Apache installation. This is an Apache
module which performs 'evasive' action in the event of an HTTP DDoS attack
or brute force attack.

<li> Install the 'Mod_security' module.  Since DDoS often targets HTTP
(port 80), it's a good idea to have a filtering system for Apache;
'Mod_security' will analyze requests before passing them to the web server.

<li> Set up load balancing for your services. In some ways, this is the
most powerful network-based defense against DDoS.

<li> Create awareness of security issues.
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
DDoS attacks can be mitigated at the target machine and prevented at the
slave network by implementing proper security. My advice to each and every
server and network owner is to implement effective security measures; since
DDoS is a network-wide problem, preventing it is going to require
everyone's help.
