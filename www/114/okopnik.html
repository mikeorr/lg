<h3>The Deep, Dark Secrets of Bash</h3>
Deep within the "bash" man page lurk terrible things, not to be
approached by the timid or the inexperienced... Beware, Pilgrim:
the last incautious spelunker into these mysterious regions was
found, weeks later, muttering some sort of strange incantations
that sounded like "nullglob", "dotglob", and
<code>MAILPATH='/usr/spool/mail/bfox?"You have mail":~/shell-mail?"$_ has
mail!"'</code>
<p> (He was immediately hired by an Unnamed Company in Silicon Valley
for an unstated (but huge) salary... but that's beside the point.)

<p>&lt;Shrug&gt; What the heck; I've already gone parasailing and
scuba-diving this month (and will shortly be taking off on a
500-mile sail up the Gulf Stream); let's keep living <em>La Vida
Loca</em>!</p>

<h3>Parameter Expansion</h3>

<p>The built-in parsing capabilities of "bash" are rather minimal
as compared to, say, Perl or AWK; in my best estimate, they're not
intended for serious processing, just "quick and dirty" minor-task
handling. Nevertheless, they can be very handy for that
purpose.</p>

<p>As an example, let's say that you need to differentiate between
lowercase and capitalized filenames in processing a directory - I
ended up doing that with my backgrounds for X, since some of them
look best tiled, and others stretched to full-screen size (file
size wasn't quite a good-enough guide). I "capped" all the names of
the full-sized pics, and "decapped" all the tiles. Then, as part of
my random background selector, "bkgr", I wrote the following:</p>

<pre class="code">
...

# We need _just_ the filename
fn=$(basename $fnm)

# Set the "-max" switch if the test returns 'true'
[ -z "${fn##[A-Z]*}" ] &amp;&amp; MAX="-max"

# Run "xv" with|without the "-max" option based on the test result
xv -root -quit $MAX $fnm &amp;

...
</pre>

<p>Confusing-looking stuff, isn't it? Well, part of it we already
know: the <code>[ -z ... ]</code> is a test for a zero-length
string. What about the other part, though?</p>

<p>In order to 'protect' our parameter expansion result from the
cold, cruel world (e.g., if you wanted to use the result as part of
a filename, you'd need the 'protection' to keep it separate from
the trailing characters), we use curly brackets to surround the
whole enchilada -</p>

<p><code>$d</code> is the same as<code>${d}</code> - except that
the second variety can be combined with other things without losing
its identity, like so:</p>

<pre class="code">
...
d=Digit

# "Digitize"
echo ${d}ize

# "Digital"
echo ${d}al

# "Digits"
echo ${d}s

# "Digitalis"
echo ${d}alis
...
</pre>

<p>Now that we have it isolated from the world, friendless and all
alone... oops, sorry - that's "<em>shell</em> script", not
"<em>horror movie</em> script" - I lose track once in a while...
Anyway, now that we've separated the variable out via the curly
braces, we can apply a few tools incorporated in Bash to perform
some basic parsing. Note that I'm going to show the result after
each 'echo' statement as if that statement had been executed.</p>

<pre class="code">
### Let's pick a nice, longish word to play with.
var="amanuensis"

### ${#var} - return length
echo ${#var}
10

### ${var#word} - cut shortest match from start
echo ${var#*n}
uensis

### ${var##word} - cut longest match from start
echo ${var##*n}
sis

### ${var%word} - cut shortest match from end
echo ${var%n*}
amanue

### ${var%%word} - cut longest match from end
echo ${var%%n*}
ama

### ${var:offset} - return string starting at 'offset'
echo ${var:7}
sis

### ${var:offset:length} - return 'length' characters starting at 'offset'
echo ${var:1:3}
man

### ${var/pattern/string} - replace single match
echo ${var/amanuen/paralip}
paralipsis

### ${var//pattern/string} - replace all matches
echo ${var//a/A}
AmAnuensis
</pre>

<p>(For the last two operations, if the pattern begins with #, it
will match at the beginning of the string; if it begins with %, it
will match at the end. If the string is empty, matches will be
deleted.)</p>

<p>There's actually a bit more to it - things like variable
indirection, and parsing arrays - but, gee, I guess you'll just
have to study that man page yourself. &lt;grin&gt; Just consider
this as motivational material.</p>

<p>So, now that we've looked at the tools, let's look back at the
code -<code>[ -z "${fn##[A-Z]*}" ]</code> Not all <em>that</em>
difficult anymore, is it? Or maybe it is; my thought process, in
dealing with searches and matches, tends to resemble
pretzel-bending. What I did here - and it could be done in a number
of other ways, given the above tools - is match for a max-length
string (i.e., the entire filename) that begins with an uppercase
character. The <code>[ -z ... ]</code> returns 'true' if the
resulting string is zero-length (i.e., matches the [A-Z]* pattern),
and $MAX is set to "-max".</p>

<p>Note that, since we're matching the entire string,
<code>${fn%%[A-Z]*}</code> would work just as well. If that seems
confusing - if <em>all</em> of the above seems confusing - I
suggest lots and lots of experimentation to familiarize yourself
with it. It's easy: set a parameter value, and experiment, like so
-</p>

<pre class="code">
Odin:~$ experiment=supercallifragilisticexpialadocious
Odin:~$ echo ${experiment%l*}
supercallifragilisticexpia
Odin:~$ echo ${experiment%%l*}
superca
Odin:~$ echo ${experiment#*l}
lifragilisticexpialadocious
Odin:~$ echo ${experiment##*l}
adocious
</pre>
...and so on. It's the best way to get a feel for what a certain
tool does; pick it up, plug it in, put on your safety glasses and
gently squuueeeze the trigger. Observe all safety precautions as
random deletion of valuable data may occur. Actual results may vary
and <strong>will</strong> often surprise you.

<h3>Parameter State</h3>
There are times - say, in testing for a range of error conditions
that set different variables - when we need to know whether a
specific variable is set (has been assigned a value) or not. True,
we could test it for length, as I did above, but the utilities
provided by "bash" for the purpose provide convenient shortcuts for
such occasions.

<pre class="code">
joe=

### ${parameter:-word} - If parameter is unset, substitute "word"
echo ${joe:-mary}
mary
echo $joe

### ${parameter:?word} - Display "word" or error if parameter is unset
echo ${joe:?"Not set"}
bash: joe: Not set
echo ${joe:?}
bash: joe: parameter null or not set

### ${parameter:=word} - If parameter is unset, set it to "word"
echo ${joe:=mary}
mary
echo $joe
mary

### ${parameter:+word} - "word" is substituted only if parameter <em>is</em> set
echo ${joe:+blahblah}
blahblah
</pre>

<h3>Array Handling</h3>
Another built-in capability of "bash", a basic mechanism for
handling <em>arrays</em>, allows us to process data that needs to
be indexed, or at least kept in a structure that allows individual
addressing of each of its members. Consider the following scenario:
if I have a phonebook/address list, and want to send my latest
"Sailor's Newsletter" to everyone in the "Friends" category, how do
I do it? Furthermore, say that I also want to create a list of
names of the people I sent it to, or do some other processing...
i.e., it becomes necessary to split it up into fields by length -
and arrays become one of the very few viable options.

<p>Let's look at what this might involve. Here's a clip of a
notional phonebook to be used for the job:</p>

<table border="0" width="700">
<tr>
<td><strong>Name</strong>
</td>
<td><strong>Category</strong>
</td>
<td><strong>Address</strong>
</td>
<td><strong>Email</strong>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Jim &amp; Fanny Friends</td>
<td>Business</td>
<td>101101 Digital Dr. LA CA</td>
<td>fr@gnarly.com</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Fred &amp; Wilma Rocks</td>
<td>friends</td>
<td>12 Cave St. Granite, CT</td>
<td>shale@hill.com</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Joe 'Da Fingers' Lucci</td>
<td>Business</td>
<td>45 Caliber Av. B-klyn NY</td>
<td>tuff@ny.org</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Yoda Leahy-Hu</td>
<td>Friend</td>
<td>1 Peak Fribourg Switz</td>
<td>warble@sing.ch</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Cyndi, Wendi, &amp; Myndi</td>
<td>Friends</td>
<td>5-X Rated St. Holiday FL</td>
<td>3cuties@fl.net</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Whew. This stuff obviously needs to be read in by fields - word
counting won't do; neither will a text search. Arrays to the
rescue!</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash
# 'nlmail' sends the monthly newsletter to friends listed
# in the phonebook

# "bash" would create the arrays automatically, since we'll
# use the 'name[subscript]' syntax to load the variables -
# but I happen to like explicit declarations.

declare -a name category address email

# A little Deep Hackery to make the 'for' loop read a line at a time
OLD=$IFS
IFS='
'
for line in $(cat phonelist)
do
    # Increment the line counter
    ((x++))

    # Load up the 'name' variable
    name[$x]="${line:0:25}"
    
    # etc. for 'category',
    category[$x]="${line:25:10}"
    
    # etc. for 'address',
    address[$x]="${line:35:25}"
    
    # etc. for 'email'...
    email[$x]="${line:60:20}"
done

# Undo the line-parsing magic
IFS=$OLD

...
</pre>
At this point, we have the "phonelist" file loaded into the four
arrays that we've created, ready for further processing. Each of
the fields is easily addressable, thus making the stated problem -
that of e-mailing a given file to all my friends - a trivial one
(this snippet is a continuation of the previous script):

<pre class="code">
...
for y in $(seq $x)
do
    # We'll look for the word "friend" in the 'category' field,
    # make it "case-blind", and clip any trailing characters.
    if [ -z "${category[$y]##[Ff]riend*}" ]
    then
        mutt -a Newsletter.pdf -s 'S/V Ulysses News, 6/2000' ${email[$y]}
        echo "Mail sent to ${name[$y]}" &gt;&gt; sent_list.txt
    fi
done
</pre>
That should do it, as well as pasting the recipients' names into a
file called "sent_list.txt" - a nice double-check feature that lets
me see if I missed anyone.

<p>The array processing capabilities of "bash" extend a bit beyond
this simple example. Suffice it to say that for simple cases of
this sort, with files under, say, a couple of hundred kB, "bash"
arrays are the way to go.</p>

<p>Note that the above script can be easily generalized - as an
example, you could add the ability to specify different
phone-lists, criteria, or actions, right from the command line.
Once the data is broken up into an easily-addressable format, the
possibilities are endless...</p>

<h3>Wrapping It Up</h3>
Bash, besides being very capable in its role as a command-line
interpreter/shell, boasts a large number of rather sophisticated
tools available to anyone who needs to create custom programs. In
my opinion, shell scripting suits its niche - that of a simple yet
powerful programming language - perfectly, fitting between
command-line utility usage and full-blown (C, Tcl/Tk, Perl, Python)
programming, and should be part of every *nix user's arsenal. Linux
encourages the "do it yourself" attitude among its users by giving
them access to powerful tools and the means to automate their usage
- something that I consider a tighter integration (and that much
higher a "usability quotient") between the underlying power of the
OS and the user environment.

<p>Until next month -<br>
Happy Linuxing!</p>

"...Yet terrible as UNIX addiction is, there are worse fates. If UNIX is
the heroin of operating systems, then VMS is barbiturate addiction, the Mac
is MDMA, and MS-DOS is sniffing glue. (Windows is filling your sinuses with
lucite and letting it set.)

You owe the Oracle a twelve-step program."
