<H4>Visible Changes</H4>

LG underwent a bunch of changes this month, some visible and some not.  The
most visible change is the spiffy yellow issues table on the 
<A HREF="../index.html">Front Page</A> and the
<A HREF="../lg_issues.html">Site Map</A> page (formerly known as the Index of
All Issues page).  Another visible change is that several files have been
renamed and symlinks removed:  

<UL>
<LI> lg_frontpage.html is gone, replaced by index.html.
<LI> All lg_toc##.html -&gt; index.html.
<LI> All issue##.html -&gt; TWDT.html.  (Going back as far as issue 77.)
<LI> All issue##.txt.gz -&gt; TWDT.txt.gz.  (Going back as far as issue 77.)
<LI> All symlinks are removed except the "current" link.
</UL> 

This has a few implications for readers:

<OL>
<LI> If you bookmarked the home page of your favorite mirror as lg_frontpage.html,
    you must change the bookmark to index.html or just use the site name:
    <STRONG>http://www.linuxgazette.net/</STRONG>.
<LI> You can continue to bookmark the current issue as
    <STRONG>http://www.linuxgazette.com/current/</STRONG>
    and it will update each month.  This is also useful if you want to 
    download the current issue to your palmtop each month.
<LI> You can access the TWDT versions each month from a persistent URL:
    <STRONG>http://www.linuxgazette.com/current/TWDT.html</STRONG> or
    <STRONG>http://www.linuxgazette.com/current/TWDT.txt.gz</STRONG>.
<LI> Windows users can stop complaining that symlinks don't unpack from
    tarballs on DOS filesystems, because there are no more symlinks!  (Except
    one.)
<LI> The Front Page is reformatted and somewhat less verbose.  More on the way.
<LI> If you have been downloading the FTP tarballs, you have a few obsolete 
    files now.  The disk space is minimal, but if you're obsessed with having
    a perfectly clean directory, delete it all and download lg-base.tar.gz
    and your favorite issues again.  Downloading lg-base-new.tar.gz each month
    only updates and adds files, it doesn't delete obsolete files.

</OL>

Remember, starting with issue 83, you can click the author's name at the top of
any article and go to that person's Author page, which has links to all their
articles in LG, their most current contact information, and sometimes a bit of
random information and a picture too.

<P> The mirrors took a bandwidth hit this month as the files were moving
around, but the files have all settled down now.  There will be another big
shuffle sometime when we convert the 649 old GIFs to PNG/JPG, but that's such a
big job I don't know when we'll be able to do it.  Not just to convert the
files -- that can take five minutes with ImageMagick's <TT>convert</TT>
program, <TT>find</TT> and a small shell script -- but we also have to (1)
decide whether image.png or image.jpg is smaller/looks better for each image,
(2) change the IMG links in all the HTML files, (3) not use transparency, and
(4) look at all the pages on various browsers.  Any volunteers?

<P> For next month, I want to refine the navigation links between articles and
between the global pages.

<P> There is one change which will affect only a couple mirror administrators.
Next to the existing search links, there is a commented link the mirror site
can replace with a link to their own search engine.  The comment format has
changed, and I noticed one misspelling in it ("ENDN" instead of "END").  So
mirror administrators with local LG search engines will have to adjust their
scripts.  There may be further adjustment when the navigation links get
refined.

<H4>Invisible Changes</H4>

The scripts I use to generate LG have been largely rewritten.  Configuration
information is now mostly in YAML (.yml) files.  <A
HREF="http://yaml.org/">YAML</A> is a text-readable data serialization format,
inspired by XML but simpler, and automatically converted to native types
(string, int, float, list, hash, boolean, null, date, etc).  It's still in its
early development stage (the language spec and types are just being finalized
now), but the preliminary Python parser <A
HREF="http://wiki.yaml.org/yamlwiki/PurePythonParserForYaml">PyYAML</A> works,
and there are also parsers for Perl, Ruby and C.  Here are a couple article
entries for this issue, in <STRONG>data/issues/084.yml</STRONG>:

<PRE>
---
key:     arndt
author:  arndt
title:   Office Linux -- Feedback
---
key:     bradley
author:  bradley
title:   Adding Plugin Capabilities To Your Code
</PRE>

"key" is a unique (within the issue) identifier for the article.  "author" is a
link to their Author entry, which is a file in rfc822 (mail message) format.
(I could use YAML for it, but rfc822 is really convenient for this particular
object.) "title" is, um, I think you can guess what that is....

<P> The article header/footer, TOC, Front Page, Site Map, etc, are generated
from <A HREF="http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/">Cheetah</A> templates.  Cheetah
is a free software project I've been a developer on for the past 1 1/2 years.
It's a string template system for Python.  Cheetah has been generating the LG
Mirrors page for several months.

<P> There's a shared "lg" module that reads all the configuration files into
a data structure and pickles it out to a cache file for fast reading.  (Or
actually cPickles it, which is a thousand times faster.)  Then the script
"article" takes the article entry and author(s) entry and puts the
header/footer in the HTML file in place, deleting the previous header/footer
if present.  The "authors" script is more complicated because it has to make
each Author's page as well as the author index, TAG bios index, and 
previous/next links for each.  It also searches through the articles data
to generate the links to all the articles published by each author.

<P> I'm close to having TWDT automated, which I'm very happy about.  No more
manually creating that d*%n thing manually and then having to edit three files
(the original, TWDT.html and TWDT.txt.gz) when an article needs a correction.
Soon I'll be able to change just the original and then run <TT>twdt</TT> and
have it automatically regenerate those two files.  Well, almost.  Heather
generates the TAG column lg_answer and TWDT.lg_answer.html simultaneously from
her mailbox files, and she tells me 'twould be difficult to generate
TWDT.lg_answer.html from lg_answer.  So for TAG corrections I'll still have to
edit three files.

Oddly enough, that was
one thing that the Russians _didn't_ claim for themselves... I guess
they figured that inventing the radio, the light bulb, and the airplane
was enough for anybody. :)

<H4>Iron:</H4>
So how do the Russians claim those things?  I thought Marconi was Italian.

I learned that stuff in school; with a lot of Russians of the previous
generation (mine was already too cynical), it was an article of faith.

<H4>Iron:</H4>
When I was taking Russian in high school (1983), there were a few students
who had travelled to Russia.  One said he'd gotten into an argument with
somebody over whether Pepsi was an American or a Russian invention.

<H4>Ben:</H4>
&lt;laugh&gt; *That* one, I knew for myself. Pepsi's first plant in Russia was
built in Moscow, about a kilometer away from where I was going to
school. At least they started building it; I left Russia just before
they finished it. But I'd have no problem believing your friend about
having had the argument.

<P> Every program is different.  I have no idea what *that* program does,
