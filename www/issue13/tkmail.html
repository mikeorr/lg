<center><h3>Introduction</h3></center>

<p>There are several full-featured text-mode mail clients available for Linux,
and these programs (such as Pine and Elm) are probably the most commonly used
mailers in the Linux/unix world.  One reason for this tendency is that they
run equally well in both console and X sessions (in an xterm).  They also have
a longer development history than their X-windows counterparts which results
in the accretion of more features and options. There has been ample time for
the developers to deal with bugs as well.

<p>Many of the X-windows mailers I've tried have either been too basic, too
beta, or awkward to use.  I've always returned to Pine, my standby.  Recently
two X-based mailers have been released (in late beta versions), both of which
are stable and well-provided with features and options.  When I say stable I
mean that they have functioned well for me, I haven't lost any mail, and
they both have been through several releases in which the most egregious
bugs seem to have been ironed out.

<p>Mail programs are a rather personal sort of software.  I've found it to be
prudent to copy any existing mailbox files or directories to a safe location
before installing any new mail client.  You never know until you try just what
a new mailer will do with your existing mail messages the first time it is
run.  As an example, mbox-style mail "folders" (which are just single files
with messages concatenated) might be willy-nilly transformed into MH-style
directories, with each message becoming an individual numbered file.  I
suppose there may exist a technique to reverse this metamorphosis, but I don't
know what it might be, aside from manually using an editor.

<center><h3>TkMail</h3></center>

<p><a href="mailto: raines@slac.stanford.edu">Paul Raines</a> has been working
on a Tcl/Tk mail client for some time now.  I'll let him describe its
origin:<br>

<pre><i>

   I began the project at the beginning of '92 while a physics
  grad student at the Univ. of Penn.  I had been put in charge
  of several SGI workstations and was disappointed in the X
  window mail readers I had found. I had recently got into
  Tcl/Tk programming and played around with putting Tk
  interfaces on top of command line programs for physics
  simulation.  I figured it would be easy to do one to sit on
  top of the mailx command and did. That produced tkmail 1.x.
  Eventually I decided I was too limited by the mailx command
  and wrote a Perl backend to serve as an extensible
  equivalent. That produced tkmail 2.x.  Perl was used because
  its text processing features were much faster than Tcl but I
  wanted to keep the whole program as scripts for portability.
  This proved a lost cause as Perl proved as hard to port as C
  code.  For my update to work with Tk4.0, I decided to drop
  Perl in favor of writing my own C code as a module extension
  to Tcl. The past year was the last of my graduate career and
  mostly devoted to finishing my thesis leaving little time
  for work on tkmail. It is sort of behind in some of the
  features out there today (MIME, POP, IMAP, etc) but I hope
  to rectify that soon.

            The most important future plans are: 

                   * better MIME support

                   * better key binding customization 
                    
                   * an "auto-filing" feature

                   * better search support </i></pre> <br>

<p>TkMail is very customizable; Paul Raines includes with the distribution an
alternate Tk text-manipulation library which allows the use of emacs-style
key-bindings in the compose window. This library can be used with other Tk
programs as well. Colors and fonts can be independently selected for the
folder-view and compose window.  Much of the configuration can be done from
menu-selections.

<p>Here is a screenshot of the main folder-view window:<br>

<p><center><a href="./gx/ayers/main.gif">Tkmail Main Window</a></center>

<p>And here is one of the composition window:<br>

<p><center><a href="./gx/ayers/comp.gif">the Composition Window</a></center>

<p>TkMail, like many other Linux mailers, in effect acts as a front-end to
sendmail. Luckily most recent Linux distributions come with sendmail
preconfigured. If your inbox is on a POP server you will need to use
popclient, fetchmail, or fetchpop to retrieve your messages and leave them in
a mailbox file on your local disk, where mail clients can find them.

<p>Among the many features of this beta release are:<br>

<ul>
  <li>easy inclusion of files into message compositions with
      automatic uuencoding and compression, if desired
  <li>ability to access an alternate editor from the composition window
  <li>spell check compositions using an X windows interface (using ispell)
  <li>reads aliases from either standard .mailrc or elm aliases.txt
  <li>sorting of messages on any field and the ability to
      write out the folder physically in that order
  <li>simple MIME reading and composition tool
  <li>built in 'biff' icon for notification of new mail
      on multiple folders
  <li>dynamic (at startup) menus for quick access to mail folders
      for reading, copying, and moving messages
</ul><br>

<p>TkMail is set up initially to open a small debugging window from which the
main program can be started.  Once it becomes evident that the program is
working to your satisfaction this can be disabled by editing the main
<b>tkmail4</b> script and changing the line <i>set mfp(debug) 1</i> to <i>set
mfp(debug) 0</i>, or just start it with the <i>-nodebug</i> option.

<p>I have found TkMail 4.0b8 to be easy to learn and use, and its interface is
nice-looking. With a little more work on the MIME abilities it will be as
effective an X mail client as any available.

<p>Paul Raines maintains a
<a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~raines/tkmail.html">home page</a> for
TkMail; the source for the 4.0b8 version is available
<a href="ftp://ftp.slac.stanford.edu/TkMail/BETA/">here</a>.

<center><h3>XFMail</h3></center>

<p>Some months ago John Fisk wrote about the XFmail program in the Gazette.
His account inspired me to try it out, but I had quite a few problems with the
message editing window, so much so that when I tried to mail the developers a
comment on their program, the message was corrupted and I doubt that it was
legible to them.  I gave up and deleted it soon after, making a mental note
to check it out later when perhaps it had become more usable.

<p>Recently I did just that, and found that a new editing module had been
contributed which really makes a difference in usage of the mailer.  No longer
is there a limit to the amount of the text in the editing window.  This
change, I believe, makes XFMail a credible choice as a Linux mail client.

<p>XFMail requires the XForms library.  This is available from 
<a href="http://bragg.phys.uwm.edu/xform">the XForms web-site</a>, which will
always have the latest version and news.  If you obtain the archive be aware
that the package includes a GUI designer as well as many samples.  All you
need to keep if you're not a programmer is the XForms shared and static
libraries (libforms.so.81 and libforms.a) and the header file (forms.h). These
three files will enable you to compile XForms applications, such as XFMail
from source.

<p>In order to try the current beta (which I recommend) you'll need to obtain
the source archive from the
<a href="ftp://Burka.NetVision.net.il/pub/xfmail/work/">
XFMail home FTP site</a>.
As long as you have the XForms library files installed it should compile for
you, notwithstanding the warning message at the FTP site.  If your current
mailbox is in the common mailx format (a single file), you might want to copy
the file (INBOX or whatever) to another location before installing XFMail.
The default behaviour is for XFMail to transform your messages into the
multiple-file MH format; after installation you can disable this and move your
mailbox back.  If you already store your mail in the MH manner the program
will load your messages without moving them.

<p>Even though XFMail reads and stores messages in MH format, it doesn't
require that you have the MH system installed.

<p>This mail client can handle all mail fetching and delivery needs for a
single-user machine.  The user is given the option of using sendmail for
delivery (either on- or off-line), or using XFMail to directly contact the
SMPT server and deliver outgoing mail.  Fetching new mail can be done
externally,(popclient et al), or via XFMail directly.  These features could be
helpful for new users who would rather not deal with sendmail; all functions
can be handled by the mailer.

<p>XFMail has the recognizable XForms look, familiar to users of the Lyx
front-end program for TeX/Latex.  The XForms library gives programs a unique
look, unlike standard X or Motif.  The user interface is perhaps not quite as
fancy as some, but it's not hard to become accustomed to it.  There are some
limitations in choice of colors; the selection available is greater than that
of console-ANSI programs, but less than the amount available to standard X
clients.

<p>Here are some screenshots of the various XFMail windows:<br>

<p><center><a href="./gx/ayers/xf_main.gif">The Main Window</a></center><br>

<center><a href="./gx/ayers/xf_comp.gif">The Composition Window</a></center><br>

<p>And here is the logging window:<br>

<p align=center> <img src="./gx/ayers/xf_log.gif"></p><br>

<p>Among the other features of this mailer are an internal address book, full
MIME support, and support for faces and picons.  Support is planned for
compatibility with mailx-style mail-folders.

<p>XFMail is quite an ambitious programming project; if you do try out the
beta version I'm sure the authors would appreciate hearing any comments you
may have.  There also exists an XFMail mailing list; send a message to:
<a href="mailto:majordomo@Burka.NetVision.net.il">
majordomo@Burka.NetVision.net.il</a>
with "subscribe xfmail" in the message body.

<p>Visit <a href="http://burka.netvision.net.il/xfmail/xfmail.html"
>the XFMail homepage</a> for the latest news; by the time you read this, beta
0.5 may well have been released.

<p>XFMail is being developed by <a href="mailto:gen@NetVision.net.il">
Gennady B. Sorokopud</a> and <a href="mailto:ugen@NetVision.net.il">
Ugen J.S. Antsilevich</a>.
