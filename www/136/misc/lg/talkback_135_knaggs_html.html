There are also a fair number of problems with NX.
</p>

<p>
- It is based on a rather old verson of the X server. That X server has
  several known security bugs. There is a reason most distributions do
  not ship even the open-source NX parts.
- Resuming a session doesn't always work. Murphy says it fails to work
  when it's most likely that your session has important but unsaved data
  in it. :-/
- The song+dance with the separate "nx" user and the client ssh key
  is completely unnecessary. Using a straight ssh login would be a whole
  lot simpler. It would also be more secure, because the user would be
  able to use their ssh keychains instead of typing in a password.
- Relies on a patched ssh client. An <strong>old</strong> ssh client. A patch which
  introduces a lot of code that belongs in a separate program.
</p>

<p>
The fact that the security people of several major distribution have
basically vetoed including NX should tell you something.

I also felt that there were a number of questions about this article.
</p>

<p>
1. Copying the <strong>private</strong> key client_id_dsa.key between numerous
machines seems to be a rather violent deconstruction of public-key use.
Isn't there a way to avoid this?
</p>

<p>
2. If the source for the Ubuntu Linux package is not available NX
cannot be classified as open source. How is it GPL if the source is
not available?
</p>

<p>
3. Isn't there a way to run the NX system as <strong>user</strong> without root
privileges to create an additional user on the system?
</p>

<p>
I did play with the NX server and client from the "kanotix" packages
a long while ago so I might have resolved these questions --- but I do
not recall the answers <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
