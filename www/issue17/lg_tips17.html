X Limitation to 8 Bit Color
</H3>
<P> 
From: Gary Masters <a href="mailto:="mailto:gmasters@devcg.denver.co.us">gmasters@devcg.denver.co.us</a>

<p>I read your question in Linux Gazette regarding an X limitation to 8 bit
color when the system has more than 14 megs of RAM.

Where did you find that information?  I ask because my system has 24 megs
of RAM, and I run 16 bit color all the time.

One difference between our systems is that I am using a Diamond Stealth 64
video card. 

<p>The place I tell X to run in 16 bit mode is in the file
/usr/X11R6/bin/startx.  There is a line in this file that begins with
<tt>serverargs</tt>.  I get 16 bit mode by giving "-bpp 16" as an argument in
this line (e.g. serverargs="-bpp 16").

<p>One problem I did have was that the OpenLook Window Manager (olwm) did not
like 16 bpp mode.  I solved this by switching to the OpenLook Virtual
Window Manager (olvwm)[1].  I also had success using the Tab and FV Window
Managers (twm & fvwm) in 16 bpp mode.


<p>Coming from a SunOS background, I'm used to OpenLook.

Screen Blanking Under X
</H3>
<P> 
From: Gary Masters <a
href="mailto:gmasters@devcg.denver.co.us">gmasters@devcg.denver.co.us</a>

<p>I read your question in the Linux Gazette regarding unwanted screen
blanking under X after upgrading to a newer distribution of Linux.  I had
the same frustration.  Apparently the X servers included in the Xfree86
version distributed with current Linux distributions has screen blanking
compiled as a default behavior.

<p>This behavior can be controlled with the -s option to the server.  Look in
the startx script for a line that begins with serverargs and add "-s 0".
This will disable the X screen blank.

Doubleclick Internet User Profiles
</H3>
<P> 
From: Kragen Javier Sittler <a href="mailto:kragen@pobox.com">kragen@pobox.com</a>

<p>Check out the description of what doubleclick.net does at 
<a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/frames/adinfo/dartset.htm">http://www.doubleclick.net/frames/adinfo/dartset.htm</a>

<p>Then decide whether you want to be added to their database of Internet
user profiles.  If not, you can use the script below; I run it in my
<pre>/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1</pre>.  It prevents any DoubleClick banners from being
displayed, prevents any cookies from being set, and prevents DoubleClick
from collecting any data on you.

<p>It also does the same thing with linkexchange.com, because I find their
constant banners and requests for cookies annoying.  If you'd prefer,
you can take out the linkexchange lines.

<p>However, this will also keep you from receiving *any* information from
doubleclick or linkexchange directly... so you can't visit their web
sites either.

<p>On my machine, I put the script in <pre>/etc/rc.d/rc.doubleclick</pre> and run
it from <pre>/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1</pre> at boot time, so I'm always protected from
DoubleClick.

How to Mount/Unmount For Users

<P> 
From: Kidong Lee <a href="mailto:kidong@shinbiro.com">kidong@shinbiro.com</a>


<p>When I mount/umount file, I have to login as root.
It's not convenient for me & other users.
but, I found the solution that user who is not root can do mount/umount
in mount man page. 

<p>Take a look at /etc/fstab.
<pre>
# <device>    <mountpoint>   <filesystemtype> <options> <dump>
<fsckorder>
/dev/hdb      /cdrom         iso9660          ro,user   0      0
</pre>
<p>Note "user" in options field.
In options field, if you add "user", users can do mount/umount.

File Transfer With the z Protocol
</H3>
<P> 
From: Gregor Gerstmann, <a href="mailto:gerstman@tfh-berlin.de">gerstman@tfh-berlin.de</a>

<p>Regarding Linux Gazette issue16, April 1997, I have some remarks
regarding the article on file transfer with the z protocol: 
'I type sz <filename> things go along fine, until about 40K
then I get a couple of different error messages....'
We have an internal modem with a transfer rate of 2880 cps on
the telephone line. My son has an account at a Berlin university
with a limited capacity of 5MB. We found the same error but not
limited to a special file size! During the night hours, between 1
and 5h local time, when telephone costs are lowest, we sometimes
transfered files up to 100KB without errors!
To avoid any errors at all, I limited the packages to 20 * 1024
= 20480 bytes, if a CRC occurs, transfer begins once more but with-
out timeout error, because the parcels are small. I use two proce-
dures: the first, Chop, generates another procedure that chops the
file to be transfered with the help of dd into packages and regu-
lates the transfer and removing of transfered packages. At home we
concatenate the packages again with cat ... ... > ... and everything
is ok. The last step could be done by a procedure too.
Of course, it is rather simple software, but it works until we
will use ISDN.
<p>

Using ftp Commands in Shellscript
</H3>
<P> 
From: Walter Harms, <a href="mailto:Walter.Harms@Informatik.Uni-Oldenburg.DE">Walter.Harms@Informatik.Uni-Oldenburg.DE</a><br>


Using FTP as a shell-command with ftplib<br>
<p>Working on several different networks means that you always
need to copy your data from net to net. Most ppl use rcp but like most SysOps
I found this to be a terrible security hole. So as I started this job my first
business was to rewrite several scripts that were using rsh,rcp etc.
I replaced them with an ftp based script ftp - &ltinput&gt out 2&gt out.err. 
It's easy to
see that this was not a good idea because ftp was not intended as shell-commando
like cp,mv and the other guys. So I was happy to find the ftplib on a
linux-CD. It's a nice lib that I used to build cmds like ftpmv, ftpcp, ftprm..
This made my scripts much slimmer and simpler. I have some terrible 
copy-scripts running but no problems copying on different systems
like Ultrix or AIX.

<p>Example using ftpget (from the ftplib Author Thomas Pfau)
<pre>ftpget sunsite.unc.edu -r /pub/Linux ls-lR.gz</pre>
This command reads the file <pre>/pub/Linux/ls-lR.gz from sunsite.unc.edu</pre>

Likewise there are other commands with the lib: ftpdir ,ftpsend, ftprm

<p>Who needs ftplib?<br> 
Everybody tired of typing ftp... every evening to
get the latest patches or whatever. Everyone who is regularly copying
with ftp the same Datafiles.

<p>Why use ftplib?<br>
Of course you can add it to you own application but more experienced users don't
have to use these r-commands anymore. An ftpd is available for the
majority of systems so it is easier to access more of them.

<p>Any drawbacks?<br>
Of course, for any ftp session you need a user/paswdr. I copy into
public area using  anonymous/email@ others will need to surly a
password at login, what is not very useful for regular jobs or
you have to use some kind of public login but still I think it's 
easier and better to use than the r-cmds.

ACSII-Artwork Translator
</H3>
<P> 

Here is something interesting which you might consider for publication.
It is a short program written in LEX and C, which takes ASCII-Artwork
and translates it into HTML 3.0 compliant table data.

It is a pretty interesting idea, and as far as I know, I'm the first
person to try something like this, or automate the process.

The translator (a2t) has a few options:
<p>
<ul>
<li>-x :  reverse the output
	This is because some ASCII-Artwork is meant to be seen as
	black on white and not white on black.

<li>-r value
<li>-g value
<li>-b value  
	Sets constant r,g, and or b, rgb values, so that the resulting
	"grayscale" output can be altered to shades of a color.

<li>-w value
	Sets the width of the resulting table.
</ul>
<p>The program was completed just today, so it is very new.  I've 
released it under the GNU license agreement.

<p>For some examples of the output generated by a2t, see:
	<a href="http://wilkes.edu/~pkeane">http://wilkes.edu/~pkeane</a><br>

I think you'll find the results to be pretty amusing, and slightly
more interesting than the usual bag of HTML table-tricks.
<p>
Enjoy--

Including Graphics in Linuxdoc SGML

You can already include PostScript images in Linuxdoc-SGML which
will get included in TeX output (and consequently in DVI and
PostScript).  Linuxdoc-SGML doesn't support images for HTML,
however.
<p>
An example:
<pre>
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;eps file = "neuro"&gt
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;label id = "decade"&gt;
Decade of the brain
&lt;/figure&gt;
</pre>

<p>You can make references to the figure with <tt>&lt;ref id="decade"&gt;</tt>

<p>PostScript is already supported and the developer version of SGML-Tools
(the successor of Linuxdoc-SGML) now supports HTML as well.  You
can specify a PostScript and a GIF file and depending on the output
(TeX or HTML) the respective image will be included.

X Configuration Issues
</H3>
<P> 

Date: Wed Apr 2 12:15:54 1997<BR>
From: Michael J. Hammel, <a href="mailto:mjhammel@emass.com">mjhammel@emass.com</a>
<p>If you get sufficiently tweaked by the X monitor config problems, 
I
suggest X Inside's AcceleratedX package.  Its much simpler to configure
than the XFree package for both cards and monitors.  I used to work
for them, but haven't in over a year.  I still use their package because
its the easiest to handle all the video card/monitor details.

<p>BTW, the monitor setup is menu based.  If your monitor is not listed 
you can just use one of the multisync if single frequency generic 
configs.  No dot clocks, but you do need to no your monitors frequency
capabilities.  These should be listed in the monitors cdocumetntation.

<p>The package is a commercial distribution and runs about $100 (last time
I checked). They change their name to Xi Graphics recently and the domain
for xinside.com might not be working right now. Try <a
href="http://www.xig.com">http://www.xig.com</a>.

Multiple X Displays
</H3>
<P> 

Date: Wed Apr 2 13:38:08 1997<br>                   
From: Michael J. Hammel <a href="mailto:mjhammel@emass.com">mjhammel@emass.com</a><BR>

<p>Setting up the software is probably fairly straight forward.  I've
never used MetroX (I use AcceleratedX instead), however.  Basically
you'll have two choices:
<ol>
<li> Multiple displays (host:0.0 and host:1.0)
<li> Multiple screens of the same display (host:0.0 and host:0.1)
</ol>
<p>The second choice is the one you need if you want to move the mouse
between the two monitors - like when the mouse goes past the right edge
of the first monitor it shows up on the left edge of the second monitor.
You'll have to check with Metro to find out which of these options is
supported and how to configure for it.

<p>The hardware problem is tougher.  The problem lies in the fact that PC's
were not originally designed with the idea that multiple display
adapters would be installed.  The BIOS looks for an adapter at certain 
locations (IRQ, I/O address) and, unless the second card is configurable
to some other address, the system will find multiple cards.  What
happens next is in-determinant.  Some systems won't boot.  Some do but
don't display to either monitor correctly.  

<p>The trick is to find video adapters that were designed to be used 
in conjunction with other video adapters.  Many are not.  The easiest
way for you to find out is check with Metro about what combinations of
video adapters they know work together.  Chances are good the ones you
have don't.  I know X Inside had a list of cards they knew work 
together.  You could search their web site (http://www.xinside.com or
http://www.xig.com) and see if that info is still there.

<p>Hope this helps.

 After fiddling with the xf86config file in a concerted effort to coax X
 into displaying 16 bit color, I was dismayed to learn that with my
 current hardware (16 megs RAM and a Cirrus Logic GL-5426) 16 bit color
 is *impossible*...not because of any hardware in-capability, but because
 of a certain limitation of X Windows itself...a problem with linear
 addressing. Seems that to have 16 bit color under X, one must have
 linear addressing enabled, which only works if the system has *no more
 than 14 megs RAM*. 

<p>Horse hockeys.  16 bit color is a limitation of the video subsystem and
has nothing to do with the memory of your system.  Linear addressing in
the XFree86 X servers might be tied to system memory amounts, but that
would be a limitation in the XFree86 server, not in X.  X defines
"method without policy", so such limitations just aren't built into X.

<p>A couple of things you should note:  The number of colors available
under 16bit displays is actually *less* than the number available to
8bit displays.  Why this is true has to do with the way 16bit display
hardware works.  The actual color palette for 8 bit displays can have
millions of colors - it can only display 256 colors at a time, however.
Frugal use of colormaps can allow you to have nearly exactly the right
colors for any given application.  16 bit displays only have a palette
of 65k (roughly) colors.  Once those are used up, you're outta luck.

<p>I'm not completely clear on what makes this difference such a problem
but if you visit the Gimp User's mailing list (see the Linux Graphics
mini-howto:  http://www.csn.net/~mjhammel/linux/lgh.html) and ask this
question you'll get similar replies.  Its been discussed quite at length
on the developers list, and most of them read the User's list.

<p>BTW, if you want to see if Linear Addressing is the real problem, try
the X Inside AcceleratedX demo server and see if it works in 16 bit 
color for you.  Generally, your video card needs at least 1M of on board
RAM (not system memory - this is video memory on the video card) to
run in 16Bit mode, but then you'll probably only be able to run in 
640x480 or (at most) 800x600 resolution.  To run at higher resolutions
you'll need more video memory.

<p>Hope this helps.

Figuring Out the Boot Process</BR>

One of the things that is confusing about Linux at first is which files
Linux uses to load programs and get the system started at bootup. Once
you figure out which programs are run during the boot process, which
order are they run? Here is an easy solution. 

<p>On my Red Hat 4.0 system, the /etc/rc.d directory tree is where
everything happens. There are a lot of shell scripts in this set of
directories that are run when the system boots. To give yourself a
little more info, add some echo statements to the files. For example:
<pre>
edit /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit and add the following lines at the beginning

echo " "
echo "**** Running /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit ****
echo " "
</pre>
<p>Now when the system is booting you can see exactly when rc.sysinit is
run, and what programs it launches. Repeat the above process for all the
scripts you find. 

<p>Now if the system hangs or gives an error during bootup you have a
better idea of where to look. If you don't have any problems while
booting then at least you have more info about what Linux is doing.

I read your article about ftping home with dynamic IPs.. Here's
something you might need if you get tired of looking at the screen every
time you want to find out the IP.
<pre>
ADDRESS=`/sbin/ifconfig | awk 'BEGIN { pppok = 0}
                          /ppp.*/ { pppok = 1; next }
                          {if (pppok == 1 ) {pppok = 0; print} }'\
                          | awk -F: '{print $2 }'| awk  '{print $1 }'`

</pre>
<p>Just replace the ppp.* with whatever you want (if you have multiple
ppps running). The easiest thing would to be write a script called ftphome
(or similar) and make it first assign the address and then doing ftp or
ncftp $ADDRESS. The snippet is originally from a local firewall, at the part
where it needs to know what its' own address is. :-)
