<h1>Building the HUDMOF</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/raby.html">Dale Raby</A></b></p>

<p>

<p>What does Linux need to do in order to supplant Windows as the
dominant OS on the desktop? This is a legitimate question often
asked, but never answered very well.</p>

<p>Part of this may have to do with the basic makeup of people
working on an OS that is almost designed not to be profitable. Such
individuals often do not think like capitalists. Perhaps it is
time to start thinking that way.</p>

<p>Profit is not necessarily a dirty word. I do not hold Bill Gates
in contempt because he is a millionaire many times over. He got
that way by supplying a product. In that, he is no different from
J. K. Rowling, now the richest woman in England. Why should the
rest of us Muggles not do the same?</p>

<p>Perhaps a better model corporate citizen for us to examine might
be Apple's CEO Steven Jobs. Aside from being somewhat of a
crackpot (in good company, I might add), he too, supplied a
product... and developed a market for that product where there had
not been one earlier. As testimony to his success... how many of
you cut your teeth (pun intended) on an Apple IIe or an early
MacIntosh?</p>

<p>An interesting point about Apple in the early years is the fact
that they designed software to work on one specific set of hardware
products and marketed them both as a single conglomerate product.
Since they did not have an XYZ Corporation's made-in-(insert
country of contemptuous choice) ISA interface holographic display
card in their hardware, they didn't have to worry about some kind
of machine ghost materializing whenever anyone tried to use it with
another manufacturer's tri-D manipulation device.</p>

<p>The Home User Desktop Machine Of the Future (HUDMOF) will be a
conglomerate machine that supports only the hardware in the
conglomeration. While other hardware might work, whoever builds the
HUDMOF has no incentive to support hardware built and sold by a
competitor... though if the Linux kernel is used, such support will
be available at little or no cost. Also, it will WORK with all the
hardware items in the conglomeration.</p>

<p>We, the Linux Community, need to take a leaf from Capitalism's
book and start competing for the desktop market. How would we
compete? Well, price point is one thing. Free is pretty hard to
beat... but there is no reason why we cannot sell it and make a
profit. What is sold is not the OS itself, but rather, customer
service. Having had my head bitten off from time to time asking
dumb questions on various lists (you know who you are), I can say
that we could all improve our people skills.</p>

<p>You sell customer service by either offering it with the price
of the boxed distribution, or the download. You could, I suppose,
offer it as a separate option <em>a la</em> LinuxCare. You could also use the
OS to sell your hardware, with the OS pre-installed on it. What to
sell and how to sell it depends upon the business model you are
shooting for. In any case, as the OS itself is open-source, you
HAVE to sell something else to make a profit.</p>

<p>Another point is reliability, which Linux excels at, once it is
set up. This is something that is a real advantage over Windows. We
should exploit that advantage before it disappears. Remember,
Longhorn is on the horizon. Windows 98 was an improvement over
Windows 95, and Windows 2000 and ME were improvements as well. Most
probably Windows XP followed that trend (I don't own a copy) and
Longhorn will as well.</p>

<p>The HUDMOF will be reliable.</p>

<p>Security... need I even mention that one? I am a paranoid
individual about my own system. I run a Linux Floppy Firewall on a
separate machine. IPTables has instructions to drop everything I do
not specifically request. The Windows machines I maintain in my
house are all behind this firewall as are the Linux boxes... and as
will be the Apple Newton when I get it hooked up. I don't use
wireless. Why give crooks an even break? Physical security consists
of locked doors and a former soldier with a shotgun.</p>

<p>A system that is designed to have separate user accounts is
definitely the way to fly, as far as I am concerned. I don't have
to worry about anyone getting into my email or deleting an
important document, and I don't have bookmarks for Bild Magazine,
Days of Our Lives, Pokemon, or any other websites I never visit
cluttering up my list. Those are in the home directories of other
users where they belong. Others might prefer a single user setup.
To each his own.</p>

<p>For those who prefer separate accounts for each user in the
household, passwords and separate home directories make for good
virtual neighbors. The HUDMOF should have multi-user capability
built-in... and iron-clad security.</p>

<p>Ease of installation/use. Now we have a problem. I've played
with Red Hat, Fedora, Mandrake, Debian, Gentoo, Knoppix, Storm,
DamnSmallLinux, and SmallLinux. Some of these distributions are
extremely easy to use, most notably DamnSmallLinux and Knoppix.
Others, most notably Gentoo and Debian require... hmmm... actual
intelligence.</p>

<p>Now, a true geek might say something like "to Hades with all
those GUI wimps who can't understand how to use fdisk to partition
a hard drive!" This is, however, short-sighted in the extreme.
"Those GUI wimps" are the ones who will be spending their
hard-earned dollars and/or valuable time. They need to be courted,
not snubbed.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs and Bill Gates both supplied a product that met a
demand. They are continuing to do so. That is how to put Linux on
the desktop, by supplying a demand, and a part of that demand is
going to be a certain amount of "hand-holding".</p>

<p>The Linux Community has been trying to sell Linux for more than
a decade now. Ralph Waldo Emerson once said: "Build a better
mousetrap and the public will beat a path to your door."</p>

<p>Dale Raby's Corollary to Ralph's Mousetrap: "If you have to beat
a path to the public's doors, there is something wrong with your
mousetrap."</p>

<p>So what might be wrong with our mousetrap? Why are people not
migrating in droves to an OS that is more reliable, more secure,
and being "sold" at an unbeatable price? What demand are we not
supplying that Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are?</p>

<p>Part of it is simple customer service, as noted earlier in this
article, or rather, the lack thereof, in the case of many Linux
distributions/binaries. Not to point any fingers regarding my
experiences in the early days... <em>aber, sprechen Sie Deutsch?</em></p>

<p>I once called Apple about a MacIntosh 512K. I got to speak to an
actual person who listened to my questions. She explained that
Apple no longer stocked any parts or software for this fine
antique, but referred me to Sun Remarketing. Microsoft also
answered my questions politely and provided answers. Indeed, they
maintain a vast database of solutions to problems... even with
legacy hardware/software.</p>

<p>The HUDMOF should have first-rate customer service.</p>

<p>Even better than customer service would be quality control. If
your quality control is up to snuff, you don't have to worry about
customer service nearly as much. Ever had an application not do
what it is supposed to do? Quality control issue. Applications
should work as soon as they are installed with no tweaking. Many
Linux applications DO NOT work without some CLI voodoo.</p>

<p>Mutt is a prime example of a potentially great binary that
doesn't work as it should... "right out of the box". Before you can
even start, you have to create a .muttrc file. This is not
necessarily a bad thing as it allows the user to configure Mutt to
behave exactly as he wants it to. But would it be too much to ask
for a default ./muttrc with commented out instructions on what has
to be entered where?</p>

<p>Then there are other applications that must work with Mutt in
order to make a usable email package. You need to have Exim,
Sendmail, Fetchmail and/or other MTA up and properly configured on
your system in order to send and receive mail. Mutt documentation
does not help with these very much... and the user manuals for
these applications are definitely all in GeekSpeak.</p>

<p>Mutt is only being picked on as an example because of my
never-ending frustration with training it. Realistically, it will
not likely be found on many home user workstations. It will forever
be a geek's favorite pet. Compared with the ease of use built-in
with clients like Evolution, Sylpheed, and Pine, though, Mutt has
much ground to cover in this specific area.</p>

<p>I have a long-time friend who runs a dairy farm in North-Eastern
Wisconsin. He is still using a 486 PC running Windows 3.1. Why, one
might ask, has he not updated his system?</p>

<p>The answer is not lack of intelligence. He and I played chess on
the same high school team and took third at state. Considering the
fact that we had the national champions in our conference, that was
quite an accomplishment. He runs a profitable business with more in
assets than the average computer store... and at a much smaller
margin.</p>

<p>He is also not a Luddite. While you will find an occasional
piece of antique machinery on his farm, the ones in use every day
are modern and efficient. No Ford 9N tractor with a spark-ignition
engine pulling a 2-bottom plow, but rather an Allis-Chalmers
four-wheel-drive Diesel pulling a very large chisel plow. I
recently helped to install an air suspension seat in the
air-conditioned cab of one of these machines.</p>

<p>He also has on his farm several tools that date from his
father's time, his grand-father's time, and even his
great-grand-father's time. They range from hammers to shovels to
blacksmithing tools to tractors and other farm implements.</p>

<p>Why has the milking stool not been replaced? How 'bout a
carpenter's claw hammer? Maybe the Marlin model 1895 deer rifle in
44-40 WCF? Same reason the computer has not been replaced: they
just work.</p>

<p>Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS, despite their limitations, were
extremely robust operating systems. How often have you out there
picked up a roadside scrounge machine and upon bringing it home and
booting it up found Windows 3.1 happily rising to the occasion for
whatever use you had for it? I've never had a 3.1 machine die on
me... they all survived long enough to be either given away or
parted out. A large portion of the reason for this, I suspect, was
the fact that they were fairly simple and designed to run on a
small subset of hardware components.</p>

<p>The aforementioned farmer, Greg will come in late at night after
milking 80 cows, maybe delivering a calf or two, and fixing a
broken manure spreader outdoors in below freezing temperatures
while his wife holds the flashlight and hands him tools. It might
be that his foot hurts because a 1200 pound animal stepped on it.
Quite possibly he skinned his knuckles when a bolt-head broke off
in the wrench. Almost certainly he got a bill earlier in the mail
for fuel, feed, or veterinary services.</p>

<p>If, when he comes in late and wants to use his computer for some
reason, (or just as likely, Diane, the long-suffering, frost-bitten
farmer's wife) he wants to push a button, wait for it to boot, and
then have it do the task he has set for it with no complaining. He
isn't interested in excuses from a customer service rep or a
computer tech at the local distribution point. (My favorite was
always "Well, that's Windows!" ) He certainly does not want to be
bothered with having to learn C, Ruby, Perl or Python in order to
tweak some application and/or recompile a kernel from source.</p>

<p>Greg is a farmer. He knows how to get cows to produce milk. He
can deliver calves even when they come out backwards. We once
delivered one where the cow ended up with a prolapsed uterus and
had to hold the cow down until the vet arrived. (Go ahead and try
to hold a thousand pound plus animal down some day while her uterus
is hanging out on the ground! It is an enlightening experience to
anyone who thinks himself physically strong.) He knows how to plant
seeds and rotate crops. He knows about manure management. What? You
think manure manages itself? It's a commodity just like any other...
and it has to be managed such that it produces maximum fertilizer
and little, if any, runoff.</p>

<p>Now, I am sure that Greg could learn how to initiate all the
tricks that Linux can do with a command line on a Bourne Again
Shell. I am also sure he won't bother... he just doesn't have the
time or the inclination. I'm quite certain that the rest of us
would also rather that Greg keep on milking cows so that we don't
have to have a milk-cow in the back yard, (remember, manure
management on a small scale involves the use of a shovel and a
wheelbarrow) though if you want one, I'm sure that Greg will sell
you one!</p>

<p>Most home users are like Greg in some way or another. We use our
computers for web-browsing, email, word-processing, scheduling ,
and finance management. Each of us might have other tasks we put it
to... maybe video production, or, as in Greg's case, the lineage of
his herd.</p>

<p>Most of us also have children. Educational software has its
place, and there needs to be more of it ported for Linux. In the
main, however, the Internet will be supplying more and more
information for the education of our children.</p>

<p>Some children will take to a CLI and a green or amber screen
like a duck to water... but most of them will not. They'll want the
machine to do what they want it to, i.e.: allow them to compose a
book-report. They aren't going to be interested in learning how to
use Tex for that purpose.</p>

<p>One other difficulty has been buying a turn-key system. Now,
until recently, one could not just go out and buy a computer with
Linux installed on it. It is much easier to do so now than it once
was... case in point: machines marketed by Wal-Mart running Linare Linux
(for UNDER $200.00!) and IBM desktop machines offered with Red Hat Linux
installed.</p>

<p>In order for Linux to be the desktop machine of choice for
somebody like Greg the Dairy Farmer, it had better be available as
a turn-key system. He has never installed an operating system, and
really doesn't want to learn how. Thanks to IBM, Wal-mart, and a
few others, this is now a viable option. The HUDMOF will be a
turn-key system.</p>

<p>Updates are a practical necessity. Of late, one can avoid the
dependency nightmares I used to encounter by the use of tools like
YUM. To download updates, one should be able to click one button or
enter one simple command. The HUDMOF will have that feature built
in.</p>

<p>Likewise installing new applications should also be just that
easy. Nobody likes to hunt down obscure packages that may or may
not work properly with a certain flavor of Linux. Synaptic and Yum
are great tools for package installation... but they are not
complete. Try entering "YUM install newtonlink" into your command
line.</p>

<p>Fedora's latest set of binaries cannot always be downloaded from
certain mirrors because of compatibility problems. This really
sucks. Quality control, Fedora! Standards!</p>

<p>Much has been written in the trade journals regarding
"disk-less" systems. With the price of disk drives having huge
storage capacities falling like Michael Jackson's popularity, this
is not considered as necessary as it once was. It is still a viable
model, however.</p>

<p>For small businesses, one only need purchase a single "big
muscle" machine that acts as a file server, and runs applications.
This machine can be networked with lesser machines... disk-less
PC's or what are being called "thin clients"... and operated
remotely using SSH or any one of several other remote desktop
clients. The big muscle machine can run pretty much any
distribution that meets the prime needs; Red Hat or Fedora, Debian,
or name your favorite flavor. In the case of a home-user, the big
muscle machine may not even be necessary.</p>

<p>The disk-less machines in this model need not be anything
special, and any of them could serve the home user as the sole
element, though there is no real reason not to have a full-featured
machine in the basement other than expense. Now, obviously, one
need not have a hard drive for this "disk-less" machine, by
definition. One need not even have a CD/DVD drive. Modern flash
memory, and probably other technologies on the horizon can easily
handle the storage needs of most general users. Actual RAM is
getting cheaper by the minute, and it is already quite inexpensive
enough to easily build machines sporting more than a GB of memory.
This is quite enough to load the entire OS into a ramdisk. Can you
say "fast"?</p>

<p>The exception might be home video &amp; sound production. Video
requires huge storage and processing capacity, and if the end
result is a DVD, then obviously a DVD-RW drive will be necessary.
Even these difficulties could be managed with remote storage, or
even home storage devices that are not in the machine.</p>

<p>If one can get away without any physical drives, one is well on
the way to an engineer's dream; a machine without moving parts.
There is no disk to spin up to speed, thus no extra power
requirements for that, nor is there the need for a CPU fan in many
cases or a cooling fan in the power supply. A simple radiator type
cooling system with heat fins like a Briggs &amp; Stratton
lawn-mower engine has will suffice.</p>

<p>It is also quite evident that such a machine will be able to run
with very low power requirements. I no longer drive an '82 Olds
Ninety-Eight, I drive a '91 Ford Escort. I am considering
converting my house to run on LEDs for illumination. My RCA tube
radio is in the garage on a shelf while the solid-state electronic
devices have taken over. Anybody see a trend? Look for that trend
to continue.</p>

<p>The HUDMOF will be energy efficient.</p>

<p>Two Linux distributions really stand out in the disk-less model;
Knoppix, and DamnSmallLinux. Both of these distributions are
live-CD, Debian-based, and DamnSmallLinux could be considered a
"hack" of Knoppix, though the principal developer would dispute
that claim... and justifiably so. (Note: the latest Knoppix
distributions will have an option for live CD and another intended
for HD installation.)</p>

<p>One need only put the CD for each of them into the CD-ROM drive
and turn the "damn" thing on. In most cases, all hardware is
detected and configured properly during the initial boot process
with no digital complaining of any kind. The one issue that seems,
in my own experience, to be not so smooth with both of these
distributions is that of printer setup. All peripherals should be
detected and configured properly during the boot process... and
that includes the printer. Now, it is fairly unusual for me to
print anything these days, going paperless makes a lot of sense...
but that is another issue to be dealt with later.</p>

<p>Most PCs can run either of these distributions, though there are
greater memory requirements with Knoppix which is really quite
full-featured compared to DamnSmallLinux. Also, the latest release
of Knoppix will not run on some of my older hardware that the
earlier version will. If you only have basic needs for a disk-less
system, DSL will serve you quite well, and with a minimum of fuss.
If you want more packages get the latest Knoppix live CD
distribution.</p>

<p>Wyse makes one of their Winterm Thin Clients, the S50, available
running Wyse Linux V6. I have no experience with Thin Clients, and
am unsure if this machine would serve a home user or not. I suspect
that it would under many circumstances. One would have to provide
storage devices for it... either USB Iomega Zip drives or pen
drives, other storage media, or, even better, an on-line server in
a remote location equipped with high-end RAID devices, regular
backups, and security administration.</p>

<p>I recently cobbled up a system for a neighbor running
DamnSmallLinux on an IBM Pentium 100 machine. This machine has a
web browser, an email client, a word-processor, and several other
common applications. I installed the OS onto a hard drive I had
laying around, but I would not have needed that if it had an Ethernet
NIC installed. The machine will meet the needs of this man and his
family for years to come, I suspect, and it was already an obsolete
machine when delivered.</p>

<p>Had I wished, I could have made this a highly-efficient
disk-less system with multiple interface ports in a physical size
smaller than O'Reilly's book, Running Linux. As neither I nor my
neighbor has any money, I decided to recycle hardware I was no
longer using.</p>

<p>If a device could be built, in quantity, with item-specific
off-the-shelf components, perhaps with an OS either on an old-fashioned ROM
chip or a Flash memory module running a pared-down Linux kernel without
superfluous drivers that would no longer be necessary, the dream of a
computer in every home could at last be realized. Indeed, using cutting
edge hardware such as that produced by <a
href="http://gumstix.org">Gumstix</a>, with further development, it is
conceivable that even a dirt-poor third-world slash-and-burn subsistence
farmer could one day afford to purchase and run a solar-powered machine to
expand his world and give some level of hope to his children that they
might not presently have.</p>

<p>All computers need some kind of monitor. The latest trend seems
to be LCD monitors, though many of us still use the old CRT
monitors. I even have one made by Zenith capable of full color,
amber, or green screens. CRT monitors are on the way out. They are
stable, inexpensive, and as they are a mature technology, quite
reliable. They take far too much power to operate, however, and
they are too large and heavy.</p>

<p>LCD monitors are less expensive to operate, but more expensive
to purchase initially. They can be made flat and take up far less
space on the desk top. One of their problems is that children love
to touch the screen... often damaging it. Autistic children
especially like to see the weird patterns when they push their
fingers against the screen.</p>

<p>A relatively recent technology is e-paper, which has to
potential to supplant all the previous display technologies... at
least until holographic display leaves the realm of science fiction
and joins us in the real word. Sony, among others, has been
developing this technology... and even using Linux in the
process.</p>

<p>The HUDMOF will use an e-paper display.</p>

<p>Printers are crude and need to be replaced as soon as possible.
There will, for the foreseeable future, still be a need for printed
documents, but this is more and more to soothe the worries of the
user than any other purpose. Printers are expensive to buy,
expensive to operate, expensive to repair, and none too reliable
due to the need to manipulate physical media with
electro-mechanical devices.</p>

<p>Within a very short time, comparatively speaking, there will no
longer be a demand for conventional printed matter. Newspapers and
magazines will change to a subscription web site. Books will become
e-books... though there will still be printed books for some time
to come.</p>

<p>The last letter I ever actually wrote and snail-mailed was
composed on a Tandy 600 and printed with an Epson dot-matrix
printer. This will give you some idea of how long ago that was.
Since that time, all my letters have been emailed. I almost never
print physical documents any longer. All my writing is handled
electronically and distributed that way as well. About the only
things I still print are shipping labels for books I sell on Ebay.
Now what was it I said about books in the previous paragraph?</p>

<p>The HUDMOF will eventually be without an interface for a
printer. The few occasions where a printed document is needed will
be supplied by on-line providers and snail-mailed out. The only
exception might be, for a while, shipping labels for packages.</p>

<p>Probably the HUDMOF will be a conglomerate of many features
mentioned here... and very likely several others I didn't mention.
It will be:</p>

<ul>
<li>a turn-key system.</li>

<li>extremely reliable.</li>

<li>inexpensive.</li>

<li>networked.</li>

<li>simple to setup and use with readily available customer
support.</li>

<li>physically compact.</li>

<li>upgradeable to some degree.</li>

<li>efficient to run.</li>

<li>a hardware/software conglomeration.</li>

<li>without a printer port.</li>

<li>with an e-paper display.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, nobody has reached that ideal as of yet, but Sony, Wyse,
Knoppix, Gumstix, and DamnSmallLinux represent some of the best
implementations in this direction I have seen thus far. High end
bloat-ware from Microsoft running on innumerable hardware platforms
and even higher-end Apple products will not fit into this niche...
though if Apple were to revitalize development on the Newton OS,
and reduce the price, they might have something eventually. The
Newton was truly the closest to the HUDMOF that has ever been
actually produced... though the designers of the early Macs had the
right idea as well.</p>

<p>I now lay down the gauntlet and challenge the manufacturers.
This, I decree, will be the recipe for Linux conquering the
desktop... and making somebody somewhere richer than Gates. All.
You. Have. To. Do. Is. Build. It.</p>

<p>If you build it, they will come. IBM? Sony? Wyse? Gumstix? Klaus
Knopper? John Andrews? You guys all listening? Steve Jobs? Bill
Gates? Somebody build me a HUDMOF! Now just wait for the public to beat
the path to your door, for you have fixed the mousetrap.</p>
