</FONT>

<P> Integrated Computer Solutions, Inc. have announced  the first port of Motif to the 
upcoming IA64 platform from Intel. ICS says that this is important for the Linux community, 
because most of the existing Enterprise applications written for UNIX 
platforms (e.g., Suns, HP, SGI, etc.) use Motif as a GUI toolkit. Without 
the port of Motif to the IA64, it will be difficult and expensive for 
Enterprises to migrate to Linux.
