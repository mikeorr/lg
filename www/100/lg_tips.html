<P>
Some of you will have expressed questions like: "When will XYZ be in
stable" or "is there a backport for such and such". You can in fact
backport packages yourself. For such cases, the following procedure works:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
(note: I maintain a number of backported debs, and this routine works)...
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
1. Add a deb-src line for sid to your sources.list. Typically:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>deb-src http://www.mirror.ac.uk/sites/ftp.debian.org/debian/ unstable main
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
2. Run:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>apt-get update
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
3.
</P>

<blockquote><pre>apt-get build-dep &lt;package&gt; &amp;&amp; apt-get -b source &lt;package&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
(where: &lt;package&gt; refers to the package name in question). What this will
do is install the build dependencies for the given package, and then will
build the package.
</P>
<P>
4. All that is left then is to do:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>dpkg -i ./deb_files.deb
</pre></blockquote>

<P>
When I teach a class, I often need to push one or more files to my
students' systems. Previously, I would write a "for-do-done" loop and
use "scp" to get the files across, laboriously logging in and exiting
out of each system every time I wanted to do a transfer - painfully
clunky.
</P>
<P>
Then I did some searching on the Net and found "sshtool" by "noconflic".
Written in Expect, it allows multiple host logins and copying. However,
it did not have a "no password" mode (i.e., logging in when
".ssh/authorized_keys" contains your key) and read the list of hosts
from a list defined within the program. I've modified it to read an
external file called "pushlist" and added a "no password" mode; this
last, of course, requires that you first push a "~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
to the host list.
</P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/tips/sshtool.expect.txt">sshtool.expect.txt</a></tt></p>
<P>
First, create your "pushlist", possibly from an "<TT>/etc/hosts</TT>" on one of
the local machines. It should contain all your target hosts, one line
per host. Next, create your ".ssh/authorized_keys" in the directory
where you keep "sshtool" by copying your public keys into it:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>ben@Fenrir:~/sshtool$ mkdir .ssh; cat ~/ssh/*pub &gt; .ssh/authorized_keys
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
Then, push it out to your hosts (NOTE: this <EM>replaces</EM> the remote hosts'
"authorized_keys" files!):
</P>

<blockquote><pre># Log in as user "student" and send the local file
ben@Fenrir:~/sshtool$ ./sshtool -c .ssh/authorized_keys student
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
After this, I can upload any file or list of files to the entire pushlist simply by typing
</P>

<blockquote><pre>ben@Fenrir:~/sshtool$ ./sshtool -C &lt;file[s]&gt; student
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
I can also execute a command on all the systems via the "-U" option.
</P>
<P>
Note: I'm not an Expect programmer; otherwise, "sshtool" would accept a
"local:remote" syntax so files wouldn't need to be in identical
locations. It would also allow you to specify per-host usernames in the
push list (not an option I need, but something to make it more
flexible.) Anyone adding these features - please send me a copy.

<P>
Based on something I saw on the "swsusp" list, I've done a bit of
experimentation with "lzf" compression. It's not any more effective,
size-wise, than some of the common compression utilities - in fact, it's
less so in many cases. What it is, however, is <EM>fast</EM>.
</P>
<P>
Results for compressing my 45MB "Sent_mail" box:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>rar         0m46.314s
bzip2       0m29.840s
arj         0m7.396s
zip         0m7.008s
gzip        0m6.756s
compress    0m3.094s
lzf         0m0.997s
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
File sizes:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>47668763     Sent_mail
35446476     Sent_mail.lzf
32227703     Sent_mail.Z
25119004     Sent_mail.arj
24836842     Sent_mail.zip
24836720     Sent_mail.gz
23355061     Sent_mail.bz2
22877972     Sent_mail.rar
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
For applications where speed matters more than size, "lzf" is clearly a
win. For size where speed is not an issue, it's "rar" (which matches the
results of my previous, much broader testing with many file types and
scenarios.)

<P>
I have been compiling and recompiling the 2.6.1 and 2.6.2 kernels the past
three days trying to find a configuration that will work for me.  I have
performed many kernel compiles in the past and never had this problem
occur on my machine which is currently running 2.4.24.
</P>
<P>
This is the error I get when I boot into the 2.6.1 or 2 kernel:
</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Now I have done some searching around google and saw that other people
have had this problem.  I have implemented a number of suggestions they
were given but nothing has been fruitful.  This is what I have tried:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
Verified the following are compiled in (which they are):
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>CONFIG_IDE=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDISK=y  (I have tried both IDE and IDEDISK separately
also)
CONFIG_EXT2_FS=y
CONFIG_EXT3_FS=y
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
I have removed support for Advanced Partitions.
</STRONG></P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Should have no effect -- I support advanced partitions all the time in
my kernels so I can mount other-OS drives in my lab station.

<P><STRONG>
I have toggled between DEVFS support (initially I said no, but enabling
does not seem to make a difference anyway).
</STRONG></P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">By the time devfs really causes pain you're in userland already - you
didn't get that far.  Didn't I hear a rumor they're deprecating it?
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
<P><STRONG>
I verified my settings in <TT>/etc/lilo.conf</TT> were correct.  I even tried
passing the root=/dev/hda2 parameter to the kernel at boot.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Nothing has worked.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have tried to see if there are any error messages during the boot but
where I would suspect there being an error message, it scrolls by way too
fast.  Nothing gets logged at this point either.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
As I said, I have been running 2.4.24 for a bit now having patched that
from 2.4.9 along the way.  My distro is slackware-current which reports to
have support for the 2.6.x series kernels.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Any further suggestions would be much obliged.

I had replaced a failing drive about 6 months back with a used drive I
picked up along the way.  This drive had EZ-Bios installed in the boot
sector.  Initially I was concerned with this but when I had no problems
with running linux after I transferred over my partitions, I put it out of
mind a bit too far.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I compiled a 2.6.2 kernel enabling everything possible under the IDE
device drivers into the kernel.  This slowed down the boot process enough
for me to see this line:

Sure enough, I knew EZBios was going to come back and bite me one day.  I
guess EZBios was somehow preventing the kernel from seeing the drive
properly.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

After removing EZBios the 2.6.2 kernel booted without a complaint.

Thanks for the suggestions, I appreciate your time and effort.

A lot of effort is going to create the regional language flavor of

internalization of software and demoing the capabilities of Linux to the
people.

For example, one of my friends demoed a Bengali version of Knoppix

<P>
Hi,
</P>
<P>
I ran into an annoying problem with ssh-agents. If you don't start one
on the very first login screen from which you start X you can't access
the agent from any xterm started from the window-manager. Starting new
ones is no good idea if one is already running. This script will look
for a running ssh-agent and set the environment variables so it can be
contacted. If none is running it will start one. As on ssh-login with
enabled "AGENT Forwarding" the environment variables will be set
and the remote ssh-agent (where you are connecting from) one will be
used.
</P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/tips/sshssearch-old.bash.txt">sshssearch-old.bash.txt</a></tt></p>
<P>
unfortunately there has been a change in "interface" of "ssh-add -l" --
before it was giving exit code 0 for "agent is there, with or without
keys" and 1 for "no agent".
</P>
<P>
Now it's finegrained to: 0 for "agent with keys" , 1 for "agent without
keys" and 2 for "no agent".
</P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/tips/sshssearch-new.bash.txt">sshssearch-new.bash.txt</a></tt></p>
<P>
of course you have to "source" the script to set the local environment
variables:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
source sshsearch.sh

. sshsearch.sh

<P>
to make it automatic call it from .profile (or .bashrc).

NAME
keychain - a program designed to keep ssh-agent processes alive across
multiple logins.

DESCRIPTION
Keychain is an OpenSSH key manager, typically run from ~/.bash_profile.
When run, it will make sure ssh-agent is running; if not, it will start
ssh-agent. It  will  redirect ssh-agent's output to
~/.keychain/[hostname]-sh, so that cron jobs that need to use ssh-
agent keys can simply source this file and make the necessary passwordless ssh
connections. In  addition,  when  keychain runs, it will check with ssh-agent
and make sure that the ssh RSA/DSA keys that you specified on the keychain
command line have actually been added to ssh-agent. If not, you are prompted
for the appropriate passphrases so that they can be added by keychain.

Local Eth/Internet PPP can work together

<P>
On RedHat/Fedora, if only the subnet your computer is part of needs to
be accessed over the LAN card, I believe this simple trick will work. If
not, it is easy to undo.
</P>
<P>
On set up of the network, simply do not enter an IP for the gateway. If
this is already configured then shut down your network
(<TT>/etc/rc.d/init/.d/network</TT> stop) and remove the "GATEWAY" line from
<TT>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0.</TT> Restart your network and the
"route" command should show no default gateway, but also a route via
eth0 to the subnet your computer is on. Something like :
192.168.0.0  *  255.255.255.0   U  0  0  0  eth0
</P>
<P>
kppp should then happily create a default route to ppp0 when executed.

I'm still not seeing it there.  The entries are alphabetical and go
from "Firebird Modern" directly to "Lush", and I can't find
"LittleFirebird" on the page anywhere.

<P><STRONG>
This is really strange. I checked again and I can see LittleFirebird
theme. I asked  other people to check it and they could not find it
either.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
No idea why this is happening. I am on broadband connection. My ISP
(Sify broadband) has put a LAN in the neighbourhood and we connect
through a proxy server. Do you think this could be an issue with the
cache ? (The other people I asked to check were not part of the ISP's
LAN)
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Mike] 
Either your ISP is not updating the page properly, or your browser
isn't.  I assume you've done shift-reload, restarted the browser, or
tried a different browser.  Sometimes the browser cache can be subtle
and stubborn, although I've had less problems with that since I stopped
using Netscape 4.  If your ISP has a malfunctioning proxy server, I
guess there's nothing you can do except tell them to fix it.

Hello answer guy,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I need to be able to secure an external modem that has been connect to a
Solaris box to protect against unauthorized calls.. What I mean is that I
want to be able to allow people to connect to the box based purely on the
phone number they are calling from.  Is there a way on the modem to only
allow certain calls to go through while rejecting all other calls?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks,

See the "mgetty" open source pkg (<A HREF="http://www.google.com/linux"
	>http://www.google.com/linux</A> for it).
It offers this capability, provided that your modem line has caller id.
The pkg includes pretty good documentation as well as good example cfg
files.

<!-- ::
X is Smarter Now
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:: -->
<P>
Hello Gang,
</P>
<P>
I have a NEC MultiSync 77F monitor and a Matrox Millenium II video card.  When
running the <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> configuration program Sax, X configuration occurs sort of
automatically.
</P>
<P>
All parameters were correct except the modelines associated with my monitor.
I say this because the horizontal centering was incorrect when running X.
</P>
<P>
I tried modelines generated via the XFree 3.3.6 version of xf86config, and
incorporated the modelines generated from that tool.  Those modelines were
proper and usable for XFree86 4.3.0.
</P>
<P>
As I read on, I saw that X is smart enough to figure out the appropriate
timing without modelines.  Thus, I deleted all of the generated modelines, and
now the Modes section looks like this.
</P>

<blockquote><pre>Section "Modes"
  Identifier   "Modes[0]"
EndSection
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
The file that I edited is:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>/etc/X11/XF86Config
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
I hope that this helps other SuSE 8.2 users.
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Heather] 
The flip side of this clue is just as important; if you're on a more
modern setup that doesn't generate modelines because the internally
generated ones will do, but you don't like them and feel they can be
improved, then all the old tuning tricks will still work, as will
modelines found on the net that match your monitor more perfectly.
