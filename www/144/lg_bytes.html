<h2>News in General</h2>

<h3>Ubuntu 7.10 "Gutsy Gibbon" Released</h3>
<p>
As promised, Ubuntu 7.10 server and desktop were released on 10/18.
It offers new server and desktop features, including better hardware and driver
support, especially for printers and wireless devices.

<p>
Mark ShuttleWorth, CEO of Cannonical, noted that "...this is the 7th release of
Ubuntu and the thing we are most proud of... we were with a day of
schedule on all releases." Shuttleworth added, "We are delivering
what we consider to be an enterprise-class operating system, and we expect these
will be used immediately in production environments."

<p>
Among the innovations in this edition are "tracker", a hard drive indexing
system with the ability to search the entire desktop, "I believe we are the
first distro to deliver this capability," Shuttleworth said.
</p>

<p>
The server package adds more standardized configuration templates, to speed
deployments and aid rollout scalability. Configurations are included for
Web servers, databases, LAMP applications, file and print servers, etc.

<p>
This is a non-LTS release of Ubuntu. The next release, targeted for April
2008, will be a Long-Term-Support [LTS] release for those on support
contracts. LTS releases are planned for annual or biannual release.
</p>

<p>
This latest Ubuntu version also includes the following new features:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  <em>Enhanced security</em> <br>
  AppArmor provides significantly enhanced security which protects the
  server from intrusion. Common server applications such as Apache and
  Postfix are protected with default policies.  Administrators can easily
  lock down programs and resources and add policies for their specific
  requirements.
  
<li>
  <em>Virtualized kernel</em> -<br>
   A tailored kernel optimized for use in virtualized environments. This
   smaller and simpler kernel is particularly suited for virtual
   appliances. This new kernel includes many improvements for
   paravirtualization, one of which is VMI (Virtual Machine Interface), a
   new independent way for hypervisors to relate to the kernel.
  
<li>
  <em>Tickless kernel</em> - <br>
  A new "tickless" idle mode results in reduced power consumption/heat
  emission. This feature results in significant energy and cost savings on
  machines running several virtualized instances.
  
<li>
  <em>Messaging</em> -<br>
  Deployments of large mail servers benefit from significant improvements
  to Postfix's performance.  The new stable release of Postfix takes
  advantage of the kernel's epoll functionality to reduce load and improve
  performance.
  
<li>
  <em>Printing</em> - <br>
  Improved interoperability with CUPS now supporting automatic discovery
  and authentication for many more protocols, including LDAP with SSL,
  Kerberos, Mac OS X Bonjour, and Zeroconf. The desktop version also has
  improved plug-and-play configuration for printers.

<li>
  <em>Windows compatibility</em> - <br>
  Users of the desktop version with a dual partition can read from and
  write to files that are on located in a Windows partition (including
  NTFS).
  
<li>
  <em>Programming</em> <br>
  - A new release of Python allows for a faster and more reliable
	interpreter. Additionally, OpenMP is now supported in gcc 4.2, which
	gives shared-memory programmers a simple and flexible interface for
	developing parallel applications.
  
<li>
  <em>LDAP authentication</em> -<br>
  Ubuntu Server is now fully supported as an LDAP authentication client.
  
<li>
  <em>"Landscape" management</em> - <br>
  Commercially supported users of Ubuntu Server can take full advantage of
  this Web-based management tool for managing large deployments.
</ul>

<h3>OpenAjax Alliance Promotes InteropFest, Security for Mashups</h3>

<p>
  At the September AjaxWorld conference, the OpenAjax Alliance, which is
  dedicated to open and interoperable Ajax-based Web technologies, revealed new
  initiatives for secure mashups and mobile AJAX.
</p>
  
<p>
  AJAX is the technology behind the increasingly popular "mashup", a Web site or
  application that combines content from more than one source into an integrated
  experience. As AJAX and mashups continue to gain widespread acceptance under
  the Web 2.0 umbrella, it is critical for organizations to understand these
  technologies and to avoid possible problems by adhering to best practices.
</p>
  
<p>
  The alliance prepared a new white paper titled "AJAX and Mashup Security",
  itemizing the ways in which AJAX applications could be attacked, and providing
  a set of best practice techniques to address each vulnerability. Available at
  <a href="http://www.openajax.org/">www.openajax.org</a>, the white paper
  represents the collaborative efforts of AJAX security experts, and was a joint
  effort with the Marketing Working Group.
</p>
  
<p>
  "ICEsoft has long recognized that security for enterprise-class applications
  is a critical requirement," said Robert Lepack, VP of Marketing for ICEsoft
  Technologies. "We view the publication of the Open Ajax white paper 'AJAX and
  Mashup Security' to be an important step in the ongoing need to both educate
  customers on the potential security risks of AJAX applications, and the best
  practices described in the paper to be a key step toward developing much
  needed standards."
</p>
  
<p>
  In addition to a strong focus on security, the OpenAjax Alliance held
  InteropFest 1.0, which is the final integration testing phase of OpenAjax Hub
  1.0. OpenAjax Hub is a small JavaScript library that allows multiple AJAX
  toolkits to work together on the same page. The central feature is a
  publish/subscribe event manager, which enables loose assembly and integration
  of AJAX components. OpenAjax Alliance will deliver both an open specification
  and a reference open source implementation. Standards are the key to
  interoperability, and allow the true possibilities of AJAX and Web 2.0 to be
  realized.
</p>
  
<p>
  "To further advance the AJAX ecosystem, OpenAjax Alliance members together are
  developing a standard way to describe AJAX controls and their programmatic
  interfaces so that it becomes easier for developers to use AJAX libraries with
  development tools," said Kevin Hakman, director, TIBCO Software Inc. and Chair
  of the Alliance IDE Working Group. "We're on pace to have an AJAX control
  description specification ready for early 2008."
</p>
  
<p>
  With finalization activities on OpenAjax Hub 1.0, the alliance has begun work
  on OpenAjax Hub 1.1, which will add support for secure mashups and to enable
  mediated Comet-style client-server messaging. As with OpenAjax Hub 1.1, the
  alliance will deliver both a specification and a commercial-quality open
  source reference implementation. The secure mashup features of OpenAjax Hub
  1.1 will isolate mashup components in secure "sandboxes" and use the OpenAjax
  Hub's publish/subscribe features to achieve mediated cross-component
  messaging.
</p>
  
<p>
  Also a part of InteropFest 1.0, interoperability certificates were awarded to
  the following member organizations for their participation: 24SevenOffice,
  Apache XAP, Dojo Foundation, ILOG, Getahead, IT Mill, Lightstreamer,
  Microsoft, Nexaweb, Open Link, Open Spot, Software AG, and Tibco. The
  interoperability event required integration of an organization's AJAX toolkit
  with the OpenAjax Hub and at least one other AJAX component, where
  cross-component messaging is accomplished using the OpenAjax Hub.
  Interestingly, Microsoft's ASP.NET AJAX, formerly called Atlas, passed the
  interoperability tests:
  <a href="">http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3701966</a>
</p>

<p>
About 90 companies have joined the OpenAjax Alliance since it was formed in
1990. The mashup security white paper is available at
<a href="http://www.openajax.org/whitepapers/Introducing%20Ajax%20and%20OpenAjax.html">http://www.openajax.org/whitepapers/Introducing%20Ajax%20and%20OpenAjax.html</a>
</p>

<h3>Sun Opens More Open Source</h3>
<p>
Sun held a developer summit of sorts, Oct. 15th, on its Santa Clara campus, for
many of Open Source projects it supports. Besides a report on Java
and the OpenJDK project, Sun engineers who are principals in the Postgres
project and their Glassfish application server project also reported on
progress.
</p>

<p>
Mark Reinhold, a member of the OpenJDK project's governing board, confirmed that
more of Java is now open source, with only about 4% still requiring what he
called "binary plugs" for sound and image drivers. He explained that Sun
still does not have the rights to make that code available, but is pushing the
code owners to release the necessary items or face a "name and shame" initiative
from Sun and other contributors to the OpenJDK.
</p>

<p>
The OpenJDK interim governance board was formed at JavaOne, last spring, and has
met in teleconference twice and face-to-face only once before the Sun Summit.
According to Reinhold, the plan is to have a draft constitution written by this
December, and to get it ratified by Spring 2008. As this independent
infrastructure is being built up, Sun is providing leadership and
support. Reinhold said that Sun would mostly act as "a benevolent
dictator", until OpenJDK could run on its own.
</p>

<p>
Version 2 of the Glassfish application server, based on Java 5, was
released in mid-September. It featured substantial performance
improvements, especially in clustering, and billed as
enterprise-ready. Sun will develop this Glassfish release as a product 
for its customers.
</p>

<p>
GlassFish Version 3 is already under development, and will be a major change in
project architecture. It will become fully modular, based on a
100kB kernel, and will also feature multiple class-loaders. The
micro-kernel and JVM will have extensions to efficiently run major scripting
languages, such as PHP and Ruby.
</p>

<p>
Josh Berkus, both a long time Sun engineer and a long time contributor to the
PostgreSQL project, discussed the coming version of Postgres, as well as its
history going back to the 1980s at UC Berkeley.
</p>
  
<p>
There are an estimated 15 million "embedded" users of Postgres and over 200
active developers.  Postgres is now distributed with Solaris &amp;
OpenSolaris. 
</p>

<p>
The presentations concluded with an Open Source Worldwide Panel led by Ian
Murdock and attended by developers from Europe, India, and Latin America,
including Suvendu Ray and Bruno Souza, among others. One issue discussed
was the twin problem of localization and de-localization: not only
efficient translation of language, but also mechanisms for sharing back the work
of developers collaborating in their local languages. A video of the panel
is available from Podtech here:<br>
<a href="http://www.podtech.net/home/4399/sun-microsystems-open-source-worldwide-panel">Open
Source Worldwide Panel</a>.
</p>

<p>
On October 22-23, in parallel with InterOp NY, Sun will host the
<a href="">Start-up Camp</a> event in New York
City. The goal of Start-up Camp is to bring entrepreneurs and vendors together
to network, share advice, and learn from the experiences of other startups. The
event will continue to be a face-to-face, collaborative event, with the agenda
determined during the event. Start-up University will kick off Start-up Camp, 
and provide an opportunity for attendees to learn about various topics in an
educational format.
</p>

<h3>Gphone due in November</h3>
<p>
The long-rumored Google answer to the Apple iPhone will make its debut in early
November, probably on November 5th, according to blogs and Google watch
sites. It will be a data-driven, Linux mobile device hosting Google
desktop gadgets and Google Web apps.
</p>

<p>
Unlike Apple, which tried to restrict developer access to its proprietary iPhone
platform, Google has been building developer communities for its varied
applications, and will probably leverage that support to enhance the new
platform. The Google Gears framework allows developers to create widgets
and gadgets that can be intermittently connected. And Google already has a
partner relationship with Samsung for putting Gmail and Google Search on 3G
phones. Google also recently purchased the Finnish social-networking company
Jaiku, which helps "friends" find each other via their mobile devices.
Perhaps this was the missing piece to Google's vision.
</p>

<p>
What is uncertain is whether Google will partner with the wireless carriers or
compete with them. And will it partner with one or more music services?
 Also to be determined is if there will be an ad-supported version of the
messaging and voice services. Maybe 2008 will be the year of free Mobile
Linux.

    3D Donut
  </li>
  <li>
    3D smooth lines and several others
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Also improved is the data source handling where data ranges for columns and
  rows labels can be separated from the data source range for the chart values,
  and the ability to select different x-values for different series. There is
  enhanced automatic logarithmic scaling. Finally, there are performance
  improvements and an enhanced import and export of Microsoft Office charts.
</p>

<p>

<p>
A recent development snapshot of KDE 4 is available as a preview in Mandriva
Linux 2008, and NTFS write support is also included. The
<a href="http://wiki.mandriva.com/en/Releases/Mandriva/2008.0/Errata">Mandriva
Linux 2008 Errata</a> list known issues with 2008 and how to fix or work around
them.


<h3>KDE 4 Beta 3 is out, Fedora 8 coming soon</h3>
<p>
This late-stage beta was available in mid-Oct. and also marks a freeze
of the KDE Development Platform. New educational features and
enhancements are included with further polishing of the KDE codebase.
The aim of the 4.0 release is to put foundations in place for future
innovations.

<p>
However, KDE 4.0 will probably not be ready for the first release of Fedora 8 in
early November. The October Fedora 8 beta included a completely free and
open source Java environment called
<a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/IcedTea">IcedTea</a>,
which is derived from the OpenJDK project.

<h3>Elpicx 1.1 helps prep for LPI exam</h3>
<p>
The <a href="http://distrowatch.com/elpicx">elpicx</a> 1.1 live DVD was released
in mid-October. Elpicx is a Knoppix and CentOS-based Linux system that
helps students prepare for the Linux Professional Institute (LPI)
certification exam, by providing test emulators and a number of LPI
reference cards, study notes, preparation guides, and exam exercises.

<p>
Version 1.1 is based on Knoppix 5.1.1 and CentOS 4.3. Visit the project's
<a href="http://www.elearnit.de/live_cds/elpicx/">home page</a> to read the
complete release announcement.

<h3>MEPIS 7 and its Anti-X due by November</h3>
<p>
MEPIS 7 RC Beta 5 was released in late September, and another RC is
expected around November 10.  Then it is on its way toward final
release of version 7, at the end of November or early December.

<p>
The 7.0 RC 1 release of "antiX", a lightweight derivative of MEPIS, was out in
late September. AntiX is built and maintained by a MEPIS community member as a
free version of MEPIS for very old 32-bit PC hardware. The antiX Web site is at
antix.mepis.org, and an antiX forum is hosted at
<a href="http://www.mepislovers.org/">www.mepislovers.org</a>

<p>
  AntiX 7.0 RC 1 is like AntiX 7.0 Beta2, except that the look and the packages
  have been updated to be in sync with MEPIS 7.0 Beta 4. There are also fixes
  for reported bugs that are unique to AntiX.
</p>
  
<p>
  AntiX is designed to work on computers with as little as 64MB of RAM and
  Pentium II or equivalent AMD processors. ISO images and deltas are available
  in the "testing" subdirectory at the MEPIS Subscriber's Site and at the MEPIS
  public mirrors.
</p>


<h3>Products</h3>
<h4>ASUS Launches Low Cost Eee PC</h4>
    
<p>
  ASUSTeK will be offering a new low-cost laptop PCs to consumers for as little
  $250, by year end. These laptops are targeted at non-power-users in
  markets that are nearing saturation. They will function as personal as opposed
  to business computers, and may be adopted by teens and tweeners.
</p>
  
<p>
  Called Eee PCs, the new line of notebooks will initially be available in
  English and classical Chinese versions, the latter for sale in Taiwan. Other
  languages may be supported in 2009. Prototypes were shown at Intel IDF in San
  Francisco.
</p>
  
<p>
  These low-cost PCs will run both open-source Linux and Windows (but that
  was a change for the prototypes shown in SF). Windows versions of the computer
  would cost only about $50 more than Linux versions, about $300, suggesting
  that Microsoft had offered the Windows operating systems at a big discount in
  order to play on the Eee. But this still should provide a Linux incentive to
  consumers.
</p>
  
<p>
  The Eee will be first laptop to carry the ASUSTeK brand, rather than being
  OEMed for other companies.
</p>

<h3>Zpower innovates Laptop Batteries</h3>
<p>
A safer, lighter, smaller and recyclable battery for computers and phones is
poised for production.

<p>
ZPower, formerly known as Zinc Matrix Power, has developed advanced,
rechargeable silver-zinc batteries. Initially targeted for notebook computers,
cell phones, and MP3 players, ZPower batteries currently have 30% greater energy
density than traditional lithium-ion batteries. Intel is interested in promoting
the technology, and has made a 10% equity investment in the firm.

<p>
ZPower showed its wares at the recent Intel IDF conference in SF. This included
working silver-zinc batteries for laptops that were half the thickness of
current lithium-ion batteries. When in full production in 2008, these batteries
will get 20-30% more battery life on a charge. Production goals for 2009 are
20-30% weight reductions and a target of 30-50% greater battery life.

<p>
In addition to the performance benefits, ZPower batteries are inherently safer.
The technology features a water-based chemistry that, and is not
flammable or toxic.  The battery contains no lithium or flammable
liquids and is therefore free from the problems of thermal runaway,
fire, and danger of explosion. Silver-zinc batteries are not subject to
airline restrictions.


<p>
The new batteries also environmentally friendly. The primary elements used to
produce the batteries can be 100 percent recycled and re-used. The raw materials
recovered in the recycling process of silver-zinc batteries are the same quality
as those that went into the creation of the battery. The company plans to offer
cash incentives to consumers recycling the batteries.

<p>
Dr. Ross Dueber, a scientist at ZPower, told <em>Linux Gazette</em> that
the first production silver-zinc batteries will be about 10mm thick but
about the same weight as current batteries. Weight reduction will come
from better use of the materials and manufacturing efficiencies. The
first manufacturing partner will be Tyco Electric. ZPower is currently
working with other leading manufacturers of notebook computers and cell
phones to incorporate silver-zinc technology in next generation
products.

<p> 
ZPower won Intel's "Technology Innovation Accelerated" (TIA) Award
in the Mobility category at the 2006 Fall IDF conference. The company
was also recently named a "GoingGreen 100" winner by AlwaysOn.

<p>
Troy Renken, Vice President of Product Planning and Electronics at ZPower Inc.
was a featured speaker in the Extended Battery Life panel at the Intel Developer
Forum (IDF) in Taipei, Taiwan on October 16th.  The panel, titled "Realizing
the Vision of All Day and Beyond Battery Life for Mobile PCs," discussed
industry initiatives underway to extend battery life.

<h3>IBM and Linden Labs Partner on Open 3D Standards for Collaboration</h3>

<p>
  IBM and Linden Lab, creator of the virtual world
  <a href="http://www.secondlife.com/">Second Life</a>
  (<a href="http://secondlife.com/">www.secondlife.com</a>),
  will work with a broad community of partners to drive open standards and
  interoperability to enable avatars -- the online persona of visitors to these
  online worlds -- to move from one virtual world to another with ease and
  support applications of virtual world technology for business and society in
  commerce, collaboration, education and more.
</p>

<p> As more enterprises and consumers explore the 3D Internet, the
ecosystem of virtual world hosts, application providers, and IT vendors
need to offer a variety of standards-based solutions in order to meet
end user requirements.  To support this, IBM and Linden Lab are
committed to exploring the interoperability of virtual world platforms
and technologies, and plan to work with industry-wide efforts to further
expand the capabilities of virtual worlds.  </p>
  
</p> "We have built the Second Life Grid as part of the evolution of the
Internet," said Ginsu Yoon, vice-president, Business Affairs, Linden
Lab. "Linden and IBM shares a vision that interoperability is key to the
continued expansion of the 3D Internet, and that this tighter
integration will benefit the entire industry. Our open source
development of interoperable formats and protocols will accelerate the
growth and adoption of all virtual worlds." </p>
  
</p> IBM and Linden Lab plan to work together on issues concerning the
integration of virtual worlds with the current Web; driving
security-rich transactions of virtual goods and services; working with
the industry to enable interoperability between various virtual worlds;
and building more stability and high quality of service into virtual
world platforms. These are expected to be key characteristics facing
organizations that want to take advantage of virtual worlds for
commerce, collaboration, education and other business applications.
</p>
  
</p> 
More specifically, IBM and Linden Lab plan to collaborate on: </p>

<ul> 
<li> <strong>"Universal" Avatars:</strong> Exploring technology and standards
for users of the 3D Internet to travel between different virtual worlds.
Users could maintain the same avatar name, appearance and other
important attributes (digital assets, identity certificates, and more)
for multiple worlds. The adoption of a universal avatar and associated
services are a possible first step toward the creation of a truly
interoperable 3D Internet.
  </li>
</ul>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Security-rich Transactions</strong>: Collaborating on the requirements for
      standards-based software designed to enable the security-rich exchange of
      assets in and across virtual worlds. This could allow users to
      perform purchases or sales with other people in virtual worlds.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<ul type=disc>
  <li>
    <strong>Integration with existing Web and business processes:</strong> Allowing
    current business applications and data repositories, regardless of their
    source, to function in virtual worlds.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul type=disc>
  <li>
    <strong>Open standards for interoperability with the current Web:</strong>Open
    source development of interoperable formats and protocols. Open
    standards in this area are expected to allow virtual worlds to connect
    together, so that users can cross from one world to another, just as they
    can go from one Web page to another on the Internet today.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  
</p>
  IBM has hosted discussions on virtual world interoperability, the role of
  standards, and the potential of forming an industry-wide consortium open to
  all. Linden Lab has formed an Architecture Working Group that describes the
  road-map for the development of the Second Life Grid. This open collaboration
  with the community allows users of Second Life to help define the direction of
  an interoperable, Internet-scale architecture.

<h3>IBM Introduces its "Virtualization-Ready" System X Server</h3>
<p>
  IBM has previewed the fourth generation of its virtualization chipset
  technology, <strong>X4</strong>, to be available in a high-end, scalable server
  leveraging the latest in quad-core processing technology from Intel. The
  System x3950 M2 server will debut with a new embedded hypervisor capability,
  enabling clients to easily deploy virtualized server applications right out of
  the rack.
</p>
  
</p>
X4 chipsets mark significant advances in performance, availability, and
processing efficiencies for the IBM System x line of servers. X4 will enable x86
server configurations to fuel virtualization on high-end systems. Several other
new features will allow clients to easily adopt virtualization.

<p>
The new server will be ready for virtualization right out of the box by
eliminating software setup and installation time. An internal USB interface will
accommodate chip-based or "embedded" virtualization software preloaded on a 4GB
USB flash storage device.
The new system offers double the memory slot capacity. Also, four times the
amount of memory can be hosted on a single chassis compared to the previous
system, enabling more virtualization workloads.

<p>
IBM has developed and released three generations of X-Architecture chipsets
since 1997, and remains the only top-tier vendor in the industry to incorporate
its own chipset in Intel-based servers. The third generation chipset, X3,
introduced in 2005, was optimized for server consolidation and enterprise
application software.
