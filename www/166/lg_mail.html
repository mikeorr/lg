One of our users is complaining that our transliterator doesn't work;
the few of us who have tested it all find that it works for us. Now,
he says it only works because our locales are wrong(?). I'm just
wondering if anyone other than him can get the incorrect result: i.e.,
that 'ा' fails to transliterate to 'ા' -- I reproduced the same test
using standard tools belo, because they do the same thing as our
transliterator.

&gt;&gt; Source of trouble: "lt-proc -t" Hindi to Gujarati conversion:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The "i18n" file which is used for generating locales in the SuSE 11.0 and
&gt;&gt; Ubuntu 8.04 version puts Devanagari "maatra" characters under "punct"
&gt;&gt; category for LC_CTYPE!!!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So Jimmy, Gabriel and Jacob must be using some "non-standard" version of
&gt;&gt; "i18n" files for compiling their locales! <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
&gt;
&gt; Seriously, so what? Why should that make the slightest bit of difference?

Right...

Subject: [conspire] (forw) [Evals] Joey Hess In The News...
</pre>
Joey Hess, to explain, is a Debian developer who worked with me at VA
Linux Systems.
</p>

<p>
The bit about Palm, Inc. explaining that they're doing nothing that they
didn't disclose intention to do in their Privacy Policy
(<a href='http://www.palm.com/us/company/privacy.html'>http://www.palm.com/us/company/privacy.html</a>) is worth noting, as this 
keeps coming up whenever someone discovers user-tracking measures in
Google Android phones, Apple iPhones, etc.:  Inevitably, there turns out
to have been somewhat vague contractual language by which the company
made sure it was covered.  One of several possible morals:  Read
contract clauses carefully, and assume the other guy will abuse any
right he/she claims to get you to agree to.
</p>

<p>
Example:  Terms of use on Google Docs
(<a href='http://www.google.com/google-d-s/intl/en/terms.html):'>http://www.google.com/google-d-s/intl/en/terms.html):</a>  Clause 11.1
says:  
</p>

<p>
  11.1 You retain copyright and any other rights you already hold in
  Content which you submit, post or display on or through, the Services.
  By submitting, posting or displaying the content you give Google a
  perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive
  licence to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly
  perform, publicly display and distribute any Content which you submit,
  post or display on or through, the Services. This licence is for the
  sole purpose of enabling Google to display, distribute and promote the
  Services and may be revoked for certain Services as defined in the
  Additional Terms of those Services.
</p>

<p>
"Services" is defined elsewhere as "Google's products, software,
services and web [sic] sites".  So, in putting your own private data on
Google Docs, you are granting Google, Inc. a licence to "reproduce,
adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display
and distribute" your files anywhere on any of its sites provided Google,
Inc. can reasonably claim it did so to "display, distribute and promote
the Services".  Forever:  Its right to do so doesn't cease when/if you 
stop using the service, or even if you cancel your Google login.
</p>

<p>
Now, for context, I'm not trying to pick on Google, Inc.:  Its Terms of
Service are, in general, not only quite benign and enlightened but also
written in a manner easy for non-lawyers to understand, which is
commendable.  My point is that, as eyebrow-raising as that particular
grant of rights is when you find and comprehend it, the licence
agreement as a while is a breath of fresh air compared to most such
things.

Do any of you use wicd? I wish to know how to automatically
share the wireless on boot. At the moment, the connection
to the wired setup is automatically done (by dhcpcd/wicd combination).
But the wireless internet sharing has to be set manually.

Thanks in advance.

I've been working on some scripts recently that spawn extra windows, and
kill them off for the purposes of displaying images.  What I can't
figure out is how to programatically lower a window after I've opened
it, without delving deeply into some C programming against X that would
necessitate a major learning curve.

&gt; Hello!

&gt; I just wanted to pass a quick thanks to Ben Okopnik. His article on

<p>
Thanks, Chris - always nice to get some feedback! As I recall, we've had
a few articles on Gnuplot, R, and similar things since then - even a
review of 'Gnuplot in Action' that I did a while back. Hope you have
lots of fun exploring it.

<h3>New Release: apertium-nn-nb</h3>

<b><p>
Jimmy O'Regan [joregan at gmail.com]

</p>
</b><br />
<b>Tue, 18 Aug 2009 05:50:54 +0100</b>
</p>

<p>
English:
</p>

<p>
We've just released a new language pair: Norwegian Nynorsk–Norwegian
Bokmål, apertium-nn-nb. It's the first released automatic translator for
Norwegian developed with the free and open-source Apertium machine
translator engine. The pair will be available for testing at at
<a href='http://www.apertium.org/index.php?id=translatetext'>http://www.apertium.org/index.php?id=translatetext</a> .
</p>

<p>
In developing this system, we used the Free language resources Norsk
Ordbank (a full form dictionary with morphological annotations,
<a href='http://www.edd.uio.no/prosjekt/ordbanken/'>http://www.edd.uio.no/prosjekt/ordbanken/</a>) and the Oslo-Bergen tagger
(a Constraint Grammar disambiguator, <a href='http://omilia.uio.no/obt/'>http://omilia.uio.no/obt/</a>). Both of
these resources are released under the GPL as Free software. Although a
lot of conversion work was involved, the availability of high quality
Free data led to a much higher coverage (~88%) and accuracy than would
have been possible otherwise.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the reuse and conversion of these existing monolingual
resources, a lot of work was done on the translational dictionary (partly
assisted by the tool ReTraTos which turns Giza++ corpus alignments into
bi-dictionary entries), and we have added transfer rules to handle eg. the
differences in passive verbs phrases, gender system and possessive noun
phrases.
</p>

<p>
Future goals include handling simple coordination in possessives, improving
the rule-based disambiguator along with retraining the statistical tagger,
and of course expanding and improving the translational dictionary.
</p>

<p>
This language pair was developed as part of a Google Summer of Code (GsoC)
project. For more information on Apertium and GsoC, see
<a href='http://socghop.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2009/apertium'>http://socghop.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2009/apertium</a> . Many thanks
to mentors Trond Trosterud (University of Tromsø) and Francis Tyers
(Universitat d'Alacant and Prompsit Language Engineering) for advice and
help on development, and to the other members of the Apertium project; also
to Paul Meurer (Unifob AKSIS) and Kristin Hagen (University of Oslo) for
help on the GPL Oslo-Bergen tagger, and to various Wikipedia contributors
for help on the translation dictionary. Many thanks to all those who
developed the open-source tools and free language resources which
contributed in developing this new translator.
</p>

<p>

Vi har nettopp gjeve ut eit nytt språkpar: nynorsk–bokmål, apertium-nn-nb.
Dette er den første automatiske omsetjaren for norsk som er utvikla i med
Apertium – ein maskinomsetjingsmotor med fri og open kjeldekode. Språkparet
