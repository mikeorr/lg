<p><strong>Hello,

<br><br>
I think this might interest... It arrived to me without the original
sender ID.

<hr width="10%">
The DALnet #Linux has started a movement to get Linus Torvalds voted as
Man of the Century. Their idea is to get a massive number of votes for
Linus, which would at least get the attention of Linux if nothing else.
They estimate that they need about 1 million votes to pull it off.

<br><br>
They've requested everybody to vote for Linus and to pass it along. The
category in which Linus is being placed also has a mention of Bill
Gates, so we've got some competition. If you would like more 
information, see the URLs below.

<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)" width="50" height="28"
	align="left" border="0">While 
 I have the utmost respect for Linus and feel greatly
 indebted to him for Linux.  I have reservations about this 
 suggestion.

<br><br>
 First I have to say that the computer has not, in my opinion, been
 the dominate development of this century.  Although microcomputers 
 are the basis for my career and the principle tool in my hobbies
 (writing and participating in newsgroups and mailing lists) --- I
 have to step back and try to achieve a more objective view.

<br><br>
 I'd rate the development of the telephone and our world wide 
 telecommunications infrastructure as roughly an order of magnitude
 more important worldwide.  Granted that modern telephony would be
 impossible without the computer.  The underlying importance of the 
 telephone has driven computers in large part (specifically in the 
 development of Unix --- at AT&T Bell Labs!).  However, my sense of
 history suggests that the impact of telephony was already evident
 before that (when the vast majority of it was run by mechanical 
 relays and even by human switchboard operators).

<br><br>
 Despite this I wouldn't even say that telephony is the most 
 important development of our century.  I think that broadcast 
 media (radio and television) have at least twice as much impact
 as the phone.  The reason is that telephones primarily extend
 our ability to communicate and shrink our time scales --- but they
 are still mostly localised geographically and socially.  The fact
 that the technology allows me to call someone in Japan as easily as
 I could call the local Pizza parlor doesn't matter much when I have
 no acquaintances in Japan.  The telephone doesn't most of us to really
 connect with a significantly broader or larger set of associates 
 than were possible with old-fashioned postal correspondence.

<br><br>
 Broadcast television has had quite a bit of effect on this country
 and on most of the rest of the world.  The results are fundamentally
 different than anything that could be have been accomplished by 
 correspondence or other forms of individual association.  Prior to
 radio and television we didn't even have a word "broadcast."

<br><br>
 I'd put publishing in the same league as broadcast media for potential.
 However it is several centuries old.  Also its potential has never been
 as widely realized as broadcast media due to the simple hurdle of 
 <em>literacy</em>.  This is not so simple as functional literacy.  Many people
 have sufficient academic skills to participate in our (or their) culture
 --- but are not affected enough by any publications to really move 
 society.   I personally consider television to have had a greater 
 effect on our culture based largely on the sheer number of hours that
 people spend absorbing its emanations.  

<br><br>
 It doesn't matter how trite most of the "content" has been --- the 
 fact is that a largely percentage of the world's population has been 
 pacified for an astounding number of hours by TV's and movies (silver 
 screen).  I'm not nearly so concerned by what television has caused 
 people to do as how much it may have prevented by its diversion.

<br><br>
 Despite the its greater importance I still wouldn't say that television,
 movies and other broadcast media is the <em>most</em> important development 
 in our century.  There is one thing that's had even more effect over more
 of the world that those.

<br><br>
 I think I'd have to give the award to Henry Ford.  Not only is the 
 automobile one of the most important and ubiquitous developments of 
 <em>this</em> century, but the manufacturing techniques and organisational
 structures associated with Ford dominate the world's economy and literally
 shape our cities.

<br><br>
 So, despite the fact that Ford appears to have been anti-semitic and
 to have held elitist views that would disgust many people today --- I'd
 have to vote for him for <em>this</em> century.

<br><br>
 That brings me back to Linus.  I think we just might see the real effects
 of the FSF and Linux later.  It may be that people in 2098 will look back
 and remark on how the spirit of co-operation that was fostered by 
 Richard Stallman and Linus Torvalds (among many others) in the field of 
 microcomputer software fundamentally changed our culture's ethic and 
 economy.  We might see radical changes to the publishing industry as 
 more content moves more unto the 'web' (by which I don't just mean HTML 
 carried over HTTP --- but in a broader sense I mean to include the 
 multi-cast communications we see in netnews and on these mailing lists).

<br><br>
 This would have to be accompanied by radical solutions to the <em>real</em>
 problems we face in the world today.  We cannot continue to allow our
 population and resource utilization to grow through another century.
 In addition the current allocation of natural resources must be rationalized
 before we can have a better world.  If we continue to have less than
 5% of the population accounting for 80% of the world's resource consumption
 and continue to allow individual to rape the land that they "own" and 
 discard it when they've extracted the value from it then most of the 
 world's population will remain poor and miserable (and most of the
 "developed" nations will see large parts of their own populations 
 degenerate into "third world" conditions).  This is not "doom and 
 gloom" prophecy --- it's a simple matter of arithmetic.  The question 
 is not "if" but "when" and I think the argument is over decades 
 rather than centuries.

<br><br>
 So, if we're still in a position to concern ourselves about a 
 "person of the century" contest ten decades from now, I hope that
 the standard of living for the rest of the world has improved
 to the point where we can get more than a .05% participation 
 in the selection process.  (There were less than 3 million votes
 listed in the table that Paul quoted, and that's only 1% of 
 <em>just</em> the U.S. population --- which is about 5% of the world
 population last I heard).  

<br><br>
 Who knows,  we might then see a bit of national, racial, or even 
 gender diversity in the candidates!  (Unfortunately that might 
 take way more than a century).

<br><br>
 It's not very likely --- but I'd like to on the next century and be
 astounded by the spread of altruistic collaboration from software into
 other endeavors.

<br><br>
 While I can't vote for Linus Torvalds as the man of this century I can
 mark his accomplishment as one of the most amazing things I've ever 
 seen.  He might leave a legacy that makes him the man of the next century!
