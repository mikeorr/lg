</pre>
Yesterday, I was helping Melissa add a user account to her laptop.
I decided to just point her at KDE's "Kuser" (K-&gt;System-&gt;"User Manager")
GUI tool, mostly because I wanted to see it. ;)  ("adduser" is not hard to
use, but I figured most non-Unix-types would go hunting a GUI tool,
so wanted to familiarize myself with it.)
</p>

<p>
One thing she noticed was the user "nobody", which sounded supsicious.
And it had quite an insane UID (65534), compared to other user accounts.
Her first thought was to Google for 'nobody 65534', and found many, many
posts where people had obviously dumped their /etc/passwd to a mailing list
for help with this-or-that.  Based on this, she seemed happy enough to
know it's just some "thing" that Linux does/has.
</p>

<p>
For the life of me, I couldn't really explain <em>what</em> "nobody" is used for.
I'm familiar with it in terms of NCSA httpd and Apache, but beyond that...
A little help, here?  :^D
</p>

<p>
Thx!
</p>

(PS - Google for '"nobody user" OR "user nobody" purpose linux' wasn't as
helpful as I had hoped. :^/  I also tried throwing 'FAQ' in there ;^) )

I'll take a stab at this.
</p>

<p>
The way I would explain it is that a *nix system has a variety of users
that are non-human.
</p>

<p>
They are users in the sense that they run processes that do not require
privileges to other parts of the system, and they maintain resources
(e.g. files and directories) to which other parts of the system do not
need access.  Therefore it is convenient and sensible to isolate them
from human users and from each other in the same way that human users
are isolated from each other.
</p>

<p>
The general idea is that your system is more secure if access is not
granted where it is not needed.  A non-human user may be a security
risk if, for example, it runs a program containing a flaw that lets
someone break in and run tasks with the privileges of that user.
</p>

<p>
I suppose someone chose the name "nobody" for one of these users
simply to emphasize that it's not human.  But there are many other
examples of such users, like apache, bind, daemon, mail, mysql and
news.
</p>

<p>
I hope this is not too condescending... I wrote it this way so that
newbies may also find it useful.

<p>
No, not at all.  Looking all the other dozens of users (lp, sys, etc.),
I explained to Melissa that it was exactly this...  putting up fences
between processes and files, so they can't clobber each other.
(Which would normally happen accidentally, or via an exploit.)
</p>

<p>
So it sounds like "nobody" is just more of a catch-all for this kind of
thing.  (e.g., back in the day, Apache ran as "nobody".  These days,
it's usually as an "apache" or "httpd" user.)
</p>

<p>
Seem like a reasonable way of explaining it?
</p>

<p>
I note with appreciation Rod's separate explanation.  Mine will probably
suffer some inaccuracies because it attempts to reconstruct ancient *ix
lore from faulty memory.
</p>

<p>
The "nobody" account is one that became a traditional feature long ago,
as a "sandbox" user-ID/username for running automated processes under
without elevated privilege and without special access to any specific
real user's files.  It's typically set to have either a locked password
or no valid shell, so as to not be an entry point for attackers.
</p>

<p>
I <em>think</em> that it's <em>maybe</em> (I was going to say "probably", but then
thought better) largely superfluous (but harmless) at this point,
because it eventually dawned on Unix admins that two separate automated
processes could have a common-mode security failure or other form of
disasterous interaction, such that it's better to set up a <em>distinct</em>
username for each such process to run under -- which is why Apache
httpd now typically runs as user "httpd" or such, for example.
</p>

<p>
Now, I can't swear that something won't break on your system, either
today or later on, if you were hypothetically to remove or further
restrict the "nobody" user.  Some scripts might be running as "nobody"
from time to time -- maybe cronjobs?
</p>

<p>
Flashback:  Early in my use of Unixes, I decided one day to "tighten
system security", and eventually got around to setting the various
non-real usernames in /etc/passwd to have shell /bin/false instead of
/bin/sh, /tmp/[username] for their shells, and so on.  Big mistake:  A
whole lot of crucial system maintenance broke -- because those usernames
turned out to need a real shell to do their work, though they didn't
have to be valid for login.
</p>

   the "insane" UID (65534) is -2, where 0 can
be thought of as 00000 and -1 is one less,
which in CPU registers is all 1 values, i.e.
65535 and -2 is one less than -1, i.e.
65535 - 1 = 65534
</p>

<p>
   I forget the user name for -1 and here the
nobody user name has -2 for a UID (that's
what 65534 is in 16-bit land).
</p>

<p>
   There's one big shop I know of that uses
nobody (65534) as an application name,
I believe for a remote log in.
   In the case of a laptop that has no apps
remotely logging in, there might be some
human log in scheme that permits remote
logging in as the user nobody and with the
highly restricted file and command access
that (should be) associated with that account.
