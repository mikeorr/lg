<EM>Enjoy this interview with Marty Pitts, Managing Editor at 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxtoday.com/">Linux Today</A>. He
talks about Linux Today's evolution and the growth of its main subject, Linux
operating systems.</EM>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: Please introduce yourself. (career, education,
        hobbies, personal and professional achievements).</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Marty Pitts:</b>

      My name is Marty Pitts.I worked in the nuclear industry for
      13 years before joining Linux Today, in jobs ranging from
      Purchasing Agent to Network Admin. I like to ski in the
      winter, hike and camp in the summer and read SciFi in
      between.I also like to play around with the latest Linux
      distros.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: How long have you been working and what are your
        responsibilities at Linux Today?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Marty Pitts:</b>

      When I became interested in using Linux at work, I started
      looking for a information about Linux online.One of the
      resources I came across was Linux Today. I liked that it was
      updated hourly. When I found news that they did not have, I
      started using their contrib form.After several months, the
      site owners: Dave and Dwight, asked if I would be interested
      in working as a volunteer on the site. Having become a Linux
      news junkie, I jumped at the chance.</p>

      <p>In the summer of 1999, Dave sent me an email asking what
      my employment situation was.It just so happened that at my
      current job, my boss of several year had just turned in his
      notice to quit.It was a good opportunity to think about a
      career change.How many people actually get a chance to work
      at what they love?</p>

      <p>I started working for Dave and Dwight in September of 1999
      full time as the Managing Editor.About a month later, Dave
      and Dwight sold the Linux Today web properties, which
      included 
      <A HREF="http://LinuxPR.com">LinuxPR.com</A>, to 
      <A HREF="http://internet.com">internet.com</A>. I have been as a full
      time employee of internet.com ever since.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: How's the site organized? Give us an idea of how
        the Linux Today works. How many people are involved?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Marty Pitts:</b>

      For the whole channel, which includes 14 web sites, there are
      approximately 9 full time editors and programmers.</p>

      <p>Right now there are two full time people who work on Linux
      Today, myself and Michael Hall.We also take care of LinuxPR
      and a couple of other sites in the Linux/Open Source
      channel.</p>

      <p>Michael lives on the east coast of the US, and I live in
      Washington state on the west coast.So naturally we break up
      the day, with Michael covering the first part of the day and
      then I come online later with a couple hours of overlap.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: Can you describe Linux Today evolution since it
        began?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Marty Pitts:</b>

      Dave and Dwight were the ones that came up with the idea for
      Linux Today and they are the ones who successfully executed
      that idea.They were successful enough to attract the
      attention of internet.com.</p>

      <p>It started as a labor of love for Dave and Dwight.They
      wanted to provide a resource that people could use to find
      out what was going in the Linux/Open Source world.They
      started the site on September 30, 1998. A year later, they
      had both quit their daytime jobs to work full time on the
      site, they had been able to hire a full time editor, and they
      had posted over 10,000 stories. Currently we are right at
      34,000 stories posted, just on Linux Today.</p>

      <p>After the sale of the site to internet.com, somethings
      changed and others remained surprisingly the same.Dave chose
      to leave and pursue other goals, Dwight stayed on and we
      worked to keep the site going. To replace Dave, who had done
      most of the site programming, Paul Ferris was hired.</p>

      <p>Paul, a great guy, started working on the programming side
      but still found time to write his column: Rant Mode Equals
      One.Currently we are using the second iteration of the site
      code, which Paul wrote, and we are about to roll out the
      third iteration of the code.It will provide increased
      flexibility so that the code will be able to be used across a
      variety of different sites, each with its own unique
      requirements.</p>

      <p>What stayed the same, during the transition, was the
      direction and focus of Linux Today. We were told to keep
      doing what we had been doing that had made Linux Today a
      popular site, which was a relief.</p>

      <p>Today we have a lot more original content than we used to.
      In addition, our focus is on making the whole Linux/Open
      Source channel work together well.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: Are there companies sponsoring or maintaining
        Linux Today?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Marty Pitts:</b>

      Since Linux Today is owned by internet.com, they are the ones
      who pay for the maintenance of this and the other sites.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: Is there any central control to avoid redundancy
        and improve editorial efforts?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Marty Pitts:</b>

      Yes. We have, as part of the backend to Linux Today, an
      Editorial Board that keeps track of who is working on what
      stories. In addition, we use email extensively, plus we have
      an IRC channel for quick communication.</p>

      <p>In spite of that, we occasionally will have a duplicate
      story go up.Which is why, sometimes you will see a message
      that says, 'This story has been unposted.'</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: How difficult is to present good content day by
        day? Besides the users' contribution, do you have any other
        content resource (agencies like Reuters, etc.)?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Marty Pitts:</b>

      Early in the week, Monday and Tuesday, it is usually very
      easy to find content to post.As the week progresses though,
      it can be a struggle to find good content and resist posting
      something that is just a rehash of a story that has already
      been covered.Weekends are more difficult since there is
      usually no news from the traditional sources. Since we like
      to have time off as well, we break up the weekend between the
      editors and we also future post some items so that they show
      up over a regular period of time.This way, we are able to
      take a break and our readers can find some fresh content.</p>

      <p>Our readers are a very valuable source of content.Without
      them providing links and suggestions, Linux Today would not
      be were it is today.</p>

      <p>We are able to find some relevant content elsewhere within
      the internet.com properties, which we use when available.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: How do you see Linux Today in the Open Source
        world? What's the best contribution Linux Today has been
        giving to the Linux community during its existence?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Marty Pitts:</b>

      We see Linux Today as the place to stop if you want to know
      what is going on in the Linux/Open Source community today. We
      search out the events and news and bring it to one place so
      that our readers don't have to spend the time doing that
      search for themselves.</p>

      <p>Through the forums and story talkbacks, we help to
      facilitate discussions within the community and give our
      readers a place to react to the news of the day.</p>

      <p>I believe that Linux Today's greatest contribution is that
      we are able to raise the awareness of our readers about the
      events, good and bad, that are happening within and to the
      Linux/Open Source community.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: What are the new features being developed for
        Linux Today? Can you detail the main currently
        projects?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Marty Pitts:</b>

      We are about to roll out redesigned site software that will
      provide a greater flexibility and robustness to all the sites
      on the channel.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: What is your opinion about the growth of Linux
        in the enterprises? What about desktops, do you have a
        projection for the future?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Marty Pitts:</b>

      From my experience, Linux is infused into the enterprise
      deeper than anyone suspects. When a problem can be solved
      without having to ask for a new budget item, the guys/gals on
      the front lines will use what works. I see the projections by
      companies like Gartner and IDC and I have to laugh. They
      don't know how to properly measure the revolution that is
      taking place under their noses. Their methodology can't
      account for stealth deployments.</p>

      <p>The desktop is there already. Ease of use and graphical
      tools have come a long way in just the past year or two. I
      use Linux as my work environment, and for many like myself,
      Linux is already there.Just look at what we have available to
      us, DVD decoding and playback capability, the latest video,
      sound and networking hardware. The environments available are
      amazing as well. Even though I don't use KDE or GNOME (I use
      a pure 'Enlightenment' desktop), I have both of them on my
      system and use their apps.</p>
