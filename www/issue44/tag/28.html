<P><STRONG>
Hi good day I would line to download the linux program please let
me know where and how to download and install this program. and
what file I need to have. I want to get to know that operating
system. everyone is talking about it and I want it to be my main
operating system
</STRONG></P>

I'm afraid that "the linux program" is actually a bit
of a misnomer.  It is true that Linux is a program.
Specifically it is a kernel.  You could go to
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org"
	>ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org</A> and download any of the versions
of the Linux kernel that you'll find there.  They range
from archaic .10 and .9x versions through the current
2.2  (stable) and 2.3 (developmental) versions.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, you could download one of these kernels (in source
code form, of course).  Then you'd compile it (more on
that later) and you'd have a copy of "the linux program"
to run.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Linux kernel is after all just a program.  It implements
about 180 system calls, provides file systems, device
drivers, a sockets interfaces with TCP/IP networking
suite, and some memory and process management APIs and
interprocess communications methods.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course that's not of much direct use.  A kernel doesn't
<EM>do</EM> anything for a user.  It provides a set of services
to your applications and other programs.  You use those
programs and they use the kernel services.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In a technical sense "Linux" is just the kernel.  Of course
the common sense of the term refers to a large suite of
utilities that run under this kernel (combined with the
kernel.  The most obvious things you need to run this
program (the kernel) are:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><ul><li>
a way to compile it.
</ul></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE><ul><li>
a way to boot it.
</ul></blockquote>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Linux kernel is written in C.  Linus Torvalds uses GCC
and most of the other developers use that or one of its
derivatives (such as egcs, now merging back into GCC).
This mostly means that you want to compile your Linux kernel
on a Linux system.  (You could cross-compile it on some
other UNIX or UNIX-like system --- but that would be
somewhat more complicated.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To boot it you'd need something like the LILO package
or a copy of LOADLIN.EXE (and a copy of MS-DOS or one of
its clones to run THAT under).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course this hypothetical discussion of running the
kernel by itself is a bit absurd.  To learn Linux and
to make any practical use of it, you need a whole suite
of programs to install it, as well as a few programs to
run under it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Most of us, particularly the techies among us, refer to
different collections of a Linux kernel with GNU, BSD, MIT
and other (mostly free) software as "distributions."
Distributions combine a kernel with a suite of installation
and configuration tools (like 'fdisk' to re-partition your
hard drive, and <TT>/sbin/lilo</TT> to install and update your
boot loader (master boot record code) etc).  They also
include libraries (like DLLs in MS-Windows) and, of course
lots of software (like editors, commmand interpreters,
compilers, web servers, graphics handlers and drawing
programs, etc.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are many distributions.  The most current and up-to-date
list that I know of is maintained in a section of the Linux
Weekly News which lists links to about 100 of them, and
posts any news about them that gets the attention of their
editors.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><DL><DT>
You can read a recent one at:
<DD><A HREF="http://www.lwn.net/1999/0722/dists.phtml"
	>http://www.lwn.net/1999/0722/dists.phtml</A>
</DL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are some spcial "micro-distributions" like Tom's
Root/Boot, LOAF (Linux on a Floppy), DOSLinux (which
installs into a DOS subdirectory) and various special
purpose systems like LRP --- the Linux Router Project.  Some
of these fit on a single floppy.  Others fit in about 20Mb
or less of archives.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, most distributions take up over a
100Mb. Consequently they are usually distributed on CDs.
There are a couple of places to get very inexpensive sets of
Linux CDs. I tend to think CheapBytes
<A HREF="http://www.cheapbytes.com"
	>http://www.cheapbytes.com</A> first in this category.  You can
get <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> or Mandrake CDs for as low as $1.99 plus shipping
and handling ($5.00). (Mandrake is a derivative of the Red
Hat Linux distribution -- it builds on it by adding a few
extra packages and refinements, etc).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now I realize I sound like an ad.  You can certainly find
whole distributions to download over the Internet.  On some
sites you can find ISO 9660 CD images (these are 650Mb
images suitable to be "burned" right off your drive and onto
your CDR or CDRW media).  I wouldn't recommend downloading
one of those with anything less than a T1 at your disposal.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's also possible, with some difficulty and quite a bit of
patience, to install a Linux distribution with a small set
of floppies and an FTP connection.  I've installed <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A>
5.2 with a single boot floppy (and one supplemental, if I
recall, it's been awhile).  I had to try several times to
get it right and to get past the occasional disconnects.
That was over a DSL line.  I wouldn't try it over a modem.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
With Debian you'd cut a set of seven or eight HD floppies,
install the "base system" using those, then you could
selectively add packages as needed.  Although this is
possible with the current Debian "stable" release (2.1) it's
much easier with the "unstable" (code-named "Potato")
version.  I have this running on my system at work, and I
put a machine on it for an installfest earlier today.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Debian is well suited to installation over the Internet
because it has many small packages and relatively sane
dependencies.  So you can install almost exactly what you
need without getting any unwanted space and bandwith
consuming "extra" baggage.  Using the apt-get and apt-find
front ends you basically just issue a command that says:
"install that" --- and the system connects to the Debian
archive mirror system, finds the latest version of the
package for your distribution release, fetches it, installs
it, and does the basic initial configuration.  It
automatically determines any pre-requisite packages
(dependencies) and prompts to install those as well.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(Another thing I like about Debian is that you can upgrade
all of the packages that you have installed with one
commend.  If you use the command:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BlockQuote><Code>
apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get dist-upgrade
</Code></BlockQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... you end up with a fully up-to-date system.  This seems a
bit scary at first.  Most of us have had "simple" upgades
and installations "break" our systems (particularly those of
us from the MS-DOS and MS-Windows worlds).  However, I've
been experimenting with this feature for several months
(tracking the "unstable" developments, no less).  About once
on every day that I'm in the office I switch to one of my
VCs, hit the up arrow a couple of times and re-issue this
command from my history.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So far I haven't had one upgrade related problem on that
system.  None.  Not one. Wow!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Despite all this I wouldn't necessarily recommend Debian as
your first version of Linux.  It is a "power-users"
distribution.  It's a bit rough around the edges and it does
some things just differently enough that you might find it
frustrating to learn Linux.  When you ask other Linux users
in your area for help you'd like their answers to apply to
your distrubution as much as to theirs.  Stormix (a Debian
derivative; similar to how Mandrake is a Red Hat offshoot)
offers some interesting possibilities for the future.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, in summary:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BlockQuote>
You can "download" Linux.  However, it's much faster and
probably cheaper to buy a CD.
