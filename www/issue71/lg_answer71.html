<!-- begin hgreeting -->
<p>   Ouch.

<p>
   The world trade center in shambles.  The financial community is still
   mostly in shock.  The airline industry is rightfully quite horrified.
   I know <em>I'm</em> horrified...

<p>
   What can we, members of the free software community, do?

<p>
   I know a lot of sites have put up banners linking to various helpful
   organizations, the Red Cross, funds for the families of all the 
   emergency personnel killed, and so on.  So much in fact, that I wonder
   how many charities will go short shrift of donations, clothes, and
   other things, simply because this one presently has everyone's attention.

<p>
   But that's what we do <em>as people</em>.  As a <em>community</em> we
   can do a lot more.  <a href="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>
   did great on keeping us all in tune with the news, when the routers 
   in front of almost every major news service were going into meltdown.
   People used IRC and websites to find out if friends were alive and well,
   I saw wikis, I saw email lists briefly stop talking about the topic
   of the moment and reserve the day for traffic about who was okay.  Now
   this didn't just mean wondering whether anybody died in New York.  For
   instance, a friendly soul from the GNOME Usability Project was trapped
   in China for 6 days longer than he expected... making it to our user
   group meeting just in time, I might add, but I think it probably 
   dampened his enthusiasm for our chinese food.

<p>
   We're an international community, and now an international problem that
   has existed for a long time has been made more obvious.  These people
   that took these planes used little that was unavailable to Cro Magnon
   Man.  I'll update them to the Bronze Age because they found a cheat 
   sheet for how to not be followed - but we're still talking tribal 
   hunters, not 21st century "agents" from The Matrix.

<p>Yet there are these pushes to "wiretap" email. (See the Crypto-Gram
   Newsletter, <a href="http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram-109a.html"
		>http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram-109a.html</a>
   for some details.)  The ultra-protectionism
   of Big Corporate copyrights continues (you think the 
	<a href="http://www.educause.edu/issues/dmca.html"
		>Digital Millenium Copyright Act</a>, already passed
   and being enforced, is bad?  Look at the bill 
	"<a href="http://216.110.42.179/docs/hollings.090701.html"
	>SSSCA</a>" up for attention.  According to the EFF's Cindy Cohn
	it makes the DMCA "look like the Bill Of Rights".) while frankly, 
   my ability as a real individual who writes about one tune every 2 years, 
   lyrics a little more often, and at least one article a month, to 
   continue to enforce my OWN copyrights and fair use rights under the 
   US Code, Title 17
   (<a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/index.html"
	>http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/index.html</a>) 
   continues straight into the gutter.
   My expectation of safety when I visit a foreign country obviously won't
   be based on the idea that I was an invited speaker -- as far as I know,
   anybody who was trapped in another city because all flights were grounded
   has gotten home now, even the ones who took a taxi From Chicago to Los
   Angeles -- but Dmitry Sklyarov, a Russian citizen, continues to live 
   trapped in the USA because eBooks can't be sold in Russia unless you 
   can make a backup of them, and he agreed to TALK about how the encryption 
   works on US soil.

<p>
  <strong>NOW</strong> I'm terrified.

<p>Of course most of my email lives a very public life already.  But let's
   face it, a translucent dime store postcard written on in big black marker
   has more privacy than the average internet Joe.  It's not a federal 
   felony to hassle a small town ISP because they don't want to let you 
   wiretap all of their customers just because you have a warrant on one of 
   them.  (We'll leave out whether the "up to something" they might
   be up to is about real life-and-death matters or merely about someone
   wanting to play Mom for us.)  It's not a federal crime to impersonate
   being someone important so that your spam gets into a victim's box.
   Hey, I may dislike spam a great deal, but it's just a delete button,
   okay?  He's said his piece and I ignore it.    We paint over graffiti
   on the walls of small towns, no attention, no fanfare, and eventually
   the spams die.   End of story.

<p>
   Soon, however, it may be a federal crime -- penalty, to lose most of
   your rights of US citizenship forever -- to deface a website.  HELLO
   real world!  This is about equivalent to "joyriding".  Give 'em some
   community service and get on with life. Goodness knows what level of 
   punishment they have in mind for someone who 
   believes that mail containing things about money matters really ought
   to be in an envelope that can't be steamed open, even in the figurative
   sense of cyberspace.  (If you don't use PGP or 
	<a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> already, establish
   the habit now.  Free interoperable clients for MSwin and Mac: 
	<a href="http://www.pgp.com/products/freeware/default.asp"
	>http://www.pgp.com/products/freeware/default.asp</a>) 
   Or that we have a reasonable expectation of privacy and freedom to 
   assemble as a group for any other reason.  Or that the business 
   transactions of any US company are none of any other company's or 
   country's direct business, 
   unless some sort of model of trust exists between them.
   Join the <a href="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>
   and keep up on other resources about what is going on.  As a group we
   have a better chance.  (There are other privacy related groups out there
   too.  <a href="http://www.cato.org/">Cato.org</a>, the 
	<a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a>, 
	and Europeans might consider checking out the Justis database,
	<a href="http://www.justis.com/database/european_law.html"
	>http://www.justis.com/database/european_law.html</a>.  I'm sorry
	I can't read other languages or surely I'd have more pointers...)

<p>
   The electronic 'zines I'm subscribed to were singing the praises of the
   IT staff who arranged for businesses to go onward regardless of the 
   chaos.  They're only just starting to notice the drastic legislation
   that's trying to come down the pipe on a wave of patriotism, duty, and
   budget-grubbing.  I work with and know a lot of sysadmins.  I can tell
   you that a lot of sysadmins right now don't like the idea of being
   put in a tight spot: as a cop, with none of the legal defenses a cop
   has for doing his job;  as a carrier of bits, with none of the legal
   defenses of a telphony Common Carrier for the fact that we are not the
   origin of any of this information;  as an implementor of company policy,
   and a professional with special skills, but without the defense of 
   "client privilege" that other professions enjoy.

<p>A number of legislators are quite up in arms over the idea that they 
   are being asked to vote on these matters without enough time to read
   all the horrid little details.  However, some seem to want this extra 
   time so they have a chance to draft their own pet departments, see
<a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/ap/20010920/us/attacks_terrorism_laws_3.html">http://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/ap/20010920/us/attacks_terrorism_laws_3.html</a>.  Call your reps now and make sure that whatever does finally get
   drafted actually defends and supports <em>you</em>.  I'm sad to say that
   email probably isn't enough -- you can try it, but they get a ton, and it
   carries little emotional power.  Use a phone and <strong>talk</strong>
   to these people.  

<p>
   While a proposed bill isn't exactly 
   "closed source" it is pretty much what something huge like OpenOffice
   or the linux kernel is to someone uninitiated to the wizardry of C and
   perhaps even deeply experienced in the same.  Of course in <em>our</em>
   scope we have all sorts of utilities to help us manage large projects
   and sort through things.  So what I'd love to see is some sort of
   "pretty print" style parser that goes over proposed bills and exposes
   the described crimes, regulations, penalties and so on to a bit of
   serious debugging.   The "sources" are readable by anyone on THOMAS,
	<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/">http://thomas.loc.gov/</a>; 
   although goodness knows if those are up to date with what is being 
   argued on the Congress floor, it's a start.  I'm sure somebody out 
   there can give it a shot!

<p><em>On a somewhat more local note, we had many more threads than this,
        in fact I am amazed at the percentage of incoming questions that we
        answered.  But I just got all boiled up and had to let off the
        above rant.  On the plus side my scripts are doing better by
        far than last month.  So I have picked some highly juicy ones
        and hope you'll forgive me the short list.  We have new
        <a href="tag/bios.html">Biographies</a>
        for the Answer Gang, too, so you can get a sense of who answers 
	your questions here.</em></p>
