I used to wonder what "unroutable address" meant in SMTP Delivery Status 
Notification messages, as it has always seemed more than a bit vague.
It turns out, it <em>is</em> vague.  ;-&gt;  It's the default Exim return value if
a message gets evaluated against all the Exim "router" handling routines to 
see if it meets any of their criteria for acceptance.  If not, it falls
through and generates return value text "unrouteable address" by default
(<a href="http://www.exim.org/exim-html-4.40/doc/html/spec_3.html#SECT3.10">http://www.exim.org/exim-html-4.40/doc/html/spec_3.html#SECT3.10</a>).  The
question then becomes <em>why</em>, in each case.  For TAG subscriber Barry
O'Donovan &lt;gazette at barryodonovan.com), only a little checking was
required to find out:
<pre>
  $ dig -t mx barryodonovan.com +short
  ;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached
  $ dig -t a barryodonovan.com +short
  ;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached
  $ whois barrydonovan.com | more

  Domain names in the .com and .net domains can now be registered
  with many different competing registrars. Go to <a href="http://www.internic.net">http://www.internic.net</a>
  for detailed information.
 
  No match for "BARRYDONOVAN.COM".

Because Barry's domain no longer exists, I've been getting one of the
below-cited nastygrams every time anyone posts to TAG.  So, I'm setting
his subscription to "nomail" in case he fixes his domain.  ('Course, he
might never figure out why he's ceased to receive TAG mail, but that's
the breaks.)

...and <em>should</em> have updated the subject header to reflect my deciding
on that remedy, rather than just removing his subscription, as I'd
intended upon starting my post.  (Unfortunately, I sent before
thinking.)

I got a slightly different (and slightly puzzling) reply:

Whoops! That should, of course, been "whois barryodonovan.com" (note the 
'o' between the first and the last names):

<p>
Despite the above differences, I still agree that this is the right
thing to do. When mail gets repeatedly bounced for non-trivial causes -
and the admin gets prodded by the system every time this happens -
"nomail"ing that address is definitely the right answer.

<p>
And that was <em>my</em> error!  I must be tired, I guess -- though there are
other signs elsewhere that should have warned me.  When I spell the
domain correctly, I of course get the same "whois" results you do.
</p>

<p>
One take-away lesson:  Copy and paste are your friend.  Retyping of
crucial data is to be strenuously avoided.
