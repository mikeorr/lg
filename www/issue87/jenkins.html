<h2>The Poodle and the Labrador</h2>

<p>You are halfway through typing a new program into a remote machine connected
over a dial-up line, and you get
called to intervene in a fight between your partner's miniature poodle
and the neighbour's ugly yellow Labrador.
When you get back, your connection has timed-out.</p>

<p>Is this something that has happened to you?
Or perhaps you had to
drag your kids away from a particularly offensive episode of Jerry Springer,
then found you had to stick around to make sure they didn't come back?</p>

<h2>The Blonde Solution</h2>

<p>The traditional procedure for maintaining activity on your line during
an interruption of the type outlined above was to use a 'fortune' program
in a small loop so that a random saying got written to your screen
every half-minute. This could present some real problems if a person with
fair hair looked at your screen and saw something like:</p>
<pre>
 Q:  How do you make a blonde's eyes light up?
 A:  Shine a flashlight in her ear.
</pre>
<p>You could of course used a '-i' or equivalent parameter restricting 'fortune'
to generating inoffensive material like:</p>
<pre>
  Computing Definition
  Chaining - A method of attaching programmers to desk, to speed up output.
</pre>
<p>The more recent incarnations of the 'fortune' program offer their users
a more specific set of options. You can chose between offending 
those who are Irish, gay or intellectually retarded!</p>

<h2>For The Terminally-Challenged</h2>

<p>If you are just using a browser to read your Hotmail messages, you probably
won't want to open a terminal window just so you can run a 'fortune'
program. If you are using an X11-compliant window-manager, you could start a
clock program with something like:</p>
<pre> xclock -digital -update 1 &</pre>
<p>But that's not going to work on your your vintage Windows 95 machine unless
you also happen to be running something like PC-Xware.</p>
<p>The 'KeepAlive.java' program listed here is designed to work anywhere.
It's written in Java 1.1 so that even the 'jview' virtual machine
on your basic Microsoft machine can handle it. It doesn't rely on finding
a 'fortune', 'xclock' or other program on a remote machine. And you don't
have to change anything when you connect via a different ISP.</p> 

<h2>Finding A Partner</h2>

<p>But you have to send traffic somewhere, right? So how do you find a partner
machine which will receive your traffic? If we were writing this program as
a shell script, we might work out where our gateway was, and ping it at
appropriate intervals. That's not so easy to do in a Java program which might
run on any number of platforms. And in any case, it would be nice if we could
send traffic somewhere beyond the gateway machine.</p>

<p>In almost every sort of networking arrangement, the participating machines
have knowledge of one or more nameserver addresses. So what we can do from
our Java program is make periodic requests to those nameservers.
We need to ensure that any hosts whose addresses we request cannot be found
locally in a hosts table. And we need to also ensure that the answers to
our nameserver requests are not cached locally. If you take a look now at
the program, you will see that the names of the hosts whose addresses
we are requesting are generated by
examining the clock-time in milliseconds at the time of each request.
This results in names like A1040689223909, A1040689229448, etc.</p>

<p>That's really all we need to do. But it's nice to be able to see something
happening. So our program defines a 'MessageFrame' class which displays two
colored buttons in a GUI window. The colors of these are changed at each
iteration. We also set the title on the GUI window, and change it at each
iteration - so we can still see something happening when the window is
minimized. And we set up a listener to detect 'window closing' events and
perform a graceful shutdown.</p>

<h2>Getting It Together</h2>

<p>Here's the
<a href="misc/jenkins/KeepAlive.java.txt">program</a>.
You need to compile it with a command like:
<pre> javac KeepAlive.java</pre>
This will generate three 'class' files which contain code which can be executed
on a java virtual machine. So you can copy those class files to a directory
on another machine, then execute it with a command like:
<pre> java KeepAlive</pre>
To use the Microsoft virtual machine on a Windows box, use:
<pre> java KeepAlive</pre>
</p>

  public void statusMess(Color left, Color right) {
    b1.setBackground(left); b2.setBackground(right);
  }
  public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {}
}
</pre>
<p>If you have Java 1.1 or later, and no requirement to use the Microsoft
virtual machine,
you can assemble the class files into a single 'jar' file, then execute it
using the '-jar' option thus:
<pre>
  echo "Main-Class: KeepAlive\015" &gt;/tmp/MyManifest
  jar cmf /tmp/MyManifest /tmp/KeepAlive.jar *.class
  
  java -jar /tmp/KeepAlive.jar
</pre>

<h2>If You Don't Have It</h2>

<p>If your machine doesn't have Java, you can get it from
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads.html">Sun MicroSystems</a>.

And if you need to know more about network programming with Java, you
could take a look at <a href="http://www.davidreilly.com/jnpbook">"Java Network
Programming and Distributed Computing" by David Reilly and Michael Reilly</a>.
