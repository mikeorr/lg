<h3>
<a NAME="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
The first document by Rick Holbert is Micro Publishing. 
I wrote an update to that article. This article is another update. 
This article is going to be short, but it is significant since
Mark has found a way he likes to make the books, finally. 
<p>
The process of making the books inexpensively is the fact that is gets
cumbersome. It can be a real pain in the butt. My whole goal is to make it
very simple and very fast. There is no point making books if it becomes
an unpleasant event. This document will address several problems Mark and
Rick has had in the past and present one solution. This article will
also list ongoing problems. 
<p>
Rick and I are in the process of making a HOWTO for book binding, and
if anyone wishes to add to the HOWTO or wishes to contribute thoughts, 
please send email to <a href="mailto:zing@gnujobs.com">zing@gnujobs.com</a>.

<h3>
<a NAME="General"></a>Using a stapler, different glue, etc</h3>

In the past, our tools were,
<ol>
<li> Book formatted pdf, postscript, or other document. </li>
<li> Duplex laser printer.</li>
<li> Paper folder.</li>
<li> Manual heavy-duty stapler that can do at least 1/2 inch staples.</li>
<li> Ruler</li>
<li> Paper for the cover.</li>
<li> Contact cement.</li>
<li> Book binding press</li>
</ol>
<p>
The problem with this setup was that you have to keep your book in the
book press for 30 minutes before letting it go. Also, I wasn't using a ruler
when Rick said I should.

<p>
With my current setup, we can eliminate the book-binding press with just
a straight-edge. Here are the tools, 
<ol>
<li> Book formatted pdf, postscript, or other document. </li> 
<li> Duplex laser printer.</li>
<li> Paper folder.</li>
<li> Manual heavy-duty stapler that can do at least 1/2 inch staples.</li>
<li> Ruler</li>
<li> Paper for the cover.</li>
<li> Contact cement.</li>
<li> Straight edge</li>
<li> Very large binder clips.</li> 
</ol>  

<p>
Here are the steps,
<ol>
<li> Print the document on a duplex printer and make sure the printer
  is set to flip in the long edge. If you don't use a duplex printer, 
  it is a pain in the butt. Please use a duplex printer. Please refer
  to our other articles for steps on how to use a non-duplex printer.</li>
<li> Use a paper folder or fold them by hand. Please buy a paper folder
  and use it to fold the paper.  Refer to our other documents.</li>  
<li> Straighten up the folded paper on the edges and use two large
  binding clips to kept the paper from shifting. </li>
<li> Place the paper in a heavy-duty manual stapler that can use at least
   1/2 inch staples. Staple the paper at least twice. </li>
<li> Measure the width of the paper on the folded side of the paper
    where the staples are at. Squeeze it down when you measure it.
   Measure 5.5 inches plus 1/16 inch from the edge of the cardboard
   stock paper that you are going to use as your cover. Use a ruler
   to create a line from top to bottom. Measure out the width 
   of the edge onto the cover and add 1/16th inch. Draw a line across
   from top to bottom here. Now, fold the cover at the two lines 
   with a nice and crisp edge.  </li>
<li> Take the cover and place it up against anything that is straight
    and has a little height, like a block of wood, or something. 
    Place the paper on the cover and fold the cover over the paper. </li>
<li> After you have verified the cover fits over the paper nice and smooth,
    place contact cement on the inside binding edge of the cover. You don't
    need a lot of glue. </li>
<li> Fold the cover over again, and smoothen out the edge of the binding
    edge with your finger. Use two large binding clips to keep the 
    cover on the paper. </li>
<li> Done!</li>     
</ol>

<h3><a NAME="Important"></a>Why is this setup important?</h3>

This setup is important for the following reasons:
<ol>
<li>Since you are using staples, you don't have to worry about individual
  pages from ever falling out. </li>
<li>Since you don't have to use much glue, you don't accidentally
   get glue all over the place.</li>
<li>Not having to use a book binding press means you don't have to go
   make one. </li>
<li>Using paper clips to keep the cover on means you can just stack
  the books and mass produce them. Once you put the paper clips are on, 
  you are effectively done.</li>
<li> If you use a ruler to make the edges nice and straight, it makes the
  book look better and it also makes it so there isn't much gap between the
  paper and the cover, which means the glue is able to connect the paper
  to the cover better. 
</ol>

<h3><a NAME="Problems"></a>Problems</h3>
Here are some problems:
<ol>
<li>Don't staple the staples too far away from the edge since the book won't
be able to flatten if someone opens it up. </li>
<li>I don't like using contact cement. Given this stapler solution, it should
  just be possible to apply different glue or some way of applying
  some else besides glue to just keep the cover attached to the paper.</li>
<li> If you can visually see the staples when you open the book on the
  first page and the last page, it looks dumb. We need to find
    a way to cover up the staples easily. There is no reason for people to
   know that we took the cheap way out and used staples. </li>
<li> We need cheap free way of filtering out fonts from pdf documents
  so that they aren't so huge and can print faster. Right now, we can cheat
   and use a commercial product to filter out the fonts that are annoying, 
   but it would be nice if we could do it in a free way.    
</ol>

<h3><a NAME="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3>
There really is no conclusion, except now Mark can make books fast for the 
<a href="http://www.colug.net">COLUG</a>
 and <a href="http://www.svlug.org">SVLUG</a> groups he participates in.
Before it was always a pain and time consuming to make books and it was
cumbersome. Now, after the paper has been printed, he can make a book
every 10 minutes, or faster.
