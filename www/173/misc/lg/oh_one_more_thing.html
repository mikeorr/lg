...has anyone noticed anything different about TAG? No? Good. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
The Answer Gang list - in fact, all the LG lists - have now been
rehosted, and everything seems to be working fine (LG itself is still
hosted where it was, due to the kind offices of Thomas Fullhart of
Fullhart Software, <a href='http://fullhartsoftware.com/'>http://fullhartsoftware.com/</a>).  That's a very large
load off my mind, and much thanks to Ren&eacute; Pfeiffer whose help in this
move made the list transition much, much easier.
</p>

<p>
There's something I'd like to mention at this point; something really
important, and something that I'm going to cover in this month's Back
Page in LG. It's a change in policy - one of those things that I do
only on occasion, and not simply when it's warranted but when it's
required. Experience has shown that it is, indeed, required.
</p>

<p>
The addition to our policy is a simple one: Be nice. Be polite. Bastard
Operators from Hell are explicitly unwelcome. No rudeness is allowed in
LG from here forward - and this is the way it'll stay as long as I'm
EiC, and as long as I'm associated with LG in any way.
</p>

<p>
The recent flamewar here in TAG has convinced me that this needs to be
a hard limit, for my own sake as well as that of everyone else. I've
let my temper get away from me here in the past, and that's no more
acceptable than it is for anyone else to do so.
</p>

<p>
Ren&eacute; has agreed to serve as the TAG moderator, and I'm as much subject
to his decisions as anyone else. As for the broader issue of LG itself, 
my interpretation of this policy is "no more ranting (humor excepted)"
in the articles.
</p>

<p>
Whatever went on in the past, I want every aspect of LG to be that of a
pleasant, professional environment - for our staff as well as our
readers. Suggestions for making it more so are always welcome.

I did note that the list id had changed, bypassing my old filters.
