Big Brother - Place to put system information...

Big Brother has a hiding place for system information.  Just create 
a file in www/notes/ with the same name as a monitored system and
you can access this information just by clicking on the system name
on the Big Brother Main page.

I use this for disaster recovery information, system inventory stuff,
disk partition information, installed software, and just general 
commentary.
