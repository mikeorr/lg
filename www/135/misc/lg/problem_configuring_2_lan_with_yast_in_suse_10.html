Dear list,
</p>

<p>
I am running a PC having suse 10.  I have 2 lan card here
and like to configure 2 cards with different setting.
I have tried to configure the cards using Yast, but the
problem is ; 2 cards taking the same DNS, gateway etc from
the configuration which 
I make latter.  I think there may be some problem in yast,
so I like to do it manually. could any one suggest me the
file in suse 10 where I can 
write configuration for eth0 and eth1 and could any one
kindly provide an example configuration <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
</p>

<p>
thanks in advanced.
</p>

You probably want something more like:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
route add default gw 192.178.70.23 dev eth1
</pre>
I don't remember where SuSE spits out such information.

Thanks Thomas for the info. yes default gw is a must to
have. the place where suse stores eth info 
is /etc/sysconfig/network ; I have just discoverd.  But I
like to ask you one more thing. I have 2 lan cards.
when I set eth0 as DHCP enable then my firefox and ping
command are running (from eth0) but when 
I disable eth0 and enable eth1 to dialup my adsl connection
I can see the welcome message as a successful
connection but then the browser doesn't fire up and ping is
not working bcoz it still do all query based on
eth0. How can I configure my system that ping and browser
work based on eth1 ?
</p>

<p>
thanks.
