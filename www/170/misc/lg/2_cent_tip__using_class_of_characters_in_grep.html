How do you catch a range or group of characters when using grep? Of
course you can always do something like:
<pre>
$ grep -E '[a-z]+' ./test.txt
</pre>
to show lines in file "test.txt" that contain at least single
character between 'a' to z in lower case.
</p>

<p>
But there is other way (and hopefully more intuitive...for some
people). Let's do something like above, but the other way around. Tell
grep to show the name of text files that doesn't contain upper case
characters
<pre>
$ grep -E -v -l '[[:upper:]]+' ./*
</pre>
Here, upper is another way of saying [A-Z]. Note the usage of double
brackets! I got trapped once, thinking that I should only use single
bracket and wonder why it didn't work....
</p>

<p>
There are more classes you can use. Check "info grep" in section 5.1
"Character class"

<p>
There's also the '-P' ('Perl-like') switch that's kinda hit-and-miss,
but at least manages to handle Unicode named properties ('\p{Lu}' for
upper case, etc.)

&lt;Leftmost&gt; jimregan, that's because deep inside you, you are evil.
