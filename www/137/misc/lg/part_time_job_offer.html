<p>ATTENTION</p>
<p>My name is James nameremoved. I just came about your email address
through an email listing affiliated with the US Chamber of Commerce
and I would be very interested in offering you a part-time paying
job in which you could earn a lot without quitting your present Job
or having problem with your employers.I am a man with 4 kids all
boys and the love of my life, my wife. I am a some what
multitalented man and I do quite a lot of traveling and get to meet
quite a lot of people. I just resigned my job as a research
scientist for ARINI (Agricultural research Institute of Northern
Ireland (www.arini.ac.uk)) but I still work as a freelance
consultant for the institute which gives me very much time to do my
own work which is basically being a freelance researcher who could
be employed by research institutes to do research projects anywhere
in the world. I reside in Ireland, Dublin even though I have lived
most of my life in other parts of ! the world; I am fully residing
in Ireland. Presently, I have just been granted a funding to head a
research project in the tropical regions of West Africa regarding
rare and vulnerable plant species and this would be commencing very
soon. However my funding was by my American counterparts who send
me the bunch of payments mostly in US based money orders. Getting
an accountant in the states or opening an account would have been
my best choice but I have a deadline to meet and taking any of
those choices would cost me time and a whole lot of other
requirements. I am not ready to deal with, as I would be traveling
a lot in the meantime. So presently, assuming you would be able to
deal with cash, I would be willing to employ you on contract basis
to be my payment representative back in the states, this way I
could issue and make payments in form of Money Orders, Cashier's
Check, etc out to you, you could then cash them easily, withdraw
10% of the total! amount on these payment instruments as your
commission and then send the rest back to me through wire transfer.
Please, bear it in mind that we would be dealing with quite a
handful of cash and you could be making up to $5000 just working
with me in a short period of time within 1-2 weeks. I would be glad
if you accept my proposal and I intend to commence on starting as
soon as you are ready. If you are interested, please email me back
so we could make concluding arrangements. Thank you James nameremoved

Address (Where to send the check to) Age Occupation Contact phone

<p>I'm a bit of a hanging judge on these matters, so I've not
merely sent the complaint-mail below, but also permanently blocked
the sending IP.</p>
<p>Note that the claimed hotmail.com sending address is forged, as
was just about everything else (except the prior-hop IP, which
unambiguously reveals where it came from).</p>
