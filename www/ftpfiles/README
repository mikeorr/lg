To download a complete issue you must download lg-base.tar.gz as well
as the tar file for the issue of interest. If you downloaded
lg-base.tar.gz last month, you can download lg-base-new.tar.gz instead;
it contains only the base files that have changed or been added for the
current issue.

http://linuxgazette.net/ftpfiles.txt contains the latest file sizes and
modification dates for these files, if you wish to verify your mirror is up to
date.
