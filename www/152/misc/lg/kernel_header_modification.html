Good day!
</p>

<p>
I am adding   new variables to the tcp header(tcp.h)  of the linux
kernel and reflect this changes to the source code  .Kindly shed light
to my confusions below:
</p>

<p>
1.	Do I have to  recompile the whole kernel to reflect the changes
in the header files and source code(i.e., tcp.c, tcp_input.c, etc)?
</p>

<p>
2.	If so, what are the necessary steps involved( i.e., re-compile
process)  to reflect the new variables I added to the header file and
the source codes?
</p>

<p>
3.	Thank you very much in advance for the support.
</p>

<p>
Cheers,
</p>

<p>
Dom

<p>
The Linux kernel has its own build system which takes care of all the
dependencies. I usually do the following:
</p>

<pre>
 1. Get the source and unpack it.
 2. Enter the top level directory of the source tree.
 3. "make mrproper" (only if you use the tree for the first time or want
    to reset everything)
 4. "make oldconfig" (this checks your current kernel configuration
    against updated settings, probably only availabe when you have the
    config... files for your running kernel in /boot/).
 5. "make menuconfig" or "make xconfig" - this presents you with the
    dependency menu where you can tell the build process what to include
    and what to leave out.
 6. make
</pre>

<p>
Since the steps up to 4 are only necessary when you start, the make at
step 6 will always build everything that needs to be rebuild.
</p>

<p>
Installing is done by:
</p>

<pre>
 7. make modules_install
 8. make install
</pre>

<p>
Step 7 will copy all modules to /lib/modules/, step 8 will copy
everything into /boot/. Make sure you adjust your bootloader
configuration to use the new kernel (either /etc/lilo.conf or
/boot/grub/menu.lst).
</p>

<p>
Best,
Ren&eacute;.

Hi Rene,
</p>

<p>
Thank you very much for the response. I already installed the rpm kernel
source and build it(when I asked before how to get the .c files). My
kernel is already up and running. My problem now is that I added a
specific variable into the tcp.h header file and I wanted it to be
reflected and saved  into the kernel. I saved the changes but is it
enough process or do I need to do other things like rebuilding the
kernel, etc. for this change to be saved into my kernel so that the next
time I run it, the new tcp.h header file will be used instead of the old
one.
</p>

<p>
Thank you very much in advance for the help.
</p>

<p>
Cheers,
</p>

<p>
Dom

<p>
Some modules are essentially "stand-alone" - e.g., they don't require
any changes to be made in the kernel - and can be recompiled simply by
changing the code in the source file and running 'make' in the directory
where they live. 'tcp.c' is usually <em>not</em> such a module - it would make
no sense to have it as insertable code rather than being compiled into
the kernel - and so the answer is yes, you do need to recompile the
kernel. Fortunately, if you're only changing that one bit of code, that
recompilation should be relatively short.
 
</p>

&gt;    2.      If so, what are the necessary steps involved( i.e., re-compile
&gt;    process)  to reflect the new variables I added to the header file and the

<p>
This is documented in your '/usr/src/linux/README' (there's a reason
that file has that name... <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> in the 'COMPILING the kernel' section. In
short, you need to run some of the following:
</p>

<pre>
make dep		# If you're not sure that all the dependencies are right
make clean		# If you want to start from scratch - which you don't
make bzImage	# This is the place to start for you!
make modules	# Fairly obvious...
make install	# This will install the new kernel; options for 'lilo', etc.
</pre>

Hello guys,
</p>

<p>
Thank you for the response.
</p>

<p>
I already read the "README" file and follow it to recompile the
tcp_input.c code with changes in it. I went to the specified directory
and do the recompiling there. I followed the recompiling steps and when
I typed: MAKE, I received an error saying " make: <strong>*</strong> No targets. Stop".
I don't know if I missed something out here. Please help... Note: Only
the makefile and the kconfig file is within the directory..
</p>

<p>
Thank you very much in advance.
</p>

Cheers,

<p>
In fact, you did not type 'MAKE'. If you had, you'd get an error saying
"MAKE: command not found". Perhaps you typed 'make'? (Hint: quoting the
exact input that you entered and the exact errors you received -
hopefully by copying and pasting - is the Right Thing. Retyping them and
allowing transcription errors to happen is the Wrong Thing.)

<p>
1) Please don't quote the entire email you're responding to. We all know
what we've said, and if we happen to forget, then archives exist for a
reason.
</p>

<p>
2) Please <strong>READ</strong> the replies sent to you instead of just blindly banging
on the keyboard and then asking questions that have just been answered.
In particular, I suggest that you re-read the reply that I sent you and
that you have just replied to: it covers the exact situation you're
asking about.
