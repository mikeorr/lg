<h1>Creating an Unkillable Process</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/brownss.html">Silas Brown</a></b></p>


<p>Annoying as unkillable processes can be,
there are some circumstances where you might
legitimately want to create one. For example, if
I run an audit tool, or if I want to write a
program that makes sure I go to bed on time even
when I'm really stuck into something, then I
might not want even the root user to be able to
stop it from running.</p>

<p>One approach would be to simply disallow any
root access to the system, or at least disallow
it at critical times, but that can get very
complex if you still need to be able to
administrate the system and/or cannot tell with
certainty which times will not be critical.  So
I wanted an approach that did not rely on
disallowing root access altogether.</p>

<p>As root can do anything (including writing
batches of commands which when run will likely
out-pace any periodic integrity checks), and
even modifying all of root's tools does not
preclude the installation of new ones, the only
way to really make a process unkillable is to
modify the kernel.  But if possible I wanted a
solution that didn't involve delving into the
kernel, for reasons of portability and keeping
it simple.</p>

<p>So I had to settle for the lesser goal of
"create a process that, if killed, will start
again immediately".  That's not too difficult:
edit /etc/inittab and get init(8) to restart the
process whenever it dies.  But the root user can
change /etc/inittab, and can also change the
executable file on disk, which could forestall
the process from properly starting again after
it's killed.</p>

<h3>Read-only filesystem</h3>

<p>To prevent such changes, both the executable
and /etc/inittab will have to go on a read-only
filesystem.  But it's not sufficient to take
just any filesystem and mount it read-only,
because root can simply remount it read/write.
You can however make an ISO image and mount that
as a loop device; this mount can't possibly be
remounted read/write, and changing the
underlying ISO file shouldn't affect the mounted
filesystem.  But you'd still have to stop root
from unmounting it and mounting something else
in its place (or unmounting/remounting it after
changing the ISO file).</p>

<p>You can stop a filesystem from being
unmounted by making sure that it's always busy,
i.e. there are processes whose current directory
is inside it.  But that doesn't stop the use of
"umount -l" (lazy unmount) which detaches the
filesystem from the hierarchy and postpones the
actual unmounting until it's no longer busy;
root can do a lazy unmount and mount something
else, and all new processes will see the new
version.</p>

<p>Actually that's not quite true: If root does
use "umount -l", then any currently-running
processes whose current working directory is in
the old mount can continue to see the files from
the old mount, and so can their child processes,
provided that they always refer to them from the
current working directory and not via an
absolute path.  If they use an absolute path
then they'll see the new mount.</p>

<p>So if we can get init(8) to run with the
mounted ISO as its current working directory,
and to execute our program from the current
directory instead of from an absolute path, then
it should not be possible to change the contents
of that ISO as far as init(8) is concerned, at
least not without rebooting or cracking the
kernel.</p>

<p>This can be done by moving /sbin/init to
/sbin/init.orig, and creating a new /sbin/init,
a shell script:</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash
mount /sbin/init.iso /init-mnt -o loop
cd /init-mnt
exec /sbin/init.orig $@
</pre>

<p>You will also need to ensure that future
package upgrades do not overwrite your
/sbin/init script with the original binary.</p>

<p>Then chmod +x that script, make the /init-mnt
directory, and use mkisofs to make the
/sbin/init.iso file containing any binaries you
want to run.  You can run scripts, but make sure
the interpreter binaries are in the ISO and that
/etc/inittab calls them from the current
directory, for example:</p>

<pre>AA:23:respawn:./python myscript.py</pre>

<p>(In the case of python you might also want to
ensure that it's reading its standard libraries
from the ISO rather than from anywhere else,
otherwise there could be a back door that
way.)</p>

<h3>Patching init</h3>

<p>Although it should now be impossible for root
to change your script without rebooting, it is
still possible for root to change /etc/inittab
and tell init to re-read it.  On most systems,
init is hard-coded to load /etc/inittab by
absolute path, which means you can't get around
this without patching init, either to make it
load inittab from the current working directory
or to prevent it from ever re-reading inittab
during its run.</p>

<p>You could hex-edit the init binary and change
the string, but the resulting system probably
won't boot.  It's better to download your
distribution's source package for "sysvinit" (or
whatever your distribution calls it), change
into its "src" directory, edit paths.h and
change "/etc/inittab" to "inittab", then type
"make" and move the resulting init binary to
where you want it.  Remember to put an inittab
file inside the ISO image: this is the inittab
file that will be used (not /etc/inittab), and
the only way to change it is to change the
underlying ISO file and reboot.</p>

<p>There is still another problem, however.  If
your process is killed too often, init will
refuse to restart it for a while.  You could
make it more aggressive whenever it restarts
(e.g. terminate all root shells and disable the
root account for a time to stop it from being
killed again too soon), but if root launches a
script that repeatedly scans the current
processes and kills yours, and that script's
loop is small and fast, then your process is not
likely to be able to get as far as stopping
it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the easiest way around this is to
treat the "respawning too fast" condition more
seriously.  For example, search the init source
for the part that prints the "respawning too
fast" message (in version 2.86 it's in init.c)
and add "exit(1);" after the statement's closing
semicolon.  This means, if any process respawns
too fast (for example because root is running an
aggressive script to stop your process from
running), init will exit, which will result in a
kernel panic and an unusable system.  Note
however that this also means the system will
crash if any inittab task respawns too fast due
to a typo, so be careful.</p>

<h3>Closing remarks</h3>

<p>In this article we have put together a way of
preventing even the root user from getting rid
of a certain process without rebooting.
However, there is still the issue of rebooting
itself.  You can't really stop root from
changing /sbin/init or /sbin/init.iso and
rebooting the system, especially if it's done
quickly without a proper shutdown, so reboots
had better be very noticeable.  If you want to
make things more difficult, though, you could
get your program to frequently check the stat()
of /sbin/init* for changes, taking care to do so
from the main thread (remember that if your
program goes multi-threaded then it may be
possible to kill some of the threads while
preserving others).  It would still be possible
to do things by booting from a rescue disk
however, and perhaps even without booting from a
rescue disk in some circumstances, so this is
not completely flawless.</p>
