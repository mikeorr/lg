Removing LILO, Reinstalling MS-DOS
</h3>
<P> <B> 
From: Stephen Britton, <A
HREF="mailto:sbritton@westnet.com">sbritton@westnet.com</A> 
</B> <P><B>  
 My parents just told me that I have to 
 give our extra machine (a 486 running Red Hat 4.1)
 to my younger brother, who only knows Windows.
 I have formated the drive with MS-DOS, but I
 can't seem to figure out how to remove LILO. I
 recall reading somewhere that it can be done by
 c:\fdisk /mbr But that doesn't seem to be working.
 Please help, he is returning to College next week!!
</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
        That should do it. However -- which version
        of MS-DOS are we talking about.  This option
        was introduced in MS-DOS 5.0.  Although it 
        wasn't documented at the time it is widely 
        used to recover from a variety of boot
        viruses. 
<P>
        If that that doesn't work -- boot from a Linux
        floppy -- zero out the whole partition table
        and MBR (dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda -- for 
        a primary IDE, or of=/dev/sda for the primary
        SCSI and count=1 (or 2 or so)).
<P>
        Then you can boot from a DOS installation floppy
        and it will insist that you run fdisk and will 
        treat the drive as though it was brand new and
        previously unformatted/partitioned.
<P>
        (Technically you only have to zero out or 
        put anyting other that 0x55AA as the last two
        bytes of the MBR -- that's the signature that
        tells FDISK that this drive has been previously
        partitioned.  However, it's just easier to zero
 out the whole mess.)
<P>
        Naturally this will make all of the data on the
        drive inaccessible -- but I suspect you already 
        knew that was going to happen anyway.
<P>
        Alternatively -- if fdisk /mbr doesn't work -- 
        you should find out *why*.  If this is an early
        version of DOS -- you should probably try to 
        get a copy of 5.0 or later (or consider Caldera's
        OpenDOS).  I suppose you could also consider 
        installing Win '95, considering the likelihood
        that your brother will need access to TCP/IP 
        utilities like web browsers and some e-mail
        package.
<P>
        On the one hand I hate to push some further down
        the throat of the snake -- on the other hand  we
        should always do our best to act in the best 
        interests of our customers -- even when they're
        our pesky brothers.

locked into the Windows mindset.

        Trying to convince someone of something is 
        usually a losing proposition. Try to understand
        his real requirements -- and offer the best 
        advice you can.
<P> 
        It may be that Windows is the best environment
        for him.  It may also be that there are over-riding
        constraints that force him to choose a Windows
        compatible platform.
<P> 
        I think that many organizations are now "chained" to the
        Microsoft aggenda by their current investment in their
        existing data files (all their spreadsheets, documents,
        and many of their small, departmental mailing lists, and
        databases are locked into various versions of the proprietary 
        .DOC, .XLS, and other data formats).  
<P> 
        Microsoft clearly intends to maintain this state.  I 
        guess that is has been the core of their strategy for the
        last five years (since about the release of Win 3.0 or 3.1).
<P> 
        (It is also not unique to them -- most major commercial
        hardware and software vendors have tried to "lock" their
        customer into upgrade paths.  Companies like DEC, IBM,
        and HP have each had their VMS, MVS, MPE OS' with this 
        aggenda.  Consequently their efforts at Unix have often
        been "skunkworks" -- and have been highly politicized for
        over a quarter of a century).
<P> 
        I ask people to consider this tidbit in their long range 
        planning.  Truly optimizing for the present requires 
        looking to the future as well.

Running as root on Standalone Systems -- DON'T
</h3>
<P> <B> 
From: <A
HREF="mailto:griffin@ameritech.net">griffin@ameritech.net</A> 
</B> <P><B>  
 What advantages are there, if any, to running your single-user 
 system as a normal user and not root?
</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
        If you're absolutely perfect, you never make a typing mistake or
        issue a wrong command, or a right command from a wrong directory
        with the wrong arguments, *and* you only run perfect software,
        with no bugs in it at all, *and* you are totally disconnected
        from the world (you don't get any e-mail, never use netnews, or
        IRC etc) -- then you *might* be sort of safe running as root on
        your system.
<P> 
        If you simply don't care about your data and you like the idea
        of rebuilding your system configuration from scratch then throw
        all caution to the wind and go for it.
<P> 
        However, for the vast majority of us, it's the most minimal bow
        to prudence to log in as an unprivileged user for the vast
        majority of work you do at your system.
<P> 
        The advantages are:
<ul>
       <li>         Your normal user account can't accidentally 
                damage vital system files with any normal
                command.  The most common cause of data loss
                and downtime is operator failure.  When I 
                worked on the tech support lines at Norton
                Computing (the largest publisher of DOS and
                Mac data recovery tools) the accidental 
                deletion calls were more common than all other
                causes combined.  Even on Unix and other 
                multi-user system the system administrators
                (or "operators") are the primary cause of
                downtime and data loss.  It simply makes 
                sense to minimize these risks.

    <li>            Programs you are running (buggy, or even 
                trojan horses and viruses) can't readily 
                damage system files.   Software bugs are 
                the second most common cause of data loss.
                Trojan horses and viruses are a rarity
                in the Unix world -- precisely because
                the prevailing custom is to run software 
                with minimal privileges.  When it comes to
  software that legitimately needs privileged
                access (like the Red Hat rpm system when 
                it's used to update or install new packages),
                many sysadmins run new software on a "sacrificial"
                system or in a "chroot jail."
        
<li>            Even programs that are reasonably O.K. may
                vulnerable to deliberate attacks.  If someone
                uses 'write' to ANSI-bomb you (re-writing the
                keybindings in your terminal/console driver for
                malicious purposes) or exploits some 'feature' of
                IRC or your mail reader to execute code on your
                behalf, you'd like to limit the damage they can do.
 </ul>        
        The disadvantages mostly relate to convenience.  A typical
        microcomputer user from a DOS, Windows, OS/2, MacOS, AmigaDOS,
        CP/M or similar background is used to being able to edit any
        file and change any setting directly and quickly.
<P> 
        By maintaining the discipline of only doing administrative tasks
        from a 'root' login -- and all of your other work from one or
        more 'user' accounts you are forced to pause and consider the
        implications of what you're doing.
<P> 
        It's also nice that you can partition your work into distinct
        domains -- you can always play games from your 'player' account
        -- and none of those games can damage you're thesis project, or
        financial records, or whatever.
<P> 
        Personally I think this could use some improvement.  I'd like to
        see a system whereby by each user is implicitly the manager of a
        group of "roles."  For single-user home systems this would be
        basically the same as using your root account to create new
        psuedo users for yourself.  On multi-user systems it would
        delegate the task of creating new roles and rolegroups to the
        user --- so that each user's "base account" in effect becomes an
        administrator of this own roles.
<P> 
        The problem I see with that is that there's no support in Unix
        for it.  I think it would take alot of work to build a set of
        tools to support it (and many of these tools would have to be
        SUID 'root' in traditional Unix systems -- or would require some
        totally different lower level support such as a variant of a
        "capabilities" system.  In any event these tools would be very
        security sensitive -- and early versions would probably be the
        cause of numerous exploits.
<P> 
        However, none of that matters to the home user with root access
        to his own box.

<h3><img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
More on Netscape Mail Crashes
</h3>
<P> <B> 
From: Chris, <A
HREF="mailto:colohan@cs.cmu.edu">colohan@cs.cmu.edu</A> 
</B> <P><B>  
 In http://linuxgazette.net/issue24/lg_answer24.html, you suggest
 removing the ~/.netscape tree to stop Netscape Mail from crashing.
 I have had the same problem several times, and it does not appear to be
 anything in that directory -- it is the mail files themselves.  It
 appears as though Netscape will occasionally put a wee bit of corruption
 in your ~/nsmail/[Inbox, Trash, etc.] files, which prevents it from
 reading them.  And it crashes when it encounters any corruption in these
 files.  It also seems to crash if your trash gets too large.  (Anything
 over 1MB seems hopeless).
</B> <P><B>  
 So one solution is to back up your mail elsewhere, and erase your mail
 directory.  Then Netscape will create new, valid, empty mail folders,
 and stop crashing for a while.  Another solution is to open the files
 yourself (they are just text files), and erase any messages that look
 suspect.
</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
        These sound like excellent troubleshooting suggestions,
        recovery procedures and workarounds.
<P> 
        I believe I also mentioned that my e-mail is far too important 
        to me to entrust to Netscape (or any "new" product).  For
        years I used 'elm' and before that it was 'mush' (mail user's
        shell).  The switch from 'elm' to MH (using emacs' mh-e and Gnus 
        interfaces) was nerve-wracking.  (I deal with over a hundred 
        messages a day -- and it's at the core of my business that I 
        "keep up" on administration and security issues for my customers).
<P> 
        My biggest customer (another consultant in a different specialty)
        has also made this switch, after over a decade of using emacs'
        RMAIL.  As you can imagine there have to be some pretty extensive
        advantages to a package to warrant changing from one client to
        another.  (Merely having a "prettier" interface and a few bells
        and whistles isn't nearly enough).
<P> 
        Consequently I will probably stay in a poor position to answer
        questions about NS's mail and news readers.
<P> 
        As for the fact that NS crashes when encountering corruptions
        in folders and messages -- that's just poor quality control and
        poor coding.  As usual the issues of "time-to-market" and 
        "pretty interface" dominate the development of commercial products.
<P> 
        The nature of the computer software industry practically guarantees
        that the most widely used commercial products will have bugs of 
        this sort.  This is the result of a set of corporate priorities 
        that don't match typical customer priorities -- and is a byproduct
        of the selection process by most software is purchased. 
<P> 
        I could go on about this for many pages.  Since I worked in the
        software industry for a long time -- I had a lot of time to
        observe the process first hand.  (Since I was doing tech support
        I also had an abundance of free neural cycles to think about the
        issues, as well).  Here's a few observations that will help explain
        my conclusion:
<ul> 
<li>            Software companies sell features.  They only make money
                on product sales and upgrades -- and the margins are 
                much better in upgrades than in initial sales (since
                many, possibly most, upgrades are direct revenue --
                and no "cut" goes to the channel distributors and 
                retailers).
<li>Most software marketing is directed to channel 
                distributors, retailers, and fortune 1000 corporate
                purchasing agents.  Most of it is not directed to
                end users and home customers.  These intermediaries
                largely determine the pricing and availability of
                most commercial software, and the advertising that
                goes to the end-user.  The priorities of these
                intermediaries are:  high sales, low product return
                rates (RMA's).  The purchasing agents at Merisel
                and Egghead don't do detailed requirements analysis
                on behalf of their customers.

   <li>             Product returns are most tightly correlated with 
                how long the customer has had the product before
                becoming dissatisfied with it.  This is why "ease
                of use" and "ease of installation" are so important
                in commercial software.  If the vendors can keep
                the majority failures from occuring for 60 to 90 
                days -- very few customers will return the product
                even if the publisher's policies allow it.

<li>                There is much more focus on corporate sales than
                on retail for most shrinkwrapped software.  This 
 is due to high rates of piracy among home users
                and the obvious observation that every "customer"
                contact costs money (sales and tech support time).
                So one successful sale at TransAmerica costs much
                less than 10,000 individual sales to home users
                and SOHO markets.

<li>                Most corporate software users have little say and
                relatively little interest in what software they
                use.  They are told what do so -- and usually don't
                question that.  Corporate purchasing agents get
                plenty of political pressure from managers and
                executives but usually neither the purchasing 
                agent nor the manager spends much time "in the
                trenches" with the software that's being used.

<li>                Managers are far more worried about being "wrong"
                than being "right."  An excellent product from an
                unknown source is considered a much higher risk
                than a mediocre product that gets good press and
                comes from a large, well-known source.

<li>        The computer industry press can't sell much copy
                by talking about "old" products.  They also can't
                depend on any significant amount of advertising
                unless they maintain close, positive, relatiionships
                with their major advertisers.  Most of their 
                advertisers are hardware and software companies.

<li>                Because the writers in most of these magazines 
                are working with new (usually pre-release or "beta")
                software or versions they have no opportunity to
                discover the bugs that take two or three months to
                show up in typical use.  In addition most of these
                writers either don't use the products they review
                extensively, or tend to rely on earlier versions
                for their production and critical work.  Almost 
                no one is a full-time professional journalist in
                the computer industry -- and those that are in 
                this position are in a rather poor position to 
                do in depth evaluation of anything other than 
                word processors.

<li>                Despite these limitations -- which almost gaurantee
                that we should take software reviews with a large
                block of salt -- these reviews in major magazines 
                become the focal point of most discussion on the 
                topic.  By the time a given customer has purchased,
                installed, configured, and learned a given product
                it's usually too costly (emotionally and in time)
                to "start all over."

<li>                The fact that a large number of commercial packages
                store some or all of "their" data (not "yours" -- but
                "theirs") in proprietary formats also increases the
                risks and costs associated with switching.
        
<li>                Finally there is a strong possibility that the next
                product a given customer tries to switch to will be
                as bad or worse.
</ul>
        When you go through all of this -- even if you don't agree
        with half of the observations -- it's easy to see why so
        many people live in quiet desperation, hating their most
        important software.
<P> 
        Sadly it takes *really* bad software to fail as a result of its
      bugs.  dBase IV comes to mind.  It doesn't take much for really
        high quality software to fail as a result of poor marketing
        (or the superior marketing and industry dominance of competitors).
        DESQview comes to mind.
<P> 
        By contrast almost all free software is chosen by end-users
        based on recommendations from other end-users.  It is produced
        by people whose only rewards are: access to their own tool
        to solve their own problems, the satisfaction of having lots
        of users, and some chance for fame and sincere admiration.
        They gain nothing by claiming more than they deliver (except
        more e-mail with more support questions).
<P> 
        Luckily we, Linux and free software users, are blessed with 
        alternatives.  These systemic problems are what I think we are
        really "free" of.
<P>
