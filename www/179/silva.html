<h1>Collaboration Tools for Linux</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/silva.html">Anderson Silva</a></b></p>

<p>
<em>Collaboration</em>. It's a buzzword, like 'innovative' and 'cloud
computing', and like most words, it can be used or misused. It reminds
me of the words <tt>openness</tt> and <tt>community</tt>. It reminds me of
open source. Rivals and allies such as Microsoft, Google, Red Hat, Oracle,
HP, and so many others working on code in the Linux kernel is arguably one
of the greatest examples of collaboration in the technology world.
</p>

<p>
Another great example of collaboration across the globe is Wikipedia, and I 
thought it would be appropriate to use its definition of 'Collaboration' as 
part of the introduction to my article. Per Wikipedia 
[<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration title=1>1</a>]:
</p>

<pre>
Collaboration is a recursive process where two or more people or 
organizations work together in an intersection of common goals - for example, 
an intellectual endeavor that is creative in nature - by sharing knowledge, 
learning and building consensus.
</pre>

<p>
It is with that definition in mind that I decided to share with you five 
specific tools for Linux that I either currently use or have used 
in the past to improve collaboration among individuals and departmental teams. 
I will point out that, for each of the tools I will mention, there most likely 
exist several other alternatives that may or may not do as good as a job as 
the ones I have decided to write about - after all, that is the beauty of the 
open source world.
</p>

<h3>Desktop sharing with Vino VNC server</h3>

<p>
Vncserver has been around for years as desktop sharing in multiple Operating
Systems. Starting with Gnome 2.8, the Vino VNC server started being shipped by 
default. Vino allows a user to share the desktop with other remote users 
while granting them fine-grained access.
</p>

<p>
<img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_100w78nq6hc_b.png" alt="vino" height="701" width="648">
</p>

<p>
If enabled, the vino server only starts up once the user logs into their Gnome
session. When the remote user tries to connect to the local desktop a pop-up 
window will show up on the local desktop and the remote user will only be able 
to access the desktop if the local user accepts the connection request.
</p>

<p>
  To start up the connection with the desktop, all the remote user needs is a 
VNC client like <em>vinagre</em>. Some other possible clients are <em>tigervnc</em> for 
Fedora, <em>tightvnc</em>, or <em>realvnc</em> for Ubuntu.
</p>

<p>
<img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_101d8skvvgn_b.png" alt="vino 2" height="520" width="570">
<p>
A few things to be mindful of when enabling remote desktop under Gnome:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you have the appropriate iptables rule to allow the remote 
connection.</li>
<li>Like other 'standard' VNC servers, the communication between the client and 
vino is cleartext, so be aware of your security requirements.</li>
<li>Don't forget to log out or lock your workstation if you must leave your 
computer unattended while remote users are connected to it.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Simple wiki installation with Doku</h3>
<p>
It is almost impossible nowadays to talk about collaboration in a technical 
environment without talking about a Wiki. I will even assume that virtually 
every person with some sort of networked device has either gained or contributed
some wiki-based knowledge, even if they were not aware they were using a
wiki.
</p>

<p>
With that said, installing a wiki on a Linux server has become simpler and 
simpler over the years. For this article, I picked PHP based wiki DokuWiki, 
which can be easily installed by running:
</p>

<p>
On Fedora:
</p>

<pre class="code">yum install dokuwiki</pre>
<p>
On Ubuntu:
</p>

<pre class="code">apt-get install dokuwiki</pre>
</p>

<img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_102hcvcx4gx_b.png" alt="dokuwiki" height="292" width="648">
<p>
You will then have to make sure Apache is running, and should be able to access 
your newly installed wiki at: http://yourhost.com/dokuwiki/
</p>

<p>
Some other wikis available 'out of the box' for your installation on both Fedora and 
Ubuntu are <em>mediawiki</em>, <em>trac</em>, <em>kwiki</em> 
(<em>perl-kwiki</em> in Fedora), and <em>moin</em> (<em>python-moin</em> in Ubuntu).
</p>

<h3>Team programming with Gobby</h3>
<p>A couple of years ago, I was invited to a meeting at work to discuss a 
project a couple of the developers were working on. What I thought was going
 to happen was that someone would hook up a projector to their laptop, and
 all eight of us would stare at the wall and every once in a while give a 
suggestion about some excessive 'if' statement or a poorly-designed method. 
Well, I was wrong. The lead developer popped Gobby on the screen, created a 
session, and asked the rest of us to install it and join the session.
</p>

<p>
From there, we started writing pseudo and real code, creating a 'to do' list, and 
updating documentation in the source code. Gobby is that cool!</p>

<img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_103c4rzfgfg_b.png" alt="gobby" height="540" width="694">
<p>
Once you create a session, all other gobby instances in the network will 
automatically detect the created session. If you want a private session, add a 
password to your session. Each user is requested to pick a name 
and a color and as they modify the document, their picked color highlights the 
text they contribute.</p>

<img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_104wtn7mf3z_b.png" alt="gobby 2" height="542" width="680">
<p>
To install gobby on Fedora:
</p>

<pre class="code">yum install gobby</pre>
<p>
On Ubuntu:
</p>

<pre class="code">apt-get install gobby</pre>

<h3>Creating screencasts with Istanbul</h3>
<p>
Have you ever tried walking someone through steps on how to accomplish a 
task on the desktop? And then they forget what they did, and ask you again six 
months later, and you have to walk through it all over again?
</p>

<p>
I have had this problem before, and it didn't take long until I decided to start
 using a screencast application on GNOME to record any tutorials I might end up 
working on.
</p>

<p>
I started using <em>istanbul</em>, a little python application that will place a 
'record' button on your GNOME panel, and allow you to record what's going on 
your screen. It also let's you change the resolution of the screen and capture 
sound as you go through your motions.
</p>

  <img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_105gpcqv5hm_b.png" alt="istanbul" height="98" width="648">
<p>
Take a look at this <a href="misc/silva/istanbul.ogg">small sample</a> of <em>istanbul</em> at work. 
</p>


<h3>Version Control with Git</h3>
<p>
Along with a compiler or interpreter, a version control system is arguably one 
of the most important tools a developer will use from day to day. 
As you probably already know, it allows one or more developers to store, 
retrieve, log, identify, and merge revisions of a file through time.</p>

<p>
A few version control systems available under Linux are <em>cvs</em>, 
<em>subversion</em>, <em>mercurial</em>, <em>bzr</em> (bazaar), and 
<em>git</em>.
</p>

<p>
At work, as an organization, we've migrated from subversion and cvs to git, and 
that's mostly the reason why I decided to mention it in this article. If you 
have never tried git, I highly suggest you check it out. Git was originally 
written by Linus Torvalds for the Linux kernel development, and over the past 
few years has become more and more popular around the open source community. 
Just take a 
<a href=https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitProjects title="look at this list">look at this list</a>
of current projects that are using Git as their version control system.
</p>

<p>
I also recommend you take a look at the 
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29 title="wikipedia page">wikipedia page</a>
 about <em>git</em> and its <a href=http://git-scm.com/ title="official home">official home</a> 
to find out a bit more of its history, design and implementation.
</p>

<p>Installing <em>git</em> on Fedora:
</p>

<pre class="code">yum install git</pre>
<p>on Ubuntu:
</p>

<pre class="code">apt-get install git</pre>
<p>
Creating a repo is as simple as 
[<a href=http://git-scm.com/ title=2>2</a>]:
</p>

<pre code="class">
$ cd (project-directory)
$ git init
$ (add some files)
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Initial commit'
</pre>

<p>And checking out some files from a repo and creating a patch
[<a href=http://git-scm.com/ id=rark title=2>2</a>]:</p>

<pre code="class">
$ git clone git://github.com/git/hello-world.git
$ cd hello-world
$ (edit files)
$ git add (files)
$ git commit -m 'Explain what I changed'
$ git format-patch origin/master
</pre>

<p>Once you start creating branches, and squash merges with git,
 you may find keeping track of diffs, logs and different branches a bit 
overwhelming at times. A great little tool a friend of mine introduced me to 
is called: <em>tig</em>, which is "a repository browser for the git 
revision control system that additionally can act as a pager for output from 
various git commands." 
[<a href=http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig/ title=3>3</a>]
</p>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Because some of the tools discussed above are client-server based, you should always
check your firewall rules. Also, these tools are just the tip of the 
iceberg; technologies like microblogging, social networking, email, chatting, 
and so many others could easily be adapted into our day-to-day collaboration 
requirements. As you work through them with your organization, always take 
into consideration your infrastructure and security requirements before 
implementing any of these tools or services.
</p>

<p>
Unless you have a commitment from your organization or your team mates to work 
together in sharing knowledge and keeping this knowledge up-to-date, all of these
 collaboration tools at the end of the day sum up to just that: tools.
