<h1>Real World Cases For Apache's mod_rewrite</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/silva.html">Anderson Silva</a></b></p>


<p>
Technology is a funny thing; sometimes you want to write about a
specific part of it. Sometimes, you want to share your knowledge with
someone, but to do it, and do it well, you feel the need to explain
all the other technologies used to make that one specific part
successful.
</p>

<p>
This article is not really about understanding
how <code>mod_rewrite</code> works. If it were I'd probably need to
write about things like: the
HTTP <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html">protocol</a>,
the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache</a> HTTP
Server, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">Regular
Expressions</a>, and a few others.
</p>

<p>
One doesn't need to know about how a car works, from the principles of
physics all the way up to its mechanics, to be able to drive one,
right? Therefore, this article isn't going to touch on what's under
the hood when dealing with <code>mod_rewrite</code>. Instead it will just show you
how to turn it on, and get on the road with it.
</p>

<p>
So, what's <code>mod_rewrite</code> good for? It's a quick, yet fairly
flexible and potentially complex way to manipulate URLs on the server
side using regular expressions rules. You can match HTTP requests on
several different criteria like server variables, HTTP headers, and
others.  </p>

<p>
I am not sure about other Linux distributions, but, on Fedora, my
distribution of choice, the Apache HTTP Server is installed out of the
box with <code>mod_rewrite</code> loaded, but disabled.
</p>

<p>
To enable it just add:
</p>

<pre>
RewriteEngine On
</pre>

<p>
to your httpd.conf, or if you are running several Virtual Hosts on your
server, you can enable <code>mod_rewrite</code> per Virtual Host.
</p>

<p>
Now, if you've worked with regular expressions, and you are not very
comfortable with them, it's very easy to become overwhelmed by them. To
make things a bit easier, <code>mod_rewrite</code> has built-in logging
to help the administrator debug the rules.  
</p>

<p>
To enable your <code>mod_rewrite</code> logging:
</p>

<pre>
RewriteLog /var/log/httpd/rewrite.log
RewriteLogLevel 5
</pre>

<p>
At least, this way you will start working with Apache rewrites ready 
to debug them.
</p>

<h3>Four Real World Examples:</h3>

<p>
1. The company you work for sends out some marketing publications, and
someone realizes that the URL printed on the cover of the document was
wrong. It was supposed to have been:
<code>http://www.yourcompany.com/ask_me_how/</code>, but instead was printed as
<code>http://www.yourcompany.com/ask-me-how/</code>. This is probably the most
basic and classic example of <code>mod_rewrite</code>: given a URL, redirect the
user to another. Here's how to fix it:
</p>

<pre>
RewriteRule ^/ask-me-how/$ /ask_me_how/ [R,L]
</pre>


2. Your company's Web site has two
domains: <code>www.yourcompany.com</code>
and <code>www.yourcompany.net</code>. Your boss notices while
searching on Google that the results are treated as two different
sites. He wants you to find out
a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/Google_Webmaster_Help/web/faqs-for-crawling-indexing-and-ranking-2?pli=1">way</a>
to tell Google that both domains should be treated as one site.

<p>
On your Apache config, enable <code>mod_rewrite</code>, and redirect your traffic
using Permanent Redirect HTTP code 301. By default, <code>mod_rewrite</code>
redirects are 302 (Temporary Redirects), and Google search would still
index the domains as two different entities.
</p>

<pre>
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^yourcompany.net$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.yourcompany.net$
RewriteRule ^.*$ http://www.yourcompany.com/$1 [R=301,L]
</pre>


<p>
3. Suppose you have a Web site supporting both standard and secure
connections (a.k.a. HTTP and https), and your boss requires you,
without much notice (if any) to force all http:// traffic to be
directed to https://. Well, if you are running Apache and have
<code>mod_rewrite</code> enabled, all you need is the following rule:
</p>

<pre>
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
RewriteRule ^.*$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}/$1 [R,L,NE]
</pre>

<p>
4. Imagine a situation where, for one reason or another, you want to
block links made from another site to your site. Maybe an unauthorized
site found an exploit on your application and made a link available
for people to download some copyrighted material. You could use
<code>mod_rewrite</code> to block any request coming from that site by matching the
HTTP_REFERER of the incoming request. Although this isn't the final
solution, as I would hope your company would take the time to close
such an exploit, this could come in handy as a quick emergency
solution.
</p>

<pre>
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} http://www.hackersite.net [NC]
RewriteRule - [F]
</pre>

<h3>Syntax Overview:</h3>

<p>
RewriteCond - is a directive that allows you to test a certain
condition for a rule to be applied. Think of it as your everyday
programming language if-statement. Two or more RewriteCond can be
written sequentially as a logical AND, or by adding a [OR] at the end
of the line for a logical [OR]. You will notice that RewriteCond is
pretty flexible and allows you to write tests for server variables
like HTTP headers, Connection and Request, Server Internals, and even
System Information.
</p>

<p>
RewriteRule - is the most important directive you will be using. It's as
the Apache documentation calls it, the 'real rewriting workhorse' of the
<code>mod_rewrite</code> module. It usually takes 3 parameters: pattern
to match, string to substitute, and a list of flags. Here's a list of
flags I've used on the examples above: 
</p>

<p>
<code>R</code> - tells RewriteRule that you are doing a redirect, and,
unless you pass the code 301, it will default to a 302, which means
moved temporarily.
</p>

<p>
<code>L</code> - tells RewriteRule to exit the chain of rules and not
follow anything else after the last RewriteRule.
</p>

<p>
<code>NC</code> - make the pattern to match case insensitive.
</p>

<p>
<code>NE</code> - tells RewriteRule not to escape the resulting URI
with things like %20 for a blank space.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
Apache's <code>mod_rewrite</code> is an incredibly flexible tool allowing a
System Administrator to act quickly to solve issues with a Web
server. Some fixes may be of a temporary nature until a proper
permanent solution is put in place, and, even though there will be
times where <code>mod_rewrite</code> may be part of permanent solution, don't get
too used to them, as <code>mod_rewrite</code> rules can pile up fast and become
quite hard to maintain. Have you ever had to maintain Perl code with
regexes everywhere? If so, you probably know what I am talking about.</p>

<p>
Finally, if you want know more of what's under the hood of <code>mod_rewrite</code>,
make sure you read Apache's <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_rewrite.html">documentation</a>, and, when in doubt use
<code>mod_rewrite</code> logging to help you debug your rules.</p>
