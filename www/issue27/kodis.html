<H2>Autologin with mingetty</H2>

In Issue 26 of the Linux Gazette, Todd Blake,
tbb@enterprise.aacc.cc.md.us, wrote in to ask:
<blockquote> <I> 
   "I like most people am the only person to use my linux system at
    home.  What I'd like to do is when my system is done booting to
    have me automatically login as my main user account (not as root
    though) on one virtual console (the first) and leave all other
    consoles and virtual consoles alone, so that someone telneting in
    will get a login prompt like normal, just that I won't.  I'd still
    like the other VC's have logins for others to login and other
    reasons.  I've tried just putting /bin/sh in /etc/inittab and that
    didn't work, and I'm stumped.  Does anyone have any ideas on
    this?"
</I> </blockquote> 
I was in the same situation.  I saw this question come up regularly in
various newsgroups, but never with a satisfactory solution being
proposed.  Recently I came up with a solution that does just what
Mr. Blake requested.  I did this by making a few changes to Florian
LaRoche's mingetty program, which is used issue the login prompt on
virtual consoles in most Linux distributions.  These changes allow a
user to be automatically logged onto the console terminal as soon as
the system boots.  I got the idea for this patch after reading about a
similar feature provided on SGI's Irix operating system.
<P> 
Here's the description of the autologin feature that I've added to the
mingetty.8 man page:
<blockquote> 
<B>--autologin username</B> 
          Log  the  specified user onto the console (normally
          /dev/tty1) when the system is first booted  without
          prompting for a username or password.
</blockquote> <P> <blockquote> 
          When  the  autologin  option  is supplied, mingetty
          will check that the  controlling  terminal  is  the
          console  (normally  /dev/tty1),  that  a reasonable
          username has been supplied, and that  this  is  the
          first   autologin  request  since  the  system  has
          booted.  If all of these conditions have been  met,
          a request for an unauthenticated login is passed to
          the login program.  Otherwise, a normal interactive
          login is performed.
</blockquote> <P> <blockquote> 
          The login program may deny the request for an unau-
          thenticated login.  Typically this will happen when
          the  user  is  root,  has a UID of 0, or whenever a
          normal interactive login would be denied due to the
          access   restrictions  specified  in  the  nologin,
          usertty, or securetty files.
</blockquote> <P> <blockquote> 
          Only a single  autologin  request  will  be  issued
          after  a  system  boot.   If  the  automated  login
          request  is  denied,  or  if  the  user  logs  out,
          mingetty  will revert to performing normal interac-
          tive logins for all subsequent login requests.
</blockquote> <P> 
I've placed unified diffs against the mingetty-0.9.4 version of
mingetty.c and mingetty.8 on my web page at
http://www5.jagunet.com/~kodis/.  The patched version of mingetty logs
me in on the first virtual console when my computer first boots, while
leaving all the normal Unix security measures in effect for all but
this one specific console login.
<P> 
To use this patch, you'll have to first obtain the sources for the
mingetty program, preferably with any patches used in your Linux
distribution.  After applying the patch file from my web page, you
will have to rebuild the mingetty program, and install it and the
patched mingetty.8 man page in the appropriate directories after
saving the original versions.  
<P> 
The inittab entry for the first VC will then have to be modified to
put the autologin feature into effect.  In my /etc/inittab file, this
line now reads:
<PRE> 
    1:12345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty --noclear --autologin kodis tty1
</PRE> 
Rebooting after making these changes will insure that init has spawned
the new version of mingetty, and if all is well, will automatically
log you on to the console.
<P> 
Since I normally use X whenever I'm logged in at the console, I've
added the following few lines of code to my .zlogin and .bash_profile
scripts.  This code queries "Start X [Yn]? " when initially logged in
from the first virtual console, and waits 10 seconds for a response.
Entering Y or allowing the timeout to occur results in X being
started.  On exiting X, a similar timed query asking "Log out [Yn]? "
is issued, giving the option of logging out or being dropped into a
text console.
<PRE>
case `tty` in 
    /dev/tty[1])
        echo -n "Start X [Yn]? "
        expect \
	    -c 'stty raw' \
	    -c 'set timeout 10' \
	    -c 'expect -nocase n {exit 1} -re . {exit 0}'
        if [ $? = 0 ] ; then
	    startx
            echo -n "Log out [Yn]? "
            expect \
	        -c 'stty raw' \
	        -c 'set timeout 10' \
	        -c 'expect -nocase n {exit 1} -re . {exit 0}'
	    if [ $? = 0 ] ; then
		logout
	    fi
        fi
	echo
    ;;
esac
</PRE> 
These few changes combine to make getting logged on and running X on a
Linux box as easy as turning the power on.  Here's hoping that this
proves useful for Mr. Blake and any of your other readers who find
themselves in this situation.
