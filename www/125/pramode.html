<h1>uClinux on Blackfin BF533 Stamp - A DSP Linux Port (Part 2)</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/pramode.html">Pramode C.E.</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>
In <a href="../123/jesslyn.html">Part 1</a> of 
this series, we had examined how to connect a BF533 Stamp board to our 
GNU/Linux machine and run a simple `hello, world' program. In
this article, we shall look at writing simple device drivers to access 
the LED's and buttons on the board as well as manipulating 
the on-chip watchdog timer.

<h3>Compiling the uClinux kernel</h3>

<p>
You can download the uClinux kernel (with Blackfin support) from 
<a href="http://blackfin.uclinux.org/projects/uclinux533/">blackfin.uclinux.org/projects/uclinux533</a> - I am using the 2005R3 release.

<p>
Before you start compiling the kernel, make sure that you have set up 
the GNU toolchain for the Blackfin processor as described in 
Part 1; the Blackfin uClinux documentation project offers
<a href="http://docs.blackfin.uclinux.org/doku.php?id=setting_up_your_development_host">more information</a>.

<p>
The kernel compilation process is documented in detail <a
href="http://docs.blackfin.uclinux.org/doku.php?id=basic_compilation">here</a>
- it's fairly standard procedure (make menuconfig; make).
You can simply use the default settings most of the time; the 
only change I made was enabling loadable module support.

<p>
The kernel binary (in ELF format) will be present under the folder 
uClinux-dist/images; it will be a file named `linux'. Don't be
surprised by the size of the file (around 5.6Mb in my case) - the
file contains not only kernel code but also an elementary root file
system which gets loaded onto a ramdisk when the board is powered up!
It seems that this file system is built from the directory tree rooted
at uClinux-dist/romfs/.

<h3>Downloading the kernel onto the board</h3>

<p>
Connect the Stamp board to the serial port of the PC and fire up
`minicom'. As soon as you feed power to the board, a boot loader program
called `uboot' starts running looking for keystrokes out of the
serial port - if you hit `enter' in 5 seconds, `uboot' will suspend
the booting process and display a prompt where you can enter some
simple commands. The `print' command should show you several lines
of the form `name=value'. We are interested in two such `names'; they
are `serverip' and `ipaddr'. We shall assign values to them by
typing:
<pre>

set ipaddr 192.168.1.1
set serverip 192.168.1.2

</pre>

<p>
The name `ipaddr' refers to the IP address assigned to the Ethernet
controller on the stamp board and `serverip' refers to the IP
address of the Ethernet card on the PC to which the board is
connected. You should now check whether `uboot' is able to 
communicate with the PC via the Ethernet link by running:
<pre>

ping 192.168.1.2

</pre>


<p>
We have to set up a TFTP server on the PC and verify that it is
working properly. As I am using Ubuntu, I had to `apt-get' three
packages - tftp, tftpd and xinetd. (Note: the `apt-get' command is
used to download and install packages on Debian GNU/Linux 
systems). The `xinetd' program should be instructed to start the
TFTP daemon by creating a file called /etc/xinetd.d/tftp which
contains entries of the form:
<pre>

service tftp
{
	socket_type		= dgram
	protocol	= udp
	wait		= yes
	user		= root
	server 	= /usr/sbin/in.tftpd
	server_args = -s /boot
	wait		= yes
	disable	= no
}

</pre>

<p>
The `server_args' line specifies that files to be download via 
TFTP should be placed under /boot.

<p>
Once this file is created, we should verify whether everything is
working fine by starting `xinetd', copying the Blackfin uClinux
kernel image to /boot and running tftp (on the PC):
<pre>

$ cd /tmp
$ tftp localhost
tftp&gt; get linux
Received 5676668 bytes in 0.9 seconds

</pre>

<p>
Once we have verified that the Ethernet link between our GNU/Linux 
machine and the Stamp board is working OK (by pinging from uboot)
and that the TFTP server on the PC also has been configured 
properly, we can reboot the board, hit `enter', get into the `uboot'
prompt and type:
<pre>

tftpboot 0x1000000 linux

</pre>

<p>
This will download the newly created kernel image (called `linux') 
from /boot of our PC to the memory of the stamp board. Once this
is over, we should type:
<pre>

bootelf 0x1000000

</pre>

<p>
and the board will boot with the downloaded kernel. Once we log onto
the board, we should again configure the Ethernet controller with
the proper ip address using the `ifconfig' command.

<p>
More info regarding `uboot' can be obtained from
<a href="http://docs.blackfin.uclinux.org/doku.php?id=das_u-boot_on_blackfin">here</a>.

<h3>Our first kernel module</h3>

<p>
Here is a simple `hello, world' loadable kernel module:

<p>
<a href="misc/pramode/listing1.txt">[Listing 1]</a>
<pre>

#include &lt;linux/module.h&gt;

int init_module()
{
	printk("Hello...\n");
	return 0;
}

void cleanup_module()
{
	printk("World...\n");
}

</pre>

<p>
This module can be compiled with the help of the following
`Makefile':

<p>
<a href="misc/pramode/listing2.txt">[Listing 2]</a>
<pre>

obj-m:=test.o
default:
	make -C /usr/local/src/uClinux-dist/linux-2.6.x/ M=`pwd`

</pre>

<p>
We can `ftp' the resulting object file `test.ko' onto the stamp 
board and load it into the kernel by running `insmod ./test.ko'.

<h3>A minor problem</h3>

<p>
It seems that the file system on the board does not have the 
`mknod' command. It's very easy to build one ourselves:

<p>
<a href="misc/pramode/listing3.txt">[Listing 3]</a>
<pre>

#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include  &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;

main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	int r;
	if(argc != 4) {
		printf("Usage: mknod file major minor");
		exit(1);
	}
	r=mknod(argv[1], S_IFCHR|0777, makedev(atoi(argv[2]), atoi(argv[3])));
	if(r &lt; 0) {
		perror("mknod");
		exit(1);
	}
}

</pre>


<p>
The code should be compiled like this:
<pre>

bfin-uclinux-gcc -Wl,elf2flt mknod.c -o mknod

</pre>

It can be ftp'd onto the board or can be made part of the file
system by copying to uClinux-dist/romfs/bin and building the
kernel once again.

<h3>Blinking LED's</h3>

<p>
The BF533 Stamp board comes with 3 LED's and 3 buttons attached to
a few General Purpose I/O pins (or `programmable flags' PF0 to PF15
as per the Blackfin manual) - the LED's are on PF2, PF3 and PF4. 
The GPIO pins can be programmed via certain memory mapped registers.
The pin direction (input or output) can be set by writing to a
`direction register' at location 0xFFC00730 - if a bit of this 
register is `set', the corresponding pin acts as output and if it
is clear, the pin acts as an input pin; for example, writing:
<pre>

*((unsigned short*)0xFFC00730) = 0x1;

</pre>

<p>
will result in PF0 being configured as output and all others as
input.

<p>
The uClinux kernel for the Blackfin processor comes with macros
using which we can access all these registers - the above expression
can be rewritten as:
<pre>

*pFIO_DIR = 0x1;

</pre>

<p>
There are two other registers which we can use to set or clear the
GPIO pins - writing a 1 to a bit of the FIO_FLAG_S register results
in the corresponding GPIO pin going high and writing a 1 to a bit of 
the FIO_FLAG_C register results in the pin going low. All these
registers can be accessed only from kernel space. <a href="misc/pramode/listing4.txt">Listing 4</a> 
is a simple character driver which sets or clears PF2 
depending on a value it receives from user space. The file
<i>drivers/char/pflags.c</i> in the Blackfin uClinux kernel source 
is a more complete implementation.

<h3>Programming the watchdog</h3>

<p>
A watchdog timer is a critical part of many applications which
depend on the reliable operation of computer software - it's basically
a timer which counts down to zero and resets the microprocessor
when the count reaches zero - follow <a href="http://www.embedded.com/2000/0011/0011feat4.htm">this link</a> for more information. 

<p>
The Blackfin CPU has a 32 bit watchdog timer. The registers
associated with this timer are the watchdog count, status and
control registers. The status register holds the current watchdog
count value which gets decremented by one every clock cycle (the
system clock is 100MHz on my board). Writing any value to this register
when the watchdog is enabled results in the register being loaded
with the value of the count register. Writing a value to the count
register when the watchdog is disabled results in that value being
copied to the status register. When the status register value becomes
zero, the watchdog triggers an event which was previously selected
by writing to a few bits of the control register (usually a system
reset). The watchdog is enabled by writing any value other than
0xAD to bits D4 to D11 of the control register. Bits D1 and D2 of
the control register decide the event to be triggered on timeout - 
setting the value to 00 chooses `system reset' as the event.

<p>
The  working of the watchdog can be tested by writing a simple module
whose <i>init_module</i> function contains the following lines:
<pre>

*pWDOG_CNT = 500000000 // timeout in 5 seconds
*pWDOG_CTL = 0; // choose `reset' event and
 // enable watchdog.

</pre>

<p>
The system will reboot five seconds after inserting the module!

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>

Myself and <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/authors/jesslyn.html"> Jesslyn</a>
(my student and author of the <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/123/jesslyn.html">first part</a>) 
would love to share with LG readers many more experiments using 
the Stamp board in later parts of this series!
