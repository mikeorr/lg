<p><strong>From Thomas L. Gossard on Fri, 03 Jul 1998 
<br><br>

Answerguy,
<br><br>

Regarding the recent question you received on memory leakage under
2.0.29.  I don't believe it is a memory leakage under the normal
sense where a program quits and won't give the memory back to the OS.
</strong></p>

<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)" width="50" height="28"
	align="left" border="0">
	Once a program has <strong>quit</strong> (exited) it is the OS' 
	responsibility to reclaim all RAM and normalize all 
	other resources (process table entries, filed descriptors
	and handles, etc) that were allocated to that process.
<br><br>

	If it fails to do so, that is a bug in the OS (the kernel
	and/or its drivers or core user space processes, like 
	'<tt>init</tt>').  Under Linux (and Unix in general) it is very
	rare to see this sort of bug.  (I've never heard of any
	kernel memory leaks in Linux).  
<br><br>

	Under NT there is apparently a problem because the system is
	very complex and so much of the programming doesn't respect
	the intended modularity between "kernel" and "user space" ---
	so DLLs and drivers, (particularly video drivers) will end up
	locked into memory with no references.  Since I'm not an NT
	programmer (and not a systems programmer of any sort I'll have
	to accept the considered opinions of others who've said that
	this is why NT has a notorious poor stability record compared
	to any form of Unix.  The fact that they've added some process
	memory protection and imposed some modularity and process
	isolation means that NT's stability is orders of magnitude
	better than MS-DOS, Windows 3.x, and Windows '95 ever were.
	However, it's reported to be very poor compared to any of the
	multi-user OS' like Unix or VMS.

I also use .29 and saw the same problem.  I sent out several e-mails
and found out that what is really happening is the OS has the memory
but is not reporting it as free but has saved it for cache purposes.
Notice the guy with the question said "<tt>ls</tt>" the first time took
memory but not the second time.  A memory leak will take the memory
each time.  The OS is keeping the memory for itself.  The real
problem is in the way the OS or <tt>top</tt> or whatever is reporting the
memory usage and the way we expect to see it.
</strong></p>

<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)" width="50" height="28"
	align="left" border="0">
	The way that memory is used by the Linux cache is 
	fairly complex. Consequently the output from '<tt>top</tt>' and
	'<tt>free</tt>' and '<tt>vmstat</tt>' are not easy to interpret (and I 
	don't consider myself to be an expert in them by any
	means).
<br><br>

	The intended design is supposed to use all "available" 
	free memory for disk caching (and I guess the 2.2 kernels
	will implement disk and directory entry caching ---
	which should yield much better performance for several
	reasons).  It is certainly possible that there were bugs
	in the caching and memory management code in some of the 
	2.0.x kernels.  You could certainly go to the Linux
	kernel mailing list archives and read through the various 
	change summaries to see.  Or you could ugrade to a 
	newer kernel and look for symptoms.

The only true way to check on the problem seems to be to execute
some memory hog routines, like graphics and watch the swap useage.
In particular my mail program seemed to suck up 8 or 9 megs at a
time yet even going in and out of that and xv my swap was barely
touched.  With a sufficient memory leak after a period of time the
swap should see a great deal of activity due to the lack of memory.

	Most memory leaks are in user space --- in long running	
	daemons like '<tt>named</tt>', a web server, '<tt>sendmail</tt>', X,  etc.  
	Your test doesn't isolate the cuase of the memory leak.
	I think my message covered some suggestions to do that
	(like run with init=/bin/sh and run some tests from there)
<br><br>

	If exiting doesn't return your memory to availability for
	cache/free space --- you have a problem in your kernel.
	However, it can be deceiving.  For example --- I remember
	a situation where BIND ('<tt>named</tt>') was leaking --- and it
	looked like '<tt>sendmail</tt>' was the culprit.  In actuality 
	'<tt>sendmail</tt>' was making DNS queries on the named, causing
	<strong>it</strong> to lose it's cookies.  (At the same time that
	'<tt>sendmail</tt>' was segfaulting (dying a horrible death) because
	the old resolver libraries (against which it was linked)
	were return <strong>lots</strong> of MX records for sites 
	like <a href="http://www.compuserve.com/">Compuserve</a>
	and <a href="http://aol/com/">AOL</a> (which back then had 
	just started deploying 
	dozens of mail servers each --- so that one DNS request
	would return more records than the resolver could handle).
<br><br>

	At first I thought someone had discovered a new remote
	<tt>sendmail</tt> exploit and was hacking into my site (this was
	actually on an old SunOS box).  Then I realized that it
	was related to DNS --- and finally I upgraded to a newer
	DNS and set of resolver libraries.  The newer version of
	<tt>named</tt> still had a memory leak back then --- but my other
	sysadmin friends said "Oh yeah!  It's been doing that ---
	just set up a '<tt>cron</tt>' job to kill it once a day or so"
	(I'd been sure that it was my fault and that I'd built
	and installed it incorrectly).
<br><br>

	As for the "true way" to look for memory leaks ---
	I think most programmers would disagree with your 
	analysis on this one.  They might suggest Electric Fence
	(a debugging form of the malloc() and new() calls that's
	designed to catch the sorts of allocation and reference
	problems that '<tt>lint</tt>' won't --- and that might not be
	immediately fatal).  Another option might be for someone
	to link this with Insure++ 
	(<A HREF="http://www.linuxjournal.com/issue51/2951.html"
	>http://www.linuxjournal.com/issue51/2951.html</A>) and do 
	their testing with that.
<br><br>

	Certainly, we, as sysadmins are usually constrained
	to more hueristic and less "invasive" approaches ---
	but we definitely want to isolate the problem to a 
	specific component (program, module, kernel configuration
	whatever) or combination.  That's what "tech support"
	is all about.
