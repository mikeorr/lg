<h1>Using Linux to Create a Audio CD Library</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/weatherwax.html">John Weatherwax</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>
Back a few years ago, some friends of mine got very interested in
creating audio CDs from *.mp3 files.  At the time, they had access to
a large directory structure with numerous directories (read: CDs), each
containing around 10-13 mp3 audio files.  At first, when the need
arose to create a CD, one of the many "interactive CD burning software"
packages would be used.  This entailed selecting the relevant mp3
files with a mouse, dragging them to another "window", selecting any
CD-specific options, and then finally pressing the "go" button.  In
addition to this manually intensive process, the software itself
usually took a good deal of time to complete the "burn", during which
one dare not do any serious work on that computer, for the CD buffer
may run dry, and the burn process would be ruined.  Because of the
amount of effort that went into creating a single CD from a set of MP3
files, only the most "important" CDs were created in this way.

<p>
At this same time, I began to wonder if I could use Linux to script the
entire burn process.  My idea was to write a script that would
operate on a text file containing a list of directory one wanted CDs
burned from.  When the script executed, the first directory on the list
would be used, and a CD would be burned.  This directory would then be
removed from the list.  A user could run the script from the command
line, and a CD would be produced without the use of a graphical user
interface.  As an additional bonus, this script could be run by
cron in the middle of the night.  Then, the user would need only
leave a blank CD in the drawer at the end of the day, and come back to a
newly created CD the next morning.  One wouldn't get a huge number of
CDs created at one time, but, over weeks and months, one naturally would
obtain a sizable collection.  In addition, running this script at
night meant all the cycle-time is done when the computer is idle, so
there is no disruption of one's daily routine.

Before I begin this article, I want to state that in no way am I
endorsing any illegal behavior.  This article is for educational
purposes only.  I do not support, endorse, or approve of the illegal
copying of music or other media.

<p>
&lt;/end legal blub/&gt;
</em>

<p>
Before I began the task of scripting this burn process, I had a
relatively good knowledge of shell scripting, but no understanding of
the audio CD format, audio file formats, etc.  Luckily, one doesn't need to
know too much: One is able to find all the audio pieces on the Web,
so the scripting was not too difficult.

<p>
Before I go into the scripting, there were some pieces of software that
must be installed on your system, to perform the tasks we need to do.
Most of these pieces come standard with a great number of Linux
distributions, but I've included the links here, just in case a reader
doesn't have them in his/hers.  By the way, a person can check if they
have the program named "programName" by typing at the shell prompt:

<pre>
$ type programName
</pre>

<p>
If you see something like "programName not found in blah blah blah",
then you do <em>not</em> have this program, and you need to download the
program from the links below, and install it.<a href="#1"><strong>[1]</strong></a>

<p>
The first required program is the CD burning program itself, called
"cdrecord".  This program will interact at the device level with your
CD-ROM drive, and perform the actual burning process.  It can be
obtained at
<a href="http://cdrecord.berlios.de/old/private/cdrecord.html">http://cdrecord.berlios.de/old/private/cdrecord.html</a>.

<p>
The next is an audio normalization program called "normalize".  This
program is used to ensure that all of the tracks on the audio CD play
at the same "volume level".  This is also delivered standard with
several Linux distributions, but can also be downloaded at
<a href="http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~cvaill/normalize/">http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~cvaill/normalize/</a>.

<p>
The next is the program called "sox".  This can be obtained at
<a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/">http://sox.sourceforge.net/</a>

<p>
Next is a program called mpg321, which will allow one to decode mp3
into WAV files.  This can be found at
<a href="http://mpg321.sourceforge.net/">http://mpg321.sourceforge.net/</a>.

<p>
Next is a program called cdrdao, which is used to write audio or data
CD-Rs in disk-at-once (DAO) mode, based on a textual description of the
CD contents:
<a href="http://cdrdao.sourceforge.net/">http://cdrdao.sourceforge.net/</a>

<p>
The final required program is a Perl script that implements all of the
suggestions in "Greg Wierzchowski's" Linux MP3 CD Burning mini-HOWTO.
This Perl script basically glues all the above programs together.  By
the way, the Linux MP3 CD Burning mini-HOWTO is an excellent tutorial on
all of the issues encountered in burning CDs, and I highly recommend reading
it.  The HOWTO can be found at
<a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/MP3-CD-Burning/index.html">http://tldp.org/HOWTO/MP3-CD-Burning/index.html</a>.

<p>
The Perl script can be found at the following location:
<a href="http://outflux.net/software/pkgs/mp3cd/">http://outflux.net/software/pkgs/mp3cd/</a>

<p>
The first step I performed was to create a text file containing the
lists of the desired directories.  A very simple one would look like
the following:

<pre>
% cat desiredCDs.txt

Aerosmith/Greatest Hits
3 Doors Down/Under The Sun
ZZ Top/Greatest Hits
</pre>

<p>
I broke this task up into two scripts.  The first (called
"mp32AudioCD") is a wrapper for mp3cd that will create a audio CD,
given a directory of *.mp3 files.  The second script (called
"checkForCD_N_Burn.sh") is a wrapper to mp32AudioCD that extracts a
single directory from the "desiredCDs.txt" file, and passes it to
mp32AudioCD.  The script checkForCD_N_Burn.sh is called from cron,
every morning.  I'll present the scripts below, and then explain the
various pieces separately.

<p>
With that introduction, the shell script checkForCD_N_Burn.sh looks
like the following.  Note I've appended line numbers to the left of
the code:

<pre>
     1	#! /bin/sh
     2
     3	CDLIST=~/desiredCDs.txt
     4	TOPDIR=/mnt/mp3s
     5
     6	# Check if the file exists:
     7	if [ ! -e $CDLIST ]; then
     8	  exit 1
     9	fi
    10
    11	# Read the first directory to burn:
    12	read currentCD < $CDLIST
    13
    14	# Check to make sure this directory is present on disk:
    15	if [ ! -d "$TOPDIR/$currentCD" ]; then
    16	  echo "$0: CD $currentCD not found"
    17	  exit 1
    18	fi
    19
    20	echo "Attempting to burn: $currentCD"
    21
    22	if ! ~/bin/mp32AudioCD "$TOPDIR/$currentCD"; then
    23	  echo "$0: CD burn failed"
    24	  exit 1
    25	else
    26	  # Delete this line from the CD list
    27	  sed '1d' $CDLIST > /tmp/cdListOneLess
    28	  mv /tmp/cdListOneLess $CDLIST
    29	fi
</pre>

<p>
In this code, we declare the two variables: CDLIST, which points to the
text file above, and TOPDIR, which points to the top of the directory
structure that contains the subdirectories desired.  After some
argument checking, on line 12, we read the first directory, specified
in the text file desiredCDs.txt, into the variable currentCD.  This
would be the string "Aerosmith/Greatest Hits", in the above example.
Lines 15-18 check to make sure that we have requested a valid
directory, and line 20 calls the function "mp32AudioCD" with the
correct argument.  If this command succeeds, we remove this directory
from the desiredCD.txt list on lines 27-28.

<p>
Next, I show the code for the routine mp32AudioCD

<pre>
     1	#!/bin/sh
     2
     3	iso_dir=/tmp/isoimage_dir
     4
     5	echo "Removing data in $iso_dir"
     6	# Clean up anything in the $iso_dir:
     7	rm -f $iso_dir/*
     8
     9	echo "Copying data into $iso_dir"
    10	cp "$1"/*.mp3 $iso_dir
    11	# Exit if we have an error coping MP3 files:
    12	if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    13	  exit 1
    14	fi
    15
    16	# Got to mp3 directory:
    17	cd $iso_dir
    18
    19	# Call mp3cd script:
    20	$HOME/bin/mp3cd -E -c "--driver generic-mmc --speed 1" *.mp3
    21
    22	exit 0
</pre>

<p>
Here, on line 3, we define a temporary directory "iso_dir" to copy the
mp3 files to.  This needed is because mp3cd converts the mp3 files
into WAV files, and I needed this done on a local machine.  On line 17,
we change into this directory, and run mp3cd with some command flags.
The flags I use here are:

<pre>
-E, --no-eject     Don't eject drive after the burn.
-c, --cdrdao ARGS  Pass the option string ARGS to cdrdao.
</pre>

<p>
Here the -c command switch stores some specific options that I pass to
cdrdao.

<p>
With this introduction, we can perform a test run.  With all the
directories set correctly, at a shell prompt enter:

<pre>
$ ~/bin/checkFor_CD_N_Burn.sh
</pre>

<p>
You should see some statements explaining what CD you are about to
burn, followed by the burn process beginning.  When the process
finishes, you should have a new CD in your drive.

<p>
All that remains to be done is to create a cron script that will run
this program every night, creating a new CD every morning.  I choose to
run this program only on Monday through Friday evenings, at 1:30 A.M. (Even
computers need rest!)  To have this happen at a shell, enter the
following:

<pre>
crontab -e
</pre>

<p>
This should open an editor with your existing crontab file.  In this
file, put the following line:

<pre>
30     1     *     *     1-5     /home/wax/bin/checkForCD_N_Burn.sh
</pre>

<p>
Save the file and you are done.  The line above runs the
checkFor_CD_N_Burn.sh script every Monday through Friday evening, at
1:33 AM.  Thus, every Monday-Friday morning, you should have a new CD in
your drive.  I think you'll find that a great number of CDs can be
created from *.mp3 very easily, this way.

<p>
Write, if you have any questions or suggestions for improvements to this
script.  I'd love to hear them.  Flames to /dev/null.

<p> [1] <span class="editorial">Rick Moen comments</span>:  While it's 
useful and worthwhile to know about a program's "upstream" development
site, where (among other things) the author's latest source code can 
be downloaded, there are a few disadvantages that should be noted,
(and some alternative locations that should be usually be preferred, 
instead, if such are findable):  

<p>
1. Absent extraordinary measures on your part, your Linux distribution's
package-tracking system won't know about the program's presence on your
system.  Therefore, it won't know to avoid installing conflicting
programs, removing libraries it depends on, etc.  

<p>
2. You won't get any tweaks and enhancements that may be normal (or
necessary!) for applications on your Linux distribution &mdash; unless
you yourself implement them.  You won't get security patches, either, 
except those written by the upstream author.

<p>
3. Along those same lines, the desirable version to compile and run may
well not be the author's latest release:  Sometimes, authors are trying
out new concepts, and improvements &amp; old bugs fixed are outweighed by
misfeatures &amp; new bugs introduced.

<p>
4. As a person downloading the upstream author's source code directly, 
you have to personally assume the burden of verifying that the tarball
really is the author's work, and not that of (e.g.) a network intruder
who cracked the download ftp site substituted a trojaned version.
Although this concern applies mostly to software designed to run with
elevated privilege, it's not a strictly academic risk:  Linux-relevant 
codebases that have been (briefly) trojaned in this fashion, in recent
years, on the upstream author's download sites, include  Wietse Venema's
TCP Wrappers (tcpd/libwrap), the util-linux package, sendmail, OpenSSH,
and the Linux kernel (CVS gateway's archive, only).  Unless you are 
prepared to meaningfully verify the author's cryptographic signature 
&mdash; if any &mdash; on that tarball, you risk sabotaging your
system's security.

<p>
All of the above are problems normally addressed (and the burden of
solving them, shouldered) by Linux distributions' package maintainers,
so that you won't have to.  It's to your advantage to take advantage of 
that effort, if feasible.   The memory of when a thousand Linux sysadmins,
circa 1993, would need to do all of that work 999-times redundantly, is 
still fresh to us old-timers:  We call those the Bad Old Days, given
that <em>today</em> one expert package maintainer can instead do that task 
<em>for</em> a thousand sysadmins.  And yes, sometimes there's nothing
like such a package available, and you have no reasonable alternative
but to grab upstream source tarballs &mdash; but the disadvantages
justify some pains to search for suitable packages, instead.

<p>
Depending on your distribution, you may find that there are update
packages available directly from the distribution's package updating
utilities, or from ancillary, semi-official package archives (e.g., 
the Fedora Extras and "dag" repositories for Fedora/RH and similar
distributions), or, failing that, third-party packages maintained by
reputable outside parties, e.g., some of the Debian-and-compatible 
repositories registered at the apt-get.org and backports.org sites.
Although those are certainly not unfailingly better than tarballs, 
I would say they're generally so.

<p>
The smaller, less popular, and less dependency-ridden a package is, the
more you might be tempted to use an upstream source tarball.  For
example, I use locally compiled versions of the Leafnode pre-2.0
betas to run my server's local NNTP newsgroups, because release-version 
packages simply lack that functionality altogether.  On the other hand,
that package's one dependency, the Perl PCRE library, I satisfy from my
distribution's official packages, for all the reasons stated above.
