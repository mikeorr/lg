I have received quite a few comments and suggestions concerning my
"linusability" project. thank you all. I am trying to make a
consoldiated summary of all suggestions I have received. I seem to
have misplaced/lost some of the mails. I would like to retrieve them
from the TAG mailing list. Is  there an archive of TAG mails somewhere
? I tried but could get to only the archives of LG issues. Cat find
TAG mail, back issues though.
</p>

<p>
Can someone guide me please ?

<p>
Hi, all -
</p>

<p>
I've been trying to do some research on this topic, but am coming up dry
(or at least very sparse on good choices.) I'm hoping that someone here
will have an answer.
</p>

<p>
A few days ago, I got an AirPort Extreme - a wireless bridge + USB
gadget from Apple - so I could "unwire" my poor spiderwebbed laptop. Had
to set it up on a Windows machine [1], then started playing around with
the possibilities. Plugged in my new high-gain "client bridge" that's up
my mast (really, really impressive gadget, by the way
- <a href='http://islandtimepc.com/marine_wifi.html'>http://islandtimepc.com/marine_wifi.html</a>) - PoE connector snaps right
  into the WAN plug, AirPort hooks into it, life is good. Plugged in a
USB hub, hooked up my HP printer, told the AirPort software to share it
- OK, that's all fine too. Hooked up the external hard drive... um.
Well, OK, a few hours of struggling with Windows file sharing, and
Samba, and more file sharing, and... argh. My external HD is formatted
as ext3, so - no joy there, despite Macs running BSD these days. No way
am I going to reformat it. Also, plugging in an external CD-ROM was a
total fail: the AirPort doesn't recognize it, even when plugged in
directly without a hub. In addition, there's no HTTP interface on this
thing: you have to use their (Windows or Mac only) software to talk to
it.
</p>

<p>
So, the AirPort is going back to the store - but now, I'm stuck with a
dream. It would be really, <strong>really</strong> nice to just connect power and maybe
an external monitor to the laptop, and have the external drive, a
CD-ROM, the printer, and the network all available wirelessly. After
noodling on this for a bit, a small light went on. I said to myself:
"Self... what if you had a small beige box of some sort that was running
Linux and had all that stuff plugged into it?" At that point, none of
the above peripherals would present a problem: they'd just be available
<strong>stuff</strong>, accessible via standard protocols.
</p>

<p>
The only question is, what's the cheapest, smallest box that I can get?
Obviously, it needs to have at least one USB port, one Ethernet port,
and be accessible via WiFi. If it runs on 12 volts, that would be a
great plus. Recommendations on a flavor of Linux to run on this
gadget would also be welcome.
</p>

<p>
Thanks in advance for any suggestions!
</p>


<p>
[1] All FOSS-vs.-proprietary rhetoric aside... how the HELL do people
put up with Windows? I had to struggle through so many "YOUR MACHINE MAY
BE INFECTED!!! BUY OUR SOFTWARE ***NOW!!!***" warnings,
update-and-reboot repeats, instances of software automatically firing up
a browser and taking you to the company webpage, and completely
senseless procedures ("sharing" a network-accessible disk is a complete
lather-rinse-repeat nightmare) that I found myself literally screaming
"STOP already!" in frustration. And I'm not what you'd call
computer-illiterate, nor completely unfamiliar with Windows - although I
haven't used it in several years. That was just a horrible experience
that I hope I never have to repeat.

<h3>JPEG de-duplication</h3>

<p>
A family member has a number of directories containing photos in JPEG format. 
3 directories contain different versions of the same collection of photos. 
One is the current master and the others are earlier snapshots of the same 
collection. I believe that all the photos in the older snapshots are present 
in the current master, but I would like to verify that before I delete them. 
Also many other directories probably contain duplicates of photos in the 
master collection and I would like to clean those up.
</p>

<p>
Identifying and cleaning up byte for byte identical JPEGs in the snapshots has 
freed up a considerable amount of disk space. A sample of the remaining 
photos suggests that they are probably in the master, but the tags and 
position in the directory tree have changed. I don't want to go through 
comparing them all by hand. 
</p>

<p>
Initial research suggests that ImageMagick can produce a "signature", which is 
a SHA256 checksum of the image data. I believe that this would be suitable 
for identifying identical images, on which the tags have been altered. 
</p>

<p>
Are there any graphics experts in the gang who can confirm this? Alternatively 
suggestions of existing tools that will do the job, or better approaches, 
would be most welcome.

<h3>Photo recovery from a formatted flash memory card</h3>

</p>

<p>
Recently I've needed to recover photos from 2 compact flash cards, one of 
which was accidentally formatted and one of which was faulty. Subsequently I 
have used the "expertise" acquired to recover photos from a formatted SD card 
as a favour to a random stranger on the internet.
</p>

<p>
The first thing I did was backup the card, using a simple dd if=/dev/sdX1 
of=/path/to/data
</p>

<p>
The first time I did this, I was in a hurry. I had seen a lot of 
recommendations for a Windows tool called Recuva and I didn't want to spend 
much time on research, so I just grabbed a copy of that. It seemed to work 
just fine "recovering" 1045 files, but on closer inspection, none of them 
were complete. They should have been 3-5 MB jpegs, but they were all about 
1.5MB and only the thumbnails were viewable. I messed about with the 
settings, to no effect and looked at a couple of other Windows tools, before 
I saw a recommendation for photorec, which is part of Christophe Grenier's 
testdisk suite. <a href='http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec'>http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec</a>
</p>

<p>
Photorec looked like a Unix native tool, so I downloaded the appropriate 
tarball, unpacked it and ran it. It took the file name of my backup as an 
argument, so I didn't even need to have the card handy. I walked  through a 
few simple menu options and it recovered just over 1000 photos. This time 
they all appeared to complete, full resolution photos. As far as I could tell 
there was nothing missing.
</p>

<p>
Reading through the instructions, I found that there was probably junk data at 
the end of the photos, which could be removed by running convert (from the 
ImageMagick suite) on the jpeg.
</p>

<p>
The sequence of commands below is how I recovered the photos from the SD card.
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
$ dd if=/dev/sdd1 of=/tmp/sdcard.bin
$  ~/testdisk-6.11.3/linux/photorec_static /tmp/sdcard.bin 
$ mkdir /tmp/recovered
$ for file in /tmp/recup_dir.1/*.jpg; do 
convert "$file" "/tmp/recovered/$(basename $file)"; done
</pre>

<p>
The first command is just a binary copy of the raw data from the SD card to a 
file.
</p>

<p>
The next command obviously runs photorec itself. In the menus, just accepting 
the defaults is usually sufficient, but you have to select a directory in 
which to store the results. Photorec actually creates subdirectories under 
that directory, called recup_dir.N. In this case I selected /tmp/ to store 
the recovered photos in.
</p>

<p>
Having recovered the photos, I created the directory /tmp/recovered and ran a 
loop, calling convert on the files, as explained above. That directory, 
containing the final results was then burned to a CD, which was sent to the 
owner of the photos. 
</p>

<p>
As you can see photorec is a very simple tool to use and as far as I could, it 
recovered all the files that we expected to find on the various flash cards. 
I would recommend it to anyone who has a need to recover photos from a 
corrupt, defective or formatted flash card.

Hello TAG!
</p>

<p>
Im doing some research in here, and was wondering if any of you ever
worked with external sensors.
</p>

<p>
What i had in mind was having temp/humidity sensors plugged into my
computer and reading theyr values on linux to use on some program ill
write.
</p>

<p>
If anyone ever did this, what kind of hardware did you use?

Linux usability -- an introspection (Code name ::  linusability)
</p>

<p>
In spite of all claims and evidence regarding the superiority of
Linux, one aspect of Linux remains to be its major weakness --
usability. This may be the reason for its slow acceptance by the
not-so-geeky user community. I am launhing a serious study into
various aspects of the usability aspects of Linux, so as to list
out the problems and hopefully help some people offer solutions.
</p>

<p>
I need help. Please, if you have any ideas on this subject, or if
you know any sources where I can get directions, or if there is
something I should (or should not) do, let me know directly, by
email. I will compile all my findings, and post them back in this
forum. Let us make Linux more enjoyable by more people.
</p>

<p>
Many thanks,

I am currently running Fedora 11 on my Laptop and have run into some problem. My Laptop has been spewing random errors on boot up, displaying the following 
"crc error kernel panic - not Syncing VFS unable to mount root fs on unknown block (0,0). 
The boot process fails at this point. 
Following this, i tried to boot the Laptop using a Linux Dvd and run into the following roadblock. The error message displayed is " RAMDISK:  incomplete write  (13513 != 32768) write error 
Kernel Panic - not Syncing: VFS : unable to mount root fs on unknown block (0, 0). 
Has anyone experienced a similar problem. Kindly assist on how i can recover from the error. Thanks in advance.
