Dear Mr. Dennis,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Sorry for bothering you out of the blue, but you seem to be THE
person to talk to regarding the problems I have.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"

I wouldn't say I'm <EM>THE</EM> person.  There are thousands
of Linux users on the 'net that do the same sorts of
support that I do.  They just don't get all the glory
of a monthly column in LG

I am thinking of buying a Dell computer system (350Mhz, Pentium II
desktop). I intend to install Linux on it (to type my dissertation
in LaTeX), but I also want to have Win98 and related software,
just in case. IN relation to this I have two burning question:
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
Maybe I could ask you a few questions on LaTeX.  I'm
writing my book (Linux Systems Administration) in
that format because I love the extensibility, the
cross references and labels, the indexing, and
the ability to focus on structural markup rather than
appearance (and to defer many elements of cosmetics
to later).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, it is a pretty complex environment (more
programming than composition) and I occasionally
get into some tight spots).  I'd love to have a LaTeX
guru on tap.  (Yes, I sometimes post to the comp.text.tex
newsgroup; but sometimes I prefer the bandwidth of voice
to the precision of e-mail/news text).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

1) My friends warned me that Dell (just as any other brand name
computer) may have some proprietary features of the design, which
would prevent Linux from functioning properly. Have you had any
related problems reported or dealt with?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
Actually, Dell owes a tremendous degree of its popularity to
the fact that they <EM>usually</EM> eschew proprietary features and
traditionally have produced very compatible systems with
consistent quality.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
They might not always the the "hottest, coolest, fastest,
and latest" --- but a palette load of Dells will all work
the same way, probably won't require any special vendor
drivers and patches, and won't cost as much as the first
tier IBM's and Compaq's (who can afford to devote that
extra margin on research and development of cool,
fast, late-breaking, bleeding edge and <EM>proprietary</EM>
features).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Many business have standardized on Dell for this reason.
Some of these have palettes of these systems drop shipped
to them (hundreds at a time in some cases).  They want
the systems they order next month to work just like the
ones they deployed last month --- because having your IS and
help desk staff trying to sort out those new "features" can
rapidly cost more than the systems themselves.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, Dell traditionally was noted for it's lack of
proprietary frills.  However, they've now been the
"wunderkind" of the stock market for about the last year.
This may spur them to take on the very same "bad attitudes"
that provided them with the opportunity to overtake IBM and
Compaq in the marketplace.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I should reveal some of my biases and involvement with this
issue:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I wrote an open letter to Dell(*) to lobby for customer choice
in the bundled software.  This was specifically to allow
Linux and <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A> users to order systems without purchasing
software that we don't want and will never use.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><ul>
<li>Published in the Linux Weekly News
<A HREF="http://lwn.net/lwn/980514/dell.html"
	>http://lwn.net/lwn/980514/dell.html</A>
</ul></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
They'd initially claimed that there was "no customer demand
for this" (which was an offensive lie).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It was later revealed that they had been pre-installing
Linux on systems shipped to some select corporate customers
in Europe (read: BIG contracts that DEMANDED it) for about
a year.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Micheal Dell has recently commented on the issue (though not
in response to me, personally) and characterized the demand
a "vocal" but not necessarily from a large market segment.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I responded to that as well.
(<A HREF="http://www.lwn.net/1998/1112/backpage.phtml"
	>http://www.lwn.net/1998/1112/backpage.phtml</A>).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, obviously I'm biased.  More importantly I've pointed
to alternatives.  There are a large number of hardware
vendors that will respond to their customer's needs.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You can find a list of vendors who will pre-install
Linux at:  <A HREF="http://www.linux.org/vendors/systems.html"
	>http://www.linux.org/vendors/systems.html</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Naturally these are small companies that "nobody" as
ever heard of.  However, Dell was also an obscure
company as little as five or six years ago.  So, there's
a real chance that one of these vendors will become the
next Dell.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I think that Dell will soon "see the light."  Although
I've lobbied for it and think it would be best of the
Linux community as a whole; I have mixed feelings from
another tack.  I'd really rather see one of the "little
guys" (from the Linux vendors list for example) grow
into a new powerhouse on Wall Street.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(My superficial impression is that VA Research has the
best current head start on this market.  However, VA
Research focuses entirely on PC's --- and so far refuses
to consider Alpha, PowerPC, StrongARM, or other platforms
that represent some interesting new options for the Linux
user.  There's a part of me that is getting <EM>REALLY</EM> tired
of PC's.  Linux gives of the choice --- all of the core
software that most of use for most of our work is portable
and has already been ported to almost a dozen architectures.
WE DON'T HAVE TO TAKE IT ANY MORE!).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"

2) I really would like to have a DVD-ROM on my machine (III
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
generation, but I don't know which brand they are offering). Are
there DVD-drivers supported by Linux, or, alternatively, will the
CD-ROM drivers available with Linux make the DVD-ROM work at least
as a CD-ROM?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
Quite by chance I noticed that PenguinComputing
(<A HREF="http://www.penguincomputing.com">http://www.penguincomputing.com</A> --- founded by my
friend and fellow SVLUG member, Sam Ockman) now offers
DVD Drives on his systems. (*)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><ul>
<li><A HREF="http://www.penguincomputing.com/dvd-cd.html"
	>http://www.penguincomputing.com/dvd-cd.html</A>
</ul></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I note that there isn't currently any available software
to view DVD movies under Linux.  However, there's apparently
no problem using these drives to read CD discs, including
CD-R and CD-RW media.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... He also offers those cool case LCDProc displays
there were all the rage at SlashDot
(<A HREF="http://www.slashdot.org">http://www.slashdot.org</A>) earlier this year.  These
are little backlit LCD panels that you can install
in place of a couple of 5.25" drive blankup covers in
any normal PC case.  You can drive this to provide
various types of process status displays.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Anyways, you might want to consider getting the whole
system from him.  (Editorial disclaimer:  I did mention
that he's a friend of mine, didn't I?  I'm not, however
involved in any business with Sam, nor with VA Research
--- which is also operated by friends and aquaintances
and where Sam used to work, in fact).

Hope this all Helped.
