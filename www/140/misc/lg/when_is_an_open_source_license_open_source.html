This is just out:  OSI President Tiemann has made a ringing statement
that badgeware licensing is absolutely not open source, and has called
upon the community to support him.  We of course should do so,
unequivocably.

Subject: when is an open source license open source?
</pre>
Today I read a blog posting from Dana Blankenhorn 
(<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=1123">http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=1123</a>) that has compelled me to 
respond.  I may well be preaching to the choir on this list, but the 
blog posting I wrote in response (<a href="http://opensource.org/node/163">http://opensource.org/node/163</a>) is a 
request for the choir to now sing as one.  If I am asking you to do 
something you do not agree with, I'm sure you'll let me know.  If you do 
agree, now is the time to be heard.  Thanks!

I've just emailed him to request permission to republish that piece in
LG. (I realize that it's released under the CCL, but consider it polite
to ask anyway.) If there's anything else that can be done to help, I'm
all for it.
