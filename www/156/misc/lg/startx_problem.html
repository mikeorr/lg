Dear list,
</p>

<p>
I don't need kdm to run as a service because most of the time I access this 
linux box remotely. Only when I am at home then I need the desktop. That's 
why I have disabled the kdm. But after that "startx" gives an error

That's it? This log file suggests your X is up and running on vt7.
</p>


<p>
if this is indeed a log file created by an unsuccessful use of startx
and not by a successful kdm start maybe try to switch to vt7? what does
ps say? Is an X process running?

Hello Karl,
Thanks for your kind response.

<p>
I have just rechecked the startx but there is no x running at vt7. Moreover 
when I give startx command just for a second xwindow flashes and after that 
it throws the error messages. I also checked the log and it gives information 
as below

Surprisingly If I start kdm then I don't have any problem and i don't need any

&gt; Whatever goes wrong is not showing up as an error. Something outside X
&gt; might terminate it...
&gt;
&gt; You could try starting X manually, then start some windowmanager after

Hello Karl,

<p>
I have done "startx 2&gt; log" and then read the file "log" but there is nothing 
new. It just provided the same FPE font path error which I have emailed 
befor. Hence I have not mentioned the same here.

<p>
Try launching X directly - i.e., rather than using 'startx' or 'xinit'
(both of which use your private startup files, and thus add another
layer of complication), just type 'X', or perhaps 'X :1' to start it on
a second display (i.e., VT8.) If you want detailed error logging, you
can use the '-logverbose 255' as the first option.
</p>

<p>
Incidentally, I've noted in the past that the "refcount is 2, should be
1" message normally does not happen until X exits; i.e., by the time you
see it, X has already crashed. When X is launched via 'startx', crashes
like this, and there are no errors, I usually suspect the private config
files - i.e., either '~/.xinitrc' or '~/.xsession'. As Karl-Heinz has
mentioned, you need to launch something - some kind of a window manager,
or at the very least an xterm - to keep it open.

Hello Ben and Karl,
</p>

<p>
Thanks a lot. Your debugging skill are awsome. Ben you have discussed briefly 
what Karl suggested. With all these knowledge and suggestion I have fixed the 
proble. I first started x manually with "X" command and The xwindow came up. 
I checked the ps too and got Xorg was running. Then I focused on the .xinitrc 
file and got the culprit . There was only #startkde !! I deleted the comment 
symbol and startx command works <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)"> In these whole debugging process your 
suggestion always backed me up. When the problem was solved it were Ben and 
Karl whose name first came in my mind. Thanks a lot

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Incidentally, I've noted in the past that the "refcount is 2, should be
&gt; &gt; 1" message normally does not happen until X exits; i.e., by the time you
&gt; &gt; see it, X has already crashed. When X is launched via 'startx', crashes
&gt; &gt; like this, and there are no errors, I usually suspect the private config
&gt; &gt; files - i.e., either '~/.xinitrc' or '~/.xsession'. As Karl-Heinz has
&gt; &gt; mentioned, you need to launch something - some kind of a window manager,
&gt; &gt; or at the very least an xterm - to keep it open.

&gt; Hello Ben and Karl,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks a lot. Your debugging skill are awsome. Ben you have discussed briefly 
&gt; what Karl suggested. With all these knowledge and suggestion I have fixed the 
&gt; proble. I first started x manually with "X" command and The xwindow came up. 
&gt; I checked the ps too and got Xorg was running. Then I focused on the .xinitrc 
&gt; file and got the culprit . There was only #startkde !! I deleted the comment 
&gt; symbol and startx command works <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)"> In these whole debugging process your 
&gt; suggestion always backed me up. When the problem was solved it were Ben and 
&gt; Karl whose name first came in my mind. Thanks a lot

Excellent! Glad to help, and thanks for letting us know what the
solution was.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You could try starting X manually, then start some windowmanager
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; after to get winodw handling. Remember to redirect the stdout and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stderr to a file to get all the log.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have done "startx 2&gt; log" and then read the file "log" but there is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nothing new. It just provided the same FPE font path error which I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have emailed befor. Hence I have not mentioned the same here.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Try launching X directly - i.e., rather than using 'startx' or 'xinit'
&gt; &gt; &gt; (both of which use your private startup files, and thus add another
&gt; &gt; &gt; layer of complication), just type 'X', or perhaps 'X :1' to start it on
&gt; &gt; &gt; a second display (i.e., VT8.) If you want detailed error logging, you
&gt; &gt; &gt; can use the '-logverbose 255' as the first option.
