<HR>

<H3>Yup, it's finished!</H3>

<P>As of July 1, 1995 I finished up a 3 year stint as a General Surgery resident
at the <A HREF="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/">Vanderbilt University Medical Center</A>
in Nashville, Tennessee.  It was... an experience.  And as of July 1 I've hung up
the stethoscope; I'm afraid I won't be doing gallbladders anymore...

<H3>So where to now...?</H3>

<P>Now, it's off to Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) for some catch-me-up
courses in Computer Science and then it's off to <EM>somewhere</EM> for a
<B>Medical Informatics</B> training program.  Yeah, I'm going to miss going to
the OR and taking care of patients... but I'm pretty excited about heading off
into Informatics.  And I'll actually get to see my wife occasionally ;-)

<P>I owe a deep debt of gratitude to innumerable people, but two stand out:
<P><B>Dr. Lester Williams</B>, Chief of Surgery at the St. Thomas Hospital in
Nashville, for his unflagging belief in doing what is <EM>right</EM>, and <BR>
<B>Dr. John Tarpley</B>, Head of Surgery at the Veteran's Administration
Hospital in Nashville, for his tireless encouragement, example of excellence, and
the occasional, but well deserved, kick in the pants.

<P>... and, of course, to <B>Linus Torvalds</B> for one awesome OS!  Thanks.

<P>Any <B>Linux affectionados</B> out there, drop me a note if you've got ideas,
suggestions, criticisms, or just want to chat about Linux.
