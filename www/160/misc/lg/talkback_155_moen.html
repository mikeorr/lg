Probably not, but you can now dedicate a work to 'the Commons':
<a href='http://creativecommons.org/licenses/zero/1.0/'>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/zero/1.0/</a>

<p>
Yes, I actually talk about the "CC0 Waiver"[1] in my comprehensive rundown
(Web page) on legal problems that <em>may</em> result from purporting (as
copyright owner) to use any PD grant, including Creative Commons's.  The
page includes a dialogue I had with CC co-founder, Prof. Lawrence
Lessig, where he acknowledges that the concept is problematic, and that
the CC0 Waiver is merely CC's effort to "frame the dedication in as
complete and reliable way as possible".
</p>

<p>
My page also points out that all such problems can be completely avoided
easily by using, instead, a simple one-line permissive licence grant
(with example cited) -- or two lines if you disclaim warranties (which
is advisable).

[1] I guess they must have recently retired that term, and are now
calling it "Commons Deed" or CC0.  I'll update my page, accordingly.
