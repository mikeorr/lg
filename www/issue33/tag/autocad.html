<strong><p>Hi, I was talking with Terry and he told me you may know of a way to use 
an AutoCAD14 compatible on the Linux OS platform? I'm an AutoCAD driver 
for pay and am about to build a machine and I'll need an OS for said 
machine. Do you think Linux is a good way to go? Thanks Dave

>Last I heard there was no support for Linux from Autodesk.
Although they originally developed on Unix, Autodesk has 
shifted almost completely to Windows in recent years ---
and they've been cutting their margins and trying to make
it on volume.  The prices for their Unix versions were 
always <EM>much</EM> higher than the Windows versions --- so their
perception of the market interest levels is probably a
matter of "self-fulfilling" prophecy.  (Naturally the market
will appear to have greater demand for the version that
costs one quarter the price).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>So you probably won't get AutoCAD running directly.  I also
wouldn't try to run it under one of the Windows emulators
that's available for Linux --- those are generally too slow
and unstable for productive use on major applications.  They
are most suited to the occasional case where you need to get
into Word or Excel to extract some data from a proprietary
document.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Of course I could be wrong --- you should definitely call
Autodesk and ask them.  We've recently had Informix, Oracle,
Sybase, Corel, IBM and other major companies announce
product plans (and actually release products) for Linux.
So, Autodesk might be jumping on this bandwagon to blow
their own horn any time.  Calls by real users, who are
really interested in making an immediate purchase are bound
to help.  I've copied their webmaster on this message so 
that he or she (or they) can forward this along to the
the appropriate parties.  (I did search their web site at
<A HREF="http://www.autodesk.com">http://www.autodesk.com</A> 
for Unix and Linux --- and there didn't seem to be any support for 
any PC based Unix -- though there was mention of AIX, HP-UX, and Sun 
[sic] --- that would presumably be Solaris/SPARC).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>If that doesn't work you could try some of the native Linux
CAD packages. There are a couple of these out there --- one
is called "Microstation" from Bentley systems.  It is
available only in a "student version" and they won't sell a
"fully support" edition for commercial/professional use at
this time.  There also one called VariCAD and another called
Varkon.  Actually there's a whole list of related products
at:

<blockquote>... LinuxApps.com is an extensive site that lists a good
cross section of the available Linux software  (mostly
commercial software in this case).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Two other favorite sites for Linux applications are:
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<dl><dt>Christopher B. Browne's home pages:
	<dd><A HREF="http://www.hex.net/~cbbrowne"
		>http://www.hex.net/~cbbrowne</A>
	</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Christopher is very active on the comp.os.linux.* 
newsgroups --- where he is often a voice of cool reason 
amidst the flames.  His Linux pages covers DBMS (databases)
more extensively than any others I've found.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>... and:
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<dl><dt>Linas Vepstas
	<dd><A HREF="http://www.linas.org">http://www.linas.org</A>
	</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Linas Vepstas should not be confused with Linus Torvalds.
However, Linas does maintain a nice trim set of web pages
devoted to "Linux Enterprise Computing."  I particularly 
like Linas' commentary and annotations, including the 
occasional wisecrack.  This is not "just another bookmarks"
page.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>These might not work like AutoCAD at all and I don't think
they support the same document formats nor the "AutoLISP" 
programming/macro'ing language.  However they might suit
you. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Ultimately if your most important requirement is AutoCAD ---
then you're probably stuck with Windows until Autodesk
figures it out.  Until then you could toss Linux up on a
cheap little PC in the closet --- run an ethernet cable to
it and access all your Linux applications remotely (via
telnet and/or VNC or X Windows).  If you use 'screen' and
VNC it's possible to leave jobs running on the Linux box
"detached" from your Windows box, so that the frequent
reboots required by Windows won't disturb your other work.
(My boxes at the house usually stay up for months at a time.
I only occasionally reboot any of them --- usually to add
hardware or install a new kernel.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Your "closet" server can be as modest as a 386 with as
little as 16Mb of RAM and a 100Mb hard drive.  (Actually
it's possible to boot from a single diskette and do
limited work in 8Mb of RAM or less --- but 16Mb and a
hard drive is still a good idea).
