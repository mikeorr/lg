<h1>closedShop - The Open Source Shopping Cart</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/fleizach.html">Chris Fleizach</A></b></p>

<p>
<p class="editorial">I ran across this piece of software while searching
for an Open Source alternative to the commercial "shopping cart" software
(which was mostly poorly written, and in a number of cases, badly broken.)
Chris's approach impressed me with its simplicity, utility, and ease of
installation - and fit my requirements perfectly.</p>

<p class="editorial">One of the arguments that the opponents of Linux
use, over and over, is that "Linux doesn't support business".  IBM, Novell,
Oracle, SAP, and countless other companies have been proving them wrong in
the corporate world; by soliciting articles from authors of software that
caters to the small and mid-sized business, such as Chris Fleizach's
<em><strong>closedShop</strong></em>, I hope to cut the feet from under
this part of their argument as well.<br>
 -- Ben</p>

<hr>
<p>About three years ago I was faced with the challenge of putting
together an e-commerce site that would not require online credit
card processing. Although I searched briefly, I only found
expensive solutions. Thus I began work on closedShop, an open
source shopping cart. Over the past three years, there have been
over 13,000 downloads spread across 9 releases. Basically,
closedShop is a free shopping cart written in Perl, using the mySQL
database as a back-end, that allows anyone to set up shop with no
online credit card processing necessary. They can process the
credit cards manually, as most businesses already have a manual
credit card processor.</p>

<p>Before we go into a tutorial on how to set it up and start
accepting orders, it's good to know what closedShop offers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add/Edit/Remove Products</li>

<li>View/Process Orders</li>

<li>View Sales Reports</li>

<li>View Customers/Email Customers</li>

<li>eBay integration for adding products</li>

<li>PayPal integration</li>

<li>Wish lists for customers</li>

<li>Searching capabilities</li>

<li>Total customization through templates</li>

<li>SSL capable</li>

<li>Language support for English and Tongan (those are the only
languages I know)</li>

<li>Backup/Exporting features</li>

<li>Product Importing from flat-file or Excel worksheets</li>

<li>Gift Certificates</li>

<li>Sub-Categories</li>

<li>Thumbnail or Text view of categories</li>

<li>Inventory Tracking</li>

<li>State/National/Country Taxes</li>

<li>Shipment Tracking for major carriers</li>
</ul>

<p>If that's what you need, then closedShop is a pretty good solution for
you. The first thing you need to do is download the <a
href="http://closedshop.sourceforge.net">latest version</a> from
SourceForge.

<p>After downloading, unzip the contents into your cgi-bin
directory. Make sure the all the files have 755 permissions
(closedShop doesn't work very well on Windows-based servers, only *nix
types). Most FTP programs allow you to change permissions (via the 'chmod'
command). You'll want to make all the files read-write-execute for
the owner, read-execute for the group, and read-execute for
everyone else. This set of permissions is also known as 755.</p>

<!-- This (writable cgi-bin) is the problem that got this bumped from issue 105 -->

<p>You also need to make sure that the web server is allowed to
write to the directory that closedShop is saved in. This is very
important since the program needs to save some data in flat-text
files. Most web hosting services allow this automatically. If your server
does not allow it, closedShop will tell you so and will not attempt
the installation. If you see this message you may need to contact
your hosting service and tell them you'd like to allow the web server to
write to the directory that closedShop is in (usually the cgi-bin
directory.)</p>

<p class="editorial">[ Previously, Chris' article got sidelined due to the
security concerns with the instructions in the above paragraph during our
technical review; making "cgi-bin" world-writeable is not usually
adviseable. However, I eventually decided that it wasn't all that
insecure in the first place (someone would have to crack the webserver to
get access), and that <a href="misc/fleizach/fix.html">a simple
modification</a> of closedShop would get rid of the above requirement in
any case. Open Source in action, at your service. :) -- Ben ]

<p>Assuming you have passed that main hurdle, you will now go to
your web browser and access the file called <tt>Install.pl</tt>. If
you put closedShop in your cgi-bin directory (and assuming your site is
located at "www.yoursite.com"), then to access
<tt>Install.pl</tt>, you'd type</p>

<pre class="code">
http://www.yoursite.com/cgi-bin/Install.pl
</pre>

<p>A web page will come up and ask you to enter some important
information. Some of it will be about your company, some about taxes,
some about how you would like your tables to appear. For most of the
data you can leave the default. The most important information is
about the mySQL database. You must have access to a mySQL database
before installation. Most web hosting services allow this access, but
you may need to request it beforehand. Then they will send you a mySQL
username/password and database name. You put this information into
the mySQL database section.</p>

<p>The other important section is the admin password and merchant
password. The admin user will allow you to make all changes to the
program, while the merchant account shows fewer administrative
changes and is more for processing orders. It allows two people to
log on at the same time as well. Remember those passwords, you will
need them to log in.</p>

<p>After you fill out the rest of the data, click 'Install' and it will
take about 30 seconds to prepare everything. Afterwards, you'll see a
screen that says go to the <tt>Admin.pl</tt> script.  There are four
scripts that do the different functions.  <tt>Admin.pl</tt> handles
administrative tasks. <tt>Cart.pl</tt> is for the shopping cart
and checkout procedures. <tt>User.pl</tt> is for individual clients
to login and watch the order tracking as well as manage their wish
list. <tt>Item.pl</tt> displays items and categories and also allows
for searching.</p>

<p>Once you log into <tt>Admin.pl</tt> you will see the different
options. You may want to edit category information first for the
categories you entered in the Install. Note: if you want to add
more categories or change the name, then go to "Edit Program
Variables". Other information about categories can be viewed as
well in the "Edit Categories" section. After editing categories,
you should start adding products, either through the "Add Product"
option or through importing. When adding a product, you also have
the option of posting the item to eBay at the same time. The eBay
information will be below the main information and is not
required.</p>

<p>Finally, you need to integrate closedShop into your site. You'll
find important links under the "View Important Links" option. This
tells you the URLs for each category, Searching, User logon and the
Shopping Cart. If you have a standard design for your site you can allow
closedShop to use that design with the header and footer variables in
the "Edit Program Variables". The header is a file that contains the
top part of the HTML for your design. The footer is a file that will
contains the bottom part of the HTML for your design. closedShop will
insert itself into the middle. These files could be made and put in the
cgi-bin directory. Normally, you would name them <tt>header.html</tt>
and <tt>footer.html</tt> and put those respective values into your
program variables.</p>

<p>You should then take the links you want to use, like Searching,
and link them into your design. An example of this can be found at
Demo Site on the closedShop web site (<a href=
"http://closedshop.sourceforge.net">http://closedshop.sourceforge.net</a>)</p>

<p>Of course, you should also use SSL if possible. Customers will
be entering their credit cards over the site and you will be
viewing them. If you're not using SSL capabilities then there is a
greater possibility of having the data stolen. Most web hosting services
allow customers to use their SSL certificates and SSL processing.
It may be a different link than what you are used to seeing, though,
something that looks like it is from the hosting service. In this case,
you'll want to change the program variables and change the names of
the files to use the <tt>https://</tt> and then type in the full
URL to the secure location. You'll also need to change the image
directory URL to the secure path, otherwise users may get messages
complaining about a mixture of secure and non-secure. You should
always access the <tt>Admin.pl</tt> script using the secure
connection, otherwise you leave yourself vulnerable to thieves.</p>

<p>The program has been designed to be as straight-forward as
possible. If you go to each script, you will see the default screen
appear initially. There is also more information in the
documentation that comes with each release. Of particular interest
might be the template features, which allow you to mix in Perl
programming with your template in order to totally customize the
look and feel of Item and categories.</p>
