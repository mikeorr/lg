<h1>Hacking RPMs with rpmrebuild, 2nd Edition</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/silva.html">Anderson Silva</a></b></p>

  <p>A couple of years ago, I discovered a tool called 
<a href=http://rpmrebuild.sourceforge.net/>rpmrebuild</a> while searching 
for a way to reverse-engineer the files installed on an older Fedora system 
back into the original 
<a href=http://linuxgazette.net/issue31/tag_rpm.html title="RPM package">
RPM package</a>. Rpmrebuild is able to reconstruct an RPM by looking up the 
information about the RPM's content stored in the RPM database. If you want to 
rebuild an old RPM that is not easily available on the Internet anymore, or if 
you need to tweak packages for your organization's internal releases, or even 
if all you want to do is study and learn a bit more about RPM packaging, 
rpmrebuild is a great tool to have.
  </p>

  <p>
    But rpmrebuild doesn't stop there; you can also modify actual RPM packages 
without needing access to its SRPMS or even knowing much about 
<a href=http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm/s1-rpm-build-creating-spec-file.html 
title="SPEC files">SPEC files</a>. 
Although this may not be recommended when dealing with core/base Linux system 
RPMS, it is incredibly useful for developers, release engineers, and system 
administrators who need to create internal RPMs for their organizations.
  </p>
  <p>
    To install rpmrebuild on Fedora:
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre class="code">yum install rpmrebuild</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    To rebuild an installed package in your system into an RPM: 
  </p>
  <p>
  <pre class="code">rpmrebuild packagename</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    While rebuilding a package, rpmrebuild will let you know if files have been 
modified from their original state. If they have, it will give you the option to
 continue or halt the rebuilding of the package, and it will ask you if you want
 to change the release number of the package.
  </p>
  <p>
    Example:
  </p>
 
    <pre class="code">[root@carioca ~]# rpmrebuild httpd
result: /root/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/httpd-2.2.15-1.fc13.x86_64.rpm</pre>

  <p>
    My favorite feature of rpmrebuild is the ability to modify its spec file on 
the fly. By that I mean that you can actually edit the spec of an existing RPM 
without having to rebuild from source. Why is this useful? Well, you can modify 
RPM package requirements, change logs, descriptions, and other fields in the 
spec without having to go through the entire build process again. It can save 
you a lot of time if you are in the business of building RPMs and don't 
use auto-builders like koji or buildbot.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here how's it done: 
  </p>
  <p>
  <pre class="code">rpmrebuild -e -p -n some_package.rpm</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
  Where the parameters mean:
  </p>
  <p>
  -e tells rpmrebuild you want to edit the whole spec file<br>
  -p is used because we are editing an actual RPM file<br>
  -n stops rpmrebuild from auto-testing your RPM, just in case you are building
 an RPM on a workstation that does not have all required RPMs for that package
  </p>
  <p>
    Rpmrebuild also offers certain shortcuts and plugins. Below I will change 
the release number of an RPM file without having to open up its spec file. This 
is great for automating release numbering processes.
  </p>
  <pre class="code">[root@carioca ~]# rpmrebuild --release=99 -p -n /root/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/httpd-2.2.15-1.fc13.x86_64.rpm
result: /root/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/httpd-2.2.15-99.x86_64.rpm</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    Notice that the httpd package went from release #1 to #99. Why would this be
 helpful?
  </p>
  <p>Well, as an example, it is common practice for release engineers to have a
 "back out" strategy in case a release does not meet requirements during 
installation. With rpmrebuild, the version and release numbers of an RPM that 
may be replaced by a new one can be tweaked so that in case there is a failure 
and the "back out" RPM is needed, the release engineers can simply install the 
back out RPMs over the new RPMs. Then the back out RPMs will have higher version
 and/or release numbers on them, so a tool like up2date or yum can automatically
 pick up on the changes.
  </p>
  <p>
	Not recommended to the same degree, but still useful for your
organization's internal applications - you can modify the version number of
an RPM as well:
  </p>
  <p>
  <pre class="code">rpmrebuild --change-spec-preamble='sed -e "s/^Version:.*/Version:1\.3\.1\.0\.1/"' --release=99 -p -n some-package-1.3.1-11.noarch.rpm</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    This command will rebuild your RPM and produce 
some-package-1.3.1.0.1-99.noarch.rpm.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some other things to keep in mind about rpmrebuild are:
  </p>
  <p>
  <ol>
    <li>Once an RPM is rebuilt, it will lose its original signature 
(if signed).</li>
    <li>You need to be root to rebuild a package only if there are 
root-protected files in that package.</li>
    <li>Rpmrebuild will respect your RPM "home" building location, so if you 
have .rpmmacros set up in your home dir, your rebuilt RPMs will show up 
there.</li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    The authors of rpmrebuild, Eric Gerbier and Valery Reznic, point out that 
even though the newer versions of RPM have a repackage option, they still 
require the user to uninstall that package from their system, which sometimes 
is not all that easy because of the dependencies on that package.<br>
  </p>
<p>
After finding this tool, and using it several times at my job, I took it upon 
myself to 'officially' package rpmrebuild into an RPM and make it part of the
 standard Fedora distribution. It's been available under Fedora since Fedora 7,
 and under EPEL for RHEL/CentOS systems as well.
