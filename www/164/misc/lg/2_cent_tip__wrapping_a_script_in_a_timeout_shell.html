Subject: Two Cent tip
</pre>
I have written previously on other topics for LG, and then IBM, but it's
been a while, and I'd like to first share this without creating a full
article (though I'd consider one).
</p>

<p>
This is a bit long for a two cent tip, but I wanted to share a solution
I came up with for long running processes that sometimes hang for an
indefinite period of time.  The solution I envisioned was to launch the
process with a specified timeout period, so instead of running the
problematic script directly, I would "wrap" it within a timeout shell
function, which is no-coincidentally called "timeout".  This script
could signal reluctant processes that their time is up, allowing the
calling procedure to catch an OS error, and respond appropriately.
</p>

<p>
Say the process that sometimes hung was called "long_data_load"; instead
of running it directly from the command line (or a calling script), I
would call it using the function defined below.
</p>

<p>
The unwrapped program might be:
</p>

<p>
long_data_load arg_one arg_two .... etc
</p>

<p>
which, for a timeout limit of 10 minutes, this would then become:
</p>

<p>
timeout 10 long_data_load arg_one arg_two .... etc
</p>

<p>
So, in the example above, if the script failed to complete within ten
minutes, it would instead be killed (using a hard SIGKILL), and an error
would be retuned.  I have been using this on a production system for two
months, and it has turned out to be very useful in re-attempting network
intensive procedures that sometimes seem never to complete.  Source code
follows:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
#!/bin/bash
#
# Allan Peda
# April 17, 2009
#
# function to call a long running script with a
# user set timeout period
# Script must have the executable bit set
#
 
# Note that "at" rounds down to the nearest minute
# best to use use full path
function timeout {
   if [[ ${1//[^[:digit:]]} != ${1} ]]; then
      echo "First argument of this function is timeout in minutes." &gt;&amp;2
      return 1
   fi
   declare -i timeout_minutes=${1:-1}
   shift
   # sanity check, can this be run at all?
   if [ ! -x $1 ]; then
      echo "Error: attempt to locate background executable failed." &gt;&amp;2
      return 2
   fi
   "$@" &amp;
   declare -i bckrnd_pid=$!
   declare -i jobspec=$(echo kill -9 $bckrnd_pid |\
                        at now + $timeout_minutes minutes 2&gt;&amp;1 |\
                        perl -ne 's/\D+(\d+)\b.+/$1/ and print')
   # echo kill -9 $bckrnd_pid | at now + $timeout_minutes minutes
   # echo "will kill -9 $bckrnd_pid after $timeout_minutes minutes" &gt;&amp;2
   wait $bckrnd_pid
   declare -i rc=$?
   # cleanup unused batch job
   atrm $jobspec
   return $rc
}
 
# test case:
# ask child to sleep for 163 seconds
# putting process into the background, the reattaching
# but kill it after 2 minutes, unless it returns
# before then
 
# timeout 2 /bin/sleep 163
# echo "returned $? after $SECONDS seconds."
