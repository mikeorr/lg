		recently picked up my copy of <I>The Linux Multimedia Guide</I> 
		by Jeff Tranter.  This text covers a wide range of material related
		to the creation and use of multimedia files with respect to the
		Linux operating system.  The text is approximately 350 pages, 
		including source code listings for a number of sample multimedia
		applications which are discussed in one chapter of the book.
		As usual, O'Reilly provides copies of the source from their ftp site.

		When I first found out about this book I thought "Rats, Jeff beat
		me too it."  Much of what Jeff covers is listed in my own Linux
		Graphics mini-Howto.  However, there are quite a number of items
		not covered by the LGH (as I call it), such as audio, a bit more 
		detail about video formats and tools, and programming considerations
		for various hardware (CD-ROMs, joysticks, and sound devices), which
		make the Linux Multimedia Guide a good addition to the O'Reilly
		family of Unix books.
		<BR>
		<IMG SRC=../gx/hammel/cleardot.gif ALT="indent" ALIGN="left" 
			HSPACE="8" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1">
		The text is divided into 5 sections:
		<OL>
			<LI>Introduction to Multimedia
			<LI>User's Guide
			<LI>A Survey of Multimedia Applications
			<LI>Multimedia Programmer's Guide
			<LI>Appendices
		</OL>
		The first section introduces
		the reader to the various concepts involved with multimedia such as the
		CD-ROMs, image file formats, and sound files.  The chapters here are
		generally brief but the one on audio is quite informative.  There is
		a discussion on audio file formats as well as a comparison of a few
		of the popular sound cards available for Linux.
		<BR>
		<IMG SRC=../gx/hammel/cleardot.gif ALT="indent" ALIGN="left" 
			HSPACE="8" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1">
		Section two opens with a discussion on hardware requirements for
		doing multimedia on Linux systems.  Most of this section centers on either
		the CD-ROM driver or the Linux Sound Driver (now known as OSS).
		There is also a short chapter on the joystick driver.
		<BR>
		<IMG SRC=../gx/hammel/cleardot.gif ALT="indent" ALIGN="left" 
			HSPACE="8" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1">
		The second longest section, A Survey of Multimedia Applications, 
		covers applications for the
		various forms of multimedia.  There are chapters on sound and music
		applications, graphics and animations applications, hypermedia
		applications, and games.  The last chapter, on games, seems a bit out of
		place.  There are games implemented as network applications using Java,
		JavaScript and the new Tcl/Tk plug-in for Netscape but this chapter 
		doesn't cover these.  This section is very similar to the LGH in that the
		chapters provide the program names and URLs associated with them (if any).
		The number of items covered is less than the LGH, but there are better
		descriptions of the applications in the book.
		<BR>
		<IMG SRC=../gx/hammel/cleardot.gif ALT="indent" ALIGN="left" 
			HSPACE="8" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1">
		Chapter fourteen opens the fourth section, the Multimedia
		Programmer's Guide.  This section is the longest in the book and
		covers all the devices discussed earlier.  Other chapters in this section
		cover some of the available toolkits available to multimedia developers.
		There is one chapter which contains three sample applications.
		<BR>
		<IMG SRC=../gx/hammel/cleardot.gif ALT="indent" ALIGN="left" 
			HSPACE="8" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1">
		In general I find the <I>Linux Multimedia Guide</I> a good reference
		text with a moderate degree of developer tutorials.  Unlike many of the
		books available for Linux this text provides detailed explanation on the
		various programming interfaces, a useful tool beyond the simple "what
		is this and where do I get it" that many of the Howto's provide.  The
		only drawback that I can see is that, like most of other Linux texts, this
		text does not provide a users perspective on any of the tools listed.  If
		Linux is to ever go beyond a developer's-only platform there will need to be
		detailed users guides for the various well known applications.

		long ago I got email from a reader of my Unix Graphics Utilities
		page asking this:
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
			I am just getting into the graphics scene and I have POV-Ray (for linux)
			and a few other programs.  I know how to create an image with a 
			modeller but how do apply texture and color to it?
		</BLOCKQUOTE>

		My answer was simple enough: It depends on what modeller you use 
		and what renderer you use.  POV-Ray for
		Linux doesn't have a modeller.  You have to feed it a text file which
		contains both shapes and textures and POV-Ray will render (draw) it.  There
		are 4 modellers that I know of for Linux: AC3D, AMAPI, SCED, and Midnight
		Modeller.  SCED allows you to preview your image using various renderers.
		AC3D has a built in renderer, as does AMAPI.  All three will output files
		that can be used by a number of renderers (such as POV-Ray, Radiance,
		PolyRay, RIB formats, etc).  Modellers create shapes that are
		independent of the tools used to render the image.
		<BR>
		<IMG SRC=../gx/hammel/cleardot.gif ALT="indent" ALIGN="left" 
			HSPACE="8" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1">
		Modellers are great for creating shapes, but the textures applied to those
		shapes depend on what renderer you use.  POV-Ray has its own set of
		commands that it uses for determining how a texture will look on an object
		in a scene.  Commands for creating textures are different for other
		systems, like the procedural language (an actual programming language) 
		used by BMRT (which conforms to the Renderman
		specification - i.e. the formats used by Pixar and their tools).
		<BR>
		<IMG SRC=../gx/hammel/cleardot.gif ALT="indent" ALIGN="left" 
			HSPACE="8" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1">
		So, the answer to the question is:  it depends on what renderer you use.
		For POV-Ray you need to learn the command syntax for describing textures.
		If you can find a copy, pick up "Ray Tracing Creations" 2nd edition by
		Chris Young and Drew Wells.  It may be out of print.  This text has a good
		reference for the 2.2 version of POV-Ray.  Although the texture commands
		were expanded for the 3.0 version, you can still create 2.2 based textures
		by providing the "#version 2.2" command in your POV-Ray source file.
		In this way you have a handy reference for learning how to create textures
		in POV-Ray.  You still have to do this by hand, though.  I've heard rumors
		that there may be a 3.0 text eventually, but I don't have any word if that
		is true or not.
		<BR>
		<IMG SRC=../gx/hammel/cleardot.gif ALT="indent" ALIGN="left" 
			HSPACE="8" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1">
		As far as setting the textures from within the modeller, well, I don't
		think any of the modellers do that for you.  You still have to manually set
		the textures (SCED allows you to do so from within the modeller, but I'm
		not sure the others do) using the command language of the particular
		renderer you're using.  The reason for this goes
		back to what I said earlier:  the format of the texture commands depends 
		on what renderer you use.
		<BR>
		<IMG SRC=../gx/hammel/cleardot.gif ALT="indent" ALIGN="left" 
			HSPACE="8" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1">
		Its best to think of modelling and rendering as two separate tasks.  If you
		want to preview your models you still need to run the renderers separately
		(except for SCED which will launch the renderer for you, but it's still a
		separate program - the renderer is not part of the modeller).
		<BR>
		<IMG SRC=../gx/hammel/cleardot.gif ALT="indent" ALIGN="left" 
			HSPACE="8" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1">
		I know this is confusing.  It was for me too.  In fact, I gave up on
		modellers and now create my images by hand (I use vi to edit
		the .pov and .inc input files for POV-Ray).  I've only recently started 
		to look seriously again at modellers.

The following links are just starting points for finding more information
about computer graphics and multimedia in general for Linux systems.  If
you have some application specific information for me, I'll add them to my
other pages or you can contact the maintainer of some other web site.  I'll
consider adding other general references here, but application or site
specific information needs to go into one of the following general 
references and not listed here.
