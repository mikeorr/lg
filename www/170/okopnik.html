<h1>A Quick Lookup Script</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/okopnik.html">Ben Okopnik</a></b></p>

<p>
Over the years of using computers, as well as in the process of growing
older and more forgetful, I've discovered the value of having quick,
focused ways of accessing important information. As an example, I have a
password-protected, encrypted file containing my passwords and all the
information related to them (i.e., hostname, username, security questions,
etc.), as well as a script that allows me to look up the information and
safely edit it; I also have a quotations file that I've been assembling for the
last 20-plus years, and a script that looks up the quotations and lets me add
new ones easily. In this article, I'll show yet another, similar script -
one that lets me keep track of often-used commands and various tips and
tricks that I use in Linux, Solaris, and so on.
</p>

<p>
For those familiar with database terminology, this is a minimal version of
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a>
(create, read, update, and delete) interface, minus the 'delete' option -
as an old database administrator, I find even the thought of data deletion
distasteful, anyway. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> Updating is a
matter of adding a new entry with a distinct search string - and if you've added
something that you decide you don't need later, all you have to do is not look
it up.
</p>


<h3>Keeping shell scripts from blowing up</h3>
<p>
One of the things I've found out in writing and using this type of script
is that there are pitfalls everywhere: any time you write something that
takes human-readable information and tries to parse it, you're going to run
into interface problems. Not only are the data items themselves suspect -
although that's not an issue in this case, where the information is just a
textual reminder - but also the user interaction with the script has edge
cases all over the place. As a result, 99% of this script is tests for
wrong actions taken by the user; the actual basic function of the script is
only about a dozen lines. The most amusing part of how things can break is
what you get after a while of not using the script and forgetting its
quirks: even I, its author, have managed to crash it on occasion! These
were always followed by half-amused, half-frustrated muttered curses and
fixes - until there wasn't anything left to fix (at least, based on the
problems that I could stumble across, find, imagine, or create.) As always,
I'd appreciate feedback, if anyone discovers a problem I haven't found!  
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>
On my system, the script is simply called 'n' - as I recall, I was
originally thinking of 'note' at the time that I named it. You can download
the latest version from <a href="http://okopnik.com/misc/n.gz">here</a>,
although <a href="misc/okopnik/n.gz">the one on the <em>LG</em>
server</a> isn't likely to go stale any time soon; this script hasn't
changed in quite a while.  
</p>

<p>
The run options for this script are deceptively simple, and can be seen by
invoking it with '-h' or '--help' as an argument:
</p>

<pre class="code">
ben@Jotunheim:~$ n -h

  n [-h|--help] | [section] [comment_search_string]
  
  If invoked without any argument, asks for the section and entry text to
  be added to the data file. If an argument is provided, and matches an
  existing section, that entire section is displayed; if two arguments
  are supplied, displays the first entry matching arg[2] in the section
  matching arg[1].

</pre>

<p>
Here's an example of adding a new entry:
</p>

<pre class="code">
ben@Jotunheim:~$ <strong>n</strong> 
Current sections:
awk
date
find
grep
mencoder
misc/miscellany/miscellaneous/general
mount
mp3/ogg/wav
mplayer
netstat
perl
shell/bash/ksh
sort
tcpdump
vi/vim
whois
Please enter the section to update or a new section name: <strong>perl</strong> 
Please type in the entry to be added to the 'perl' section:
<strong># Interactive Perl debugger</strong>
<strong>perl -d scriptname</strong>

ben@Jotunheim:~$ 
</pre>

<p>
Note that each entry requires a comment as its first line, and is
terminated by a blank line. The comment may be continued on the subsequent
lines, and is important: the default action for lookup (this may be changed
via a setting in the script) is to search only the comment when the script
looks for a specific entry in a given section. In other words, if I wanted
to find the above entry, I'd search for it as
</p>

<pre>
n perl debug
</pre>

<p>
This would return every entry in the 'perl' section that contained 'debug'
in the comment. If you wanted a "looser" type of search, that is, one which
would match either the comment or the content, you could change the
'search_opt' variable near the top of the script as described there.
Personally, I prefer the "comment-only" search - but, in this, I'm taking
advantage of my "Google-fu", that is, my ability to formulate a good search
query. The trick is that I also use the same thing, the same mode of thinking,
when I <em>create</em> the comment for an entry: I write comments that are
likely to match a sensibly-formed query even if I have absolutely no memory
of what I originally wrote.
</p>

<p>
So far, so simple - but that's not all there is to it. The tricky part is
the possibly-surprising features that are a natural consequence of the
tools that I used to write the script. That is, since I used the regex
features of 'sed' to locate the sections and the lines, the arguments
provided to the script can also be regexes - at least, if we take care to
protect them from shell expansion by using single quotes around them. With
those, this script becomes much more useful, since you can now look for
more arbitrary strings with more freedom. For example, if I remember that I
had an entry mentioning 'tr' in some section, I can tell 'n' to look for
'tr' in the comment, in all the sections:
</p>

<pre class="code">
n '.*' tr
</pre>

<p>
However, if the above search comes back with too many answers (as it will,
since '<strong>tr</strong>ailing', 'ma<strong>tr</strong>ix',
'con<strong>tr</strong>ol', and so on will all match), I can tell 'n' to
look for  'tr' as a <em>word</em> - i.e., a string surrounded by
non-alphanumeric characters:

<pre class="code"> n '.*' '\&lt;tr\&gt;' </pre>

<p>
This returns only the match I was looking for.
</p>

<p>
I can also look for entries in more than one section at once, at least if I
remember to use 'sed'-style regular expressions:
</p> 

<pre class="code">
n 'perl\|shell' debug
</pre>

<p>
This would search for any entry that has 'debug' in the comments, in both
the 'perl' and 'shell' sections.
</p>

<p>
This can also go the other way:
</p>

<pre class="code">
n perl 'text\|binary'
</pre>

<p>
Or even:
</p>

<pre class="code">
n 'awk\|perl' 'check\|test'
</pre>

<p>
One of the convenient options, when creating a new section, is to use more
than one name for it - that is, there may be more than one section name
that would make sense to me when I'm thinking of looking it up. E.g., for
shell scripting tips and tricks, I might think of the word 'shell' - but I
might also think of 'bash', 'ksh', or even 'sh' first. (Note that case
isn't an issue: 'n' ignores it when looking up section names.) What to do?
Actually, this is quite easy: 'n' allows for multiple names for a given
section as long as they are separate words, meaning that they are delimited
by any non-alphanumeric character except an underscore. So, if you name a
section 'KSH/sh/Bash/shell/script/scripting', any one of these specified as
a section name will search in the right place. Better yet, when you add a
new entry, specifying any of the above will add it in the right place.
</p>

<p>
Since the data is kept in a plain text file, you can always edit it if you
make a mistake. (The name and the location of the file, '~/.linux_notes',
is defined at the top of the script, and each user on a system can have one
of their own - or you could all share one.) Just make sure to maintain the
format, which is a simple one: section names start with '###' at the
beginning of the line, comments start with a single '#', and entries and
sections are separated by blank lines.  If you do manage to mess it up
somehow, it's not a big deal - since the file is processed line by line,
every entry stands on its own, and, given the design of the script,
processing is fairly robust. (E.g., multiple blank lines are fine; using
multiple hashes in front of comments would be OK; even leaving out blank
lines between entries would only result in the 'connected' entries being
returned together.) Even in the worst case, the output is still usable and
readable, and any necessary fixes are easy and obvious.
</p>

<h3>'n' as a template</h3>
<p>
One of the things I'd like the readers of <em>LG</em> to take home from
this article is the thought of 'n' as a starting place for their own future
development of this type of scripts. There are many occasions when you'll
want an "update and search interface", and this is a model I've used again
and again in those situations, with only minimal adjustments in all cases.
Since this script is released under the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License ">GPL</a>,
please feel free to tweak, improve, and rewrite it however you will. Again,
I'd appreciate being notified of any interesting improvements!

Ben is the Editor-in-Chief for Linux Gazette and a member of The Answer Gang.
</p>

<p>
<em>
Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became interested in electricity
at the tender age of six, promptly demonstrated it by sticking a fork into
a socket and starting a fire, and has been falling down technological
mineshafts ever since. He has been working with computers since the Elder
Days, when they had to be built by soldering parts onto printed circuit
boards and programs had to fit into 4k of memory (the recurring nightmares
have almost faded, actually.)
</p>

<p>
His subsequent experiences include creating software in more than two dozen
languages, network and database maintenance during the approach of a
hurricane, writing articles for publications ranging from sailing magazines
to technological journals, and teaching on a variety of topics ranging from
Soviet weaponry and IBM hardware repair to Solaris and Linux
administration, engineering, and programming. He also has the distinction
of setting up the first Linux-based public access network in St. Georges,
Bermuda as well as one of the first large-scale Linux-based mail servers in
St. Thomas, USVI.
</p>

<p>
After a seven-year Atlantic/Caribbean cruise under sail and passages up and
down the East coast of the US, he is currently anchored in northern
Florida. His consulting business presents him with a variety of challenges
such as teaching professional advancement courses for Sun Microsystems and
providing Open Source solutions for local companies.
</p>

<p>
His current set of hobbies includes flying, yoga, martial arts,
motorcycles, writing, Roman history, and <strike>mangling</strike> playing
with his Ubuntu-based home network, in which he is ably assisted by his <a
href="../authors/tanaka-okopnik.html">wife</a> and <a href="../authors/okopnik1.html">son</a>;
his Palm Pilot is crammed full of alarms, many of which contain exclamation
points.
</p>

<p>
He has been working with Linux since 1997, and credits it with his complete
loss of interest in waging nuclear warfare on parts of the Pacific Northwest.
