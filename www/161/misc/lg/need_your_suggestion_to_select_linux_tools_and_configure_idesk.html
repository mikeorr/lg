Dear list,
</p>

<p>
I am in a process to optimize my linux box with low fat tools. I have already  
icewm running with geany editor, parcellite clipboard, audacious, aterm, 
claws-mail.  Some more applications are missing and I am seeking your kind 
advise here.
</p>

<p>
1&gt; what might be a little and fast sound mixer applet to use with icewm ?
</p>

<p>
2&gt; A screen capture tool that can be fitted in icewm taskbar and have the 
features like ksnapshot.
</p>

<p>
I still have problem with idesk. It can't provide the wallpaper though having 
the right path of Background file. It alwasy shows error like
</p>

<pre>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[idesk] Background's file not found.
[idesk] Background's source not found.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</pre>

<p>
Please suggest,
</p>

<p>
Thanks
</p>

These are generally hard to come by that aren't explicitly tied into
GNOME or KDE -- you might find something in the adesklets stuff.

I use 'cam' with a script that allows me to adjust it incrementally, 5%
at a time - and I tie that script to 'Ctrl-Alt-A' (which triggers
"voladj -u") and 'Ctrl-Alt-Z' ("voladj -d"). These are specified in my
~/.icewm/keys and adjust the volume up and down respectively.

Cool tool - thanks, Thomas!
</p>

<p>
I'm not familiar with 'ksnapshot', but since GNOME is installed on my
system, I just tied "/usr/bin/gnome-screenshot -i" to a toolbar icon
(done in ~/.icewm/toolbar).

Hello Thomas,
</p>

<p>
Thanks for pointing out feh. It is really nice image viewer as well as fast, 
ligh-weight. I'm also looking into adesklets but puppy now a days draw my 
attention too. This distro also uses specially the tools which are fast and 
low fat.  Regarding screen capture I'm really searching a tool/command so 
that I can add an icon in the toolbar and take screen shot when ever 
required. a command line tool can also solve this but I have no idea which 
tool can support region selection too.
</p>

<p>
Thanks
</p>

Except their security model sucks. Everything is done as root, and
trying to turn it back into a "normal" system is just about impossible.
Puppy is a cute demonstrator, but I wouldn't use it for anything more
than that.

<p>
'xsnap' is really lightweight and has region selection and lots of other
features. I got it from an old issue of LG, and it still works great:

I have found scrot <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)"> The combination of scrot+feh really rocks !!  
scrot+gpicview is also good but gpicvies is little bit slower than feh.

Hello Rick,
</p>

<p>
Thanks a lot for your list. I'll surely go through it.  Yesterday I have 
configured scrot with feh as a screenshot <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)"> But I still miss the virtual

I'm curious: how did you set it up? Given the number of options that
'feh' offers (the templates you can define in ~/.fehrc and the way that
symlinks trigger the template behavior is just a fantastic feature),
combining the two sounds like a useful thing to do.

Very nice - thanks. They're both excellent programs with a pleasant UI
and a nicely-rounded set of features, although I wish 'scrot' was
documented a bit better: it supports the three features I want in a
screenshot program (select area, snap window, snap everything) but
mentions only one of them in the man page. Just FYI, right-clicking in a
window after executing 'scrot -s' snaps that window, and right-clicking
on the root window (the background) snaps everything.

<p>
"scrot -s" also allow to select a region. It would be helpful if scrot change 
the normal mouse pointer to something else so that it will be nice to see 
that we are right now in capturing mode.
</p>

<p>
You can also use gpicview replacing feh. gpicvies is little bit fancier. But 
feh is compareably faster than gpicview.
