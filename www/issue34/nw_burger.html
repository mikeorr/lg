<h2>Introduction</h2><br>
To understand the circumstances which led to me writing this little article, 
I have to explain a few things first.  I am a student at the university of 
Stellenbosch in South Africa.  We have a lot of Netware Servers on Campus, and 
most of the printers used by students are connected to one of these servers.
A while ago I installed Linux for two friends of mine.  They were quite 
impressed with the performance, and after a while the decision was made to
install Linux on two of the other computers too.  To make the switch from 
Windows to Linux as smooth as possible, one of the requirements of the new
setup was that the Linux PC's should be able to print to the Netware printer
upstairs, without any aditional steps (Saving as text, converting to 
postscript, and printing with nprint), in other words, point and click the way
windows users do it all the time.  This article explains how I did it.
<p>
This article assumes that you'll be using only one printer, that is the Netware 
printer.  Because this procedure includes replacement of the print spooler 
daemon, I do NOT recommend this procedure for a working installation with one 
or more printers (unless of course you know what you're doing, but then you
won't be reading this now would you? :) ).  Also, most of the instructions are
rather Redhat specific, if you are using another distribution, ask someone to
translate :)
<p><hr>
<h2>How does it work?</h2><br>
A print spooler is a program that accepts print jobs from computers on the 
network.  Usually the print jobs are stored on disk until the printer becomes 
available again.  The print spooler program also places an exclusive lock on 
the device your printer is connected to, usually /dev/lp1.  This prevents other 
users or programs from printing while the print spooler is busy.
<p>
The print spooler does however do no formatting of its own.  It merely stores
what ever you sent it in a disk file, then send it to the printer when it
becomes available.  To have some kind of intelligent formating, filters are
used.  A print filter will determine the type of data passing through it, and
peform conversions on it.  This means that it doesn't matter what you send to
the printer, the printer will always get something printable, usually 
postscript.
<p>
Filters also makes it possible to do a few nice things.  Since a filter is
actually nothing more than a small program that reads from stdin and writes
to stdout, we can write filter programs that can do almost anything.  In this
case, I made it send the job to a Netware server.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<b>You need the latest versions of:</b><br>
<ul>
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.astart.com/pub/lprng/lprng/">LPRng</a>
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.sunsite.unc.edu/pub/linux/system/printing/">Magicfilter</a>
<li>ncpfs (on your redhat cd or some good linux ftp site)
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> The location or version numbers of these software may have changed.
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Installation</h2>
You have to be <b>root</b> to install this.
<p>
If you havent already done so, recompile your kernel with ipx support, but
not full internal net. You may also compile ipx as a module.  See the Kernel-
HOWTO for more information about this.
<p>
Install ncpfs with: rpm -i ncpfs-2.0.11-3.i386.rpm (Your version number may 
differ)<br>
You may also need to install ipx-utils.  Rpm will notify you if you haven't
installed ipx-utils yet.
<p>
Execute <b>one</b> of the following, depending on your setup. In my case the 
first line worked perfectly on all of the systems I have installed this on:<br>
<ul>
<li>ipx_interface add -p eth0 etherii
<li>ipx_configure --auto_interface=on --auto_primary=on
</ul>
<p>
You may also want to read the man pages for these commands.  Since you want 
to print to a netware server, I assume you have access to it, and should not 
have a problem obtaining the correct settings here.  You should also put this 
line in /etc/rc.d/rc.local, so that it gets executed everytime you boot your 
system.
<p>
You have to remove the existing lpd before installing LPRng, this is most 
easily acomplished with:<p>
<code>
	/etc/rc.d/init.d/lpd stop<br>
	rpm -e printtool<br>
	rpm -e rhs-printfilters<br>
	rpm -e lpr<br>
</code>
<p>
Extract the LPRng- and magicfilter tarballs into /usr/local/src (or anywhere
else you feel comfortable with), they should untar into their own 
subdirectories.  Now follow the directions given in the README or INSTALL files 
of both, this usually consists of a ./configure, make, make install.
<p>
Create the directory /usr/local/printfilters and copy a suitable filter from
/usr/local/src/magicfilter-1.2/filters to this directory.  You may need to 
modify this file slightly to make it work propperly.  In my case i used the 
psonly600-filter file: on rh5.1 a2ps was invoked with bad parameters; on rh5.0
a2ps wasn't installed and nowhere to be found on the cdrom, so i had to add this
to the file:<p>
<code>
	default                 pipe    mpage -ba4 -o -1 
</code>
<p>
or install nenscript (from redhat cd) and add this line (this is probably the 
best option):<p>
<code>
	default			pipe	/usr/bin/nenscript -b -p-
</code>
<p>
Also, change these lines:<p>
<table>
<tr><td><tt># postscript</tt></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>0</tt></td><td><tt>%!</tt></td><td><tt>postscript</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>0</tt></td><td><tt>\004%!</tt></td><td><tt>postscript</tt></td></tr>
</table>
to this:<p>
<table>
<tr><td><tt># postscript</tt></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>0</tt></td><td><tt>%!</tt></td><td><tt>cat</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>0</tt></td><td><tt>\004%!</tt></td><td><tt>cat</tt></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
This is because "postscript" caused an extra clean page to be printed after
every print job.
<p>
I also include <a href="nw_psonly1200-filter">this</a> filter.  It was orriginally 
used to print to a HP laserjet 4000.
<p>
Copy <a href="nw_print">nwprint</a>, <a href="nw_filter">filter</a> and 
<a href="nw_config">.config</a> to /usr/local/printfilters, then edit 
<a href="nw_filter">filter</a> and replace psonly1200-filter with the filter you 
intend to use.
<p>
Edit the <a href="nw_config">.config</a> file to contain the information relevant 
to your setup.
<p>
Now do:
<PRE> 
	chmod 755 filter nwprint
	chmod 640 .config
	chown root.daemon .config
</PRE> 
<p>
Install the <a href="nw_lpd">lpd startup script</a> in /etc/rc.d/init.d.  
remember to do a chmod 755 /etc/rc.d/init.d/lpd.
<p>
Now you have to make symlinks to start lpd in the correct runlevels:<p>
<code>
	cd /etc/rc.d/rc3.d<br>
	ln -s ../init.d/lpd s90lpd<br>
	cd /etc/rc.d/rc5.d<br>
	ln -s ../init.d/lpd s90lpd<br>
	cd /etc/rc.d/rc6.d<br>
	ln -s ../init.d/lpd k08lpd<br>
	cd /etc/rc.d/rc0.d<br>
	ln -s ../init.d/lpd k08lpd<br>
</code>
<p>
This should have lpd start up in the runlevels mostly used by Redhat users.
<p>
Now we get to modifying a bunch of files in /etc...<br>
Edit /etc/printcap to look like the following:
<p>
<code>
	lp:\<br>
       	:sd=/var/spool/lpd/lp:\<br>
        :mx#0:\<br>
        :sh:\<br>
        :if=/usr/local/printfilters/filter:\<br>
        :af=/var/spool/lpd/lp/acct:\<br>
        :lp=/dev/null:<br>
</code>
<p>
Edit /etc/lpd.conf and locate the line:<p>
<code>
	# Purpose: lock the IO device<br>
	# lk@<br>
</code>
<p>
Uncomment the "lk@".  This tells lpd NOT to place an exclusive lock onto the
device, so if any other program tries to use /dev/null while we're printing it 
will not break.
<p>
Edit /etc/lpd.perms and add these lines:<p>
<code>
REJECT NOT SERVER<br>
REJECT SERVICE=R,P,Q,M,C,S NOT REMOTEUSER=yourusername,another,friend<br>
</code>
<p>
This allows only the users in the comma separated list to print from the local
host.  I dont know what will happen if two users print at exactly the same
time, but for the most part you will only allow yourself to print anyway.
<p>
Finally execute:<p>
<code>
	checkpc -f<br>
	/etc/rc.d/init.d/lpd start<br>
</code>
<p>
Everything should work propperly now.  You should now clean up /usr/local/src.
Keep the tarballs in a safe place, then do this:<p>
<code>
	rm -rf /usr/local/src/magicfilter-1.2<br>
	rm -rf /usr/local/src/LPRng-3.5.1<br>
</code>
<p><hr>
<h2>Why it took me a week to figure this out...</h2>

I tried to do the same thing with lpd, but for some sinister reason nprint
could not access any Netware servers if it was invoked by lpd.  If the
filter was invoked from the commandline, only then could nprint access the 
server and print the job.  I had a few options: Figure out a way of forcing
lpd to allow me access, produce a kind of work arround, or use another
spooler.  Since lpd already have lots of other problems (Read about it, never
seen them in action), I settled for LPRng.
<p>
At first I tried to make the standard Redhat print filter work with LPRng.  This
did not work very well, because the standard filter use files in 
/var/spool/lpd/lp while LPRng is rather fussy about the permisions of files in
this directory.  Moving the files broke everything, and as it was already 3:00
on a Saturday morning by then, I quickly got magicfilter off sunsite (We have
a local mirror :) ), compiled the software and built myself a little filter
script.
<p>
Now all I had to do was introduce some kind of password hiding mechanism so
that users of the system cannot see the Netware username and password.  I
discovered that the filter was executed as the "daemon" user, therefore
decided to create a .config file with permisions 640 and ownership root.daemon.
This file is simply included into nwprint, but while anyone can read nwprint, no
one can read .config ( except root and daemon of course :) ).
<p>
Well this allowed any user with access to the system to print, usually you would
only want yourself to have access to the printer, so after reading through
/etc/lpd.perms and part of the documentation, I came up with the two REJECT 
lines mentioned above.
<p><hr>
<h2>A few useful tips</h2>

Or rather, things I discovered while doing this...
<p>
1. To test the setup, change the nwprint script to cat all input to a file in
/tmp.  This is also nice to produce postscript files from applications that do
not have the capability to save in postscript: Just uncomment the 
"cat > /tmp/printout.ps" line in the nwprint script.  Of course you'll have
to comment the nprint line out :)  You can even have this installed as a second
"Printer", together with your existing printer.
<p>
2. To print from pine, you have to setup lpr as default printing command rather
than the other default thingy it uses.
<p>
3. Use the Generic postscript option in StarOffice.  Even if you don't have a
postscript printer, you should be able to use it as long as ghostscript has
a driver for your printer.
<p>
4. Look in /pub/Linux/system/printing on sunsite.unc.edu for other print 
filters.  There's plenty of existing solutions for most of the Canon bubble jet
printers, as well as HP deskjets and some of the Epson printers.
<p>
Also read the Printing-HOWTO, it should be installed in /usr/doc/HOWTO but if it
is not there, locate the RPM on your Redhat 5.0/5.1 CD and install it, having
the howto's arround is always nice, and is in my oppinion a MUST.

<h2>DISCLAIMER</h2><hr>

This is the place where I tell you that I am not responsible for any harm that
may come to you or your computer as a result of following the steps in this
article.  Blah Blah...
<p>
If I did anything stupid or there are better ways to do this please 
let me know at the e-mail address below, this address should be valid at least 
until somewhere late in 1999 :)
