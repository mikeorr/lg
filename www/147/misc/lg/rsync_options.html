Just a quick question guys...
</p>

<p>
Backed up my Windows Document directory using rsync in Ubuntu
with the following command line:
</p>

<pre>
rsync -Havcx --progress --stats /home/martin/win/My\ Documents/*
/home/martin/back/mydocs/
</pre>
(Mounted ntfs drive to mounted smbfs share)
</p>

<p>
If I run that again a few weeks or so later will it copy all
31000+ files again or will it just copy new and changed files?
</p>

I didn't know that ntfs supports hard links (-H flag). Live and
learn, I suppose.

<p>
It will copy only changes. Even for individual files it will only copy
changed blocks.

<p>
The one you use seems fine.
</p>

<p>
I should have said that "rsync" will still <strong>check</strong> each file in the
file-system for changes. This is because it is a history-less system.
</p>

<p>
An alternative that keeps some history is "unison". As a result the
latter is often quicker if there are very few changed files but the
volume is very large.

I also use the -u option "update only (don?t overwrite newer files)". You
may wish to check out the --delete option, and --delete-after, depending
on what you want. Otherwise deleted files will hang around on your backup.
But YMMV.

<p>
<strong>If</strong> your target supports hard links then a different way to use
"rsync" is to have a date based archive.
</p>

<pre>
	TODAY=$(date +%d-%m-%y)
	YEST=$(date +%d-%m-%y -d 'yesterday')
  
	rsync -Havx --link-dest=target/$YEST source target/$TODAY
</pre>
This will create hard links under target/$TODAY for all files that
already exist under target/$YEST. Any newer or changed files will be
copied in the usual "rsync-way".
</p>

<p>
WARNING: This creates the entire directory tree anew and so will
take longer than the usual procedure.
</p>

Just the diffs - as the 'rsync' man page specifies - and even "more so"
due to your '-c' option:
</p>

<pre>
 -c, --checksum              skip based on checksum, not mod-time &amp; size

Well, you might want to review all the options you're using in the
'rsync' man page. As Kapil said, what you're using seems fine - but
that's only because we're assuming that you want rsync to do the
"average" thing (a bit of circular reasoning, there. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> Only you can
tell if the options actually match what you want to do.

That might be the reason it takes ages to work out at the

Y'know, I often hear people bitching about how unfrienldly man pages are
[1] - but the one for "rsync" is very, very friendly indeed. [2] It
doesn't just explain the options - it also shows how to use the prog in
the most common, useful ways. The way I typically use "rsync" comes
straight from that page (and yes, I have taken the time to read up on
the options that I use - I hate cargo cult coding, and assiduously avoid
planting landmines in my own path.)
</p>

<p>
So, to <strong>finally</strong> answer your question [grin]:
</p>

<pre>
# Note: you don't need the '*' at the end of the source spec as long as
# you have that '/'. You also don't need to copy 'H'ard links: AFAIK,
# Wind0ws doesn't have those. You also don't need the 'x' (unless your
# Documents dir crosses filesystems!) I'll assume that you want to see
# that progress bar and those stats...
  
rsync -avz --progress --stats ~/win/My\ Documents/ ~/back/mydocs/
</pre>
In other words, '-avz' does the greatest majority of what people usually
want in that situation.
</p>



<p>
[1] "UNIX <em>is</em> user friendly. It's just selective about who its friends
are."
</p>

<p>
[2] As pTerry said, "...sir, to forestall your next question, I
personally would go to bed with it."

Does any one know of a good GUI manpage reader for Gnome?

<p>
In KDE you could just type man:/rsync into a Konq window and a
nicely HTML formatted man page would pop up and I just wondered
if you could so the same thing in Gnome...

<p>
seriously - why?
</p>

<p>
The search facilities under less (the usual manpager) are way superior and
quicker than anything mouse driven. And for long man pages it is searching
that is the major power tool.
