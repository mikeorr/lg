<p>Snazzy title, eh? Well, not snazzy, but informative. As it
suggests, this article (or tutorial, if you will) is all about
OOP in the computer language C++. Okay, let's get to the intros.
The name's Williams, Mike Williams. My mission? To teach novice
programmers, such as yourselves about the art of programming.
Through the months, I'm hoping to take you through a variety of
programming techniques, starting right here, right now with C++.<strong>
</strong>Are you sitting comfortably? Then I shall begin....</p>

<h3><strong>So what is OOP?</strong></h3>

<p>OOP is undoubtedly one of the most complex programming
techniques to explain. In fact, it's not so much a 'technique'
rather than a whole new method of looking at programming itself.
There are entire books on the subject, and it's well beyond the
scope of this article to introduce you to every philosophy and
implication of OOP. To understand OOP, you must first understand
what programming was like before OOP.</p>

<p>Back then, the basic definition of programming was this : a
program is a sequence of logical instructions followed by the
computer. And that's it. All well and good, but let's face it,
it's hardly inspiring. Until now, that is. It's been hiding in
the background for quite some time now, but OOP has finally taken
off. In an OO programming language, the emphasis is placed far
more on the data, or the 'objects' used and how the programmer
manipulates them. Before OOP, numbers were simply an address in
memory; a sequence of bytes that meant nothing. Now, however,
through OOP they have become far more than that. The program is
now a solution to whatever problem it is you have, but now it is
done in the terms of the objects that define that problem, and
using functions that work with those objects. Confused? Don't
worry, you won't need to understand OOP to use it within your
programs. Indeed, the best way to learn what OOP is all about is
through using it in your programming.</p>

<h3><strong>What you'll need and who this is for</strong></h3>

<p>All the examples within this article can be compiled in the
GNU C++ compiler. To invoke it, type:</p>

<p>g++ &lt;filename&gt;</p>

<p>at the BASH prompt. I'm assuming that you have a reasonably up
to date compiler, although it shouldn't make too much of a
difference if you don't. Oh, and by the way, you can't use the
GNU C compiler - it won't work (just thought I'd mention that.)
You will, of course, need a text editor. 'Emacs' is a very
powerful editor, and I suggest you use that.</p>

<p>This article is aimed at people who already have a reasonably
understanding of the C++ language, but want to further that
understanding by learning about OOP in C++. If you're a complete
beginner, I suggest you read one of the hundreds of C++ tutorials
lying around on the internet. A good place to start would be <a
href="http://www.programmingtutorials.com/">http://www.programmingtutorials.com/</a>.Good
luck.</p>

<h3><strong>A Historical Interlude</strong></h3>

<p>Hundreds of years ago, in Britain (specifically England),
there was civil unrest. People were angry - the poor people to be
more specific. They noticed that some people were richer than
them, they did not like it. What to do about this problem? How to
keep the people happy? Religion had already gone some of the way,
but even the promise of eternal utopia if the poor behaved
themselves in life didn't seem to work. Capitalism already had
sunk its powerful jaws into the world, and a new idea was needed
to keep the masses happy. That idea became known as 'class'. The
basis was that if everyone understood their place and role in
society, they would feel secure and happy, and would not
challenge the authority. It worked. There was the upper class
(who were rich), the middle class (who were not so rich), and the
poor sods class (who could barely afford to live). Quite unfair,
but nevertheless it became reality. What has this got to do with
C++ you ask? Well in C++, all Object Orientation comes in the
form of classes. But enough of that; we're programmers, not
social scientists. </p>

<h3><strong>Data types</strong></h3>

<p>Up to this point in your use of C++, you've used only the
basic types of variables : int, float, bool, double, and so
forth. These are called simple data types. However, they are very
linear in what we can 'model' with them. Let's take an example.
Let's say we wanted to represent a real life object, say a house.
Obviously, we would have to examine the various attributes of a
house : the number of rooms it has, its street number and whether
or not it has a garden (okay, so there are more attributes, but I
won't go into them now). In C++, we could show the house like
this:</p>

<pre><strong>int</strong> number, rooms;
<strong>bool</strong> garden;</pre>

<p>And it would work fine for this particular example. But
suppose we wanted many houses? Suppose we wanted to make the
program more complicated than this? Suppose we wanted to define
our <em>own</em> data type to represent the house. C++ allows us
to do this through the use of classes.</p>

<h3><strong>Classy!</strong></h3>

<p>Continuing with our example of the house, let's have a look at
how we could 'model' a house using a C++ class:</p>

<pre>
class house
{
public:
    int number, rooms; 
	bool garden;
};

main()
{
	house my_house;
	my_house.number=40; 
	my_house.rooms=8;
	my_house.garden=1;
	return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>Let's take a look at what each line does. The second line
declares a new class and calls it 'house'. We then open the class
definition with the curly brace '{'. The next line declares that
all the 'members' (any data type that belongs to the class) that
follow it to be 'public (I'll explain what this means later). We
then go onto declare two variables of the basic type 'int'
(integer). The next statement declares the garden member to be of
type bool (booleon- either a 1 or a 0). Finally, we end the class
with closing curly brace '}' and a ;. We have now declared a new
data type or class called 'house', which we can use within our
program. To use it, we start the main() function, which is where
the execution of the program begins and ends. The first thing we
do in the function is to declare the variable my_house to be of
type house, which is the class we defined at the beginning of the
program. Now, we this variable gains new dimensions; it now has
many more attributes than a simply int or float type. From our
class definition, we gave the house class three variables :
number, rooms and garden. The variable we just declared,
my_house, has all of these attributes. In the second line of our
main function, we define the number member of the object my_house
to be of value 40. We then go onto define the values for the
other three data members of my_house, before ending the function
with the return value 0.</p>

<p>At this point, you're sitting there wondering what the big
fuss is about these classes. After all, wouldn't it be simpler to
use the non-OO method? Well, it would in this particular
instance, since we're only talking about a very small program
that does very little. However, once you start to write more and
more complicated programs, you will find not only that classes
are useful, but that they are essential. </p>

<h3><strong>Member Functions</strong></h3>

<p>It's all well and good being able to declare a some variables,
but how do we make use of them? The answer comes of course in
functions. In C++, classes can have member functions. These are
declared in a similar fashion to member variables. To illustrate
how they work, let's take an example. A square perhaps. First we
must model the data based on the attributes of a square. It has a
length, a width, and of course an area. Of course, you find the
area of a square by multiplying the length by the width. To do
this, we could use a member function:</p>

<pre>class square
{
public:
	int length, width;
<strong>	int area()
	{
		return length*width;
	}</strong>
};</pre>

<pre>main()
{
	square my_square;
	my_square.length=5;
	my_square.width=2;
	<strong>cout&lt;&lt;my_square.area();</strong>
	return 0;
}</pre>

<p>This example should output the number 10. The square class is
very similar to the house class we saw earlier. Firstly, we
declare two member variables of type int : length and width. We
then go onto declare a function, area(), which will return a int
value. You declare the function exactly as you would outside a
class. In this case, we make area() return the value of the
member variables length and width when multiplied. We then end
the class, and start with the main function, which should pretty
much explain itself. </p>

<h3><strong>Function Definitions Outside the Class Definition</strong></h3>

<p>Of course, if you had a lot of functions to put in the class,
they would all become rather messy. To overcome this, we use
something called the scope resolution operator. Let's say we
wanted to declare the area() function outside of our original
function definition. Firstly, we would declare the class square,
and in it the function area, as shown above. However, we would
not insert the function code in at this point, so the class
definition would look like this:</p>

<pre>class square
{
public:
	int length, width;
	<strong>int area();</strong>
};
</pre>

<p>To define the member function area() outside of the class
defintion, we would write this:</p>

<pre><strong>int square::area()</strong>
{
	return length*width;
}
</pre>

<p>This would produce the same output. </p>

<h3><strong>Public or Private?</strong></h3>

<p>While we're on the subject of member function definitions, you
should learn the difference between public and private members of
a class. Members that are declared to be public can be accessed
from any function within the entire program. The simplest way to
explain is with an example. Suppose we declared the class square
just like it was above, and tried to access the length variable
from within the function main, which is not a member function of
the class:</p>

<pre>main()
{
	sqaure my_square;
	my_square.length=2;
	cout&lt;&lt;my_square.length;
	return 0;
}

</pre>

<p>The compiler would have no problem with this, and would output
the value 2. However, let's say we change the square class so it
looked like this, and all the members were private:</p>

<pre>class square
{
<strong>private:</strong>
	int length, width;
	int area();
};</pre>

<p>If we tried to run the function main() shown above, the
compiler would generate an error. Private members can only be
accessed through member functions.</p>

<h3><strong>Class Constructors</strong></h3>

<p>It gets a bit tedious declaring the value of each member
variable of a class using the method shown below:</p>

<pre>main()
{
	sqaure my_square;
	my_square.length=2
	my_square.width=3
}
</pre>

<p>For each member of mysquare, we have to seperately declare and
initialize its value. Of course, not only is this tedious, but
it's also easy to overlook the initialization of each member,
particularly when your classes become more complex. One way
around this is to use a class constructor. A class constructor is
a function that is initialized whenever the class is used:</p>

<pre>class square
{
public:
	int length, width;
<strong>	square(int length1, int width1)
	{
		length=length1;
		width=width1;
	}</strong>
	int area()
	{
		return length*width;
	}
};

main()
{
	<strong>square my_square(5, 2);</strong>
	cout&lt;&lt;my_square.area();
	return 0;
}
	</pre>

<p>This would produce the output 10. Firstly, we declare the
class constructor by giving it the same name as the class itself.
&gt;From now on, this function will execute itself whenever the
class is used. We declare it so that it takes two values, both of
type int. The next change comes in the function main(). Whenever
we delcare an object to be of type square, we add a function
definition. In this case, we gave the variables length1 and
length2 the values 5 and 2. The constructor then takes these two
variables, and assigns their values to the member variables
length and width, and, as they say, the rest writes itself.</p>

<h3><strong>Arrays and Classes</strong></h3>

<p>It goes without saying that you can use arrays with classes.
Obviously, this opens up scope for far declaring far more
variables in a shorter time. There isn't a huge amount to go
through on this subject, so let's take a simple example:</p>

<pre>class person
{
public:
	int age, house_number;
};

main()
{
	<strong>person alex[5];</strong>
	<strong>for(int x(0); x&lt;5; x++)</strong>
	<strong>{
		alex[x].age=x;
		alex[x].house_number=x;
		cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Age is &quot;&lt;&lt;alex[x].age&lt;&lt;endl
			&lt;&lt;&quot;House number is &quot;&lt;&lt;alex[x].house_number&lt;&lt;endl;
	}</strong>
	return 0;
}

</pre>

<p>There's nothing really complicated within this example, so I
won't go through it. Obviously, you can do a lot more with
arrays, and it doesn't take a genius to work out other ways to
use them.</p>

<h3><strong>In closing</strong></h3>

<p>Well that's all for this month. If I get a chance, next week
I'll continue this very topic, and go further into OOP
programming with C++ to look at ideas such as pointers, class
desctructors, inheritance and organizing your program code into
files. Happy programming!</p>
