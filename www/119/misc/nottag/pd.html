Another thing, pointed out in my favorite book <em> Natural Capitalism </em>
(<a href="http://www.natcap.org"
	>http://www.natcap.org</a>, entire text online), is that
environmental impact is ignored because doesn't appear on corporate
balance sheets or tax forms, so the cost is treated as zero even though
it's enormous.  Trees are cut down because they're in the way, but is the
$2 million benefit of a shopping center really more than the long-term
benefit of oxygen, ecosystem nutrition, wood production, and carbon
sequestering, none of which we can produce by artificial means?  Same for
polluting rivers, etc.

Err, well - to the company receiving the $2M benefit, it certainly is.
They're stealing the immeasurable benefit of the trees from the public at
large, and putting the $2M into their own pockets; both the cost and the
loss to them personally is minimal - and the public doesn't get to say
anything about it. So, why wouldn't they steal it? There's no law
against it - at least nothing enforcible.

It <em>might</em> be - the idea sounded good to me - but it doesn't seem to be
working yet, at least not on a large scale. Essentially, you're talking
about a method that's supposed to be more effective, in business terms,
than the current sales-based system - <em>but</em>, and this is a big one, it
presumes accounting that includes the cost of the natural resources.
Which is not what's done now, and which is why the leasing arrangements
of that type haven't sprung up all over the place and supplanted the
current system. I'm a big fan of Lovins and Hawken (thanks to you), but
the penetration of their ideas has been very, very slow. Dammit.

These are both the same problem, of which you speak. "Externalizing" the
environmental cost, as Hawken puts it. Externalizing it onto everybody,
in fact, while the polluter laughs all the way to the bank. It's
difficult to change the paradigm, but if we remember the goal we might
have a chance. If we forget it or give up, we definitely won't.

Or, perhaps, making people aware that they <em>own</em> these resources -
forests, lakes, the air... "good stewardship" is a concept that goes deep
in this culture, if it can only be coupled to these things via that

If the mining
companies in Montana had to pay the full cost of restoration up front,
or Hanford's nuclear waste in my own backyard, maybe they'd think twice
about doing their project at all. Especially if they could find no
insurance company willing to write a bond for the amount. No more
companies declaring bankrupcy and getting off scot-free. The cost would
be passed on to the public, of course, and they would make their
purchasing decisions accordingly. Maybe a PC would cost $100,000 for all
the metal in it. Maybe that's not necessarily a bad thing. Organic
farmers were laughed at for thirty years, but now there are organic
supermarkets doing a very good business.

I think - um, actually, I <em>know</em> - that there are
environmentally-responsible ways to mine iron. A bit less profitable,
certainly, but not a lot - and perhaps more profitable once the
companies have financial incentive to apply brainpower to it (that's
what NatCap says, and thought experiments that I can run in my head
totally agree; the synergy of having the energy of nature available to
you as you work can't help <em>but</em> improve your end results.) Reserving
the top soil as you strip-mine, then creating a lake in the pit and a
forest on the hill of the material you've dug up is not some huge
project for people who are doing all that earth-moving in the first
place - and they could harvest the resulting timber in the future (or
sell the rights to another company who'd do it.) Tax breaks for creating
a new oxygen source and providing a recreation area for the local
community, water rights on the new lake (perhaps selling licensing for
the marinas, buying up the surrounding property because the real estate
in the area is going to go up due to the lake/forest)... there's
millions of ways to make a profit out of the situation <em>and</em> serve the
world. I don't buy the current insanity of "you have to rape the world
to make a profit."

Depends on the amount of repayments. Seems to be around 22.9% APR, and
it seems they're not calling it 'hire purchase' anymore, it's an
'appliance loan' (administered by the Irish branch of the Bank of
Scotland). Have a look for yourself:

22.9% interest?  That's even worse than putting it on a credit card.
The maximum credit cards can charge here is 18%.  But if they're talking
loans and APR, that's different than I was talking about.  I was talking
about something more like a subscription.

I don't have a credit card, so I can't say for sure, but I think that
rate is roughly on par with credit card charges here. I did mention that
it was hire purchase, I assumed you knew what that meant, though I will
admit I was wrong to say "they're not calling it 'hire purchase'
anymore", it quite simply <em>is</em> a loan.

ISTR reading the fine print on one of the credit card offer mailings I
received not too long ago, and noticed that the rate was somewhere
around 22%, so I don't think that the 18% rate is universally applicable
in the U.S. anymore either.

Well, except his business interests and neoconservatism are two
different things.  His financial and oil interests (and Cheney's) are
basically an old-boys' network that has stayed the same for decades.
Neoconservatism's "bring democracy to the world" and "freedom is on the
march" seem to have conveniently dovetailed with their interests.  Bush
also seems to have undergone a conversion to neoconservatism after
9/11.  Before, he was focusing on domestic affairs (and removing foreign

I understand in Europe you rent real estate but hire
everything else.  So I translated 'hire' to 'rent' and then to 'lease'.
Leasing is the same as renting but with a long-term contract.  So you
rent a car by the day but lease it for six months.  Or you lease an
apartment for a year, then it becomes a month-to-month rental (and the
landlord can raise the rent).  With products you usually have the option
to buy it for the remaining purchase price ("rent to own"), but the
price is high.  The kind of lease I'm talking about is basically a
subscription.  There may be a "rent to own" option but it would defeat
the purpose if that was emphasized.  I don't know what a 'hire purchase'
is, but I guess you mean buying something with a financing plan, like a
home mortgage.

Kinda. It's kind-of like a 'rent-to-own' scheme, except there are
specific laws that apply. IIRC (and it's been 8 years since business

23% interest, ouch.  Here the unscrupulous cards charge 18%, but the
better cards are 6.9%.   When I was in Russia in 1996, interest was 10%
per <em>month</em>.  And when the banks were closed for lunch, you changed
money with the tough guy standing in front of the bank with a stack of
$100 bills in his hand.  Because nobody kept their savings in rubles,
inflation was too high.  But you had to buy things in rubles.  I always
went into the bank because it had a better exchange rate, but my Russian
friend went to the guy in front of the bank to show that he was rich
enough not to care about a few extra dollars.  I always wondered how
these money changers could do it every day without getting mugged, but I
guess guys who wear dark sunglasses don't worry about things like that.
And he was wearing dark sunglasses, as was my friend.  When you go into
a bank, a guard meets you at the door and asks what you want, then lets
you in one at a time.  I have no idea if it's still like that.  My

More stories.  In 1998 he was living in Germany and I went to visit.
One weekend he wanted to see a girl in Liege.  I'd convinced him to be a
cheapskate, so we made it from Duesseldorf to Liege and back for a
ridiculously low $12 each.  We had a weekend railpass and went to
Aachen.  It was $50 to Liege so I asked for the nearest stop in Belgium
(Verviers) but that was still almost $50.   (Oops, I pronounced it
"Ver-VERSS".  She corrected it "Fer-VYAY".)  I asked if we can walk
across the border and she said no.  I asked why, is it illegal?  She
said you just can't, and pointed us to a local bus.  The bus went to
Eupen.  I was expecting a passport check and a sharp differentiation,
but it was just the outskirts of one small town merging into another
small town on a narrow, windy, hilly road.  Gradually the ordinary signs
turned from German to French, but the luxury signs (cars and real
estate) remained German.  At the bushof there was a problem with our
ticket.  My French was minimal; my friend's was nonexistent.  I asked,
"Sprechen Sie Deutsch?"  The driver said, "Seulement francais."  So we
were shouting at the neighboring driver to translate.  "The driver said
this ticket was good all the way to Liege.  ---Who said that?  ---The
driver from Aachen."  He said "Aachen!" dismissively, as in "Those
Germans!", but stopped hassling us.  At Verviers we transferred again to
Liege.  It was 8pm and there was a hotel across the street, but my
friend said we'd find something better and we went into a bar.  First I
experienced the ATM.  The smallest amount was 100 franks.  I had no idea
how much that was but the big number was scary.  I finally assumed that
if that was the smallest amount, it must be around $20.  It turned out
to be $33.  We went into the bar.  The bartender spoke only French.  My
French is just enough to order a beer, so we drew pictures on napkins
for a conversation.  He put on cowboy music to make us feel at home!
I'm American but I don't like country music.  My friend is Russian but
he likes to pretend he's  American so he gets treated better.  So the
bartender got us both wrong.  I bet he never knew.  My friend called the
girl and found out she's working in Brussels now (oh no!) but she's in
Liege this weekend visiting her parents (yes!).  We arrange to meet the
next day.  I get more and more paranoid about finding a hotel that's not
full, so at 11pm I force my friend out of the bar.  We walk around
looking for a place.  Being a yank I assume there'll be motels
everywhere.  Not in Liege.  We walk for three hours and don't see
anything except a Holiday Inn (too expensive).  Finally we come across
an outdoor map and discover there's only three hotels/hostels in the
city.  So we return to the original hotel at 3am and check in.  On the
way we see a sign for a town called Huy.  We took a picture of it
because huy means penis in Russian.

Or a printer with a guaranteed upgrade every year?  Then the
manufacturer would have an incentive to make it long-lasting and with
recyclable parts, to cut down their expenses.  If you buy an appliance and
it falls apart or was a bad technological choice, it's your problem and
the manufacturer can ignore it (and sell you a new one).  But if you lease
an appliance and it falls apart, it's their problem.  I don't quite buy
this leasing argument completely coz I don't see how to prevent price
gouging; i.e., I've seen cars and computers leased for more than they
would cost to buy, but I assume the right company could come up with an
attractive lease.

That example is terrible, as it underlines exactly why people seek to
sell things that could be leased, and I fail to see how leasing
something could ever cost <em>less</em> than buying it outright.

A small unit costs $120.  The initial working goal is a
rate that equals the purchase price over the lifetime use of the
product.  $2/month is likely not profitable, but maybe $5 is.  If the
person only needs it for a few months and has a return-anytime lease,
they're obviously ahead, and the company can redeploy the unit
elsewhere.  The person doesn't have to go to the trouble of selling or
disposing it.   But say the person keeps it more than two years, they'd
lose.  That's what happened in the 60s and 70s in the US with
telephones, people leased them for ever and ended up paying several
hundred dollars for them.  But they got a new one free if it broke.

Say
the company not agrees not only to replace a broken air conditioner for
free, but to give you an upgrade to the latest model every two years.
If you're the type who buys one air conditioner and runs it into the
ground over twenty years until even duct tape won't hold it together,
you won't be interested.  But say you're the type who replaces stuff
every two years anyway like some people do with cars, then you won't
have a net loss even the third or fourth year.  And you'll gain a bit by
keeping the money you would have spent up front in a savings account.

Now say the new model uses half the electricity of the old one.  Wow,
your expenses go way down.  No biggie if you would have bought a new one
anyway, but a big gain if you wouldn't.  Plus you don't have to get rid
of that old air conditioner: convenience for you, and the fish will
breathe easier without that toxic waste.  The company knows it will get
the unit back eventually, in two years maximum, so they have an
incentive to make the parts long-lasting and reusable in their new
designs.  Their engineers certainly know how to do this better than you
do.  And if they were somehow paying for the energy cost too (e.g., if
they were providing a "cooling service" rather than a product), they'd
have an incentive to keep that down as well.  So there are a lot of
variables involved, which would make some products more attractive for
leasing than others.  A company that does this would obviously have a
small niche at first, but if they had a superior service (we can't say
"product") they might find it turning into a big niche as demand rose.
The Starbucks factor.

otherwise they should not do it at all), their profit would be at least
as high as selling said commodities (which would be crap quality), so
the shareholders would be happy.  Then they could start designing a
second produt to lease....

Obviously there are problems, like if it's stolen or your house burns
down and you have to pay for all the appliances.  Or if the company is
not as benign as it seems and gives you a WinPrinter for an upgrade.
(But then you'll just tell them where they can stick their printer.)  Or
if they're price gouging for the toner.  (But printer companies don't do
that, do they?)  But these can all be worked out for the right product
with the right plan and some kind of insurance.

A major part of the book talks about eliminating waste, which makes sense
if you view it as nonperforming assets.  He gives examples of companies
and individuals cutting down waste by 50% in a year by redesigning their
products/lifestyles, and it's a win-win situation.  E.g., a change in
manufacturing process eliminates production of a toxic byproduct; this
reduces expenses.  The new process creates another byproduct that can be
fashioned into another product and sold, so profits go up.  Things like
that.  Much is possible if you base your business plan on minimizing
waste, which is really lost profits.  On a personal level, adding energy
efficiency to a house drives up the cost but only to a point.  When you
get to the point that you can eliminate a heater or air conditioner,
suddenly expenses go way down.  The purchase price is only 10% or less of
the TCO of an appliance; 90% is the energy cost to run it over the years.
Likewise, if you get a $100 raise or cut your expenses by $100, the net
result is the same, but the latter is easier and under your control,
whereas the former requires the cooperation of others.

Actually, it's <em>not</em> the same. Because of taxes, you have to get a raise
larger than $100 to put an extra $100 in your pocket, whereas if you
save $100, that's $100 you have free and clear.

Heh. My raise was supposed to come through this week, but the idiots who
do the payroll didn't have the manager around to hold their hands, so I
only got paid the old rate (they should've been able to tell I should've
been paid at a higher rate because I was paid a related bonus). But at
least I got paid <em>something</em>, which is more than can be said for a few
people. (Oh, and my raise is ~100 euros

Better than my friend got.  He was hired for a warehouse job at $10/hour
but trusted them too much and didn't get the rate in writing.  For several
weeks he thought his paycheck was low but figured it was all the
deductions.  He couldn't check his past timesheets because they refused to
give them to you.  Finally he added it up and realized he was getting
$8/hour.  He called the payroll department (at some headquarters in a land
far, far away) and they said everyone with that job was paid $8 and it
couldn't be changed.  Finally he forced his manager to remember he had
agreed to $10 in the interview, which two other interviewers had
witnesses.  Then it was another several weeks to get the payroll
department to adjust the rate.  Then <em>another</em> several weeks of stalling
to get his back pay, which I don't know if he ever did get before he quit.
Then the manager threatened to hold his last check for.. I don't
remember, not give notice probably, but that's highly illegal so he was
able to talk them into giving him it pretty easily.  Then he met a Labor
and Industries rep who said he could look into the case, but he sent him
the info and the guy said there wasn't enough evidence to make a case.

As many have pointed out, the public just doesn't see the public domain as
valuable.  I don't think this is as much about the piracy wars as the fact
that the proponents of "intellectual property" have really managed to
convince the public that it's the same as physical property.  A lot of it
may just be because of the word "property".

The rich in this country, at least, have considered IP to be one of the
best all-around investments for a long time. There are few or no
production costs, there's nothing to wear out - and the yield, <em>ceteris
paribus</em>, is damn near infinite if you own the thing. It's no wonder
that they're fighting so hard to maintain the legal fable that allows it
to exist in its present form.
