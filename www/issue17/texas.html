      <h1>Linux Installation Project</h1>

      <p>
	It all started with a simple question: `Why don't we install
	Linux at all our meetings instead of at only some of them?'
	The <a href="http://www.ntlug.org/">North Texas Linux Users
	Group</a> had been in existence for only about five months,
	and we wanted to make sure to spread the word in North Texas
	about Linux. We wanted to educate the computing public in our
	area about Linux, but we also wanted to let experienced
	computer users know that Linux could handle anything they
	threw at it.

      <p>
	After meeting at Texas Christian University for our first few
	meetings, we signed a contract with the <a
	href="http://www.dfwxchange.com/dfwx.nsf/?Open">DFWXchange</a> that enabled NTLUG
	to meet at the <a href="http://www.infomartusa.com">Dallas
	Infomart</a>. The DFWXchange is an umbrella organization that
	allows Dallas-Fort Worth users groups to meet at the Infomart
	for free, with all costs being absorbed by the many commercial
	vendors who also meet at the Infomart during the Super Satuday
	Sale. So every month between 3,000 and 5,000 computer users
	from the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex converge on the
	Infomart---the premier meeting facility in the Southwest
	devoted exclusively to computer and technology events and
	organziations---to participate in users groups meetings and to
	take advantage of some really good prices on computer-related
	hardware. It's a big party.

      <p>
	It didn't take long for the NTLUG leadership to realize that
	we had stumbled upon a great opportunity: we wanted to let
	computer users in our area know about Linux, and we were now
	meeting every month in a facility filled with thousands of
	potential Linux converts. Our solution was to start the
	<b>Linux Installation Project</b>, which we call the
	<b>LIP</b>.

      <p>
	The goal of <b>LIP</b> is simply to install Linux on as many
	computers as possible. Those of us who participate in this
	project month-to-month have discovered that the very best way
	to advocate the use of Linux is to make it easy and painless
	for the unconverted to do just that: namely, run Linux on
	their computer of choice. In other words, Linux is its own
	best advocate. After a few weeks without a crash, most people
	say goodbye to Windows 95 with zealous enthusiasm.  We like to
	think of <b>LIP</b> as an ongoing Linux Installation Festival
	that allows us to convert computer users to Linux one at a
	time.

      <p>
	The first step in establishing <b>LIP</b> as a well-run,
	consistent endeavor was to find someone to lead the
	effort. NTLUG is fortunate to have a technologically advanced
	membership, and it was fairly easy to find someone to lead the
	<b>LIP</b>; in fact, we found two such people: Mike Dunn and
	Bill Petersen, both of whom are experienced Unix and Linux
	Sysadmins. Under their guidance, and due to the generosity of
	NTLUG members, NTLUG's <b>LIP</b> has solicited and organized
	enough computer hardware to perform up to many simultaneous
	installations of Linux by all the usual methods, although
	we've found that cdrom installations are usually the most
	trouble free.

      <p>
	The word has now spread in and around the Dallas-Fort Worth
	Metroplex---from schools and universities to computer vendors
	and other users groups---that NTLUG's <b>LIP</b> is the place
	to go for a painless installation of Linux onto PCs, laptops,
	servers, and even Alpha platforms. We have expanded our
	efforts at the <b>LIP</b> booth to include Linux advocacy,
	advertisement for Linux vendors who supply us with materials,
	the sale of Linux CDs (thanks to Bradley Glonka at <a
	href="http://www.lsl.com/">Linux Systems Labs</a>), and even
	basic Linux system administration and maintenance. We also
	spend a lot of time explaining to the uninitiated masses what
	makes Linux <b><i>free</i></b> and what makes it so much fun.

      <p>
	While we have been happy with the results so far, the
	<b>LIP</b> has more work to do. We want to expand our sales
	efforts to include other kinds of Linux merchandise (the sales
	of which go to support NTLUG and <b>LIP</b>), and we'd also
	like to expand our hardware assets to enable more simultaneous
	installations. Finally, we also want to develop our users
	group assets to such an extent that we can go to other
	DFW-area computer events and setup Linux installation and
	advocacy booths. NTLUG's approach to the Linux Installation
	Project can be summed up in the phrase: "Linux is free. Life
	is good."

      <p>
	If you want to learn more about the North Texas Linux Users
	Group or our Linux Installation Project, or if you're a Linux
	Users Group and would like to talk about setting up your own
	local version of <b>LIP</b>, please visit the <a
	href="http://www.ntlug.org/">NTLUG</a> website or contact me
	at <i><a
	href="mailto:kclark@computek.net">kclark@computek.net</a></i>.
	
      <p>
	Finally, I would be guilty of ingratitude if I did not thank
	the following people and organizations that have made the
	<b>LIP</b> possible. Please forgive me if I've forgotten
	anyone. It's just about impossible not to meet great people
	when you work with Linux.
