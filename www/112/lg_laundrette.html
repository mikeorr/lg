<p align="center">...............</p>
<P>
Hmmm, seems I've fallen behind the times...
</P>
<P>
So, I'm sitting here in my computer store, doing business. A client
comes in - one of those good ones, you can see right away that if he
buys anything, it'll be a lot, and expensive. In other words, quality.
He's got all the accessories, too - the hat, the coat, the high-priced
tie, the Armani suit... He's walking around, looking at stuff, flashing
his Parker, checking his list.
</P>
<P>
I ask him if I can help in any way.
</P>
<P>
Client: Certainly, if it's not a bother. I'm looking for a home
computer, something fairly speedy.
</P>
<P>
Me: - No problem! I see you have a list, so you already know the general
configuration?
</P>
<P>
C: - Yes, I was advised to get an AMD64+...
</P>
<P>
(Oh, sure - I know <EM>all</EM> about these "advisors"...)
</P>
<P>
Me: Actually, I'd wait a bit on buying that particular CPU, at least for
now.
</P>
<P>
C: Oh? Why?
</P>
<P>
(Well, hell. Now I'm got to explain CPU architecture...)
</P>
<P>
Me: Well, you see, it's a brand new architecture, and Wind0ws has not
yet been fully developed for it.
</P>
<P>
C: And why do I need Wind0ws?
</P>
<P>
(Holy crap... Another clueless lame-o! Now I've got to explain Wind0ws!)
</P>
<P>
Me: You see, for a computer to work, you need an operating system, and
the one for this processor is still being developed.
<p>
C: So?
<p>
Me: Well, Wind0ws is the operating system...
<p>
C: Young man! You might as well call <EM>DOS</EM> an operating system! (I go
into a slight state of shock) Wind0ws is no operating system - it's a
commercial result of Bill Gates' activity (I can feel myself turning to
stone). Now, <EM>Linux</EM> is a real operating system! (I go into total
catatonia)
<p>
C (interested): So, you have Wind0ws installed here?
</P>
<P>
I nod slowly.
</P>
<P>
- No, really?
</P>
<P>
He walks over to the monitor and looks at it.
</P>
<P>
C: - Hmm. <em>  Seemed  </em> like decent people, at first sight...
</P>
<P>
He stays silent for about a half a minute, and then delivers the killing
blow:
</P>
<P>
C: - <em>Tell me, please... why would I entrust the installation of complex
and expensive equipment to DOS-using, pingless lamers who don't know and
don't <strong> care</strong> to know about anything except Wind0ws?</em>
</P>
<P>
Turns around and walks out.

I'd imagine that they did - but spammers commonly misppel keywords such
as "degrees" in hopes of foiling spam blockers. Not that it helped them;
I never saw the thing (presumably, it got processed and dumped with the
rest of my spambucket during my weekly cleaning, a couple of hours ago.)

one just caught me in a grumpy mood...

I've been writing to a retired english teacher and she loves correcting my

I keep my degrees in a shoe box... under my desk...  I've even forgotten what

By the way Urdu and Hindustani were almost the same language until around
Partition (the division of British India into India and Pakistan). At that
point religious fanatics decided to create one language called
Hindi
(supplanting an earlier language of the same name) which adopted more and
more Sanskrit words and is the language spoken on India(n) Radio and TV,
and another language called
Urdu
which adopted more and more Persian words and is the language spoken on
Pakistani Radio and TV.

Thanks, Mike! I don't know if I'll make it down there this time, but
it's a good pointer for future reference. The Vietnamese place I went to
last night definitely hit all the high marks for me - and there was a
Vietnamese supermarket in the same shopping mall, so there was much
happy sighing and many satisfied munching noises. I was also looking for
the latches used to attach these places to the ground, on the theory
that I could perhaps carry them away with me to St. Augustine (they'd be
a little bulky in the luggage, and the airlines would probably get
snotty about weight and size limits, but we all have our crosses to

Since I'm still in an area where there are definite signs of
civilization (Baltimore), last night's culinary adventure was Chinese.

<EM>nothing</EM> on their menu that is commonplace. I don't think they even
<em> have  </em> sweet-and-sour whatever or chop suey anything, and would probably

The meal, all the better for being shared with one of my best friends,
consisted of "Jellyfish with Pickle and Red Vinegar", "Clams with Ground
Pork and Onion", "Snow Pea Greens with Roasted Garlic", and, I kid you
not, "Froggy with X. O. Sauce", all washed down with pu'u-er tea (which
I'd never heard of before but enjoyed) and finished off with a dessert
soup.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The jellyfish was somewhat surprising, both in its texture (rather firm
and even "crisp", like a good pickle) and its subtle but definite
flavor; the "Pickle" that came with it turned out to be mildly pickled
julienned cucumbers, carrots, and some sort of squash. The snow pea
greens, of which both I and my friend are quite enamored, are actually
the greens - not the snow peas thomselves, as some might expect - and
had a very delicate flavor, nicely enhanced by nut-brown roasted garlic
cloves.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The clams... it would take a more experienced food writer than me to do
justice to their description. Suffice it to say that you end up licking
the shells to make sure you get every last trace of the sauce, and Some
People put down their chopsticks and use a spoon (!) to get every last
bit off the plate. I forgave her, since pregnant women must be humored.
Besides, she has a devastating pout - quivering lower lip and
everything - and is not afraid to use it.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The "Froggy" turned out to be a bunch of, well, froggy drumsticks. Good,
although a little too bland to be on par with the other dishes and just
a little too fiddly (those are <em>  tiny  </em> little bones!) for my tastes. They
made a good vehicle for the excellent sauce - which, as my friend
commented, is more than some people have as a mission in life.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
We had just enough room left for a few spoonfuls of the dessert soup,
which was a sweet tapioca-based concoction. It was fine, but did not
cause either one of to go into transports of ecstasy (which was OK,
since we were both a little too tired to be transported anywhere.)

All in all, <EM>quite</EM> the memorable meal.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Would you believe that we originally stumbled on this place by accident?
It looked like a slightly seedy "ballroom"-type of Chinese restaurant,
probably nothing special... I plan to return to worship at the shrine of
its food whenever I visit Baltimore.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Tomorrow, New York - and dinner at the Harvard Club. Due to a number of
interesting reasons (long story), I shall be wearing a Roman toga and
lounging on a couch in high Roman tradition - along with six or seven
similarly-attired people. The meal will be something very close to the
cuisine of pre-Octavian Rome, and should be quite interesting. We'll be
off in a section which has been reserved for us; the other patrons may
stare but will not actually have to rub shoulders with the crazies.
</STRONG></P>

Jan 19 03:14:26 &lt;okopnik&gt;       Anyone?
Jan 19 03:14:33 &lt;okopnik&gt;       Hmm.
Jan 19 03:14:42 &lt;editorgal&gt;     yo
Jan 19 03:14:46 *       editorgal hugs ben
Jan 19 03:14:53 &lt;okopnik&gt;       Mmmmm!
Jan 19 03:15:02 *       okopnik hugs Heather back
Jan 19 03:15:08 &lt;okopnik&gt;       *lots of smiles*
Jan 19 03:15:13 &lt;editorgal&gt;     it really should be a bigger hug than that
Jan 19 03:15:23 &lt;okopnik&gt;       GREAT BIG HUG
Jan 19 03:15:35 &lt;editorgal&gt;     given the rough porcupine like beast I was being when you were in here before
Jan 19 03:15:56 &lt;okopnik&gt;       Aww, you were OK.
Jan 19 03:16:09 &lt;okopnik&gt;       Remember what I said in email?
Jan 19 03:16:56 &lt;okopnik&gt;       If I didn't realize that my interaction with my
friends is going to be sometimes up and sometimes down, what the hell kind of friend would I be?
Jan 19 03:17:16 *       editorgal smiles
Jan 19 03:17:33 &lt;editorgal&gt;     well in 20/20 hindsight I did pretty good
Jan 19 03:17:42 &lt;editorgal&gt;     I didn't completely shrivel like a raisin

   Jan 06 20:41:17 &lt;jimregan&gt; Script-fu your way out of those tricky

   Jan 06 20:41:20 &lt;editorgal&gt; "added" script-fu was python support.
   Jan 06 20:41:22 &lt;jimregan&gt; It slices! It dices!
   Jan 06 20:41:26 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah.
   Jan 06 20:41:37 &lt;editorgal&gt; it makes juliene fonts. yeah
   Jan 06 20:41:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; Saw that in the pretty pretty Gimp 2 that

   Jan 06 20:47:25 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; jimregan: Coffee, please.

   Jan 06 20:48:27 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; What is this, Starbucks? You know I
   don't have anything, bar normal coffee. :P
   Jan 06 20:48:32 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Yeesh. Can't get the staff.
   Jan 06 20:48:39 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 06 20:49:01 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I'd try propping up the bar, but I'm too
   short.
   Jan 06 20:49:02 * jimregan passes over what passes for normal coffee
   in Thomas's twisted worldview
   Jan 06 20:49:15 * jimregan takes off the lead gloves
   Jan 06 20:49:17 * thomas_adam sips through a mobius straw.
   Jan 06 20:52:36 &lt;jimregan&gt; I gotta go. Heather, I leave the bar in
   your hands.
   Jan 06 20:52:50 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; jimregan: Thanks, Jim. Toodles.
   Jan 06 20:52:50 --- You are now known as jimregan_away
   Jan 06 20:52:54 &lt;editorgal&gt; right, he doesn't know what he's in for...
   Jan 06 20:53:12 * thomas_adam pours all the alcohol away, and serves
   nothing but coffee.
   Jan 06 20:53:15 &lt;jimregan_away&gt; Hey... at least wait until I've gone
   through the door
   Jan 06 20:53:17 &lt;editorgal&gt; \o/
   Jan 06 20:53:22 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; jimregan_away: Sssssh -- you're not
   here. :P
   Jan 06 20:53:28 &lt;jimregan_away&gt; Have fun with the safe...
   Jan 06 20:53:30 * editorgal has made a pot extra strong
   Jan 06 20:53:38 &lt;jimregan_away&gt; where I keep the 'good' stuff

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 07 01:52:02 &lt;editorgal&gt; hey jimmy, I've got some of the parts
   toward my plan for next month's cover art
   Jan 07 01:52:09 &lt;jimregan&gt; Cool
   Jan 07 01:52:21 &lt;editorgal&gt; my teddybear, bear, has agreed to be a
   model for xteddy
   Jan 07 01:52:31 &lt;editorgal&gt; since he's fairly similar of form
   Jan 07 01:52:47 &lt;editorgal&gt; I want to come up with a bio for bear
   Jan 07 01:52:57 &lt;jimregan&gt; "You're beautiful dahling. Tease the
   camera"
   Jan 07 01:53:04 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)))
   Jan 07 01:53:07 &lt;editorgal&gt; I've the plans for the little newspaper
   Jan 07 01:53:14 &lt;editorgal&gt; * bear smiles :)
   Jan 07 01:53:30 &lt;editorgal&gt; * bear waves hi hi hi
   Jan 07 01:53:47 * jimregan waves back
   Jan 07 01:54:05 &lt;jimregan&gt; (I'm only in a single 'hi' mood though.
   Sorry 'bout that)
   Jan 07 01:54:06 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :)
   Jan 07 01:54:08 &lt;editorgal&gt; I've a plan for a teacup but it occurs to
   me I still have some fimo left
   Jan 07 01:54:29 &lt;editorgal&gt; I might just make him his own teacup and
   put something LG lookin' on it
   Jan 07 01:55:01 &lt;jimregan&gt; Huh? Potentially lethal liquid concoction?
   Possibly toxic?
   Jan 07 01:55:26 &lt;jimregan&gt; Guaranteed to make you either extremely
   drunk or extremely knurd?
   Jan 07 01:55:45 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh I dunno
   Jan 07 01:55:51 &lt;editorgal&gt; what would a teddybear drink?
   Jan 07 01:56:03 * jimregan tries to remember the words
   Jan 07 01:56:14 &lt;jimregan&gt; c/~ if you go down to the woods today...
   Jan 07 01:56:30 * thomas_adam sings along.
   Jan 07 01:56:38 &lt;editorgal&gt; teddybear's picnic!
   Jan 07 01:56:42 &lt;editorgal&gt; * bear sings along
   Jan 07 01:56:43 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 07 01:56:53 * editorgal pats bear
   Jan 07 01:57:21 * editorgal avoids singing ewoks picnic til the
   original is done ;P
   Jan 07 01:58:22 &lt;jimregan&gt; Um... I only know a few of the words.
   Jan 07 01:58:33 * thomas_adam knows it all. :))
   Jan 07 01:58:33 &lt;jimregan&gt; The last time I heard that, I was 9 or 10
   Jan 07 01:59:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; I could google, but I'm in a nihilistic
   mood, so I'm listening to Chimaira instead :-P
   Jan 07 01:59:02 * editorgal grins as thomas leads
   Jan 07 02:01:56 &lt;jimregan&gt;
   http://duchessathome.com/childrensongs/teddybearspicnic.html
   Jan 07 02:03:46 &lt;jimregan&gt; "See them gaily gad about": that line would
   suggest that teddy bears drink tea.
   Jan 07 02:04:04 &lt;jimregan&gt; With a dash of milk, one lump or two
   depends on the bear
   Jan 07 02:04:09 &lt;editorgal&gt; c/~ furry short barbarians, you'd best
   beware of them, cuz they're having quite a time today...
   Jan 07 02:04:14 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 07 02:04:53 &lt;editorgal&gt; really really big bears might need less
   sugar, they're already sweeter.
   Jan 07 02:07:18 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :)
   Jan 07 02:07:26 --- thomas_adam removes channel operator status from
   thomas_adam
   Jan 07 02:13:50 &lt;editorgal&gt; c/~ the ewoks will be free... because
   they're determined little teddy bears...
   Jan 07 02:14:02 &lt;editorgal&gt; * bear giggles

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 08 02:03:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'm sure you'll get it sorted
   Jan 08 02:04:28 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Though I've had the universe move in
   strange ways for me today, so I might just be overly positive)
   Jan 08 02:05:11 &lt;editorgal&gt; thanks
   Jan 08 02:05:18 &lt;editorgal&gt; it's been kind of strange for me too
   Jan 08 02:05:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; How so?
   Jan 08 02:06:23 &lt;editorgal&gt; I saw a rainbow
   Jan 08 02:06:30 &lt;jimregan&gt; ?
   Jan 08 02:06:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hmm... OK... you're in California, not
   Ireland
   Jan 08 02:07:09 &lt;editorgal&gt; when among my errands I bought a cellphone
   battery, the store clerk (who was indian) gave me a very sincere ~10m
   chatter about how god looks out for us, and the soul is eternal
   Jan 08 02:07:24 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 08 02:07:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; (I finished reading another Paulo Coelho
   book today, so I got basically the same thing :)
   Jan 08 02:09:20 &lt;jimregan&gt; It turns out that Beata and I ended up
   giving each other the same present twice.
   Jan 08 02:10:34 &lt;jimregan&gt; When she said I made one of her dreams come
   true, I was like... "OK". Then today, blam!
   Jan 08 02:14:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; When I was reading that book, there was
   something I desperately want to talk about with someone - anyone - but
   then, out of nowhere, another thought swept in and said "No, you can't
   talk about this"
   Jan 08 02:15:42 &lt;jimregan&gt; Blam. I had a secret. I can still have
   them! I'm not empty handed.
   Jan 08 02:19:27 * jimregan pours a vodka
   Jan 08 02:19:38 * jimregan swirls the glass to watch the ripples
   Jan 08 02:21:43 &lt;editorgal&gt; heh
   Jan 08 02:23:08 &lt;jimregan&gt; Makes me reevaluate that "her boyfriend's
   days are numbered" crap I was spewing last month, safe in the
   knowledge I wasn't really going to pursue her anyway
   Jan 08 02:26:40 &lt;jimregan&gt; Now... I just wish her well.
   Jan 08 02:29:24 &lt;jimregan&gt; Anyways, I gotta get up in the morning. All
   the best.

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 14 07:15:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; So... what did Santa bring?
   Jan 14 07:17:01 &lt;editorgal&gt; um
   Jan 14 07:17:06 &lt;editorgal&gt; not much
   Jan 14 07:17:19 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hee hee. Best presents I got this year were
   from foreigners I didn't even know 4 months ago
   Jan 14 07:17:24 &lt;editorgal&gt; a jar that looks like sweets, containing
   smaller jars that look like sweets
   Jan 14 07:17:31 &lt;editorgal&gt; some tea and biscuits
   Jan 14 07:17:49 &lt;editorgal&gt; a bit of money, very much needed
   Jan 14 07:18:00 &lt;editorgal&gt; heh
   Jan 14 07:18:16 &lt;editorgal&gt; more cookies than we knew what to do with,
   really
   Jan 14 07:18:17 &lt;jimregan&gt; My gift choices were universally praised :)
   Jan 14 07:18:27 &lt;editorgal&gt; that's cool
   Jan 14 07:18:38 &lt;jimregan&gt; I got "Wyrd Sisters" for Trev - "How did
   you know that was the book I was on?"
   Jan 14 07:18:56 &lt;editorgal&gt; I dunno, how did you?
   Jan 14 07:18:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; I got a book about the human body for my
   sister - "I was going to buy that"
   Jan 14 07:19:02 &lt;jimregan&gt; I didn't.
   Jan 14 07:19:16 &lt;jimregan&gt; I actually didn't even buy that for him
   (Shhh!)
   Jan 14 07:19:18 &lt;editorgal&gt; she an artist?
   Jan 14 07:19:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; Masseuse
   Jan 14 07:19:27 &lt;editorgal&gt; ah
   Jan 14 07:19:29 &lt;jimregan&gt; (in training)
   Jan 14 07:19:39 &lt;editorgal&gt; (ok)
   Jan 14 07:19:46 &lt;jimregan&gt; ((righto))
   Jan 14 07:20:08 &lt;jimregan&gt; I got my Dad a book he had bought for
   himself earlier that week
   Jan 14 07:20:13 &lt;editorgal&gt; and we already know beata liked hers
   Jan 14 07:20:16 &lt;editorgal&gt; whoops well
   Jan 14 07:20:22 &lt;jimregan&gt; Erm... yeah.
   Jan 14 07:20:34 &lt;editorgal&gt; see if he'd held off on xmas buying for
   self ..
   Jan 14 07:20:42 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yep
   Jan 14 07:20:56 &lt;jimregan&gt; Got my other sister a bottle of vodka
   Jan 14 07:21:03 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 14 07:21:10 &lt;editorgal&gt; do stores there refuse to take back books
   with eyeball tracks on them?
   Jan 14 07:21:27 &lt;jimregan&gt; Dunno. Never tried to return anything,
   ever.
   Jan 14 07:22:07 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh.
   Jan 14 07:22:28 &lt;editorgal&gt; jim got a sweater I need to get size
   exchanged
   Jan 14 07:22:52 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'd never return a gift.
   Jan 14 07:23:02 &lt;editorgal&gt; his mom's a bit ditzy about her baby boy
   is bigger than he was when he was 8, so she waaaay blew past the size
   margin
   Jan 14 07:23:06 &lt;jimregan&gt; To me, it's the embodiment of a thought.
   Jan 14 07:23:13 &lt;editorgal&gt; awww
   Jan 14 07:23:13 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 14 07:23:30 &lt;editorgal&gt; luckily the vendor's very good about that
   stuff
   Jan 14 07:23:32 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah. Which is why I have /no/ expectations
   for Christmas or birthdays
   Jan 14 07:24:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; Though now, I suppose, I can rely on at
   least one of my sisters, and my son is showing signs of great reserves
   of thoughtfulness
   Jan 14 07:25:14 &lt;jimregan&gt; It should be great when he's old enough to
   buy the gifts himself.
   Jan 14 07:25:19 &lt;editorgal&gt; I find it's more interesting to put good
   thought in, than to just merely throw money at a box
   Jan 14 07:25:33 &lt;editorgal&gt; you might be surprised
   Jan 14 07:25:37 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh. When I was fifteen, I was given money
   in a box
   Jan 14 07:25:51 &lt;editorgal&gt; when I was a kid I did my shopping with
   adults, but made sure to make seperate trips
   Jan 14 07:26:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; My mother made some comment about how
   shitty it'd be if she did that to one of my sisters
   Jan 14 07:26:10 &lt;jimregan&gt; "Uh... you did that to me when I was
   fifteen"
   Jan 14 07:26:14 &lt;jimregan&gt; "Oh..."
   Jan 14 07:26:26 &lt;jimregan&gt; "Ended my expectations for Christmas"
   Jan 14 07:26:26 &lt;editorgal&gt; someone always knew someone else's
   present, but it was when they were shopping for $that_person too
   Jan 14 07:26:52 &lt;editorgal&gt; :(
   Jan 14 07:27:48 &lt;editorgal&gt; I was able to provide the added benefit of
   spot-checking whether the recipient probably would or wouldn't like
   their pick, too
   Jan 14 07:28:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; I can't be too hard on my parents though...
   /I/ can't even buy stuff for me :)
   Jan 14 07:29:25 &lt;editorgal&gt; at *least* it could be a giftcert at
   someplace you enjoy shopping at.
   Jan 14 07:29:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nah. Cash is great. Pubs don't do
   giftcerts.
   Jan 14 07:30:09 &lt;editorgal&gt; well ok, how about cash used to pack a
   couple pintglasses.
   Jan 14 07:30:13 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Tried to talk the barman in my old
   regular...)
   Jan 14 07:30:26 &lt;jimregan&gt; erm ... into it
   Jan 14 07:30:38 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nah. I rarely have drink in the house.
   Jan 14 07:30:57 &lt;jimregan&gt; Contrary to my own myth, I don't drink that
   often.
   Jan 14 07:31:00 &lt;editorgal&gt; s/pintglasses/coffeemugs/ ?
   Jan 14 07:31:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nah. We've already got a set that are
   attached to my ritual.
   Jan 14 07:31:30 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh.
   Jan 14 07:31:34 &lt;jimregan&gt; Anything else wouldn't work.
   Jan 14 07:32:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; 's why I try to go for different coffee
   types when I'm elsewhere
   Jan 14 07:32:11 &lt;editorgal&gt; here the ritual includes mild cussing that
   the pot is a dribble pot for a cup and a half worth
   Jan 14 07:32:27 &lt;jimregan&gt; I think I need to kill that ritual. I had
   ~10 cups today.
   Jan 14 07:32:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; Just out of boredom
   Jan 14 07:33:12 &lt;editorgal&gt; // the shake becomes a warning // it is
   caffeine alone that sets the mind in motion
   Jan 14 07:33:31 &lt;jimregan&gt; Shake?
   Jan 14 07:33:34 &lt;jimregan&gt; Pfft.
   Jan 14 07:33:46 &lt;jimregan&gt; I need ~20 cups before I get the shakes
   Jan 14 07:34:04 &lt;jimregan&gt; I've been drinking coffee from an
   unhealthily young age
   Jan 14 07:34:06 &lt;editorgal&gt; then you'd be more likely to get them from
   not drinking at least 8...
   Jan 14 07:34:12 &lt;jimregan&gt; True
   Jan 14 07:34:15 &lt;editorgal&gt; I didn't start til I was 15
   Jan 14 07:34:22 &lt;editorgal&gt; blame my programmer friends
   Jan 14 07:34:25 &lt;editorgal&gt; well...
   Jan 14 07:34:38 &lt;editorgal&gt; strictly speaking I tasted some younger
   Jan 14 07:34:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; I was around 10
   Jan 14 07:34:54 &lt;editorgal&gt; and what we drank in the lab as it were
   wasn't coffee, it was instant
   Jan 14 07:35:15 &lt;jimregan&gt; I brought coffee to school every day when I
   was 11
   Jan 14 07:35:33 &lt;editorgal&gt; well then
   Jan 14 07:35:37 &lt;jimregan&gt; Until it spilled on my books
   Jan 14 07:35:43 &lt;editorgal&gt; your nerves are probably wired for it.
   Jan 14 07:37:25 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah, but last time I tried to quit
   smoking, I tried to quit caffeine too, and managed just fine on 1 cup
   Jan 14 07:37:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; until the smoking habit kicked back in, and
   I said fuck it

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 14 07:38:37 &lt;lunatech&gt; seen this /. story "Creationist Textbook
   Stickers Declared Unconstitutional"
   Jan 14 07:39:06 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 14 07:39:36 &lt;editorgal&gt; um
   Jan 14 07:39:46 * editorgal shuffles her feet and looks down
   Jan 14 07:39:52 &lt;editorgal&gt; I don't follow slashdot
   Jan 14 07:40:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; WHAAAAAT!
   Jan 14 07:40:02 &lt;editorgal&gt; I sometimes surf freshmeat
   Jan 14 07:40:19 &lt;editorgal&gt; I figure the good stuff gets retold to me
   anyway...
   Jan 14 07:40:47 &lt;jimregan&gt; (OK, I haven't read much more than the
   headlines for a month now, but still)
   Jan 14 07:41:08 &lt;lunatech&gt; neither do i, others on channel usually
   point out interestig stories
   Jan 14 07:42:33 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh good, then you won't rat me out and
   make me turn in my union card
   Jan 14 07:42:46 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh.
   Jan 14 07:43:00 &lt;lunatech&gt; :)
   Jan 14 07:43:04 &lt;jimregan&gt; When I made the switch to ubuntu, I didn't
   bother installing liferea
   Jan 14 07:43:22 &lt;lunatech&gt; being a conformist geek is higly overrated
   Jan 14 07:43:25 &lt;jimregan&gt; So, I don't read the stuff I used to... and
   don't miss most of it either
   Jan 14 07:43:30 &lt;editorgal&gt; installin wha ?
   Jan 14 07:43:36 &lt;jimregan&gt; A feedreader
   Jan 14 07:43:41 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh
   Jan 14 07:43:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; That can take input from a pipe
   Jan 14 07:43:47 &lt;lunatech&gt; bloglines is the best feed reader jimregan
   :)
   Jan 14 07:43:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; Pfft
   Jan 14 07:44:05 &lt;jimregan&gt; See my answer before yours
   Jan 14 07:44:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; Y'know, I had this whole screen scraping
   thing going on...
   Jan 14 07:44:28 &lt;jimregan&gt; don't use them anymore
   Jan 14 07:44:28 &lt;editorgal&gt; webfetch and add ones you care about to
   your website.
   Jan 14 07:44:38 &lt;jimregan&gt; Website?
   Jan 14 07:44:50 &lt;jimregan&gt; That's, like, soooo 1997
   Jan 14 07:44:51 &lt;lunatech&gt; i think reading blogs can keep you ahead of
   the curve
   Jan 14 07:44:54 &lt;editorgal&gt; yeah I know
   Jan 14 07:45:08 &lt;lunatech&gt; you get to know cool things before anyone
   else
   Jan 14 07:45:22 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah, but it doesn't replace reading
   mailing lists
   Jan 14 07:45:27 &lt;jimregan&gt; (or using gmane)
   Jan 14 07:45:29 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 14 07:45:35 &lt;lunatech&gt; i agree with that :)
   Jan 14 07:46:06 &lt;jimregan&gt; For sites you really do read on a daily
   basis, it's a lot better
   Jan 14 07:46:28 &lt;jimregan&gt; But most sites have such shitty feeds
   Jan 14 07:46:46 * lunatech wonders what feeds jimregan reads
   Jan 14 07:46:46 &lt;jimregan&gt; (And I hold up my hands for LG's being
   among the worst)
   Jan 14 07:46:52 &lt;jimregan&gt; Pfft.
   Jan 14 07:47:15 &lt;jimregan&gt; Check LG back issues. I put my OPML and my
   screen scrapers in back issues
   Jan 14 07:47:34 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Don't ask me which :)
   Jan 14 07:48:39 &lt;lunatech&gt; i remember reading your screen scraper
   article :)
   Jan 14 07:48:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; The only feed I really keep an eye on
   anymore is my del.icio.us feed
   Jan 14 07:48:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; To keep tracks of the sites I liked :)
   Jan 14 07:49:24 &lt;lunatech&gt; del.icio.us is ingenious
   Jan 14 07:49:33 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah.
   Jan 14 07:49:37 &lt;lunatech&gt; i stumble upon lots of nifty things on it
   Jan 14 07:49:39 &lt;jimregan&gt; I like flickr too.
   Jan 14 07:50:16 &lt;jimregan&gt; I like bookmarking my articles with it, so
   I can see who else liked them :)
   Jan 14 07:50:42 &lt;jimregan&gt; The two articles in this month's LG were
   the most popular so far, I think
   Jan 14 07:50:50 &lt;jimregan&gt; I really wasn't expecting that
   Jan 14 07:51:24 &lt;lunatech&gt; :)
   Jan 14 07:51:38 &lt;lunatech&gt; nice hack that one
   Jan 14 07:51:47 &lt;jimregan&gt; Though I have to say, my montage script is
   pretty cool
   Jan 14 07:52:32 &lt;jimregan&gt; First time I sat down and wrote a program
   thinking "how can I make this /fully/ useful?"
   Jan 14 07:53:08 &lt;lunatech&gt; i have seen a flick zeitgist(sp?) on some
   blogs,
   Jan 14 07:53:15 &lt;jimregan&gt; Suppose it was something to do with my
   writing it on Christmas Day/the 26th
   Jan 14 07:53:20 &lt;jimregan&gt; That flash thing?
   Jan 14 07:53:38 &lt;jimregan&gt; Flash hangs my computer, that's why I wrote
   the script :)
   Jan 14 07:54:35 &lt;lunatech&gt; yes, yes that flash thing. it is nifty
   Jan 14 07:54:57 &lt;jimregan&gt; I was tearing my hair out, wrestling with
   Image::Magick's strangeness, while Charlton Heston delivered the 10
   commandments on TV :)
   Jan 14 07:55:39 &lt;jimregan&gt; (I had a few "thou shalt nots" for the
   creator of Image::Magick
   Jan 14 07:56:26 &lt;lunatech&gt;
   http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~anthony/graphics/imagick6/
   Jan 14 07:56:51 &lt;lunatech&gt; useful examples on that page
   Jan 14 07:58:46 &lt;jimregan&gt; Eh... I don't feel like going down that
   route again.
   Jan 14 07:59:22 &lt;lunatech&gt; hehe .. useful resource, bookmark it .
   trust me you won't regret it :)

   Jan 14 05:04:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; Erm... I wrote a story.
   Jan 14 05:04:59 &lt;editorgal&gt; what kind?
   Jan 14 05:05:03 &lt;jimregan&gt; Guess
   Jan 14 05:05:07 &lt;editorgal&gt; er

   Jan 14 05:05:16 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 14 05:05:42 &lt;okopnik&gt; Erotica involving computers?
   Jan 14 05:05:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; I was daydreaming and wrote it down for a
   change
   Jan 14 05:05:49 &lt;jimregan&gt; No.
   Jan 14 05:06:11 &lt;jimregan&gt; The mind boggles...
   Jan 14 05:06:20 &lt;okopnik&gt; Binary division never sounded so
   interesting...
   Jan 14 05:06:20 &lt;editorgal&gt; the bog mindles..
   Jan 14 05:06:26 &lt;jimregan&gt; I like my computer, but it's a purely
   platonic thing
   Jan 14 05:06:42 * editorgal brings out some carrots to tease the
   square root out of them
   Jan 14 05:06:43 &lt;okopnik&gt; Yes, but does your computer think so???
   Jan 14 05:06:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hmm...
   Jan 14 05:07:03 &lt;editorgal&gt; or does it have a warm sense of ftp behind
   its firewall?
   Jan 14 05:07:08 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 14 05:07:33 &lt;okopnik&gt; If you take the square root of a caret
   (5^2), doesn't that get you right back to where you started?
   Jan 14 05:07:36 &lt;jimregan&gt; I really should be more careful about what
   I say. I keep holding it as evidence against myself
   Jan 14 05:07:49 &lt;editorgal&gt; aww
   Jan 14 05:07:52 * editorgal hugs jimmy
   Jan 14 05:08:05 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nah, I was talking about the ftp/firewall
   comment
   Jan 14 05:08:11 * editorgal pours him a shotglass full of something
   tasty
   Jan 14 05:08:15 &lt;editorgal&gt; here, take the fifth
   Jan 14 05:08:18 &lt;jimregan&gt; I sent it to Trev so he can laugh at me :)
   Jan 14 05:08:27 &lt;okopnik&gt; That's a BIG shotglass.
   Jan 14 05:08:29 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nah, gimme a glass. Ripples
   Jan 14 05:08:39 &lt;editorgal&gt; okopnik: texas
   Jan 14 05:08:50 &lt;okopnik&gt; Jimmy, you don't want Ripple. That's _nasty_
   stuff.
   Jan 14 05:08:57 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 14 05:09:04 &lt;editorgal&gt; geez Jimmy I said *tasty* not *nasty*
   Jan 14 05:09:12 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh.
   Jan 14 05:09:22 &lt;jimregan&gt; That's actually what I saw
   Jan 14 05:09:24 * editorgal finds these shotglasses are good for 307
   ale though
   Jan 14 05:09:40 &lt;okopnik&gt; Never heard of it.
   Jan 14 05:09:47 &lt;editorgal&gt; I refuse to keep anything stocked whose
   vintage is by week rather than year
   Jan 14 05:09:53 &lt;editorgal&gt; !
   Jan 14 05:09:57 * okopnik laughs
   Jan 14 05:10:01 &lt;editorgal&gt; you never heard of 307 ale??
   Jan 14 05:10:08 &lt;okopnik&gt; Nope. Whatsit?
   Jan 14 05:10:27 &lt;jimregan&gt; ??
   Jan 14 05:11:03 &lt;jimregan&gt; I refuse to keep anything in the TAG bar
   that goes by proof instead of half-life, but to each his/her own

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 14 06:52:52 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh... found a quote in a book about Celtic
   religion
   Jan 14 06:52:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; The folk of a Celtic type, whether
   pre-Celtic, Celtic, or
   Jan 14 06:52:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; Norse, have all spoken a Celtic language
   and exhibit the same old
   Jan 14 06:52:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; Celtic characteristics--vanity, loquacity,
   excitability, fickleness,
   Jan 14 06:52:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; imagination, love of the romantic,
   fidelity, attachment to family
   Jan 14 06:52:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; ties, sentimental love of their country,
   religiosity passing over
   Jan 14 06:52:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; easily to superstition, and a comparatively
   high degree of sexual
   Jan 14 06:52:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; morality. Some of these traits were already
   noted by classical
   Jan 14 06:52:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; observers.
   Jan 14 06:53:07 &lt;jimregan&gt; Sound like anyone?

   Jan 14 06:56:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; Cup of chai?
   Jan 14 06:56:25 &lt;creighton&gt; Hullo
   Jan 14 06:56:36 &lt;editorgal&gt; huh
   Jan 14 06:56:37 &lt;lunatech&gt; hello jimregan ,
   Jan 14 06:56:49 &lt;lunatech&gt; yes a cup would be nice :)
   Jan 14 06:56:53 &lt;lunatech&gt; hello editorgal
   Jan 14 06:56:56 * jimregan passes one over
   Jan 14 06:57:02 &lt;editorgal&gt; when I did renfaire regularly my "cup" of
   chai was taller than the average beer stein
   Jan 14 06:57:17 &lt;jimregan&gt; That's the handy thing about a virtual
   bar... really cuts down the prep time
   Jan 14 06:57:34 &lt;editorgal&gt; That was also the time I managed to get
   bee stung, entirely mom's fault
   Jan 14 06:57:55 &lt;editorgal&gt; since I put an indecent amount of honey in
   my 18-20 oz of chai
   Jan 14 06:58:36 &lt;editorgal&gt; the bees did hang around the honey thing,
   and I wouldn't have been stung by them on that basis, they weren't
   stressy actually
   Jan 14 06:58:49 &lt;editorgal&gt; snacking, more like, and frankly, bees
   don't eat much
   Jan 14 06:59:19 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah. Make great house guests
   Jan 14 06:59:26 &lt;jimregan&gt; Take up little room, too
   Jan 14 06:59:40 &lt;editorgal&gt; but mom wails &lt;accent
   type="valleygirl"&gt;like &lt;em&gt;toooo&lt;/em&gt;tally freaked&lt;/accent&gt;
   Jan 14 06:59:48 &lt;lunatech&gt; :)
   Jan 14 07:00:03 &lt;jimregan&gt; fer sher
   Jan 14 07:00:15 &lt;editorgal&gt; and I turn around and cross-move out of
   the intersection rather quickly, expecting to narrowly avoid a troop
   in platemail or the scots or somesuch
   Jan 14 07:00:37 &lt;jimregan&gt; Ye wha?
   Jan 14 07:00:37 &lt;editorgal&gt; thereby smanging the back of my hand into
   a terribly surprised (and now dying) bee.
   Jan 14 07:00:54 &lt;editorgal&gt; well the way she yelped I thought I was
   about to be run over.
   Jan 14 07:00:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; I think you omitted part of that story
   Jan 14 07:01:21 &lt;editorgal&gt; what? the part about renaissance pleasure
   faire?
   Jan 14 07:01:35 * jimregan scrolls back
   Jan 14 07:01:55 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yep
   Jan 14 07:02:10 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'm just a bit confused, OK...
   Jan 14 07:02:14 &lt;editorgal&gt; "when I did renfaire regularly..." &lt;-
   that?
   Jan 14 07:02:27 &lt;editorgal&gt; um
   Jan 14 07:02:36 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh renfaire == renaissance pleasure faire.
   Gotcha
   Jan 14 07:02:47 &lt;editorgal&gt; 6 weekends worth of everyone pretends it's
   elizabethan tourist trap
   Jan 14 07:02:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh, not /just/ about that story. In general
   Jan 14 07:03:02 &lt;jimregan&gt; You read the story :)
   Jan 14 07:03:28 &lt;jimregan&gt; (For those coming late to the table, I
   wrote a story. All icky gooey yuck)
   Jan 14 07:04:00 &lt;editorgal&gt; the tale of the poor dead bee isn't done
   yet of course... damn that hurt... I was really annoyed too, but put a
   damper on my heartbeat el pronto...
   Jan 14 07:04:23 &lt;editorgal&gt; and laurie started clearing the way to get
   us down to first aid
   Jan 14 07:04:52 &lt;editorgal&gt; jimmy: you forgot mushy, that came first
   Jan 14 07:04:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh, yeah. Mea culpa.
   Jan 14 07:05:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; I think the letter was so much more mushy
   though.
   Jan 14 07:05:29 &lt;editorgal&gt; *now* if someone got in our way there was
   gonna be someone run over...
   Jan 14 07:05:32 &lt;jimregan&gt; Public shaming? [Y]/n?
   Jan 14 07:06:16 &lt;editorgal&gt; so I got down to first aid and they were
   able to extract the bee remains before much of its poison sac got into
   my hand
   Jan 14 07:06:17 &lt;jimregan&gt; I did promise Mike something to razz me
   about
   Jan 14 07:06:25 &lt;editorgal&gt; mom, however, needed a tranquilizer.
   Jan 14 07:06:32 &lt;jimregan&gt; *snort*
   Jan 14 07:06:36 &lt;jimregan&gt; Splart!
   Jan 14 07:06:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh...
   Jan 14 07:06:54 &lt;jimregan&gt; Just noticed the splart! notice is gone.
   Jan 14 07:06:59 &lt;editorgal&gt; yeah thomas took it off
   Jan 14 07:07:15 &lt;editorgal&gt; we do change these things from time to
   time you know
   Jan 14 07:07:16 &lt;jimregan&gt; Splart is the sound you make when you try
   to hold the coffee in with your hand and fail
   Jan 14 07:07:26 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah... but so rarely :P
   Jan 14 07:07:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Erm... when laughing...)
   Jan 14 07:07:48 &lt;editorgal&gt; given how unhappy my new year has been...
   Jan 14 07:08:15 &lt;jimregan&gt; (I just remembered certain stories... felt
   the need to specify)
   Jan 14 07:09:02 &lt;creighton&gt; unhappy?
   Jan 14 07:09:27 &lt;creighton&gt; Heh heh...people kept telling me "Happy
   New Year!" I said "We'll see, won't we?"
   Jan 14 07:09:29 --- editorgal has changed the topic to: The Answer
   Gang, linux 'r' us and maybe the kernel will even compile this time |
   linuxgazette.net #110 | The TAG bar is open, look out for the
   watzamocha
   Jan 14 07:09:45 &lt;editorgal&gt; creighton: two of my friends died, one
   very close to me :(
   Jan 14 07:09:58 &lt;editorgal&gt; although I think the total score goes...
   Jan 14 07:10:09 &lt;jimregan&gt; You're keeping score?
   Jan 14 07:10:25 &lt;jimregan&gt; Dammit, I'm the morbid one. You stick to
   -ose, you!
   Jan 14 07:10:50 &lt;editorgal&gt; 1 death by old age, 1 utterly unfair early
   death for no known reason (yet), 2 people suicidal during xmastime
   still around, and 1 wedding proposal of a friend accepted by his
   sweety
   Jan 14 07:10:56 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Erm... too facetious?)
   Jan 14 07:11:38 &lt;jimregan&gt; Wow. Wedding proposal accepted? You really
   are more morbid than me :)
   Jan 14 07:11:57 &lt;editorgal&gt; jimregan: the king of ose died a few years
   ago of brain cancer
   Jan 14 07:12:24 &lt;jimregan&gt; Gah...
   Jan 14 07:12:26 &lt;editorgal&gt; aww that's not morbid - they're both sweet
   people
   Jan 14 07:12:42 &lt;jimregan&gt; Fitting...
   Jan 14 07:12:48 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh yeah and a couple who'd broken up got
   back together over xmas
   Jan 14 07:12:55 &lt;jimregan&gt; but still... at the same time... erm...
   fitting
   Jan 14 07:13:11 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah. Quite common.
   Jan 14 07:13:18 &lt;jimregan&gt; You get better presents that way
   Jan 14 07:13:34 &lt;editorgal&gt; um
   Jan 14 07:13:45 &lt;editorgal&gt; I don't think that's how it worked out,
   but nevermind
   Jan 14 07:13:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh, did I forget to mention I'm in cynical
   mode?

   Jan 14 05:23:05 &lt;jimregan&gt; OK, so aside from the morbid ending...
   Jan 14 06:32:42 --&gt; creighton (~jason@ppp46.polson.net) has joined
   #tag-chat
   Jan 14 06:33:05 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hi Jason
   Jan 14 06:33:11 &lt;editorgal&gt; hi jason
   Jan 14 06:33:41 &lt;creighton&gt; Hi Jason. (Oh, wait...) :-)
   Jan 14 06:34:06 &lt;editorgal&gt; "say goodnight, gracie" &lt;gracie&gt;
   goodnight, gracie.
   Jan 14 06:34:38 &lt;jimregan&gt; When I think expresso, I think raw
   expresso, not... non caffeinated stuff
   Jan 14 06:34:41 * editorgal breaks out the espresso cups
   Jan 14 06:34:48 &lt;editorgal&gt; not expresso
   Jan 14 06:34:50 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Where 'stuff' is to be said with much
   disdain)
   Jan 14 06:35:01 &lt;editorgal&gt; expresso's probably some courier brand
   name in podunk iowa
   Jan 14 06:35:07 &lt;jimregan&gt; Espresso, sorry
   Jan 14 06:35:12 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeesh.
   Jan 14 06:35:14 &lt;creighton&gt; Whoa! non caffeinated espresso?
   Jan 14 06:35:32 &lt;jimregan&gt; No.... Heather was telling me about her
   bowl size cups
   Jan 14 06:35:35 &lt;editorgal&gt; and /me thought diet jolt cola was
   antimatter
   Jan 14 06:35:37 &lt;jimregan&gt; "For espresso?"
   Jan 14 06:35:43 &lt;editorgal&gt; yeah
   Jan 14 06:35:48 &lt;creighton&gt; jimregan: Yeah, spelling will kill you.
   I'll ship you a dictionary via Fed-Es. :)
   Jan 14 06:36:13 &lt;jimregan&gt; capuccino == espresso drink... but with
   non-caffeinated crap
   Jan 14 06:36:22 &lt;editorgal&gt; 1 cup standard coffee, N shots espresso,
   additives per (latte cappucino mocha wtf etc)
   Jan 14 06:36:34 &lt;editorgal&gt; no way
   Jan 14 06:36:38 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Though if they ever manage to make
   caffeinated cream...)
   Jan 14 06:36:40 &lt;editorgal&gt; it isn't coffee without caffiene
   Jan 14 06:36:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hey, hey, hey
   Jan 14 06:37:08 &lt;jimregan&gt; Noone was talking about decaf, just a
   simple misunderstanding
   Jan 14 06:37:12 &lt;jimregan&gt; Stay calm!
   Jan 14 06:37:14 &lt;editorgal&gt; good
   Jan 14 06:37:19 &lt;editorgal&gt; just so we have that stright
   Jan 14 06:37:25 &lt;editorgal&gt; +ai
   Jan 14 06:37:27 &lt;jimregan&gt; Eep! I said the 'd' word
   Jan 14 06:37:50 * editorgal commits jimmy to 40 lashes with a wet
   noodle
   Jan 14 06:37:50 &lt;jimregan&gt; De (/me spits at the ground) caf
   Jan 14 06:37:56 &lt;jimregan&gt; much better
   Jan 14 06:38:07 &lt;jimregan&gt; brb
   Jan 14 06:38:16 &lt;jimregan&gt; (all this talk of caffeine)
   Jan 14 06:38:54 &lt;creighton&gt; I don't drink coffee. Never tried it. I
   see too many people who just can't go without the stuff, I don't think
   I want jokes made about "not really awake until the second cup of
   coffee" to be *true*. But I mentally file "Capuccino" under "Something
   weird that coffee people like. See also: Mocha, Frappe, etc..."
   Jan 14 06:38:59 &lt;editorgal&gt; darnit, wasn't very lit here today, and I
   want the photos I'm going to merge in similar lighting
   Jan 14 06:39:15 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh well
   Jan 14 06:39:22 &lt;editorgal&gt; I mostly drink tea...
   Jan 14 06:39:30 &lt;editorgal&gt; coffee I savor, tea I drink
   Jan 14 06:39:47 &lt;editorgal&gt; I don't put up with icky coffee either
   Jan 14 06:40:53 &lt;editorgal&gt; Mocha = method to get the maximum amount
   of stimulant into a sysadmin's body, consisting of espresso,
   chocolate, cream, with whipped cream on top, chocolate powder for
   cuteness optional.
   Jan 14 06:41:20 &lt;editorgal&gt; cute lil shavings of a chocolate brick
   also pleasantly acceptable
   Jan 14 06:42:05 &lt;editorgal&gt; anyways
   Jan 14 06:42:19 &lt;editorgal&gt; jason, what do you actually prefer to
   drink?
   Jan 14 06:42:38 * editorgal could just go back and look at the thread,
   but..
   Jan 14 06:43:14 &lt;creighton&gt; You mean, if someone asked me, "What would
   you like to drink? Come on, anything at all!" what would I want?
   Jan 14 06:43:23 &lt;editorgal&gt; sure
   Jan 14 06:43:31 &lt;creighton&gt; Hmm
   Jan 14 06:44:19 &lt;creighton&gt; This is going to sound weird...
   Jan 14 06:44:36 * editorgal grins, weird's fine by *me* ...
   Jan 14 06:44:47 &lt;jimregan&gt; Fine by me, and I stock the bar
   Jan 14 06:45:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; What? Human blood?
   Jan 14 06:45:37 &lt;jimregan&gt; I got some, y'know... any blood group in
   particular?
   Jan 14 06:45:37 &lt;editorgal&gt; smurf juice?
   Jan 14 06:45:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hee hee hee
   Jan 14 06:46:02 &lt;jimregan&gt; (sorry, spent the evening watching some
   really juvenile stuff)
   Jan 14 06:46:25 * editorgal looks up a vendor ID number for Gargamel
   Jan 14 06:46:38 &lt;editorgal&gt; says he's out, lil buggers keep getting
   away.
   Jan 14 06:46:43 &lt;creighton&gt; But I really like a good lemonade. No, not
   *real* lemonade. The stuff you can order at a restaurant, or buy in
   2-Liter bottles at Wal-Mart. Probably loaded with Bad Stuff, but a
   nice smooth taste, which I tend to prefer over carbonated soft drinks.
   Jan 14 06:47:12 &lt;jimregan&gt; Lemonade?
   Jan 14 06:47:14 &lt;jimregan&gt; OUT!!
   Jan 14 06:47:16 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 14 06:47:24 &lt;editorgal&gt; right, one high fructose corn syrup laden
   something lemony with yellow coloring coming up.
   Jan 14 06:47:32 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hey!
   Jan 14 06:47:36 &lt;creighton&gt; editorgal: That's the spirit! :)
   Jan 14 06:47:47 &lt;jimregan&gt; That's my damned bar!
   Jan 14 06:47:50 &lt;editorgal&gt; most of the stuff you can get at
   restaurants here came from lemons. sorry bought that jason
   Jan 14 06:48:11 &lt;creighton&gt; "damned"? What did it do?
   Jan 14 06:48:11 &lt;editorgal&gt; he didn't say he wanted a drink, that
   makes it my stock
   Jan 14 06:48:23 * jimregan finds something sufficiently chemical
   laden, with a hint of cirtus
   Jan 14 06:48:25 &lt;creighton&gt; editorgal: Sorry, brain's gone fuzzy.
   Where's "here"?
   Jan 14 06:48:32 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Note: not 'citrus')
   Jan 14 06:48:34 * editorgal giggles
   Jan 14 06:48:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; The bar!
   Jan 14 06:48:56 * jimregan points at the kegs and spirit bottles
   Jan 14 06:49:00 &lt;editorgal&gt; that's what you get for drinking what
   Jimmy put in front of you...
   Jan 14 06:49:18 &lt;editorgal&gt; as for where *I* am...
   Jan 14 06:49:20 &lt;editorgal&gt; er
   Jan 14 06:49:23 * jimregan grabs a lemonade
   Jan 14 06:49:34 * jimregan grabs a wutka
   Jan 14 06:49:48 * editorgal skips the mental nav specs, them probably
   not being what he wants to here.
   Jan 14 06:50:12 &lt;editorgal&gt; especially with the under destruction
   signs in there :/
   Jan 14 06:50:31 &lt;jimregan&gt; (wutka == vodka, but moreso)
   Jan 14 06:50:45 * editorgal is presently typing from a chair in
   northern california

<p><strong>From #tag-chat

<p></strong></p>

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 04 06:37:31 &lt;jimregan&gt; I've only ever given one presentation, ever
   Jan 04 06:37:46 &lt;jimregan&gt; (And brought the draft version instead of
   the final)
   Jan 04 06:37:52 &lt;editorgal&gt; I've given a stack of them and made
   presentation software for more
   Jan 04 06:37:56 &lt;editorgal&gt; whoops
   Jan 04 06:37:58 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'm a public speaking disaster :)
   Jan 04 06:38:20 * editorgal loans jimmy a copy of "Technically
   Speaking"
   Jan 04 06:38:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; At the hustings when I went for a student's
   union position, I got a big laugh
   Jan 04 06:39:05 &lt;jimregan&gt; Looked down at my hand, noticed I still had
   a lit cigarette in it, and flicked it from the podium
   Jan 04 06:39:38 &lt;editorgal&gt; lol
   Jan 04 06:39:39 &lt;jimregan&gt; Had to ad lib my speech, 'cos I had my cue
   cards upside down &amp; out of order
   Jan 04 06:39:49 &lt;jimregan&gt; Kept it to 3 sentences :)
   Jan 04 06:39:57 &lt;editorgal&gt; I have a trick for that part
   Jan 04 06:40:23 &lt;editorgal&gt; punch holes in the corner, and run one of
   these round keychain loops through them
   Jan 04 06:40:24 &lt;jimregan&gt; Threw those off the podium too. Made it
   part of the speech
   Jan 04 06:40:32 &lt;editorgal&gt; that way they're stuck in order
   Jan 04 06:40:38 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh well, ok
   Jan 04 06:41:01 &lt;editorgal&gt; especially if it's a feature in this crowd
   to be short er, ahem, brief about it
   Jan 04 06:41:10 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah
   Jan 04 06:41:17 &lt;editorgal&gt; "short" here is sometimes used to mean a
   cross attitude
   Jan 04 06:41:27 &lt;editorgal&gt; "don't be short with me"
   Jan 04 06:41:45 &lt;editorgal&gt; ^ == adult version of "you meanybutts stop
   it"
   Jan 04 06:41:30 &lt;jimregan&gt; First of the 3 sentences was "Fuck it, I'm
   not going to waste your time"
   Jan 04 06:41:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; heh
   Jan 04 06:42:00 &lt;editorgal&gt; heh bet that got good attention
   Jan 04 06:42:25 &lt;editorgal&gt; so did you get the job or not?
   Jan 04 06:42:37 &lt;jimregan&gt; Dunno. I was the only person going for the
   job, so all I needed was to get the basic amount of votes
   Jan 04 06:42:52 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh, I got the job. Well, position.
   Jan 04 06:42:59 &lt;editorgal&gt; you don't know if you got it??
   Jan 04 06:43:01 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh ok
   Jan 04 06:43:12 &lt;jimregan&gt; "Job" to me implies payment.
   Jan 04 06:43:15 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh you don't know if what you did really
   counted as good
   Jan 04 06:43:17 &lt;editorgal&gt; ah
   Jan 04 06:43:25 &lt;editorgal&gt; I worked with the student union
   Jan 04 06:43:40 &lt;editorgal&gt; but as a tutor; we did get paid, just
   wretchedly.
   Jan 04 06:43:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; :(
   Jan 04 06:43:58 &lt;editorgal&gt; with a shush on telling students needing
   tutoring how much we're paid
   Jan 04 06:44:17 &lt;editorgal&gt; don't want to discourage people from
   offering or seeking help by discussing money
   Jan 04 06:44:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; It did annoy me that I my president was
   less organised than me.
   Jan 04 06:44:24 &lt;editorgal&gt; just get to the topic
   Jan 04 06:45:09 &lt;editorgal&gt; I did fine at that of course
   Jan 04 06:45:19 &lt;jimregan&gt; There's a college quiz show on TV here...
   he told me we were to submit a team the Monday of the week it was due
   Jan 04 06:45:21 &lt;editorgal&gt; english and higher math and computing
   Jan 04 06:45:39 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh that's a lot of help
   Jan 04 06:45:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah. Due Wednesday.
   Jan 04 06:46:30 &lt;jimregan&gt; The vice president was fairly neurotic
   anyway, and gave out to me because she knew he wouldn't pay attention
   :)

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 15 13:30:47 &lt;jimregan&gt; Though these days we tend to get the
   American tourist leprechauns
   Jan 15 13:30:57 &lt;jimregan&gt; With their bad accents
   Jan 15 13:31:07 &lt;jimregan&gt; No bloody gold either
   Jan 15 13:31:19 &lt;jimregan&gt; Keep trying to fob us off with rubbish
   cereal
   Jan 15 13:32:54 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :)
   Jan 15 13:33:03 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I like accents...
   Jan 15 13:33:14 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Which kind of Irish one do you have?
   Jan 15 13:33:22 &lt;jimregan&gt; Erm...
   Jan 15 13:33:36 &lt;jimregan&gt; I have a fairly flat southern accent.
   Jan 15 13:33:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; Depends on who I'm talking to.
   Jan 15 13:34:01 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Why?
   Jan 15 13:34:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; More use of idiom around certain people
   Jan 15 13:34:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Because they don't really 'get' standard
   English)
   Jan 15 13:34:43 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Oh. I suppose we're all guilty of that.
   Jan 15 13:34:55 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; That's OK, neither do the Americans. :P
   Jan 15 13:34:58 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh. I make no bones about being a
   pretentious git
   Jan 15 13:35:17 * thomas_adam wasn't going to mention it.
   Jan 15 13:35:27 &lt;jimregan&gt; It's actually something I've been giving
   thought to.
   Jan 15 13:35:43 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Being a git? :)
   Jan 15 13:35:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; A coworker and I are going to teach each
   other languages
   Jan 15 13:35:58 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nah. Don't need to think about that, it
   comes naturally.
   Jan 15 13:36:14 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Hehehe.
   Jan 15 13:36:26 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; You could teach other languages, aye.
   Jan 15 13:37:09 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I know that over here, if one wants to
   teach at a University -- no teaching experience is needed. In fact,
   apart from one or two, most of my lecturers are people whom have been
   in industry for ages.
   Jan 15 13:37:10 &lt;jimregan&gt; He wants to improve his English. It doesn't
   really help that there are three main versions he'd have to be
   familiar with
   Jan 15 13:37:28 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah. Tend to be better lecturers for it.
   Jan 15 13:38:13 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; ... then there are those who are
   clueless.
   Jan 15 13:38:16 &lt;jimregan&gt; The academic types tend to be a bit strange
   Jan 15 13:38:26 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Ivory towers, and all that.
   Jan 15 13:38:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; "So we were doing research into foo..."
   Jan 15 13:38:44 &lt;jimregan&gt; "Why?"
   Jan 15 13:38:47 &lt;jimregan&gt; "Erm...."
   Jan 15 13:39:22 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh. Media Lab Europe shut down.
   Jan 15 13:39:33 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; It's not even that -- there's one
   lecturer who used to be in the army, and post that, did acting. It
   shows, too. He doesn't know shit. Quite how he got a job lecturing, I
   don't know.
   Jan 15 13:40:40 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh. We had to do a course in basic
   office-type applications in first year. Our lecturer just about knew
   how to use Word...
   Jan 15 13:40:53 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :)
   Jan 15 13:41:36 &lt;jimregan&gt; A friend of mine is doing his masters, and
   was giving lecturing work.
   Jan 15 13:42:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; He said that every lecture, he's guaranteed
   to 'zone'
   Jan 15 13:42:12 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Zone?
   Jan 15 13:42:13 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; (brb)
   Jan 15 13:42:27 &lt;jimregan&gt; He'll start talking about something, tune
   out, tune back in and wonder what the hell he's talking about.
   Jan 15 13:42:43 &lt;jimregan&gt; His students loved his lectures, for the
   comedy appeal.
   Jan 15 13:43:12 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Aww.
   Jan 15 13:43:47 &lt;jimregan&gt; Mostly it'd be telling them exactly how
   useless aspect X of the course was
   Jan 15 13:44:17 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :D
   Jan 15 13:44:39 &lt;jimregan&gt; I think he was giving lectures on software
   design techniques, so he had plenty of ammunition
   Jan 15 13:45:11 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Not that he ever stuck to his own subject)
   Jan 15 13:45:51 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Hehehehehe.
   Jan 15 13:45:54 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; He sounds cool.
   Jan 15 13:46:28 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah. He's the type who studies religions
   so he can annoy their adherents in depth.
   Jan 15 13:46:56 &lt;jimregan&gt; "Oh, you can't fully appreciate the Quran
   unless you're read it in Arabic"
   Jan 15 13:47:05 &lt;jimregan&gt; "What, bullshit doesn't translate?"
   Jan 15 13:47:12 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :)
   Jan 15 13:47:42 &lt;jimregan&gt; He decided to become a Buddhist because
   "you can tag on another religion"
   Jan 15 13:48:07 &lt;jimregan&gt; He loooves telling the Jehovah's Witnesses
   that he'll convert
   Jan 15 13:48:16 &lt;jimregan&gt; because it doesn't conflict with Buddhism
   Jan 15 13:48:33 &lt;jimregan&gt; "But... but...."
   Jan 15 13:48:44 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; LOL!
   Jan 15 13:49:12 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh. Once he wrote a program in Java and in
   8088 asm to show that the 8088 version was faster
   Jan 15 13:49:28 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; He didn't need to do that...
   Jan 15 13:49:34 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; It was a foregone conclusion.
   Jan 15 13:49:35 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Again, picking on a religious fanatic)
   Jan 15 13:50:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; I remember being highly amused when I saw
   the quote about you being the type who'd write his own operating
   system.
   Jan 15 13:50:54 &lt;jimregan&gt; 'Cos this guy actually did it.
   Jan 15 13:51:21 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I never would.
   Jan 15 13:51:27 &lt;jimregan&gt; Some NT apologist lecturer really got to
   him, so he wrote it for his thesis.
   Jan 15 13:51:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; Just so he could say "see, there's no good
   reason for NT to do [whatever it was]"
   Jan 15 13:52:00 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :D
   Jan 15 13:52:28 &lt;jimregan&gt; It's strange how the world works.
   Jan 15 13:52:53 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Indeed.
   Jan 15 13:52:54 &lt;jimregan&gt; Once he'd decided to write about that, he
   stumbled across a bunch of books about OS design at a book fair
   Jan 15 13:53:27 &lt;jimregan&gt; And so did another friend: "You wouldn't by
   any chance be interested in these?"
   Jan 15 13:53:41 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :))
   Jan 15 13:54:01 &lt;jimregan&gt; The other day, I had my first serious
   thought about needing to earn more
   Jan 15 13:54:12 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Oh?
   Jan 15 13:54:20 &lt;jimregan&gt; 10 minutes later, one of the senior
   operatives told me he was changing jobs
   Jan 15 13:54:45 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Ah.
   Jan 15 13:55:06 &lt;jimregan&gt; I didn't say a word to anyone about it, the
   universe just dumped it in my lap.
   Jan 15 13:55:24 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; What would you do about another job?
   Jan 15 13:55:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; You mean working elsewhere, or going for
   this job?
   Jan 15 13:56:02 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'm not really ready to move on to
   somewhere else.
   Jan 15 13:56:24 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Hmm.
   Jan 15 13:57:11 &lt;jimregan&gt; I mean, I could go get another job,
   possibly quite easily
   Jan 15 13:57:34 &lt;jimregan&gt; But I decided to use this job as a learning
   experience, and I still have something to learn.
   Jan 15 13:57:59 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; But to what end? It seems like a horrid
   place.
   Jan 15 13:58:01 &lt;jimregan&gt; It's just a feeling, but that feeling has
   always steered me right in the past.
   Jan 15 13:58:28 &lt;jimregan&gt; Well, everything happens for a reason. (Or
   at least, I'm superstitious enough to believe that)
   Jan 15 13:59:03 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Fatalistic?
   Jan 15 13:59:13 &lt;jimregan&gt; I needed to learn the right kind of
   humility, working where I am has taught me that.
   Jan 15 13:59:39 &lt;jimregan&gt; And I needed to unlearn the wrong kind that
   got me consistently screwed over.
   Jan 15 13:59:55 * thomas_adam nods.
   Jan 15 14:00:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; I've had a very strange week and a half...
   Jan 15 14:00:46 &lt;jimregan&gt; Basically, if I've thought about anything I
   needed, it happened.
   Jan 15 14:02:36 &lt;jimregan&gt; I suppose it's really that I learned to
   attempt things without presuming failure from the start.
   Jan 15 14:03:39 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; That's always a good frame of mind to
   start with
   Jan 15 14:04:47 &lt;jimregan&gt; Well, attempt most things. I think I know
   what I need to do now.

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 16 08:33:27 &lt;editorgal&gt; his nose looks right now
   Jan 16 08:33:31 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 16 08:33:41 &lt;editorgal&gt; he hasn't quite got xteddy's smile, but
   Jan 16 08:33:54 &lt;editorgal&gt; hey, we *are* catching him pre-coffee.
   Jan 16 08:36:24 &lt;editorgal&gt; heh. 1-10 out of 304,000 hits on 'linux
   teddy'
   Jan 16 08:36:35 &lt;jimregan&gt; ?
   Jan 16 08:37:27 &lt;editorgal&gt; well I just had this idea that bear's bio
   would be in there cuz I might claim he took the photo..
   Jan 16 08:37:42 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh... dear... god...
   Jan 16 08:37:46 &lt;editorgal&gt; with it being an excuse to cross point at
   some teddybear stuff of some sort
   Jan 16 08:37:54 &lt;editorgal&gt; &lt;- wicked
   Jan 16 08:38:12 &lt;jimregan&gt; Look, just because I've been all puppy-like
   for the last 2 months doesn't mean I'm getting into all the icky
   cutesy stuff
   Jan 16 08:38:45 &lt;editorgal&gt; hey
   Jan 16 08:38:49 &lt;editorgal&gt; it's my teddybear
   Jan 16 08:38:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 16 08:38:54 &lt;editorgal&gt; don't be mean like that
   Jan 16 08:38:58 &lt;editorgal&gt; ;&gt;
   Jan 16 08:39:22 &lt;editorgal&gt; anyways so far it looks like it'd all be a
   cheap ad for cafepress...
   Jan 16 08:39:36 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hmm... wonder if there's a teddy bear mod
   for Doom...
   Jan 16 08:39:56 &lt;editorgal&gt; they have a stock white teddy bear they
   put lil t-shirts on.
   Jan 16 08:40:08 &lt;jimregan&gt; I don't play games, but I'd make an
   exception to shoot some teddies
   Jan 16 08:41:14 &lt;editorgal&gt; * bear growls
   Jan 16 08:41:22 &lt;editorgal&gt; there's a mini-itx teddybear
   Jan 16 08:43:13 &lt;editorgal&gt; multiple hits on a fedora german mailing
   list because someone's nick is teddybear...
   Jan 16 08:44:36 &lt;jimregan&gt; Grr.
   Jan 16 08:44:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; I was gonna growl back, but the effect is
   lost in text.
   Jan 16 08:45:01 &lt;editorgal&gt; hehe
   Jan 16 08:45:12 &lt;editorgal&gt; * bear hops on the counter and hugs his
   coffeemug
   Jan 16 08:45:32 * jimregan searches for his 'baseball' bat
   Jan 16 08:45:46 &lt;editorgal&gt; heck, bear darn near *fits* in his
   coffeemug.
   Jan 16 08:48:27 &lt;editorgal&gt; there was a teddybear computing services -
   and might still be - but the url quoted goes to a teddybear artists
   colony now. guess teddybears are leaving windows behind.
   Jan 16 08:48:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh heh.
   Jan 16 08:48:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; I saw 'colony' and jumped to conclusions
   Jan 16 08:49:09 &lt;jimregan&gt; "What, they shave off the fur?"
   Jan 16 08:49:48 &lt;editorgal&gt; err
   Jan 16 08:50:25 &lt;editorgal&gt; I take that back, according to her TechWeb
   (nee' WinMag) bio, she always wanted to open a teddybear shop, and the
   shown teddybear is the same image on the website
   Jan 16 08:51:40 &lt;jimregan&gt; Er, OK.
   Jan 16 08:52:13 &lt;editorgal&gt; type of server software not mentioned...
   :)
   Jan 16 08:55:20 * jimregan declares behind the bar a teddy bear free
   zone
   Jan 16 08:56:59 &lt;editorgal&gt; &lt;bear&gt; bllllt
   Jan 16 08:57:31 &lt;jimregan&gt; Bear doesn't want to experience my glare.
   Jan 16 08:57:55 &lt;editorgal&gt; Tiny Debugger (tdbr - "teddy bear") Peter
   Lund
   Jan 16 08:58:08 &lt;editorgal&gt; * bear is well defended, he doesn't care.
   Jan 16 08:58:30 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hah.
   Jan 16 08:59:03 * jimregan turns on the full force of his glare.
   Across the globe echoes the sound of children sobbing
   Jan 16 08:59:46 &lt;editorgal&gt; interesting
   Jan 16 09:00:08 &lt;jimregan&gt; ?
   Jan 16 09:00:24 &lt;editorgal&gt; he says he started that project when he
   was ill, and it probably helped him not forget how to program.
   Jan 16 09:02:54 * editorgal bookmarks him
   Jan 16 09:03:41 &lt;editorgal&gt; and alas, there's some windows virus
   called teddybear :(
   Jan 16 09:04:29 &lt;editorgal&gt; hm. a mention on telsa's diary?
   Jan 16 09:04:30 * jimregan feels the urge to torture kittens to repair
   the cutesy balance
   Jan 16 09:05:12 &lt;editorgal&gt; giggle. she has a beeblelbear
   Jan 16 09:05:20 &lt;editorgal&gt; don't panic jimmy
   Jan 16 09:05:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; Groan
   Jan 16 09:05:49 &lt;editorgal&gt; you can always come up with less cutesy
   ideas for covers
   Jan 16 09:06:08 &lt;jimregan&gt; Crucified bear?
   Jan 16 09:06:12 &lt;editorgal&gt; and if I can do the art I might even give
   em the shot what the heck
   Jan 16 09:06:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; }:)
   Jan 16 09:06:25 &lt;editorgal&gt; where's the linux in that?
   Jan 16 09:06:33 &lt;editorgal&gt; xteddy is at least already an app.
   Jan 16 09:07:01 &lt;jimregan&gt; Mmm hmm.
   Jan 16 09:07:31 &lt;editorgal&gt; hmm
   Jan 16 09:19:26 &lt;editorgal&gt; !
   Jan 16 09:19:43 &lt;editorgal&gt; "teddybear housed wireless access point
   400 meter range"
   Jan 16 09:20:00 &lt;editorgal&gt; wrong
   Jan 16 09:20:04 &lt;editorgal&gt; 400 feet
   Jan 16 09:20:23 * editorgal needs to learn to read
   Jan 16 09:20:28 &lt;editorgal&gt; wireless video
   Jan 16 09:20:37 &lt;editorgal&gt; bet it's supposed to be a baby monitor
   Jan 16 09:33:26 &lt;editorgal&gt; right now xteddy's still reading an upside
   down phone book, which looks pretty silly.
   Jan 16 09:33:34 &lt;editorgal&gt; But it is a good save point.
   Jan 16 09:33:55 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)

   Jan 18 20:51:11 &lt;jimregan&gt; Grr.
   Jan 18 20:51:57 * jimregan thought he called in the teddy bear
   exterminator...
   Jan 18 20:52:05 * thomas_adam larts jimregan
   Jan 18 20:52:07 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :(
   Jan 18 20:52:18 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; What's wrong with bears?
   Jan 18 20:52:33 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nothing, as long as they're real bears.
   Jan 18 20:52:51 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; teddy bears, then?
   Jan 18 20:53:07 &lt;jimregan&gt; It's part of my "Just say no to cuteness"
   campaign.
   Jan 18 20:53:22 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :(
   Jan 18 20:53:31 &lt;jimregan&gt; "Friends don't let friends hug stuffed
   animals"
   Jan 18 20:54:36 &lt;editorgal&gt; meanybutts
   Jan 18 20:54:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hee hee hee
   Jan 18 20:54:47 * editorgal buys jimmy a stuffed cold virus
   Jan 18 20:54:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)))
   Jan 18 20:55:05 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah, the cold virus can get stuffed
   Jan 18 20:55:54 &lt;editorgal&gt; jimregan: there really is a site selling
   plushy viruses.
   Jan 18 20:56:09 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh... dear... God...
   Jan 18 20:56:43 &lt;jimregan&gt; Although a plush 'Bender' or 'Zoidburg'...
   Jan 18 20:57:20 &lt;editorgal&gt; someone in thomas' lug has a plushy ebola.
   Jan 18 20:57:30 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Hmm.
   Jan 18 20:57:35 &lt;jimregan&gt; Aw. Now that I /do/ like.
   Jan 18 20:57:36 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Teddy bears are good.
   Jan 18 20:57:52 &lt;jimregan&gt; "Who's a cute little flesh eating virus?
   You are"
   Jan 18 20:58:56 &lt;editorgal&gt; right
   Jan 18 20:59:01 &lt;editorgal&gt; found his price point
   Jan 18 20:59:03 &lt;editorgal&gt; sold.
   Jan 18 20:59:18 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh. I wonder if it's possible to get a
   plush half-brick
   Jan 18 20:59:30 &lt;editorgal&gt; almost certainly
   Jan 18 20:59:33 &lt;jimregan&gt; (For those people you want to hit with one,
   figuratively)
   Jan 18 20:59:39 &lt;editorgal&gt; in fact, if it isn't I could make one
   Jan 18 20:59:52 &lt;editorgal&gt; my pal Katy (aka Chaos) has a boffer trout
   Jan 18 21:00:19 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah, you told me about that
   Jan 18 21:01:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; I wonder if you can get a "my little
   executioner" toy set?
   Jan 18 21:01:15 &lt;jimregan&gt; An electric chair with a victim that
   /really/ wets itself
   Jan 18 21:01:21 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :|
   Jan 18 21:01:51 &lt;editorgal&gt; jimmy, you're more warped than usual
   today.
   Jan 18 21:01:57 * thomas_adam h4x0rs jimregan's computer and runs
   xteddy indefinitely.
   Jan 18 21:02:08 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 18 21:02:13 &lt;editorgal&gt; but I'm pretty sure I can get you a
   guilotine type cheese slicer from one of the horror shops.
   Jan 18 21:02:15 &lt;jimregan&gt; Why yes, yes I am.
   Jan 18 21:02:27 &lt;jimregan&gt; You can get cigar guilotines too
   Jan 18 21:02:42 &lt;jimregan&gt; Just the right size for Barbie as Marie
   Antoinette
   Jan 18 21:03:41 &lt;editorgal&gt; thomas_adam: that script that andy found
   :D
   Jan 18 21:03:55 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I wouldn't be that cruel.
   Jan 18 21:04:06 &lt;editorgal&gt; hehe
   Jan 18 21:04:14 &lt;editorgal&gt; ok, only if jimmy continues to act up.
   Jan 18 21:04:33 &lt;jimregan&gt; Awww... I'm all curious and shit
   Jan 18 21:04:45 * editorgal grins wickedly
   Jan 18 21:04:54 &lt;jimregan&gt; But I'm out of teddy torture ideas
   Jan 18 21:04:59 &lt;editorgal&gt; &lt;Andy&gt; xteddytakeover ! aggh :)
   Jan 18 21:06:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; So... what's with xteddy getting the cover
   for next month? Is it a Valentines tie-in, or just an "I like xteddy"
   thing?
   Jan 18 21:06:46 &lt;editorgal&gt; it was what I thought of that I have
   baesline partial photo ideas for
   Jan 18 21:06:52 &lt;editorgal&gt; I asked for ideas
   Jan 18 21:07:00 &lt;editorgal&gt; you had something sounded good for march
   Jan 18 21:07:01 &lt;jimregan&gt; Xteddy giving Tux a heart?
   Jan 18 21:07:11 &lt;jimregan&gt; No!
   Jan 18 21:07:11 &lt;editorgal&gt; I hadn't thought of valentines tie in, but
   Jan 18 21:07:16 &lt;jimregan&gt; Damn, gone the wrong way!
   Jan 18 21:07:22 &lt;jimregan&gt; Ermm....
   Jan 18 21:07:28 &lt;editorgal&gt; come to think of it the grab-me cursor
   over xteddy is a little heart. so it could be.
   Jan 18 21:07:35 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Flintgirl. :)
   Jan 18 21:07:39 &lt;editorgal&gt; aww
   Jan 18 21:07:40 &lt;jimregan&gt; ?
   Jan 18 21:07:54 &lt;editorgal&gt; jimmy: my teddybear's girlfriend.
   Jan 18 21:08:06 &lt;editorgal&gt; but there should be some linuxy tie in
   Jan 18 21:08:08 &lt;jimregan&gt; Excuse me for a minute
   Jan 18 21:08:10 &lt;editorgal&gt; xteddy's an app
   Jan 18 21:08:20 * editorgal chuckles
   Jan 18 21:08:33 &lt;jimregan&gt; Sorry, just needed to throw up :-P
   Jan 18 21:14:50 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh. Just stick a bow on the teddybear
   girlfriend's head: "Ms. Xteddy"
   Jan 18 21:15:02 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Wayne's World quote elided)
   Jan 18 21:15:27 &lt;editorgal&gt; xteddy married? better for a june issue.
   Jan 18 21:15:34 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I hope he isn't
   Jan 18 21:15:57 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Because you could say he's having an
   affair, being packaged with all distros...
   Jan 18 21:16:00 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; But he has friends, though.
   Jan 18 21:16:14 &lt;editorgal&gt; anyways no I was just thinking, we
   inaugurate the TAG bar with xteddy reading his newspaper
   Jan 18 21:16:20 &lt;editorgal&gt; LG, of course.
   Jan 18 21:16:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; So... xteddy is polyamourous?
   Jan 18 21:16:44 &lt;thomas_adam&gt;
   http://linuxmafia.com/~n6tadam/fvwm/Ne2.png
   Jan 18 21:16:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; Not in my bleedin' bar!
   Jan 18 21:16:57 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Omnipresent; Ubiquitous.
   Jan 18 21:23:43 &lt;editorgal&gt; xteddy doesn't bleed, jimmy. your bar is
   safe.
   Jan 18 21:24:31 * editorgal imagines xteddy and friends doing the
   'ewoks picnic' thing to the Microsoft campus. hee hee hee
   Jan 18 21:29:42 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :)
   Jan 18 21:29:59 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I changed my .signature file, Jimmy...
   Jan 18 21:30:09 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; "Today's the day that teddy bears have
   their picnic"
   Jan 18 21:30:40 &lt;editorgal&gt; "today's the day the ewoks destroy the
   Empire" :)
   Jan 18 21:37:45 &lt;editorgal&gt; to answer the question as you might have
   preferred to ask it, jimmy
   Jan 18 21:37:57 &lt;editorgal&gt; no, the cover art doesn't have to be
   insanely cute
   Jan 18 21:37:59 * thomas_adam prefers his quote.
   Jan 18 21:38:05 &lt;editorgal&gt; it was just the first two things I thought
   of.
   Jan 18 21:43:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeesh...
   Jan 18 21:44:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hmm... wonder if I should start a Cult of
   Clandestine Satanic Teddybear Murderers
   Jan 18 21:44:37 --- ChanServ gives channel operator status to
   thomas_adam
   Jan 18 21:44:41 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :((
   Jan 18 21:44:49 &lt;jimregan&gt; "I spill the stuffing of this bear in
   tribute to you, Dark Lord"
   Jan 18 21:44:54 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :|
   Jan 18 21:44:55 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 18 21:45:02 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Hmm.
   Jan 18 21:45:05 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I'm special again.
   Jan 18 21:45:12 * thomas_adam lowers himself to jimregan's level.
   Jan 18 21:45:14 --- thomas_adam removes channel operator status from
   thomas_adam
   Jan 18 21:45:18 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 18 21:45:32 &lt;editorgal&gt; aww
   Jan 18 21:45:35 * editorgal hugs thomas
   Jan 18 21:45:39 * editorgal hugs jimmy too
   Jan 18 21:45:43 &lt;jimregan&gt; Gerroff!
   Jan 18 21:45:55 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; jimregan: Do you own a teddy bear?
   Jan 18 21:45:56 * editorgal tickles jimmy mercilessly
   Jan 18 21:45:59 &lt;editorgal&gt; :)
   Jan 18 21:46:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'm sacrificing teddy bears here...
   Jan 18 21:46:17 &lt;jimregan&gt; It's not good for the image to have teddy
   bear lovers hugging you, y'know
   Jan 18 21:46:23 &lt;editorgal&gt; lol
   Jan 18 21:46:27 &lt;editorgal&gt; good ;P
   Jan 18 21:46:30 &lt;jimregan&gt; No, I don't own a teddy
   Jan 18 21:46:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; I did once...
   Jan 18 21:46:47 &lt;jimregan&gt; When I was five.
   Jan 18 21:47:09 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; hi all :)
   Jan 18 21:47:21 * Frodo-NL owns a teddy... two even...
   Jan 18 21:47:28 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Yay!
   Jan 18 21:47:31 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Cue long load of psychobabble crap about
   not having closure with my teddybear lead to my hatred of teddies :)))
   Jan 18 21:48:00 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; and a tweety... and three taz's... and a
   beaver (no, you guys, I mean the animal)
   Jan 18 21:48:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; I take it you're not interested in joining
   my Super Secret Satanic Society(R) then?
   Jan 18 21:48:46 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; oh - and I have a Tux
   Jan 18 21:48:55 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; So do I. :)
   Jan 18 21:49:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; OK, I'll fess up. I used to have a stuffed
   ejog named "Snugglemuffin".
   Jan 18 21:49:33 &lt;jimregan&gt; I hasten to add that I /did not/ choose the
   name
   Jan 18 21:49:46 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; as to my teddies - they can be seen in this
   pic... http://rodolf.com/metsfan.jpg
   Jan 18 21:49:58 &lt;jimregan&gt; Is it a picnic pic?
   Jan 18 21:50:38 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nope... oh well.
   Jan 18 21:51:12 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; and no, Jim, the teddy bear picnic was a
   few days earlier... *G*

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 18 23:42:22 * editorgal orders bob-lad a pint
   Jan 18 23:42:30 &lt;editorgal&gt; put it on my tab, Jimmy.
   Jan 18 23:44:54 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Hey, Jimmy -- yer not doing yer job.
   Jan 18 23:45:01 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I haven't had coffee yet.
   Jan 18 23:46:01 &lt;Rickeh&gt; mr adam :)
   Jan 18 23:46:41 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Heh.
   Jan 18 23:46:46 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Hello, Richard.
   Jan 18 23:46:52 &lt;Rickeh&gt; thomas, long time no pub.
   Jan 18 23:46:58 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Yup.
   Jan 18 23:47:03 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; You see that mountain?
   Jan 18 23:47:10 &lt;Rickeh&gt; your workload?
   Jan 18 23:47:17 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; That would be the pile of work I'm
   climbing up. :)
   Jan 18 23:47:35 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I've got...
   Jan 18 23:47:46 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; A report due in Monday.
   Jan 18 23:47:52 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Two presentations.
   Jan 18 23:48:02 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Some UML/Java bullshit.
   Jan 18 23:48:06 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Another presentation.
   Jan 18 23:48:09 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Ah, bugger.
   Jan 18 23:48:13 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I forgot about that.
   Jan 18 23:48:41 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Rickeh: How's you?
   Jan 18 23:48:56 &lt;Rickeh&gt; fine :P
   Jan 18 23:49:01 &lt;Rickeh&gt; i had fun with java today
   Jan 18 23:49:09 &lt;Rickeh&gt; wrote a signed motion jpeg viewer applet
   Jan 18 23:49:20 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Don't try and justify it. We both know
   it wasn't fun. :)
   Jan 18 23:49:28 &lt;editorgal&gt; heh
   Jan 18 23:49:47 * Rickeh vaguely remembers something about exceptions
   Jan 18 23:50:11 * editorgal sneaks behind the bar and starts prepping
   the real coffee.
   Jan 18 23:50:27 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; try (..) {..} catch (..) {...} final
   (switchToC) { System.exit(0); }
   Jan 18 23:50:45 &lt;editorgal&gt; heh
   Jan 18 23:52:41 * editorgal fills thomas' cow mug
   Jan 18 23:52:46 &lt;editorgal&gt; milk?
   Jan 18 23:52:49 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Moo.
   Jan 18 23:52:55 * editorgal pours
   Jan 18 23:53:02 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; :)
   Jan 18 23:53:03 &lt;editorgal&gt; there ya go
   Jan 18 23:53:04 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Thanks.
   Jan 18 23:53:09 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Rickeh: About gettys...
   Jan 18 23:53:25 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Rickeh: Either it is the case you're too
   busy, or that bath you took is sodding long. :)
   Jan 18 23:53:59 &lt;Rickeh&gt; ROFL
   Jan 18 23:54:17 * Rickeh passes thomas_adam the Golgafrincham "B" Ark
   guide to Baths.
   Jan 18 23:54:32 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Heh.
   Jan 18 23:54:32 &lt;Rickeh&gt; I've had shedloads.
   Jan 18 23:54:39 &lt;Rickeh&gt; I've recently renovated the bathroom and
   toilet,
   Jan 18 23:54:43 &lt;Rickeh&gt; I've just got an iMac up and running
   Jan 18 23:55:04 &lt;Rickeh&gt; I've recently purchased two games consoles
   and wired them thru a data switchbox to my TV via SCART
   Jan 18 23:55:06 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Somehow the renovation of the toilet and
   an iMac are related, aren't they...
   Jan 18 23:55:15 &lt;Rickeh&gt; i've got a media PC to furnish with a 30GB HD
   Jan 18 23:55:20 &lt;Rickeh&gt; no :P
   Jan 18 23:55:30 &lt;Rickeh&gt; a new laptop that requires a HD transplant
   from the old laptop
   Jan 18 23:55:34 &lt;Rickeh&gt; a fax system to set up
   Jan 18 23:55:41 &lt;Rickeh&gt; and, at the bottom of the list: gettys.
   Jan 18 23:55:48 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Ah, cool.
   Jan 18 23:55:59 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; As long as it is not top priority.
   Jan 18 23:56:30 &lt;editorgal&gt; bob-lad: what'll you have?
   Jan 18 23:56:52 * editorgal pours myself a nice strong coffee too.
   Jan 18 23:59:50 &lt;Rickeh&gt; thomas_adam: oh, and when you get a moment
   from scaling Mount Kilaminjava, we need to go to the pub.
   Jan 19 00:00:35 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Chin-chin.
   Jan 19 00:01:25 &lt;editorgal&gt; minimum java? oooh
   Jan 19 00:02:30 &lt;Rickeh&gt; kill-a-min-java
   Jan 19 00:02:32 &lt;Rickeh&gt; min being minute
   Jan 19 00:02:34 &lt;Rickeh&gt; MANY minutes.
   Jan 19 00:02:50 &lt;jimregan&gt; Pftt. Kill nothing.
   Jan 19 00:03:05 &lt;jimregan&gt; It also violates the corpse.
   Jan 19 00:05:09 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Sorry. Been getting too much into this
   Satanic Teddybear Cult idea)
   Jan 19 00:05:49 &lt;editorgal&gt; hey. this is a family zine.
   Jan 19 00:06:12 &lt;jimregan&gt; Satanists have families too.
   Jan 19 00:06:22 &lt;jimregan&gt; And occasionally refrain from sacrificing
   them too!
   Jan 19 00:06:51 &lt;editorgal&gt; the last unicorn&gt; there comes a time when
   the witch must sacrifice her own liver, and not expect to get it back.
   Jan 19 00:07:25 &lt;jimregan&gt; Cool. You've given me an idea
   Jan 19 00:08:10 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'll start an Irish Satanic Cult, where you
   have to sacrifice your own liver through the ritualistic drinking of
   way too much booze
   Jan 19 00:08:54 &lt;jimregan&gt; The tithes should see me a millionaire by
   2007

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 19 00:29:14 &lt;editorgal&gt; but thomas and I are pretty much always
   here
   Jan 19 00:29:32 &lt;editorgal&gt; and now that many of the gang pop by more
   often
   Jan 19 00:29:43 &lt;editorgal&gt; Jimmy added the bar and snuck in a
   jukebox.
   Jan 19 00:29:52 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I want Mike Orr in here. :)
   Jan 19 00:30:02 &lt;editorgal&gt; he's at work.
   Jan 19 00:30:05 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; So? :)
   Jan 19 00:30:15 &lt;jkarns&gt; gotta get some herbie hancock on that 'box,
   then!
   Jan 19 00:30:27 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I'm sure he could use PySlither to get
   here. :P
   Jan 19 00:32:42 * jkarns wonders what PySlither is, and figures it's a
   metal band or something
   Jan 19 00:34:03 * jkarns gets it - a python based irc client ... \o/
   Jan 19 00:34:15 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; jkarns: A fictitous python script Mike
   Orr might write to get on IRC from work. Py for Python, and 'Slither'
   as in Snake, slippery.
   Jan 19 00:35:23 &lt;jkarns&gt; .. as in ben's recent remark about a
   'slithery python script' ..
   Jan 19 00:35:27 * jkarns nods
   Jan 19 00:35:41 * jimregan recites the fell incantation that opens the
   door to the good stuff
   Jan 19 00:35:55 &lt;jimregan&gt; Drinks anyone?
   Jan 19 00:36:12 &lt;jkarns&gt; cold bass ale!
   Jan 19 00:36:19 &lt;jimregan&gt; Coming up
   Jan 19 00:36:23 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; jimregan: Barkeep? Damn slow.
   Jan 19 00:36:31 * jimregan slides it down the bar
   Jan 19 00:36:41 * jimregan sweeps up the pieces of the glass
   Jan 19 00:36:49 &lt;jimregan&gt; Gotta get a hang of that
   Jan 19 00:36:51 * jkarns fetches
   Jan 19 00:37:03 * jimregan hands over this one carefully
   Jan 19 00:37:13 &lt;jkarns&gt; oops, ... the dog will drink it ...
   Jan 19 00:37:33 &lt;jkarns&gt; thankya ..
   Jan 19 00:37:35 &lt;jimregan&gt; Watzamocha anyone?
   Jan 19 00:38:50 &lt;jimregan&gt; Or freshly ground, freshly irradiated
   coffee?
   Jan 19 00:39:12 * jimregan pats his new particle accelerator
   Jan 19 00:39:22 &lt;jkarns&gt; yeah, some that's been through at least 10
   airport checkpoints
   Jan 19 00:39:42 &lt;editorgal&gt; heh
   Jan 19 00:40:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nah. No weapons grade coffee yet. Waiting
   for it to come through LA
   Jan 19 00:41:02 &lt;jimregan&gt; (When you hear about Arizona Bay in the
   news, you'll know it's here)
   Jan 19 00:41:15 &lt;jkarns&gt; doncha just love it when they run all your
   food and medicine through those airport irradiators?
   Jan 19 00:41:16 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heather, you may wish to consider moving
   Jan 19 00:41:42 &lt;editorgal&gt; back to LA so I can be closer to my
   coffee?
   Jan 19 00:42:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; No... about 3 timezones away
   Jan 19 00:42:09 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh I already did that
   Jan 19 00:42:18 &lt;editorgal&gt; thomas noticed I darn near live in his.
   Jan 19 00:42:20 &lt;jimregan&gt; /Someone/ will drop the coffee, I'm sure...
   Jan 19 00:42:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah, but Thomas pretty much makes up his
   timezone as he goes along.
   Jan 19 00:43:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah, yeah. You heard me - the kettle's
   black.
   Jan 19 00:43:42 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; GMT
   Jan 19 00:43:43 &lt;jkarns&gt; mine's GMT, greenwich mean twilight
   Jan 19 00:44:26 &lt;jkarns&gt; .. RIP, rod sterling ...
   Jan 19 00:45:09 &lt;jimregan&gt; I was in "Jimmy Mean Time" earlier, but
   I've lightened up
   Jan 19 00:45:42 &lt;jkarns&gt; your SO will 'preciate that
   Jan 19 00:48:10 &lt;jimregan&gt; SO? NO more like.
   Jan 19 00:49:01 &lt;editorgal&gt; jimregan: that pretty much describes me
   too.
   Jan 19 00:51:10 &lt;jimregan&gt; Eh? I haven't decided what I want the 'N'
   to stand for yet
   Jan 19 00:51:35 &lt;editorgal&gt; Nsignificant?
   Jan 19 00:51:58 &lt;jimregan&gt; Non-existant

   having
   Jan 19 03:40:46 &lt;okopnik&gt; Oh, good idea. I should have something...
   I'm getting a bit dry. BRB.
   Jan 19 03:41:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yowza! Coffee time!
   Jan 19 03:46:02 * jimregan kickstarts the jukebox
   Jan 19 03:46:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; Some Tool, I think.
   Jan 19 03:46:36 * jimregan puts on "Parabol" &amp; "Parabola"
   Jan 19 03:48:24 &lt;okopnik&gt; One thing about a Russian household...
   people would *kill* you if you tried to starve to death. :)
   Jan 19 03:48:56 &lt;okopnik&gt; I went downstairs to get something to drink,
   and came back with a plate of food.
   Jan 19 03:49:04 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh.
   Jan 19 03:49:56 &lt;okopnik&gt; Never mind that it's awesome food that I
   can't get while I'm at home, darn it!
   Jan 19 03:50:08 &lt;okopnik&gt; It's just... it's just... YUMMY. :)
   Jan 19 03:50:28 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 19 03:51:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; My one tiny taste of Polish food left me
   curious.
   Jan 19 03:51:10 &lt;okopnik&gt; My sister-in-law is an *amazing* cook - and
   I say that as a pretty damn good cook myself.
   Jan 19 03:51:50 &lt;jimregan&gt; It's pretty difficult to get interesting
   food around here.
   Jan 19 03:52:34 &lt;okopnik&gt; New York, you
   Jan 19 03:52:46 &lt;okopnik&gt; d have the opposite "problem":
   Jan 19 03:53:07 &lt;okopnik&gt; you can't _find_ boring food around here if
   you searched for it.
   Jan 19 03:53:10 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh. Maybe after I get my promotion &amp; can
   afford the the trip
   Jan 19 03:53:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; I start into it unofficially next week,
   officially pending the posting of the job opening
   Jan 19 03:54:17 &lt;jimregan&gt; Six month probationary period, but after
   that my pay goes up ~50%
   Jan 19 03:54:38 &lt;okopnik&gt; Very much the foodie town - I mean,
   Italians, Russians, and Jews? Whew. Corned beef sandwiches they have
   to use a forklift to deliver to your table... and the owner is likely
   to commit suicide if you can finish it.
   Jan 19 03:54:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 19 03:55:13 &lt;okopnik&gt; Into it... which it? (and congrats if it is
   what I think)
   Jan 19 03:55:33 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'm taking over as a senior operative
   Jan 19 03:55:44 &lt;okopnik&gt; Of?
   Jan 19 03:55:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; Erm... a line supervisor, basically.
   Jan 19 03:56:25 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'll be taught to drive a forklift, which
   is the cool part for me :)
   Jan 19 03:56:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; One of the things that's been keeping me in
   this job is the determination to be promoted before I left.
   Jan 19 03:56:50 &lt;okopnik&gt; Well hey, cool beans! Get me a corned beef
   samwish, will ya? :)
   Jan 19 03:56:56 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 19 03:57:24 &lt;jimregan&gt; Next thing is to record and release some
   music (this week)
   Jan 19 03:57:30 &lt;jimregan&gt; Then, quit smoking.
   Jan 19 03:57:33 &lt;okopnik&gt; YAY!
   Jan 19 03:57:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; Then this penitant portion of my life is at
   a close, and I can move on.
   Jan 19 03:57:52 &lt;okopnik&gt; Go, Jimmy! (and lots of other supportive
   noises)
   Jan 19 03:57:55 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 19 03:58:49 &lt;okopnik&gt; Hey, man, I'm all for friends improving
   their lives.
   Jan 19 03:59:37 &lt;jimregan&gt; I came across a link to the Tao Te Ching,
   courtesy of Raj, and it had exactly the missing piece to my personal
   puzzle
   Jan 19 03:59:44 &lt;okopnik&gt; ?
   Jan 19 04:00:23 &lt;okopnik&gt; Which particular piece?
   Jan 19 04:00:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; Basically, that the usefulness of a bowl, a
   room, etc. comes from the emptiness within.
   Jan 19 04:00:30 &lt;okopnik&gt; Ah. YES.
   Jan 19 04:00:47 &lt;okopnik&gt; Definitely familiar with that one; rang me
   like a bell when I read it.
   Jan 19 04:01:26 &lt;jimregan&gt; Well, I had a few days before that done
   some intense introspection, and ejected the black hole that had been
   there.
   Jan 19 04:01:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; Only to find a new emptiness. That quote
   put it in perspective.
   Jan 19 04:02:16 &lt;okopnik&gt; [Nod] Qualitatively different emptiness.
   Jan 19 04:02:43 &lt;jimregan&gt; It wasn't so much that I got rid of an
   emptiness; I got rid of the walls around it
   Jan 19 04:02:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; And got some great lyrics in the process :)
   Jan 19 04:03:27 &lt;okopnik&gt; Hey, [thread tangle]!
   Jan 19 04:03:32 &lt;jimregan&gt; ?
   Jan 19 04:03:39 &lt;okopnik&gt; Have you read much in a way of Polish poets?
   Jan 19 04:03:54 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nope. I'm still learning to pronounce
   Polish.
   Jan 19 04:04:03 &lt;okopnik&gt; Whatsername, Wyszowska or something? Stand
   by a few.
   Jan 19 04:04:04 &lt;jimregan&gt; Fighting misleading tutorial material.
   Jan 19 04:05:06 &lt;jimregan&gt; Trying to learn the basics of linguistics
   so I can understand how the material is framed.
   Jan 19 04:05:40 &lt;okopnik&gt; Wislawa Szymborska
   Jan 19 04:05:52 &lt;okopnik&gt; That's who I was thinking about.
   Jan 19 04:06:13 &lt;jimregan&gt; Plus, I'm going to be teaching my friend
   Pawel English in return for Polish lessons, so I've been putting
   thought into the difficulties Polish speakers have with it
   Jan 19 04:06:32 &lt;okopnik&gt; Pronunciation. :)
   Jan 19 04:06:38 &lt;okopnik&gt; &lt;=&gt;
   Jan 19 04:07:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; Well, I was thinking the dropping of the
   object in sentences, and the lack of a definitive object
   Jan 19 04:07:47 &lt;jimregan&gt; I think the pluperfect has fallen into
   disuse in Polish too
   Jan 19 04:08:09 &lt;okopnik&gt; Ah. Yeah, and the whole articles thing.
   Jan 19 04:08:12 &lt;jimregan&gt; But yeah, pronunciation is a big one.
   Jan 19 04:08:17 &lt;jimregan&gt; Articles thing?
   Jan 19 04:08:50 &lt;okopnik&gt; Yeah - 'a', 'the'... Russians have a
   terrible time with those, as I recall.
   Jan 19 04:08:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah.
   Jan 19 04:09:10 &lt;jimregan&gt; Trying to explain that is going to be fun
   :)
   Jan 19 04:09:54 &lt;okopnik&gt; Pretty much the problem in a nutshell. "What
   the hell arethose things *for*?"
   Jan 19 04:10:57 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh. I think you came up with a good
   example of what it is good for :)
   Jan 19 04:11:11 &lt;jimregan&gt; '/the/ problem'
   Jan 19 04:11:45 &lt;okopnik&gt; What, intonation isn't good enough for you?
   :)
   Jan 19 04:11:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; Then again, Polish is a highly
   context-driven language, so it probably won't seem that way :)
   Jan 19 04:13:24 &lt;jimregan&gt; I've got to make time from some proper
   study, but whenever I have a few moments I look over a few bits and
   pieces and just let it slowly sink in.
   Jan 19 04:14:01 &lt;okopnik&gt; Now that I've mentioned her, I'm looking at

   Jan 19 04:14:28 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah. I'm looking at one about torture at
   the moment.
   Jan 19 04:15:12 &lt;okopnik&gt; How about this one:

   Jan 19 04:15:21 &lt;okopnik&gt; 'A Contribution to Statistics'
   Jan 19 04:15:22 &lt;okopnik&gt; Out of a hundred people
   Jan 19 04:15:22 &lt;okopnik&gt; those who always know better
   Jan 19 04:15:22 &lt;okopnik&gt; -fifty-two
   Jan 19 04:15:24 &lt;okopnik&gt; doubting every step
   Jan 19 04:15:26 &lt;okopnik&gt; -nearly all the rest,

   Jan 19 04:15:31 &lt;okopnik&gt; if it doesn't take too long
   Jan 19 04:15:34 &lt;okopnik&gt; -as high as forty-nine,
   Jan 19 04:15:36 &lt;okopnik&gt; always good
   Jan 19 04:15:39 &lt;okopnik&gt; because they can't be otherwise
   Jan 19 04:15:41 &lt;okopnik&gt; -four, well maybe five,
   Jan 19 04:15:44 &lt;okopnik&gt; able to admire without envy

   Jan 19 04:15:51 &lt;okopnik&gt; induced by fleeting youth
   Jan 19 04:15:54 &lt;okopnik&gt; -sixty, give or take a few,
   Jan 19 04:15:56 &lt;okopnik&gt; not to be taken lightly
   Jan 19 04:15:59 &lt;okopnik&gt; -forty and four,
   Jan 19 04:16:01 &lt;okopnik&gt; living in constant fear
   Jan 19 04:16:04 &lt;okopnik&gt; of someone or something

   Jan 19 04:16:14 &lt;okopnik&gt; harmless singly, savage in crowds
   Jan 19 04:16:16 &lt;okopnik&gt; -half at least,
   Jan 19 04:16:19 &lt;okopnik&gt; cruel
   Jan 19 04:16:21 &lt;okopnik&gt; when forced by circumstances
   Jan 19 04:16:24 &lt;okopnik&gt; -better not to know
   Jan 19 04:16:26 &lt;okopnik&gt; even ballpark figures,
   Jan 19 04:16:29 &lt;okopnik&gt; wise after the fact
   Jan 19 04:16:31 &lt;okopnik&gt; -just a couple more
   Jan 19 04:16:34 &lt;okopnik&gt; than wise before it,
   Jan 19 04:16:36 &lt;okopnik&gt; taking only things from life
   Jan 19 04:16:39 &lt;okopnik&gt; -thirty
   Jan 19 04:16:42 &lt;okopnik&gt; (I wish I were wrong),
   Jan 19 04:16:44 &lt;okopnik&gt; hunched in pain,
   Jan 19 04:16:47 &lt;okopnik&gt; no flashlight in the dark
   Jan 19 04:16:49 &lt;okopnik&gt; -eighty-three
   Jan 19 04:16:52 &lt;okopnik&gt; sooner or later,
   Jan 19 04:16:54 &lt;okopnik&gt; righteous
   Jan 19 04:16:57 &lt;okopnik&gt; -thirty-five, which is a lot,
   Jan 19 04:16:59 &lt;okopnik&gt; righteous
   Jan 19 04:17:02 &lt;okopnik&gt; and understanding
   Jan 19 04:17:04 &lt;okopnik&gt; -three,
   Jan 19 04:17:07 &lt;okopnik&gt; worthy of compassion

   Jan 19 04:17:12 &lt;okopnik&gt; mortal
   Jan 19 04:17:14 &lt;okopnik&gt; -a hundred out of a hundred.
   Jan 19 04:17:17 &lt;okopnik&gt; thus far this figure still remains
   unchanged.
   Jan 19 04:17:19 &lt;okopnik&gt; -- Wislawa Szymborska
   Jan 19 04:17:37 &lt;jimregan&gt; Rings with what Rick was talking about.
   Jan 19 04:17:59 &lt;okopnik&gt; Yep. That struck me too.
   Jan 19 04:18:16 &lt;jimregan&gt; always good / because they can't be
   otherwise
   Jan 19 04:18:22 &lt;jimregan&gt; That rang with me.
   Jan 19 04:18:26 &lt;okopnik&gt; "better not to know"...
   Jan 19 04:18:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; The demon I defeated recently was that I
   was regarding myself as evil
   Jan 19 04:18:48 &lt;okopnik&gt; Ah. Well, me, I know otherwise. However...
   Jan 19 04:19:06 &lt;okopnik&gt; I don't regard myself as evil in any way...
   Jan 19 04:19:32 &lt;jimregan&gt; Well... I lost my faith at a young age, and
   with my faith questioned, I turned on my morality
   Jan 19 04:19:53 &lt;okopnik&gt; ...just human. And on the average, I must
   say that I'm pretty pleased with the balance; it's better than I would
   have expected.
   Jan 19 04:20:08 &lt;jimregan&gt; I decided long ago that I was capable of
   every evil and despicable act imaginable, and of enjoying them
   Jan 19 04:20:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; It never occurred to me to look at it from
   the point of view that... "hey, I /am/ capable of it, and I know it,
   but I /choose/ not to"
   Jan 19 04:20:45 &lt;okopnik&gt; Hmm. Can't say I've ever believed that last
   part about myself.
   Jan 19 04:21:25 &lt;jimregan&gt; Not because a priest or parent told me not
   to, but because I've checked the scales myself
   Jan 19 04:21:37 &lt;okopnik&gt; [Nod] Which is what differentiates 'evil'
   from simply ignorant.
   Jan 19 04:21:59 &lt;okopnik&gt; If you just don't know, and are doing
   something negative, you're not evil.
   Jan 19 04:22:19 &lt;okopnik&gt; (negative = "really horrible")
   Jan 19 04:22:34 &lt;okopnik&gt; If you *do*, though - different kettle.
   Jan 19 04:22:42 &lt;jimregan&gt; There are circumstances, still, where I
   would kill, but not likely.
   Jan 19 04:23:07 &lt;okopnik&gt; I can think of several in which I would
   kill.
   Jan 19 04:23:17 &lt;okopnik&gt; However, they are all pretty clearly
   defined.
   Jan 19 04:23:49 &lt;okopnik&gt; And I can see the necessity for all of them
   even from a rational frame of mind.
   Jan 19 04:23:52 &lt;jimregan&gt; If anyone ever kills or seriously hurts my
   son, intentionally, they can expect a slow, agonising death
   Jan 19 04:24:16 &lt;okopnik&gt; Something like that would be one, yes.
   Jan 19 04:25:09 &lt;okopnik&gt; I will kill to protect those who are *mine*.
   There aren't many of those, but - yeah, no doubt.
   Jan 19 04:25:42 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh. I noticed a pattern in my life after I
   came to terms with that.
   Jan 19 04:25:52 &lt;okopnik&gt; Hmm?
   Jan 19 04:26:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; I have a need for someone who can act as my
   moral compass.
   Jan 19 04:26:17 &lt;okopnik&gt; Interesting. Why do you think so?
   Jan 19 04:26:33 &lt;jimregan&gt; In school, my friend Paul (my son's
   godfather); in college, Martin; now, Trev.
   Jan 19 04:27:12 &lt;okopnik&gt; So... who makes the ultimate moral decision
   in trusting them to determine your morality? :)
   Jan 19 04:27:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; I've always had at least one geographically
   close friend who has an unshakeable moral sense
   Jan 19 04:27:39 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nah, just someone I can bounce these ideas
   off
   Jan 19 04:28:04 &lt;okopnik&gt; If you can't determine your moral stance,
   how can you determine theirs?
   Jan 19 04:28:09 &lt;jimregan&gt; A solid surface against which to test my
   elasticity
   Jan 19 04:28:28 &lt;okopnik&gt; Ah. Well, sounding boards are good things to
   have.
   Jan 19 04:28:50 &lt;jimregan&gt; The voice of the morality I was brought up
   with is still loud and clear.
   Jan 19 04:28:55 &lt;okopnik&gt; Every guitar I know says so.
   Jan 19 04:29:06 &lt;jimregan&gt; I just need to argue with someone other
   than myself from time to time.
   Jan 19 04:29:35 &lt;okopnik&gt; Sure - I develop and refine my ideas this
   way.
   Jan 19 04:29:35 &lt;jimregan&gt; Though I also recently realised that this
   other voice isn't trying to argue, it's trying to agree.
   Jan 19 04:30:05 &lt;okopnik&gt; In all aspects? That's the part to be
   careful of.
   Jan 19 04:30:13 &lt;jimregan&gt; No.
   Jan 19 04:30:19 &lt;okopnik&gt; (Even - especially - if it is.)
   Jan 19 04:30:49 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'm still capable of being in two minds
   about things.
   Jan 19 04:31:20 &lt;jimregan&gt; It's more a fundamental agreement, that
   these things are the right things to give this sort of consideration
   to, y'know?
   Jan 19 04:31:35 &lt;okopnik&gt; Your morality may/will change with time. A
   fixed morality in a book won't. Revisiting decisions, particularly
   moral ones, is something I see as very important.
   Jan 19 04:32:01 &lt;okopnik&gt; [Nod] The issues themselves, the root ones,
   they don't change much.
   Jan 19 04:32:33 &lt;okopnik&gt; That's why we can read an author from 2000
   years ago and enjoy every twist of the plot.
   Jan 19 04:32:43 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah.
   Jan 19 04:33:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; I've been getting a lot of this stuff
   recently, reading Paulo Coelho, because his books basically use
   archetypes
   Jan 19 04:34:57 &lt;jimregan&gt; Getting past the stumbling block of
   thinking that these things couldn't be that simple was probably the
   most important thing
   Jan 19 04:36:03 &lt;okopnik&gt; :) Man, ain't that the truth!
   Jan 19 04:36:30 &lt;jimregan&gt; It's made me a bit more superstitious
   though :)
   Jan 19 04:37:10 &lt;okopnik&gt; ???
   Jan 19 04:37:34 &lt;jimregan&gt; After I asked my supervisor about getting
   the job, he basically hinted that I would have had the job 6 months
   ago
   Jan 19 04:37:43 &lt;jimregan&gt; If I'd filled out an application form
   Jan 19 04:37:54 &lt;okopnik&gt; [rolling eyes]
   Jan 19 04:38:09 &lt;jimregan&gt; That was something I could have looked at
   negatively, but I'm glad it didn't happen
   Jan 19 04:38:26 &lt;jimregan&gt; If I had, I wouldn't have cut my finger.
   Jan 19 04:38:42 &lt;jimregan&gt; If I hadn't cut my finger, I wouldn't have
   gotten to know Beata
   Jan 19 04:39:20 &lt;jimregan&gt; I wouldn't have had the... coincidence that
   lead to me breaking out of the spiral of self defeatism
   Jan 19 04:39:30 &lt;okopnik&gt; One of the things I had to teach my brother
   today is the one prnciple of salesmanship that's managed to stick in
   my brain: at the end of your pitch, *ASK* for what you want, clearly
   and specifically.
   Jan 19 04:39:56 &lt;jimregan&gt; ?
   Jan 19 04:41:37 &lt;jimregan&gt; Erm... I'm not chasing her anymore
   Jan 19 04:41:44 &lt;okopnik&gt; He was writing a letter to a customer who
   had been dragging their feet on a payment. He did the whole "you owe
   us $BLAH, and you know the payment cycle starts on the $BLAH of the
   month... thank you..."
   Jan 19 04:41:50 &lt;okopnik&gt; What, again? :)
   Jan 19 04:43:02 &lt;jimregan&gt; Well, firstly, I don't have a good leash on
   the inner puppy, but mainly... I owe her the chunk of my soul I
   thought I'd thrown away. If she's happy, I don't want to interfere.
   Jan 19 04:44:56 &lt;okopnik&gt; Jimmy... you don't *owe* ANYBODY even the
   slightest bit of your soul. You can be grateful to people for helping
   you recover or discover it, but it's totally *yours*, in any way that
   can possibly count. Responsibility and ownership, complete.
   Jan 19 04:45:10 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 19 04:45:17 &lt;jimregan&gt; Thanks Ben.
   Jan 19 04:45:37 &lt;okopnik&gt; Hey, I get protective of my friends. Even
   from them. :)
   Jan 19 04:45:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah, fuck it. That was a classic example
   of puppy speak, wasn't it?
   Jan 19 04:45:58 &lt;okopnik&gt; :)))
   Jan 19 04:46:15 &lt;jimregan&gt; And I said /if/, didn't I?
   Jan 19 04:46:19 &lt;okopnik&gt; Didn't take you long to get past it, did it?
   Jan 19 04:46:36 &lt;okopnik&gt; :) You did.
   Jan 19 04:46:43 &lt;jimregan&gt; I told you the two parts weren't in
   complete agreement.
   Jan 19 04:46:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 19 04:47:07 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nah, I found out who her boyfriend is
   today.
   Jan 19 04:47:28 &lt;okopnik&gt; [shrug] What, did they have perfection on
   sale at your local market this week? You're not required to have that
   in stock, either.
   Jan 19 04:47:57 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hey, my flaws are my best parts!
   Jan 19 04:48:08 &lt;okopnik&gt; :)
   Jan 19 04:48:38 &lt;jimregan&gt; "She's with /that/ dipshit?"
   Jan 19 04:48:56 &lt;okopnik&gt; [laugh]
   Jan 19 04:49:19 &lt;okopnik&gt; Lost all respect for her over him, didja?
   Jan 19 04:49:29 &lt;jimregan&gt; I worked with him last week. Didn't know
   who he was, didn't speak a word to him, nor him to me (too busy).
   Instantly disliked him anyway.
   Jan 19 04:50:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; I normally stop the 'instantly dislike'
   reflex in its tracks, but couldn't find a good reason to do so for
   that guy.
   Jan 19 04:52:08 &lt;okopnik&gt; Happens. Not too often for me, and I'm
   usually pretty good about discovering why, anyway.
   Jan 19 04:52:35 &lt;jimregan&gt; Same here.
   Jan 19 04:52:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'm bloody good at reading people.
   Jan 19 04:53:55 &lt;jimregan&gt; Did I tell you about the Christmas present
   I got her?
   Jan 19 04:53:58 &lt;okopnik&gt; Says a fair amount about you, Jimmy.
   Jan 19 04:54:05 &lt;okopnik&gt; Nope.
   Jan 19 04:54:29 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh, well. I got her a Paulo Coelho book, in
   Polish.
   Jan 19 04:54:49 &lt;jimregan&gt; She basically told me, to my ears, to get
   her that.
   Jan 19 04:54:54 &lt;okopnik&gt; Oh, yeah... I forgot. You'd mentioned it.
   Jan 19 04:55:03 &lt;jimregan&gt; She didn't know that though.
   Jan 19 04:55:08 &lt;okopnik&gt; And?
   Jan 19 04:55:30 &lt;jimregan&gt; She swayed on the spot "Oh my God! Is this
   a joke?"
   Jan 19 04:55:42 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Got me the same thing in English)
   Jan 19 04:56:03 &lt;okopnik&gt; Whoa!
   Jan 19 04:56:05 &lt;jimregan&gt; Got a text from her later "You made one of
   my dreams come true"
   Jan 19 04:56:58 &lt;okopnik&gt; And you _don't_ want to go out with this
   girl, even to save her from that vile creep? :)
   Jan 19 04:57:29 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)))
   Jan 19 04:58:38 &lt;jimregan&gt; Fuck it. Yes I do. I was just shying away
   from changing certain realities.
   Jan 19 04:58:45 &lt;okopnik&gt; 'Scuse me a bit - my nephew is flooding the
   LAN here with his net.game nearly to the point of unusability. I have
   to DOS him for a while. :) BIAF.
   Jan 19 04:58:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 19 05:00:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hey Ben, Jason can't get in - you locked
   the damn door!
   Jan 19 05:01:27 &lt;jimregan&gt; Ah. Never mind. Unregistered nick
   Jan 19 05:01:40 &lt;okopnik&gt; Whoops! How did I do that?
   Jan 19 05:02:03 &lt;jimregan&gt; He's registering his nick now, 'sok
   Jan 19 05:02:58 &lt;okopnik&gt; (Oh, and the LAN is clear now. Must have
   been something wrong with the network, the poor boy got knocked off or
   something... :)

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 02 00:42:57 &lt;editorgal&gt; start a wiki entry on it and stub it with
   the netjoke about why the countries can't have a summit that makes
   sense
   Jan 02 00:43:13 &lt;editorgal&gt; and the one about the military not getting
   the same language
   Jan 02 00:43:13 &lt;jimregan&gt; ?
   Jan 02 00:43:25 &lt;editorgal&gt; the military one first, its simpler
   Jan 02 00:44:02 &lt;editorgal&gt; When the Marines say secure a building,
   they mean bomb the area and go room to room with guns, taking
   prisoners and recuing hostages.
   Jan 02 00:44:02 &lt;jimregan&gt; Eh? My gears have been running slowly all
   day
   Jan 02 00:44:10 &lt;jimregan&gt; Ah
   Jan 02 00:44:28 &lt;editorgal&gt; When the army says secure a building they
   mean make sure it can't shoot at you. if this means blow it up
   entirely, fine.
   Jan 02 00:44:52 &lt;editorgal&gt; when the Navy says secure a building they
   mean lock the door when you leave.
   Jan 02 00:44:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 02 00:45:07 &lt;editorgal&gt; when the Air Force says secure a building
   they mean lease with option to buy.
   Jan 02 00:49:40 &lt;jimregan&gt; rofl
   Jan 02 00:50:58 &lt;editorgal&gt; ok the other one
   Jan 02 00:51:13 &lt;editorgal&gt; an international survey doesn't work out.
   why? language. take a look...
   Jan 02 00:51:24 &lt;editorgal&gt; only one question was asked
   Jan 02 00:51:33 &lt;editorgal&gt; "Please give your honest opinion
   Jan 02 00:51:37 &lt;editorgal&gt; about solutions to the food shortage in
   the rest of the world?"
   Jan 02 00:51:55 &lt;editorgal&gt; in South America they didn't understand
   'please'
   Jan 02 00:52:10 &lt;editorgal&gt; in Scotland they didn't understand 'give'
   Jan 02 00:52:16 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 02 00:52:22 &lt;editorgal&gt; in Eastern Europe they didn't understand
   'honest'
   Jan 02 00:52:33 &lt;editorgal&gt; in China they didn't understand 'opinion'
   Jan 02 00:52:38 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'm guessing the US didn't understand
   'shortage'
   Jan 02 00:52:49 &lt;editorgal&gt; In the Middle East they didn't understand
   'solution'
   Jan 02 00:53:02 &lt;editorgal&gt; in Africa they didn't understand 'food'
   Jan 02 00:53:15 &lt;editorgal&gt; in Western Europe they didn't understand
   'shortage'
   Jan 02 00:53:33 &lt;editorgal&gt; and in the USA they didn't understand
   'rest of the world'
   Jan 02 00:54:19 &lt;editorgal&gt; (I'm sure there might be a few mortified
   souls out there who didn't understand what 'funny' meant when they
   read this, either.)

   Jan 02 14:04:07 &lt;jimregan&gt; hi
   Jan 02 14:04:09 &lt;editorgal&gt; how's the hand?
   Jan 02 14:04:19 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; still the same :)
   Jan 02 14:04:27 &lt;jimregan&gt; Still attached?
   Jan 02 14:04:27 &lt;editorgal&gt; attached is good
   Jan 02 14:04:32 &lt;jimregan&gt; Good good.
   Jan 02 14:04:34 * editorgal high fives jimmy
   Jan 02 14:04:39 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; four more weeks of cast to go, at least
   Jan 02 14:04:45 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; lol - yep, still attached :)
   Jan 02 14:04:53 * editorgal scribbles on Frodo's cast
   Jan 02 14:05:04 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; :)
   Jan 02 14:05:11 * jimregan writes carefully on Frodo's cast
   Jan 02 14:05:25 * editorgal checks the font on his word
   Jan 02 14:05:26 &lt;jimregan&gt; (which ends up looking like more of a
   scribble than editorgal's)
   Jan 02 14:05:33 &lt;editorgal&gt; rofl
   Jan 02 14:05:36 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; lol
   Jan 02 14:05:56 &lt;editorgal&gt; your write like my dad jimmy
   Jan 02 14:06:02 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh. I have to write in block capitals
   because it's only illegible that way.
   Jan 02 14:06:05 &lt;editorgal&gt; ...almost unrecognizable
   Jan 02 14:06:23 &lt;editorgal&gt; nah dad's block caps are neat
   Jan 02 14:06:33 &lt;editorgal&gt; from years of deskchecking in grid paper
   Jan 02 14:06:56 &lt;editorgal&gt; his handwriting however could get him
   accused of being a doctor
   Jan 02 14:07:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; heh
   Jan 02 14:07:14 &lt;jimregan&gt; My handwriting looks like arabic
   Jan 02 14:07:19 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 02 14:07:26 &lt;editorgal&gt; I know someone who does calligraphy, and
   her ordinary printing is 1) fast 2) pretttttty
   Jan 02 14:07:45 &lt;editorgal&gt; you a lefty jimmy?
   Jan 02 14:07:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nope
   Jan 02 14:08:06 &lt;jimregan&gt; Though my handwriting looks better with my
   left than my right :)
   Jan 02 14:08:11 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh ok, most lefty seem to whine their
   handwriting is ugly, just curious.
   Jan 02 14:08:34 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nah. I've been using computers since I was
   7, so I always prefered to type
   Jan 02 14:08:40 &lt;editorgal&gt; &lt;- 5
   Jan 02 14:08:48 &lt;editorgal&gt; maybe 4 and a half
   Jan 02 14:08:52 &lt;jimregan&gt; Eep.
   Jan 02 14:08:59 &lt;editorgal&gt; I swear
   Jan 02 14:09:05 &lt;jimregan&gt; Ah
   Jan 02 14:09:15 &lt;editorgal&gt; dad says my first programming was in some
   batch control language I've never heard of
   Jan 02 14:09:28 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 02 14:09:43 &lt;jimregan&gt; CP/M was my first OS
   Jan 02 14:09:52 &lt;editorgal&gt; giggle
   Jan 02 14:10:07 * editorgal puts on the ol beard and cane look
   Jan 02 14:10:11 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 02 14:10:18 &lt;editorgal&gt; pdp/11-60. god knows what OS really.

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 02 15:37:45 * editorgal is thinkng the laundrette might mark up
   voices by who drinks and doesn't
   Jan 02 15:37:56 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh. I was think that too.
   Jan 02 15:37:59 &lt;editorgal&gt; vbeers for drinkers, coffee for those of
   us who don't
   Jan 02 15:38:05 &lt;editorgal&gt; ok it's a plan
   Jan 02 15:38:17 &lt;jimregan&gt; "I love it when a plan comes together"
   Jan 02 15:38:18 &lt;editorgal&gt; vbeer unless they're on the teetotal list
   Jan 02 15:38:29 * editorgal pats assoc arrays
   Jan 02 15:38:55 &lt;jimregan&gt; So... to check who drinks and who doesn't,
   everyone is going to get hashed?
   Jan 02 15:39:05 &lt;jimregan&gt; griiiiiin
   Jan 02 15:39:14 &lt;editorgal&gt; yeah
   Jan 02 15:39:18 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; lol
   Jan 02 15:39:28 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh, sorry
   Jan 02 15:39:34 &lt;jimregan&gt; Watzamocha
   Jan 02 15:39:44 &lt;jimregan&gt; Can I get two vbeers :))))
   Jan 02 15:39:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; j/k
   Jan 02 15:39:57 &lt;editorgal&gt; I could give you a tall one..
   Jan 02 15:40:32 &lt;editorgal&gt; anyways they'll look tall, because if I do
   a coffee mug in proportion to a pint, they're shorter
   Jan 02 15:41:54 &lt;jimregan&gt; Right... gotta diff to members-faq.html to
   send to Ben.
   Jan 02 15:43:30 * editorgal ponders a stein for really heavy beer
   drinkers, won't bother unless someone asks after it.
   Jan 02 15:45:55 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 02 15:46:03 * jimregan googles 'stein'
   Jan 02 15:46:39 &lt;editorgal&gt; capped beer mug, usually made of metal,
   sometimes heavy glass
   Jan 02 15:46:57 &lt;jimregan&gt; Ah
   Jan 02 15:46:58 &lt;editorgal&gt; often great artwork
   Jan 02 15:47:07 &lt;jimregan&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_stein :)
   Jan 02 15:47:08 &lt;editorgal&gt; the linuxbierwanderung guys have steins
   Jan 02 15:47:19 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeah. I gotta go on one of those
   Jan 02 15:47:32 &lt;jimregan&gt; http://www.beerstein.net/articles/bsb-1.htm
   :)))
   Jan 02 15:48:06 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; I don't like drinking from steins... I
   prefer a _good_ glass...
   Jan 02 15:48:40 &lt;jimregan&gt;
   http://www.findgift.com/Graphics/Gifts/PR_35025.jpg
   Jan 02 15:48:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; Like that?
   Jan 02 15:49:20 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; lol - I actually drank from one of those,
   once...
   Jan 02 15:49:22 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; but nah :)
   Jan 02 15:49:52 &lt;jimregan&gt; I was in a drinking competition with those.
   Jan 02 15:49:58 &lt;jimregan&gt; Got through to the final!
   Jan 02 15:50:12 &lt;jimregan&gt; My best time was 36 seconds
   Jan 02 15:50:17 &lt;editorgal&gt; damn that's a tiny pic
   Jan 02 15:50:25 &lt;editorgal&gt; uh, I think that's a yard of beer
   Jan 02 15:50:25 &lt;jimregan&gt; Here's a half yard:

   Jan 02 15:50:33 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; more like this :)
   Jan 02 15:50:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; Yeep.
   Jan 02 15:51:03 &lt;Frodo-NL&gt; (it happens to be my favourite beer -
   Westvleteren Abt)
   Jan 02 15:51:04 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nah. Gimme a pint glass.
   Jan 02 15:51:24 &lt;jimregan&gt; Grr. You can push off. The tag drinks list
   is done!
   Jan 02 15:51:27 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 02 15:51:49 &lt;editorgal&gt; anyways vbeer and coffee are fine
   Jan 02 15:51:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 02 15:52:18 &lt;jimregan&gt; (just when I was going to look for a
   tequila bottle image)
   Jan 02 15:52:48 --- You are now known as senor_tequila
   Jan 02 15:52:51 &lt;senor_tequila&gt; :)
   Jan 02 15:53:19 &lt;editorgal&gt; no
   Jan 02 15:53:29 --- You are now known as jimregan
   Jan 02 15:53:31 &lt;editorgal&gt; I'd want it to be recognizable and amusing
   in the small form
   Jan 02 15:53:34 * jimregan pouts
   Jan 02 15:53:46 &lt;editorgal&gt; nobody would get why a bottle's any better
   than vbeer
   Jan 02 15:53:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; (It's after Christmas, so I can)

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 02 17:31:42 * editorgal got distracted. Thomas got his xmas
   present.
   Jan 02 17:31:43 &lt;editorgal&gt; :D
   Jan 02 17:32:01 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 02 17:32:18 &lt;editorgal&gt; well presents really
   Jan 02 17:32:36 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nice.
   Jan 02 17:32:45 &lt;editorgal&gt; when they told me I had to have it
   repacked for intl, I made sure the packing material wasn't a waste
   Jan 02 17:32:54 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh.
   Jan 02 17:33:08 &lt;jimregan&gt; Bubble wrap?
   Jan 02 17:33:14 &lt;jimregan&gt; Bubble wrap never goes to waste :)
   Jan 02 17:33:14 &lt;editorgal&gt; so a nice antistatic bubble pack and one
   of my fluffier scarves went along for the ride
   Jan 02 17:33:59 &lt;editorgal&gt; true but this is even better
   Jan 02 17:34:09 &lt;editorgal&gt; considering he works on raw devices at
   times.
   Jan 02 17:34:17 &lt;jimregan&gt; My sister got me a portable phone charger
   'cos she knows how much I love my phone
   Jan 02 17:34:30 &lt;editorgal&gt; ok so that's what she got your phone
   Jan 02 17:34:30 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh.
   Jan 02 17:34:35 &lt;editorgal&gt; what'd she get you?
   Jan 02 17:34:43 &lt;jimregan&gt; Erm... that.
   Jan 02 17:34:50 * editorgal wonders when jimmy will marry his phone
   Jan 02 17:34:54 &lt;jimregan&gt; My other sister got me sweets.
   Jan 02 17:35:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh, that reminds me.
   Jan 02 17:35:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; I got a message just after you went
   yesterday: "My phone break up with your phone"
   Jan 02 17:35:35 &lt;jimregan&gt; :)
   Jan 02 17:35:44 &lt;editorgal&gt; did you only get one of it?
   Jan 02 17:35:47 &lt;jimregan&gt; (only got that one twice)
   Jan 02 17:36:03 &lt;jimregan&gt; "My phone is heartbroken"
   Jan 02 17:36:05 &lt;editorgal&gt; right so they're still going together only
   5 times
   Jan 02 17:36:12 &lt;editorgal&gt; lol
   Jan 02 17:36:19 &lt;jimregan&gt; "I'm going to stop texting you, because my
   phone is sulking"
   Jan 02 17:36:30 &lt;editorgal&gt; hahaha
   Jan 02 17:37:00 &lt;jimregan&gt; In the meantime I asked what type of phone
   she had, googled it, gave up on the ringtone idea
   Jan 02 17:37:13 &lt;editorgal&gt; not a re-tonable phone?
   Jan 02 17:37:23 &lt;jimregan&gt; So I emailed her a picture of a dozen roses
   and one of a Claddagh ring, from my phone to hers
   Jan 02 17:37:36 &lt;jimregan&gt; No, though it can use actual sounds.
   Jan 02 17:37:37 &lt;editorgal&gt; aww it's trying to say sorry how sweeeet
   Jan 02 17:38:19 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nah... this was the "my phone is proposing"
   thing, after she said she didn't see flowers or a ring
   Jan 02 17:38:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; I can claim innocence about the timing :)
   Jan 02 17:39:06 &lt;editorgal&gt; lol
   Jan 02 17:39:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; I can always baffle her with techno babble
   bullshit
   Jan 02 17:40:06 &lt;editorgal&gt; right. so when were you going to do
   coffee, and will you have to use paper airplanes because the phones
   won't do lunch?
   Jan 02 17:40:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; Ha ha.
   Jan 02 17:40:36 &lt;editorgal&gt; hey just checkin'
   Jan 02 17:40:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'll probably bump onto her on the way
   to/from work next week.
   Jan 02 17:41:04 &lt;jimregan&gt; I'll bow: "Your Highness".
   Jan 02 17:41:40 &lt;jimregan&gt; (she wants to marry a prince)
   Jan 02 17:42:21 &lt;editorgal&gt; aren't princesses your grace?
   Jan 02 17:42:35 &lt;jimregan&gt; Duke/Duchess
   Jan 02 17:42:41 &lt;editorgal&gt; oh ok
   Jan 02 17:42:47 &lt;jimregan&gt; (iirc)
   Jan 02 17:42:51 &lt;editorgal&gt; hm
   Jan 02 17:43:02 &lt;editorgal&gt; wikipedia::forms of address ?
   Jan 02 17:43:06 &lt;jimregan&gt; Highness for a member of a royal family,
   majesty for a reigning monarch/next in line
   Jan 02 17:43:13 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh.
   Jan 02 17:44:12 &lt;jimregan&gt;
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_(manner_of_address)

<p><strong>From #tag-chat

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 03 00:56:45 &lt;okopnik&gt; Oh, totally off LG topics - you guys would
   *love* the weirdness of this hotel I'm in....
   Jan 03 00:57:06 &lt;okopnik&gt; I'm in room 1215. Care to take a guess what
   floor it's on?
   Jan 03 00:57:36 &lt;okopnik&gt; There's an electric outlet in the elevator.
   Jan 03 00:57:39 &lt;okopnik&gt; ....
   Jan 03 00:58:05 &lt;okopnik&gt; Presumably, because the elevator takes SO
   long that you should be able to recharge your phone while going from 1
   to 2.
   Jan 03 00:58:27 &lt;editorgal&gt; the 13th floor because there's an M level
   between 1 and 2 ?
   Jan 03 00:58:39 &lt;okopnik&gt; As you exit the elevator, rooms 1214 and
   1216 bracket the elevator....
   Jan 03 00:58:55 &lt;okopnik&gt; (Nope - the 2nd floor. [scratches head])
   Jan 03 00:58:55 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I never understood how you consider
   level 0 to be "Ground" and Ground to be below level 0. Most strange.
   Jan 03 00:59:23 &lt;okopnik&gt; ....but that doesn't matter, because the
   *next* room on the opposite side is - 1225.
   Jan 03 00:59:24 &lt;editorgal&gt; well they have a tendency to only mark one
   level ground
   Jan 03 00:59:33 &lt;editorgal&gt; but sometimes more than one level leads to
   the outdoors
   Jan 03 00:59:54 &lt;editorgal&gt; maybe the rooms are numbered their
   dialcode.
   Jan 03 01:00:00 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; That threw me at Uni last year -- I
   pressed 'G' thinking it was ground, but actually it was the basement.
   :)
   Jan 03 01:00:05 &lt;okopnik&gt; 1215 is *way the hell around a bend and a
   couple of corners... and the count _revereses_ as you go up the
   corridor.
   Jan 03 01:00:33 &lt;jimregan&gt; Ben, you have entered... the twilight zone.
   Jan 03 01:00:39 &lt;okopnik&gt; Jimmy, do you know if Bloody Stupid Johnson
   is still in business, by any chance? :)
   Jan 03 01:00:40 &lt;jimregan&gt; With room service!
   Jan 03 01:00:43 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 03 01:01:10 &lt;okopnik&gt; I suspect that if I search the drawers in
   the room, I may find The Colossus....
   Jan 03 01:01:14 &lt;jimregan&gt; Hmm. If so, it was probably meant to have
   been a well
   Jan 03 01:01:30 * okopnik cracks up
   Jan 03 01:01:38 &lt;editorgal&gt; Thomas, so they meant G as in lowest
   instead of G as in outdoors
   Jan 03 01:01:40 &lt;editorgal&gt; ?
   Jan 03 01:02:02 &lt;okopnik&gt; pTerry references
   Jan 03 01:02:04 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Yes. Ground in this case is Level 0.
   Jan 03 01:02:27 &lt;editorgal&gt; computer department, computers count from
   zero.
   Jan 03 01:02:55 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; This lift is for the entire building
   (well, one of them) :).
   Jan 03 01:03:16 &lt;okopnik&gt; "All sane array indexes start at zero"...
   but "real world" items always start at one!
   Jan 03 01:05:27 &lt;editorgal&gt; I suppose this Uni is hyperaware of not
   being the real world
   Jan 03 01:07:06 &lt;okopnik&gt; Oh, despite the fact that the scummiest
   hole-in-the-wall coffee shop in DC has wireless access, this
   supposedly-luxury hotel has a "business center". *One* computer. *One*
   Ethernet connection. I suspect that if I unplugged it, these people
   would wet their pants and start crying in terror.
   Jan 03 01:07:21 &lt;okopnik&gt; Oh, and they want *money* to use the thing.
   Jan 03 01:07:34 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Sounds better equipped than the labs at
   Uni.
   Jan 03 01:08:28 &lt;okopnik&gt; Well, heck, Thomas... come on over any time,
   then. :) We'll fix you right up.
   Jan 03 01:08:56 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Heh.

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 03 03:10:10 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; jimregan: I swear the before/after pics
   of you with/without your facial fluff are different people.
   Jan 03 03:10:20 &lt;jimregan&gt; He
   Jan 03 03:10:25 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh, even
   Jan 03 03:10:30 &lt;jimregan&gt; No, same me.
   Jan 03 03:10:47 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; That's scary.
   Jan 03 03:11:13 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; To think you looked so different before.
   Hardly the same person in appearence.
   Jan 03 03:11:17 &lt;jimregan&gt; Imagine how my friends felt when I turned
   up to the pub.
   Jan 03 03:11:28 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Jimmmmmmmmmmay!
   Jan 03 03:11:33 &lt;jimregan&gt; &lt;squint&gt;
   Jan 03 03:11:33 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; No doubt.
   Jan 03 03:11:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; "Whathefuckdjadotoyerhair????"
   Jan 03 03:12:02 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; (That was done in my best Irish accent,
   btw).
   Jan 03 03:12:08 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 03 03:12:43 &lt;jimregan&gt; Sorry, that should've been:
   "Whathefuckdjadotayerhair????"
   Jan 03 03:13:03 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Geordi?
   Jan 03 03:13:20 &lt;jimregan&gt; Nah. You'd have to hear a Thurles accent.
   Jan 03 03:14:05 &lt;jimregan&gt; "I /fair/ didn't recognise ya, lad"
   Jan 03 03:14:06 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Can't say that I have.
   Jan 03 03:15:04 &lt;jimregan&gt; Though my friend Trev, to do him credit,
   did need to use the wall for support, and wave me away so the laughter
   could subside
   Jan 03 03:15:09 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; My understanding of the Irish is that
   (apart from the creul jokes about you all being brain-dead :|) you
   raise leprichorns and wait for rainbows to bring you pots of gold. :P
   Jan 03 03:15:30 &lt;jimregan&gt; While drinking Guinness and whiskey, of
   course.
   Jan 03 03:15:38 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Heh.
   Jan 03 03:15:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; On the way to Mass.
   Jan 03 03:15:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; Complaining about the weather all the way.
   Jan 03 03:15:55 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; I am not that naive -- but there are
   some.....
   Jan 03 03:16:01 &lt;jimregan&gt; rofl.
   Jan 03 03:16:51 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh, and say "begor" and "bejaysus"
   Jan 03 03:17:04 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; heh.
   Jan 03 03:17:08 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Yeah - you got it. :)
   Jan 03 03:17:16 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Though, to be fair, my grandfather does
   say "Be the lord")
   Jan 03 03:17:29 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Seamus is the predominant name.
   Jan 03 03:17:34 &lt;jimregan&gt; Grrr.
   Jan 03 03:17:46 &lt;editorgal&gt; lure the unicorns with a pot of guiness
   Jan 03 03:17:48 &lt;jimregan&gt; Seamas == James
   Jan 03 03:17:53 &lt;editorgal&gt; or something like that
   Jan 03 03:17:59 &lt;jimregan&gt; Heh
   Jan 03 03:18:06 &lt;editorgal&gt; ok for your mutual amusement
   Jan 03 03:18:11 &lt;jimregan&gt; OK
   Jan 03 03:18:16 &lt;thomas_adam&gt; Ah -- "James Heaney". That sounds more
   like it.
   Jan 03 03:19:02 &lt;jimregan&gt; There's no 'J' in Irish, so foreign names
   got an 'S'. 'Seamas', 'Sean' (John) etc
   Jan 03 03:21:25 &lt;jimregan&gt; I always hated being called Seamas in Irish
   class. Nothing against the name, but it's not my name.
   Jan 03 03:21:44 &lt;jimregan&gt; It was worse in the Gaeltacht, when
   everyone figured out how much it bugged me.
   Jan 03 03:21:53 &lt;jimregan&gt; Haaaaaayyyyyyymwish
   Jan 03 03:22:12 &lt;jimregan&gt; (Became Haybob, inexplicably)
   Jan 03 03:24:18 &lt;jimregan&gt; Oh. Sheamais (Haymwish) is the accusative
   form of Seamas.

<blockquote><pre>   Jan 05 20:05:38 &lt;jimregan_away&gt; Hi hi hi
   Jan 05 20:06:21 --- You are now known as jimregan
   Jan 05 20:07:52 &lt;jimregan&gt; ok, now that i'm here: hi hi hi
   Jan 05 20:11:31 &lt;editorgal&gt; hehehe
   Jan 05 20:11:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; Um... guess who got me a Christmas present?
   Jan 05 20:11:58 &lt;editorgal&gt; Beata?
   Jan 05 20:12:02 &lt;jimregan&gt; Bingo.
   Jan 05 20:12:05 &lt;jimregan&gt; Now...
   Jan 05 20:12:24 &lt;jimregan&gt; I gave her her present, a book called
   "Jedenascie Minut"
   Jan 05 20:13:45 &lt;jimregan&gt; I gave it to her, and turned to leave. She
   called after me, and told me she had a present for me.
   Jan 05 20:14:06 &lt;jimregan&gt; She asked what her present was, I told her.
   Jan 05 20:14:06 &lt;editorgal&gt; awwwwww
   Jan 05 20:14:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; She started saying "Is this a joke? This is
   crazy"
   Jan 05 20:14:25 &lt;jimregan&gt; I was puzzled.
   Jan 05 20:14:35 &lt;jimregan&gt; She started getting giddy.
   Jan 05 20:14:41 &lt;jimregan&gt; "wait there"
   Jan 05 20:14:49 &lt;jimregan&gt; She went into the women's locker room
   Jan 05 20:15:21 &lt;jimregan&gt; She came out, and told me she thought about
   getting me a pterry book, but figured I'd probably read all his books
   Jan 05 20:15:35 &lt;jimregan&gt; So she got me a book by her favourite

<blockQuote>
So... this month's laundrette starts here. I couldn't concentrate on
anything at all last month -- it took a lot of effort to scrape out
the one article I did write, and I'm only doing this now because
after wasting a lot of my own time, and quite a lot of other people's
time, I felt the need to do something worthwhile (but couldn't think of
anything, and did this instead

<blockQuote>
Oh, and yeah, this was meant to turn into "The TAG Bar". Maybe some
other time.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Anyway, last month's song of the (end of the) month was going to be Tool's
<a href="http://www.seeklyrics.com/lyrics/Tool/Forty-Six-2.html">Forty Six &amp; 2</a>
but, for reasons I'm not going to go into, I think Tool's
<a href="http://www.lyricsondemand.com/t/toollyrics/schismlyrics.html">Schism</a>
is a bit more fitting for this month.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
(The start of the month song for last month would have been more Tool:
<a href="http://www.letssingit.com/tool-parabol-464pr7v.html">Parabol</a>
and
<a href="http://www.lyricscafe.com/t/tool/parabola.html">Parabola</a>
-- two parts of the same thought).

Heh.  That always makes me laugh.  It seems America has a habit
(addiction?) to electing previous film actors into politics.  Ronald
Regen, being the prime example.  Any particular reason for this?

Ronald Reagan, actually. (Note spelling.)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
But as for particular reason, I don't know. I wasn't alive for most of
his presidency, so I am not in a position to directly judge how well he
did. But on the other hand, I have at my disposal all the information
(archived newspapers, press releases and whatnot) that the average
American had during that time period <EM>plus</EM> the advantage of hindsight
<EM>plus</EM> any addition information that may have been written, so you could
also argue I should be able to have a <EM>more</EM> accurate view <EM>now</EM> than
someone living <EM>then</EM> had <EM>then</EM>. But presumably <EM>not</EM> as accurate as
the view of someone who lived <EM>then</EM> has <EM>now</EM>. Read the sentence again,
it actually makes sense, trust me on this one.

Voter turnout of the voting age population hovers around 60%, so if the
40% that doesn't vote suddenly started voting, they would constitute
about 28% of the new voting population, which, if they were all
like-minded, would be enough to swing most any election.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Put another way, if everybody who doesn't vote did, they could run the
country.

I'm offline now, so someone has doubtless pointed this out by now, but
the 28% figure is obviously wrong. If there was a 40% <EM>increase</EM> in
People Who Actually Vote, the new 40% would be 28% of the new total.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
But the case we have here is 40% of the people who can vote, not voting.
So if they started voting, they would obviously be 40% of the voting
population.

Just trying to be too clever for my own good. Percentages are tricky.

They are not alone in this. Actors-turned-politicians collect votes by the
zillions in India---especially in Tamil Nadu where I live.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Someone suggested a twin-states tie-up between Tamil Nadu and California
based on:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<ol>
<li>Both are on the sea.</li>
<li>The language of the majority of people in the state is different
   from the language of the majority of people in the country.</li>
<li>The climate is semi-arid so both states have perennial problems with
   water scarcity.</li>
<li> The largest film industry (in terms of employment) in the world resides
   in Tamil Nadu while the largest film industry (in terms of capital)
   resides in California.
<br><br>
And the killer point is ...</li>
<br><br>
<li>California has the leading man and we have the (now large never svelte)
   leading lady.</li>
</ol>
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
More seriously, I think (other) politicians tend to underestimate the political
skills and general intelligence of actors based on their on-screen
personas---they thus put these actors in positions of power in the hope of
controlling them like puppets (he/she took the direction of &lt;name of
director here&gt; so why not political direction from me). I think our
Amma/Madam/JJ has proved them wrong and I have a strong guess that Arnie
is no one's chump/chimp either.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Still this doesn't quite answer why <strong>people</strong> elect them when other
politicians put them up as front (wo)men.

Chris McAvoy describes his Linux-based cat feeder.  You click on a web
link (so you can feed kitty remotely!), the Python program sends a
character on the serial port, a BASIC program on a microcontroller turns
the paddles on his gizmo, and the gizmo delivers a fish to the hungry

Jimmy has been using computers from the tender age of seven, when his father was left an
Amstrad PCW8256. He was shown a Unix box several years later, and instantly fell in love.
But it could never be, as Unix vendors tended to demand first-born children, and when
Mark came along in 1997, the trade didn't seem worth it.


<p>
Within weeks of starting college, Shane, a fellow first year student, started a
computer
society and so Jimmy found his introduction to Linux. Jimmy was made an admin pretty
quickly, because Shane figured he'd get the root password one way or another.
<p>
Jimmy has since reformed his l33t wayz, and could pass for a productive member of society
in dim lighting, at a distance, if you're only looking out of the corner of your eye.
In "Moving Pictures", Terry Pratchett wrote:</em>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Of course, it is very important to be sober when you take an exam.
Many worthwhile careers in the street-cleaning, fruit-picking, and
subway-guitar-playing industries have been founded on a lack of understanding
of this simple fact.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<em>Jimmy hadn't read these words of wisdom. Jimmy now works in a meat factory.
Jimmy plays guitar, but his dream of playing in a subway is on hold, pending
the construction of a subway in his locality.
