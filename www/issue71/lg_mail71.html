<P><STRONG>
I've been TLG reader since long time (almost from the first issue).
Some time back, there used to be a column "Graphics Musings" (I
hope I've got the name correctly), which used to have information
about various graphics packages and utilities. Could you revive
that column or a new one on similar lines? i.e., not essentially on
graphics utilities alone, but also including other noteworthy
utilities too?
</STRONG></P>

<P>
Atul, the column was The Graphics Muse by Michael Hammel
(<A HREF="mailto:mjhammel@graphics-muse.org"
	>mjhammel@graphics-muse.org</A>, whom I'm cc'ing).  His farewell article was
<A HREF="../issue46/gm.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/issue46/gm.html</A>
Michael stopped writing his Linux Gazette column because (1) he wanted
to consolidate his free graphics-related work on one web site
(<A HREF="http://www.graphics-muse.org"
	>http://www.graphics-muse.org</A>), and (2) he needed to spend more time on
paid employment.  Nevertheless, Michael remains a friend of Linux Gazette
(part of the Clueful Horde) and occasionally answers questions from the
Mailbag or helps the Gazette with graphics issues.  He is also active in
a Colorado Linux users group, if I remember correctly.
</P>
<P>
If somebody would like to start a new
graphics-related series for LG, we'd be glad to publish it.  But it can't
be called The Graphics Muse since Michael is still using that title.
</P>
<P>
Since Linux Gazette's articles come from our readers, "we" cannot revive
the column, but "you" as a reader can.  Even if you're not a graphics
expert, if you use Linux graphics programs regularly, you can write about
your experiences (and frustrations) with them.  It just has to be "new
information": stuff that hasn't been published in LG before (or is so old
it needs an update), and hasn't been overreported elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
As for other utilities, those are some of the things Thomas Adam writes
about in his series The Weekend Mechanic.
If you have any suggestions for topics you'd like to see him cover,
e-mail him at <A HREF="mailto:thomas_adam16@yahoo.com"
	>thomas_adam16@yahoo.com</A>.  Or send article requests to The
Answer Gang (<A HREF="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net"
	>tag@lists.linuxgazette.net</A>) and we'll put them in the
Mailbag.
</P>

<p><em>... and having been copied on this, Michael Hammel chimed in ...</em></p>

<P>
Someone actually remembers that column?  
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</P>
<P>
Actually,  the ".org" address is for my personal stuff.  The ".com" address
holds the Graphics Muse content.  Of course, last year I started dating my
high school sweetheart, and now we're married.  So I haven't actually had
time to update that site in over a year.  I hope to get back to it
eventually, but its not on the near term schedule.

Sort of.  I moved to Houston to be with my (now) wife and her daughter,
though I still participate on the Colorado LUGs mailing list (BLUG and
CLUE, specifically).  I also am Senior Editor for LWN.net and write the On

</P>
<P><STRONG>

</STRONG></P>
<P>
That's correct.  It's still copyrighted by me.  I'd hoped to do a series of
books under the umbrella "Graphics Muse", but that hasn't happened.
</P>
<P>
Interesting that someone would remember that column from so long ago.
Especially now that graphics on Linux has become big business.

<P>
Has anybody had any luck with the Asound ALM2 Ethernet card?
I usually stick with 3com, epro or ne2000 cards to avoid driver
problems, but this one said Linux driver on the box and it was $10,
so I thought it was an ne2000 compatible.  Turns out it has a RealTek
8139 chip, which corresponds to the experimental 8139too module
(Linux 2.4.3).  But the driver doesn't recognize the card.
"init_module: no such device.  Hint: insmod errors can be caused by
incorrect module parameters, including invalid IO or IRQ parameters."
</P>
<P>
Thinking it was futile, I looked up the I/O address of the card in
<TT>/proc/pci</TT> and tried "modprobe 8139too io=0xa000".  This resulted in,
"invalid parameter parm_io".

<P><STRONG>
I am interested in developing a linux version in Tamil( an Indian
language).  It would be very helpful, if you can provide an article
providing an outline of the process of going about it.
</STRONG></P>

<p><em>... Mike likes the idea ...</em></p>

<P>
This would make an excellent
article, if there's anybody with experience to be able to write it.
Even an article on how the Spanish or Chinese versions of Linux were
built would be worthwhile.
</P>
<p><em>... Mike also encouraged him to contact those most likely to have
	experience with language ports ...</em></p>

<P>
Ravishanker, talk with the distributions that already offer multilingual
versions of Linux.  Linux--and the Unix programs and tools it is bundled
with--were originally written in English, but several distributions have
appeared in non-English-speaking countries with Linux speaking their
language.  <A HREF="http://www.turbolinux.com/">TurboLinux</A> 6.5 for the iSeries
(<A HREF="http://www.turbolinux.com/products/index.html"
	>http://www.turbolinux.com/products/index.html</A>) supports "English,
Japanese, Korean, and Simplified and Traditional Chinese with the
unified code base", and claims to have the leading support for wide
character sets.  Conectiva Linux (<A HREF="http://www.conectiva.com"
	>http://www.conectiva.com</A>) is based in
Brazil and offers Portuguese, Spanish and English versions.  <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A>
(<A HREF="http://www.suse.de"
	>http://www.suse.de</A>) is based in Germany and offers versions in seven
Western European languages and Czech.  
<A HREF="http://www.linux-mandrake.com/">Mandrake</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> and others also
offer various levels of multilingual support.
</P>
<P>
Some of the issues you will face include:
</P>
<ul>
<li> Character set.  Does Tamil have an alphabetic or idiographic writing
system?  Is it supported in Unicode?  Is there an acceptable ASCII
version of the writing system, or do one of the established 8-bit
character sets support it?  Linux currently works best with the 8-bit
character sets, but parts of the system and some applications support
16-bit Unicode.  Support for Unicode characters above 16 bits is less.
<li> Time zone, keyboard, locale, etc.  This is the easy part; just use the
standard Linux utilities to configure these.  Is there a standard
locale name for Tamil?
<li> GNU gettext is a set of C functions to enable your program to speak
multiple languages.  For programs which use gettext, it's a "simple"
matter of having a translator prepare catalog files containing
translated versions of all the strings in the programs.  For programs
which don't use gettext, you'll either have to modify the program to
make it gettext-aware, or do something else.
<li> Certain points of grammar are hard to internationalize consistently.
This makes it a huge logical challenge to come up with catalog strings.
The problem is that the string must be a unique key to find the
other-language string, but oftentimes a single string in English maps to
multiple strings in other languages.  For instance, in
English we say, "0 dogs, 1 dog, 2+ dogs...".  In Russian they say, "1
sobaka, 2-4 sobaki, 5+ sobak" (dog), "1 huligan, 2-4 huligana, 5+
huliganov" (hooligan), "1+ pal'to" (overcoat).  Many programmers just
throw up their hands and write "1 file(s) copied" in the good ol' DOS
tradition.  Worse yet is when some languages put filler words in a
different order than the default language.  Or when a word has one form
in one language but multiple case-dependant forms in another.  One must
artificially create identical-but-unique strings in the default language
to match all the distinct combinations in all the languages supported.
Or restructure your sentances to avoid differing case forms.
<br>
OK, just when you got that down, Russian has a second word for dog:
"1 pyos, 2-4 p'sa, 5+ p'sov".  And two words for horse (loshad',
kon')....
<li> To localize X-windows, first determine whether there's an existing
8-bit or Unicode font that supports Tamil.  If so, all users will have
to have that font installed, and every application configured to use
that font.  If not, you'll have to create a font.
<li> If Tabil has other conventions (besides just the font) that differ
from Western languages, you may need to use or write a special version
of xterm to handle the characters.  For instance, jterm handles
Japanese.  Emacs has a bunch of optional features called MULE for
non-Western languages; you may have to install extra emacs packages to
use these.
<li> You'll need to find and install an X keymap for Tabil.
<li> To localize the console, you'll first have to determine whether
there's an existing font and keymap that can be used.  If so, just
configure them as the default.  If not, you'll have to write them.
Note that a console keymap can be used to generate an X keymap, so
you only have to maintain your keymap one place.  The Unix display
driver has a Unicode mode, but unfortunately the ancient hardware
generator on PC video cards can display only 256 unique characters
at a time.  You can configure a primary character set and an alternate
character set (2 x 256), but you have to switch between the two.
If you want to display a document that has both Russian and German
characters (to say nothing of Japanese), forget it.
<li> Being Unicode-compatible is a worthwhile goal, because that is the
direction other Linux systems are slowly going.
</ul>
<P>
Look through the HOWTOs at <A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org"
	>http://www.linuxdoc.org</A>.  Look at the
other-language HOWTOs like the Thai HOWTO, Chinese HOWTO, Danish HOWTO,
Esperanto HOWTO, etc.  The Font HOWTO may  help with font issues.  The
Keyboard-and-Console HOWTO explains how to set up the text console for
different languages.  The Unicode HOWTO explains some other aspects of
Unicode.
</P>
<P>
Contact Linux Focus (<A HREF="http://www.linuxfocus.com"
	>http://www.linuxfocus.com</A>) and see if they have
any advice.  Linux Focus is a zine with a lot more non-English-speaking
staff than LG.

historical perspective: at one point, Rome lost three <EM>legions</EM> and one of
their governors in a single ambush in the Teutoburger Forest. Never before had

Roman armies marched; and afterwards, there was not enough left of the tribes

<P>
Dear Ben (and others),
</P>
<P>
I just thought that you and the rest of the team at
the LG, would like to know that I was flicking through
a friends copy of a British magazine called PCPlus.
Although this is mostly orientated towards Windoze
users, they do have a Linux section.
</P>
<P>
In this section the subject of shell scripting was
being taught. I was not impressed with their content.
The author of the article referred to shell scripting
as a "dos batch file" equivalent, but gave no mention
that BASH in fact has many boolean logic
control-structures. But that is by-the-by.
</P>
<P>
The real reason why this e-mail is being sent to you,
is that in one of the references, they pointed it to
Ben Okopnik's article on The basics of shell languages
(in issue 52). It is nice to know that the LG is used
in such a context.
</P>
<P>
Keep up the good work guys,
<br>Regards,

<P><STRONG>
thank you very much for your answer about apropos. The solution you sent
works properly. I had myself something similiar; however I could not
imagine there is no built-in possibility for my problem which I have
overseen.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
An OS can never give you all the commands you want, especially since
they conflict with the commands someone else wants.  What Unix gives
you is a comprehensive set of basic commands and the building blocks
to build higher-level custom commands.  This is why shell scripts and
aliases are so highly valued by Unix enthusiasts, because they give
you the ability to make custom commands for anything the developers
might have forgotten.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I crosschecked it again and my mailer inserts the proper headers:
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-2
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I find it really very pity you do attempt any use of i18n in your
mailer. I am from Hungary, so I actually need the iso-8859-2 charcter
code when I use my mother language for mails; however, my name is within
the simple Western-Europe or ascii256 charset. If you US people insist
on using us-ascii then ther are plenty of guys on the world who do not
have any chance to see their name as in their personal documents. I have
recently run some circles around locales and gnome (which I prefer to
kde), and I have to tell you how much I was shocked by the fact how long
way is to go till we reach to the point Windows95 already had. I have
freefonts, ttfs, X fonts for several languages etc. but when I wanted to
print out proper hungarian characters I had to redirect the StarOffice
postscript output to file (was also forced to use elementary postscript
fonts), and drive it through 'ogonkify'. A large number of Linux users
can not live with us-ascii, so at a given point they are lost.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
The problem of representing multiple languages is acute, and I strongly
wish Linux was more advanced in that area.  If editors and browsers
fully supported Unicode seamlessly across the board, we would switch to
it in an instant.  However, 8-bit character sets continue to be better
supported.  The limitation is that only one 8-bit character set can be
active at a time, meaning you can't properly display a document containing
English and Russian and German unless one of the languages is ASCII-ified.
This was a pain when I had Russian friends in Russia and Germany I sent
e-mail to and typed up text documents for.
</P>
<P>
LG has just thrown its hands up in the air and taken the
incorrect-but-easiest approach of using Latin-1 but pretending it's
ASCII.  Most of the non-English mail we get uses Latin-1 characters.
I try to convert these to HTML entities when I see them, but I don't
make a time-consuming effort of it.  Compounding this is the fact that
many of us use mutt as our mailreader, and mutt replaces non-ASCII
characters with "?".  Then if you save the message or forward it, mutt
converts the placeholder "?" into real "?", and then the original character
is completely lost.  With Romance/Germanic languages we can usually
guess what the original character was and substitute it back
(because "ma?ana" is clearly "ma&ntilde;ana", "K?ln" is "K&ouml;ln",
"Jos?" is "Jos&eacute;",
"Universit?t" must be "Universit&auml;t" because "Universit&ouml;t",
"Universit&uuml;t" and "Universit&szlig;t" don't exist, etc--unless
you want to say "Universit&ouml;t" is slang for "dead university"!);
however, with names from other languages we're at a total loss.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps someday we can come up with a more enlightened way to support
multiple languages, but this is what we have now.

Last question: are you plan to publish on the <em>Linux Gazette</em>
	 page this new Answer-Gang mail address? Or
not publishing it is the proper way to avoid getting rid of off-topic
questions 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">)
</STRONG></P>
<P>
The linux-questions-only address is at the top of the Mailbag page and The
Answer Gang index page, where we have always published it.  The top of
the 2-Cent Tips page still has the gazette address, but I've asked Heather
to change it.  In any case, I bounce everything to linux-questions-only that
was misaddressed to gazette.
</P>
<P>
If you see anywhere else (besides in back issues) where the gazette
address or the obsolete tag address is used, please let me know and
we'll change it.
</P>
<P>
I thought about putting the address on the home page but decided against
it, because people should at least have a look at what The Answer Gang
is about before they find out there is a submission address.
</P>
<P>
The problem of off-topic questions was not caused by Gazette readers.
It was caused by the fact that the tag address was published on many
webpages with no reference to LG.  So people would type their question
into search engines, find the tag address, and send us questions, often
without even realizing Linux Gazette existed.  Our off-topic questions
were easily 50% of the total.  See the past several issues of The Back
Page for the more amusing ones, and issues of The Answer Gang before
that.
</P>
<P>
Since switching to the linux-questions-only address, our off-topic
rate has dropped to near zero, and we are also seeing fewer Linux
questions from people who don't even bother to read the FAQs and
documentation first but just expect us to hold their hand.  LG believes
in helping those who help themselves.
</P>
<p>-- Mike

<STRONG>I miss the toons in your lates issue.</STRONG>
</P>

<P>
We miss them too.  Shane Collinge has to
concentrate on paid employment for a while, so HelpDex is on hiatus.  
Eric Kasten has his hands full doing whatever he's doing, so Tuxedo Tails
is also taking a break.  

<P> Jon "Sir Flakey" Harsem is still going strong, so we have a new 
installment of <A HREF="qubism.html">Qubisms</A> this month for your
cartoon fix.  It was missing last month because I, um, forgot to include it.
Most Qubism cartoons are non-Linux but I'm including some of the funnier
ones anyway.</P>  

<P> I originally told Eric Kasten we wanted only Linux cartoons,
but he said Linux is too specific a topic to come up with that many
cartoons about, so I've been publishing non-Linux Tuxedo Tails panels too.
</P>

<P>--Mike.</P>

Hi Heather,
</P>
<P>
In the latest Linux Gazette online issue, the link to the "internet cafe" is set
to that of "Password aging" instead of:

<P><BLOCKQuote>
<A HREF="../issue70/tag/9.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/issue70/tag/9.html</A>

You will want to correct this.
</P>
<P>
Have a nice day,

<BR>Iron (<a href="mailto:gazette@linuxgazette.net?subject=LG .rss file">LG Editor</a>)

<P> LG has two new goodies this month.  One is an .rss file at
<A HREF="../lg.rss">http://www.linuxgazette.net/lg.rss</A>.  Those who run
web sites with "live" links to various news sites and zines can feed this file
to your link generator to create links to all the articles in the current issue
(at the main LG site).  This file is <EM>experimental</EM> right now because I
need <STRONG>feedback</STRONG> from the linking sites on whether this format
will work for them, or what you would prefer instead <EM>(hint, hint).</EM>
If the feedback is positive, I will update this file each month.

<P> Also, LG has a new search engine.  The buggy WebGlimpse engine has been
replaced with <A HREF="http://www.htdig.org/">ht://Dig</A>.  The new URL is 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxgazette.net/search.html">http://www.linuxgazette.net/search.html</A>.
However, you can still use the old URL and it will take you to the new search 
page.  If you are using the extra search link that some mirrors have (to search
the mirror's copy of LG), it is unaffected.
