Hi TAG,
I really enjoyed this article, just what I need! But there's only one
problem, the DMA on the hard-disk. I've always used a very
similar approach to the one mentioned in the article to set DMA
on on my disks, the problem is INIT doesn't actually start when
waking up from hibernation and so DMA is not set which makes
reading the image (and booting, therefore) a very painfully long
process. Any ideas on other ways to set DMA that don't involve
INIT?

It's been quite a while since I've fiddled with hibernation, etc., but
if I recall correctly, there's some kind of a script directory -
/etc/apm/resume.d, maybe? - that allows you to put in scripts to be run
at wakeup time. That should work.

I've gone through a bit of documentation and found an option to be passed
in the script to run commands on resume, but that doesn't help as these
are run AFTER wake up which means no DMA while loading the image
from disk. The solution is on the kernel level as it has to be done before
anything else is loaded. So I fiddled around the kernel config and found
an option under "Device Drivers --&gt; DMA Engine support" to
automatically set DMA. Then you could pass "hda=autotune" as a
kernel parameter to get the disks tuned to maximum performance.
</p>

<p>
Without this I was getting 3-4 minute boots which is worse than the normal
(ie, no hibernation) now I get 30 second boots <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">

Hello,
</p>

<p>
This article suggests re-compiling the kernel in order to enable
a feature that is "on-by-default" in most distribution kernels!
</p>

<p>
The stock kernel version of suspend is sometimes called "suspend1"
whereas the one the author talks about is suspend2. There <strong>may</strong> be
hardware out there for which the latter works better than the former
but of late I have seen fewer and fewer systems of this type.
</p>

<p>
Now there is nothing wrong with compiling the kernel for fun, learning
and profit. I just hope people aren't doing it because they think it
is necessary <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
Regards,
</p>

<p>
Kapil.

I use it happily on Ubuntu 7.04.

There's a comparison between the stock kernel's version and suspend2
at <a href="http://www.tuxonice.net/features">http://www.tuxonice.net/features</a>
</p>

<p>
There seem to be a few extra features, but that's all. I didn't actually
know that there was a "suspend1" compiled in by default. What's done
is done ;-)

Exactly! What better thing to do than compile a kernel early in the
morning right before breakfast? It works up my appetite.
