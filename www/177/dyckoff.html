<h1>Away Mission: SemTech 2010 - Summary</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>


<p>
Almost 1200 people attended this year's Semantic Technology Conference
(SemTech 2010) in San Franciso.  That was a big jump from last year and
probably due in equal parts to the move to San Francisco and also the
growing use of SemTech all over the web. Remember, this is a recession
year.
</p>

<p>
Where do we find RDF and SemTech? The US government and maybe European
governments.  Semantic annotations are being added to many public
databases.  Also, the latest HTML5 draft has RDFa support in it.  And who
uses Semantic Technology now on the Web?  The BBC, Newsweek, the NY Times
and even companies like Best Buy have everyday applications running on
SemTech.  In short, Semantic Technology is everywhere.  (Visit the earlier
Away Mission that describes the basics of the Semantic Web <a
href="../129/dyckoff.html">here</a>.)
</p>

<p>
The event bills itself as the world's largest conference on
semantic technologies. It is also focused on the commercial aspects of
developing semantic technologies and incorporating these into social,
business and government processes.
</p>

<p>
One new aspect of the conference, which showed the pervasiveness of
Semantic Technology, was the large number of vertical industry tracks. There
were tracks for Open Government, Enterprise Data Management, Health-care
and Life Sciences, SOA Governance, Publishing, Advertising and Marketing,
and Semantic Web Technologies.
</p>

<p>
The other interesting trend was the focus on automated metadata extraction
and the automation of ontology and taxonomy building.  This was reflected
on the expo floor and in the number of presentations discussing this new
level of automation.
</p>

<p>
While there were few vendors - many of last year's vendors had been snapped
up as divisions of larger companies - the offerings were richer and more
mature. This was echoed in the conference by the frequent discussions
of monetization and business models. I'll address that in a few
paragraphs.
</p>


<p>
SemTech 2010 ran Monday through Friday, with intro sessions Monday evening
and tutorials all day Tuesday. The Friday tracks changed a bit from
primarily vendor-sponsored user sessions of previous years. For one
example, there was a hands-on tutorial on Drupal 7 and RDFa open to any
conference attendee.  The slides from that session are on SlideShare at
<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/scorlosquet/how-to-build-linked-data-sites-with-drupal-7-and-rdfa">http://www.slideshare.net/scorlosquet/how-to-build-linked-data-sites-with-drupal-7-and-rdfa</a>
</p>

<p>
Drupal is a widely-used open source platform for publishing and managing
content.  Version 7 is almost released and it will use RDFa for storing
site and content metadata. Drupal 7 will have RDFa enabled by default for
metadata on all nodes and comments. The key point here is the increasing
commonality of RDFa functionality in new websites and site building tools.
That emerging ubiquity will build the Semantic Web of meaning that Tim
Berners-Lee spoke about almost a decade ago.
</p>  

<p>
Just in the last few months, a new working group was formed for RDFa at the
W3C with the goal of defining additional structure in HTML files for
additional metadata. The group is working on linking RDFa into HTML5 and
XHTML5 as well as the Open Document format used by OpenOffice. As an
international example,  the UK's e-government effort plans to use RDFa
throughout its web pages. This allows the data to be read within a context
and used with that context preserved.
</p>

<p>
The Open Graph used within the FaceBook web site is a simplified form of
RDFa and the adoption of Open Graph by other social web sites allows
RDF-based sharing of semantic information.  For more info in Open Graph,
check out this presentation on SlideShare, which is similar to one made at
SemTech 2010:
</p>

<p>
I should mention here that several of the technical presentations from
SemTech 2010 and 2009 are on SlideShare and can be searched for  with the
string "semtech" to find them.
</p>  

<h3>Purchasing SemTech Companies</h3>

<p>
A few weeks before this year's SemTech, Apple purchased SIRI, one of the
bright stars from SemTech 2009.  SIRI's intelligent semantic agent for
desktops and mobile devices, which mixed location-based services, mashups,
and voice recognition with an inference engine, was a hit with the SemTech
crowd and I had been looking forward to a forward looking progress report.
</p>  

<p>
From the Semantic Universe review of the SIRI sale: "SIRI was in the
vanguard of leveraging the AI-based apps and applications that relate to
the semantic web developed by SRI"  and "one of the core and most
innovative technologies coming out of SRI - which led the 'CALO: Cognitive
Assistant That Learns and Organizes' DARPA project.
Maybe what's most important about SRI and CALO's Active Ontologies
innovation... was to create passive inferencing that... lets one reach
conclusions and drive to actions based on those conclusions."  More Semantic
Universe reviews of the SIRI sale can be found here:

</p>

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpjpVAB06O4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpjpVAB06O4</a>.
</p>

<p>
Of course, just after this year's SemTech event, Google bought Metaweb, the
force behind the important FreeBase global semantic data store. On the
company blog, Google wrote: "Working together, we want to improve searching
and make the web richer and more meaningful for everyone."
</p>

<p>
They also wrote: "Google and Metaweb plan to maintain Freebase as a free
and open database for the world. Better yet, we plan to contribute to and
further develop Freebase and would be delighted if other web companies use
and contribute to the data. We believe that by improving Freebase, it will
be a tremendous resource to make the web richer for everyone. And to the
extent the web becomes a better place, this is good for webmasters and good
for users."
</p>

<p>
One immediate benefit of the acquisition, Metaweb has increased the
frequency of Freebase down-loadable database dumps from quarterly to
weekly.
</p>

<p>
You can visit the YouTube intro to MetaWeb:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<h3>SemTech Code Camp</h3>

<p>
The FreeBase presentation was one of the best at the free Semantic Code
Camp held one evening during SemTech 2010. Delivered by Jamie Taylor, the
Minister of Information at Metaweb Technologies, it describe the project
that has over 12 million topics which can be queried by SPARQL and other
semantic protocols.  It gets the information from Wikipedia, the
government, SFMOMA, MusicBranz, and other sites providing semantic data.
It acts as a Rosetta Stone between identifiers in different systems such as
Netflix, Hulu, Fandango, etc. with 99% accuracy. All this runs on a
Creative Commons license.
</p>

<p>
You can find that FreeBase presentation here:
<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jamietaylor/sem-tech-2010-code-camp">http://www.slideshare.net/jamietaylor/sem-tech-2010-code-camp</a>
</p>

<p>
Other Code Camp presenters included Andraz Tori from Zemanta, which can
read in most text from many domains and give back standard tags and
categories, Wen Ruan of Textwise, which uses faceted search to find and use
subsets of a data collection, and Tom Tague of OpenCalais, a project of
Thomson Reuters, which can categorize and tag the people, places,
companies, facts, and events in content.
</p>  

<p>
The Code Camp was a beginner's track on how to use Semantic Technology and an
open Unconference track. A nice aspect was that anyone registering through
the Silicon Valley Semantic Technology Meetup could attend for free and
also get an expo pass to SemTech and share in the preceding reception and
free margaritas.
</p> 
   

<h3>Google Rich Snippets</h3>

<p>
Google announced "Rich Snippets" just over a year ago in May 2009. Today,
if webmasters add structured data markup to their web pages, Google can use
that data to show better search result descriptions.  This is not fully
implemented yet, but extra snippets are being captured and are showing up
in Google search results.  One example of this is the RDFa used in the
display of Google video selection results or receipes that display calories
and prep time on ther first line.
</p>

<p>
Kavi Goel and Pravir Gupta of Google described the simple markup vocabulary
used by Google for enhanced indexing. Currently, this can be in a micro
format or RDFa. They explained that they will add to the vocabulary as more
domains are added to the Rich Snippets ontology.  They will also be
expanding the vocabulary to include over 40 different languages, and 
will use the FaceBook Social Graph to link friends and locations.
</p>

<p>
They have just released a testing tool for webmasters and content
developers.  One reason for this:  most web sites were not doing the
snippet markup correctly.  The tool will show which elements are visible
and what properties are listed.  If nothing shows at all, then the site is
not using snippets correctly.
</p>  

<p>
Among the more common mistakes are the use of hidden text and markup
in-line, as Google search ignores this.  Alternatively, the person doing
the markup needs to be very clear in terminology.  They cited ambiguities
like differences in ratings versus reviews or votes versus counts. They
expect these to be cleared up with practice.  They also mentioned that
global use of snippets was growing at 4x the US rate from 10/09 to 06/10.
</p>


<h3>Web 3.0 Web Sites</h3>

<p>
The session on Building Web 3.0 Web Sites  discussed best practices in
implementing SEO, RDFa and semantic content for Web 3.0 sites.
</p>

<p>
The presenters - John Walker, Mark Birbeck, and Mark Windholtz - discussed
how to transform current content into semantically-rich web pages. They
emphasized the need to improve and maintain data quality, both for the main
content and for the tags and metadata that will enhance access and
combination. In addition they recommended the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li> use emerging standards like HTML 5, RDFa (and 'Google Rich Snippets'), WURFL, etc.
<li> establish robust user personas
<li> try to improve metadata throughout the site
<li> use existing ontologies or establish one or more as needed
<li> use web namespaces and URIs
<li> implement Triple stores and use REST web architecture
</ul> 

<p>
If working within a company, try to break down application silos and free
the data.  They suggested making data accessible by having triple stores
run 'on top' of existing databases.  It's much less expensive to do this and
needs less effort to start. Finally, it may be easier for IT departments to
accept semantic extensions when the underlying data resides in traditional
databases maintained by the usual staff.
</p>


<h3>Automatically Distilling Semantic Content</h3>

<p>
Several presentations focused on the emerging techniques for dynamically
extracting meaning and metadata and mapping text information into
taxonomies and ontologies.  These include combinations of statistical and
rules-based metadata extraction and auto-tagging and auto-classification to
link related content.
</p>

<p>
Some of this is being facilitated by running semantic projects that are
building standard vocabularies and standard ontologies.  Examples of this
are TextWise and FreeBase, as well efforts now taking place in industry
verticals.
</p>  

<p>
One presentation with a huge title was The Use of Semantic Analytics to
Achieve Data Transparency Using Government Standards for Information
Sharing, by Bill Stewart of Jeskell.  Stewart noted that almost half the
work week of a knowledge worker is spend finding needed information -- 19
hours a week!  Globally, we are collecting 15 petabytes every day and 80%
of new data is unstructured.  For the demo in his session, he showed the
Languageware  Workbench finding work roles from text information on the
Katrina recovery effort and distilling out an entity list of working teams.
The rule set had been built over a two day period parsing the text record.
</p>

<p>
In Assistive and Automatic Tools for Tagging and Categorizing Anything,
Seth Maislin did a survey of automation techniques.  Although the goal is
to save costs by getting human intervention out of loop, Maislin pointed
that domain expert intervention may be needed to review auto-indices and
auto-built ontologies.  Maislin suggested doing this toward the beginning
of a project to build trustworthy associations.  Building the index, with
or without the aid of a taxonomy, is the place for human involvement.  In
MedLine, humans assist categorization by accepting or declining initial
results, then reviewing and correcting by experts, added by active social
tagging by users.  He also recommended using open source taxonomies to
start and extend your own.
</p>



<h3>Nepomuk in KDE SC 4</h3>

<p>
Another example of the pervasiveness of SemTech is the Nepomuk project
which provides a standardized, conceptual framework for Semantic Desktops.
Part of the new tech in KDE SC 4, Nepomuk shares data from several desktop
applications using  RDF metadata. There are C/C++ and Java implementations.
</p>

<p>
Core development results will be publicly available during the project via
a webbased collaboration platform. The most prominent implementation is
available at <a href="http://nepomuk.kde.org">http://nepomuk.kde.org</a>.
</p>

<p>
Contributors to the project were in various expo booths, including the
folks from DERI.
</p> 

<p>
Here's part of the Goal statement from the Nepomuk project website:
"NEPOMUK intends to realize and deploy a comprehensive solution - methods,
data structures, and a set of tools - for extending the personal computer
into a collaborative environment, which improves the state of art in online
collaboration and personal data management...."<br>
<a href="http://nepomuk.semanticdesktop.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main1/Project+Objectives">http://nepomuk.semanticdesktop.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main1/Project+Objectives</a>
</p>

<p>
Although initially designed to fulfill requirements for the NEPOMUK
project, these ontologies are useful for the semantic web community in
general. These basically extends the search process with a  local desktop
RDF store and links data from various applications that use these KDE
ontologies.  The ontologies are open source and are used by Tracker in
GNOME.
</p>

<p>
The NEPOMUK ontologies are available from the following Web page:<br>
<a href="http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/">http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/</a>
</p>


<p>
In the last 2 years, the event organizer, Wilshire Conferences, has
organized SemTech and the related Enterprise Data World event with a 'lunch
on your own' policy except for the tutorial day. That, and the conference
tote bag, makes it a bit less expensive.  All attendees got an early
conference CD but conference web site hosts password access to updated
presentations.  By the way, that single lunch on the tutorial day was great!  The
Hilton kitchen staff produced tasty and eye-pleasing food.  And the move
from San Jose to the SF Hilton resulted in a better facility overall - an
excellent AV team kept all the rooms functional and all but one room had a
net of extension cords to power attendee laptops.
</p>  

<p>
I have to say I found SemTech sessions more satisfying and less academic
this year and more about real tools and products. I'm happy that they plan
to return the SF Hilton in 2011 hope to attend.
