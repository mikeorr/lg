<P>
To summarize, we had to build a system that met the following
requirements.  To succeed, every criteria had to be met in full:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> The system had to operate in real-time.  Data entered at one site
   must be immediately available at all other sites.
<LI> The system had to be secured against eavesdropping, wire-taps, etc.
<LI> The system had to be responsive to users even when communication latency
   was high (on the order of 1-3 seconds) and the bandwidth was low
   (at most 30kbps).
<LI> All administration had to be handled by a trained end-user.
<LI> Access to the data had to be strictly controlled and the rules for
   access control were subject to modification by the 
   user-administrator.
<LI> Access to data had to be logged and the detail with which logs were 
   made had to be subject to run-time control by the user-administrator.
<LI> The client user interface had to be very intuitive - users with no
   computer experience (literally: where's the on-switch?) had to be able
   to use the system after a 1/2 hour of training.
<LI> The system had to be inexpensive to develop, deploy, administer and
   maintain.
</UL>
<P>
The last criterion makes the preceding ones even harder to achieve!
