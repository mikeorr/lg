Hi all,
</P>
<P>
I just set up a nice little p120 with 2-NICs and RedHat7.0 for my mom and
it is working great except for one thing which you have spoken of before,
the "neighbour table overflow" message being printed out to the console.
</P>
<P>
In a response to a letter from James Zhuang, Heather spoke of how ifcfg-lo
might be missing or that lo might not be up but on my system, ifcfg-lo is
there and appears correct and lo is up and running.  Also JimD mentioned
that pump might be screwing up the loopback configuration and I am running
that as my dhcp client;  how might i remedy this problem?  I'd be happy to
provide more system information if it would help or if you have any other
ideas on where i might look i would appreciate it.
</P>
<P>
Thanks,
</P>

<P>
Hi all there,
</P>
<P>
I recently bought a OVIS Live FSH8R 10/100 MPS autosensing switch and a
Davicom 9102 network card (dmfe.c) (They deliver Linux drivers on disk!!)
So I cabled all together and connected to a friends notebook.
From my <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A> server he can download with speeds up to 9 MB/s, that's what
I expected. Now when I download files (big files to measure the
throughput) from his Apache (on Windows 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/unsmily.gif" ALT=";-(" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> or via smbmount/Samba, 
I'll just get a rate of 2,5 MB/s. With iptraf (an ip traffic analyser, it's
very good, IMO) I get a lot of big packets (1400-1500 bytes), which are
the data packages. But my network interface also receives/sends alot small
(&lt;100 bytes) packages. These are confirmation packages, I assume.
</P>
<P>
Both network cards run at 100 Mps, changing switch ports did not help.
The switch has only two cables connected.
</P>
<P>
So, nice story 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=";-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">. The question: 
Why can't I get a fast downlink, but only a fast uplink.
</P>
<P>
Thanks, Matthias

I read your article in Published in issue 71 of Linux Gazette October
2001 where Jefferson said Diablo ran fine under Wine at LWE.  Which
Diablo?  I or II.  I have II running fine, but I can't find anyone who
has Diablo I running.

I really don't recall whether it was I or II - but it was the honest to

Would you kindly pass on to Mr Field that "Lunux Canada" seems to have
exactly what he is looking for. It is not free, but moderately (compared
with MS) priced. Certainly it is worth checking them out.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I found them at www.linuxcanada.com
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
They didn't have anything that interested me but they seem to have exactly
what Mr Field needs.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks for your wonderful magazine.
</STRONG></P>

<P>
LG has received announcements from Linux Canada before about their POS
products.  I sent the URL to Dennis, but I also noted that I couldn't
get into the site when I retested it.  However, I can get into the site
now.  I think Dennis is looking for more of a software solution, whereas
Linux Canada is more geared toward special hardware.  But maybe Dennis
will find what he needs. -- Mike
</P>


<P><strong>
Thank you for your rapid reply.
</strong>
</P>
<P><strong>
So far as I know Linux Canada only sells software. There has (in the last 2
years) never been a suggestion of hardware sales or availability - only
accounting and point of sale SOFTWARE.
</strong>
</P>
<P><strong>
The only time I have had trouble getting into their website was when the
backbone was clogged, you could not even get anywhere in Canada then. You
may have had a similar problem.

<P>
There are a whole series of relatively common problems related in this article,
like applications software which does not run smoothly on all distributions
and hardware which is not suported by a distribution, or sometimes by any
Linux driver at all.
</P>
<P>
The real point is what can be done about this, and who should do it. The
author, Dennis Field, seems to put the blame with the Linux distribution
he chose. He, or his employer, paid them good money and so Linux should do
what he needs it to do. There is nothing wrong with the logic of this,
but the prospect of all distributions, or the most comercial distributions,
or even one Linux distribution running out of the box on all old and
new PCs is pritty well nill. Also even if that did happen, it would not get
Mr Field to his goal of using Linux for the whole bookshop in one giant
leap.
</P>
<P>
The problems which would need to be fixed
even in this one "case study" are spread accrose the developers of:
Linux kernel, X windows, StarOffice, and the distribution's firewall.
Each of these have nowhere near the resources or assistance from hardware
designers which Microsoft has, and yet they produce software which
(on other criteria than out of the box installation on all PCs) far
outperforms Microsoft's products. They have a right to pride in their
work and respect from others, and simply calling for any of
these teams to work harder till the problems nolonger exist would really
mean accepting that Linux has lost, because even if the developers gave
up all their free time, the extra improvement could never have the kind
of impact which the author desires.
</P>
<P>
I have writen <A HREF="http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/15359/84340"
	>elsewhere</a> (http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/15359/84340)
how I would generally advise SMEs to move towards
Linux, but given the evidence of interest in building fairly complex
systems at low cost, maybe we need a business by business (Bookshops,
Chemists, Garages) Linux forum to give system integration with Linux
the kind of boost which <A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">Linux Documentation Project</A> (LDP) and sourceforge have done in other ways.

<P>
Dennis,
</P>
<P>
It is unfortunate that you had trouble installing Linux on your ThinkPad.
You don't say what distros you tried, and each distro works a bit
differently. Since installation troubles are really the domain of the distro
and not the operating system itself it seems unfair that you name the
problem as Linux but avoided naming the distros that actually caused you the
trouble.
</P>
<P>
Have you tried <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> Linux? This is a very popular distro, supported
entirely by volunteers. You could download the boot/root floppy images from
debian.org, copy them on to two floppies, then boot and install a minimal
Debian Linux OS. This is usually quite easy. After configuring your Linux
network settings and adjusting your sources.list to point to the Debian
download site you could then use dselect or apt-get to install the rest of
whatever you want automatically over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
That you would have the troubles you did isn't too surprising. Most Windows
users would have trouble in the similar circumstances trying to install
Windows on their own for the first time without ever having used it before.
A more realistic approach when installing Linux for the first time is to
enlist the aid of other Linux users. Most Linux users groups host monthly
installfests for this reason, so that new users get the install help they
need from experienced hands. Had you done that I expect you would have had
an operational Linux laptop within minutes. Another approach is to join the
debian mailing list where anybody usually gets answers to install problems
within a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
Your analogy comparing Linux to a Ferrari with no wheels is unjust. The
wheels are right there, you just had a problem with your "Some Assembly
Required" situation. You were not picking up your new Ferrari at the dealer,
were you? If you were buying a new Thinkpad purchased from IBM with Linux
already pre-installed (look under "personal systems" at www.ibm.com/linux)
you should have no installation problems whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
Please let me know if I can be of any help to you installing Debian Linux on
your laptop.
</P>
<P>
Cheers,
<br>Robin
</P>

<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)"

Articles go to <A HREF="mailto:gazette@linuxgazette.net"

<P>
Basically, a tip covers just one simple topic in a screenful or two (or less).
An article covers several subtopics under separate headings and/or is more than
a couple screenfulls.
</P>

<p><em>... and Tips rarely involve more than one Answer Gang member's comments.
I do like to use this rule of thumb: would the answer (possibly without
explanation)  fit in a .sig block?  If not, it's probably not small enough to
make a good Tip.
</em></p>
<p><em>
When the discussions get going even a short thread might go into TAG, and 
some of the better long answers in TAG still aren't as long as a standard
article.  I'd also like to remind people that for article submissions, we 
prefer simple HTML to the font-laden stuff automatically generated by most
