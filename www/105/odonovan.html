<h1>Securing a New Linux Installation</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/odonovan.html">Barry O'Donovan</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

From a security professional's perspective, a number of common
Linux distributions are insecure &quot;out of the box&quot;, and many of the
supplied packages are already out of date by the time they reach
the shelves. As the security of one's computer and more importantly
its data is a priority concern, there are a number of steps that
should be taken at the time of installation to secure one's
operating system as well as to help identify attempted or
successful attacks. 

<p>These steps are listed below and each is expanded on in detail
in the sections that follow.</p>

effective firewall</a></li>

<li><a href="#update">The (automatic) updating of all installed
packages</a></li>

</ol>

<h3 id="install">1. Installing and Configuring a Firewall</h3>

A properly configured and effective firewall policy is not only
your first line of defense but it is also your most important. Any
potential (remote) attacker that cannot breach your firewall will
not be able to exploit any of the possible vulnerabilities of the
underlying services that are protected by it. 

<p>The firewall should be set-up <strong>before</strong> you
connect you new Linux installation to the internet for the
first-time. Configure it to deny all incoming packets except those
that are <code>ESTABLISHED</code> or <code>RELATED</code>. This
will provide maximum protection while you carry out the rest of the
steps to secure your installation. Once you have completed all of
the steps you can then configure your firewall policy as you
require.</p>

<p>I introduced the basic concepts of <code>iptables</code>, the
built-in firewall of the Linux kernel, and gave a number of example
configurations for various scenarios in &quot;<a href=
"http://www.linuxgazette.net/103/odonovan.html">Firewalling with
netfilter/iptables</a>&quot; from issue #103 of the Gazette. I strongly
recommend you read through this article and use it to complete
this step.</p>

<h3 id="update">2. Update All Installed Packages</h3>

A standard Linux distribution can come bundled with well over 1,000
packages and many of these will have had newer versions released by
the time you install them. Most of these updates will be feature
enhancements and bug fixes, but some will also be security fixes,
and some of these security fixes may be serious. Ensuring that all
of the installed packages are at their newest versions is not just
a job at installation but rather one that must be continued
throughout the lifetime the new installation. This can be a very
time consuming job and luckily there are a number of utilities that
can do this for us automatically. The two most common utilities
used are APT (Advanced Package Tool) and Yum (Yellowdog Updater,
Modified). 

<p>Some distributions may provide their own utilities and in those
cases you may find it easiest to just install them and use them as
pre-configured. For example RedHat and Fedora distributions come
with <code>up2date</code> and the Debian distribution uses APT by
default.</p>

<p>If you have or want to install one yourself I would recommend
APT which can be used with any RPM-based Linux distribution. You
will also need to locate a repository containing the new/updated
packages for you distribution from where APT can download and
install them. A quick internet search with the name of your
distribution and 'apt' or 'apt-get' should locate an APT binary RPM
and a repository for you. See the links following this article for
some useful sites and repositories.</p>

<p>Once you have APT installed and the repositories set-up (usually
<code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> or similar), its use is trivial
and involves only two commands (run as root):</p>

<pre>
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get upgrade
</pre>

The first command downloads the latest package information from the
repository and the second uses this information to download and
install newer versions of already installed packages if available.
These commands should be performed regularly to ensure your system
is always up-to-date. 

<p>If you wish to ensure maximum security you should always try to
use official repositories containing signed packages; this is best
accomplished by using the default auto-updater supplied by the more
popular distributions. When downloading individual packages and
files from the internet, always try and use <code>md5sum</code>
(c.f. <code>man md5sum</code>). An MD5SUM is a hash/checksum of a
file and most download sites publish the MD5SUMs of the files they
have available for download; comparing these with the ones you
generate from the downloaded file will help ensure that you have an
not downloaded a trojaned version of the package/file.</p>

<p>Finally, you should strongly consider subscribing to your
distribution's security mailing list. These are usually low-volume
lists and you will be informed by e-mail whenever a new package is
released that fixes a vulnerability.</p>

<h3 id="services">3. Stop and Disable All Unnecessary Services</h3>

A new installation of many Linux distributions will have many
services/daemons configured to start each time you boot your
machine. Some of these might include the HTTP (web server),
POP3/IMAP (e-mail) daemons, a database server, etc. Many of these
will be unnecessary for many users and can offer a potential
attacker many routes to infiltrate your new operating system. You
should go through each of them and stop <strong>and
disable</strong> all of those you don't need. 

<p>The bigger and more common distributions will probably have a
GUI application for configuring these services; try looking in the
Settings or System menus of your desktop's application menu for
this.</p>

<!-- 
dsrich 25July2004 - chkconfig and service apparently ship with RedHat,
so I changed the wording in the next paragraph to reflect this.  A 
version of the chkconfig utility appears to be available from
http://www.buttsoft.com/~thumper/software/sysadmin/chkconfig/
This utility only works on SysV-derived /etc/rc.d/rc.#/... arrangements,
not BSD versions like my Slackware, so I could not test it.
-->

<p>On RedHat systems, the command line utility for configuring services
is called <code>chkconfig</code>. To list the current status of all
installed services, execute (as root):</p>

<pre>
$ chkconfig --list
</pre>

which will generate something similar to: 

<pre>
iptables        0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off
sshd            0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off
sendmail        0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off
httpd           0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off
 ...             ...     ...     ...     ...     ...     ...     ...
 ...             ...     ...     ...     ...     ...     ...     ...
smb             0:off   1:off   2:off   3:off   4:off   5:off   6:off
squid           0:off   1:off   2:off   3:off   4:off   5:off   6:off
xinetd based services:
        chargen-udp:    off
        rsync:          off
        chargen:        off
          ...           ...
          ...           ...
        sgi_fam:        on
</pre>

<p>The numbers (0 through 6) preceding the colons represent the
system &quot;run-levels&quot; where the two of usual concern are 3 and 5; if
your system boots to a console (no GUI) then it runs in level 3
whereas if it boots to a GUI it runs in level 5.</p>

<p>To enable a service (say <code>squid</code>) in run-levels 2,3,4
and 5 we would execute (as root):</p>

<pre>
$ chkconfig --level 2345 squid on
</pre>

and to disable a service (say <code>sshd</code>) in levels 3 and 5
we would execute (as root); 

<pre>
$ chkconfig --level 35 sshd off
</pre>

<p>If you do not know what a particular service that is enabled is
or does then try an internet search or try using the
<code>man</code> command with the service name as a keyword
(<code>man -k</code>). Some of the GUIs may offer an explanation of
what the services are.</p>

<p>The <code>chkconfig</code> command will enable/disable services
the next time you boot your computer but it won't have any effect
on whether or not a service is currently running.
Under RedHat, we use the <code>service</code> command as follows:</p>

<pre>
$ service service_name start
$ service service_name stop
$ service service_name restart
$ service service_name status
</pre>

where <code>service_name</code> is the same as those reported by
<code>chkconfig --list</code>. 

<p>You can run <code>netstat -l</code> after disabling all
unnecessary services to ensure you got them all (it checks what
sockets are listening for connections). For the services which you
do keep running, ensure that they are correctly (and restrictively)
firewalled and configured.</p>

<h3 id="SUID">4. Locate and Remove/Alter Unnecessary SUID/SGID's</h3>

A SUID (set user ID) or a SGID (set group ID) program
is one that allows an ordinary user to execute it with elevated
privileges. A common example is the <code>passwd</code> binary
which, among other functions, allows an ordinary user to change
their login password. However, these passwords are stored in a file
that can only be altered (and sometimes read) by the root user and,
as such, non-root users should be unable to change their passwords.
The access privileges for this binary are: 

<pre>
-r-s--x--x  1 root root 18992 Jun  6  2003 /usr/bin/passwd
</pre>

As you can see, the owner execute bit is set to '<code>s</code>'
instead of the usual '<code>x</code>', making the binary SUID; i.e.
when an ordinary user executes <code>passwd</code>, it will run
with the privileges of the file's owner - in this case the root
user. 

<p>Many SUID/SGID executables are necessarily so, such as
<code>passwd</code> above. However many others are not. SUID/SGID
programs can be exploited by malicious local users to gain elevated
privileges on your system. Run the following command as root to
find all of these executables:</p>

<pre>
find / \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \)
</pre>

or for a more detailed list use: 

<pre>
find / \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) -exec ls -ldb {} \;
</pre>

<p>We must now go through this list and try to reduce these files
that are owned by root or in the root group to the bare minimum by
either removing unnecessary SUID/SGID binaries and/or removing the
SUID/SGID bit.</p>

<p>Packages containing SUID/SGID executables that you are unlikely
to use can be removed by first finding the package with, say,
<code>rpm -q --whatprovides /usr/sbin/kppp</code> and then removing
it with <code>rpm -e package-name</code>.</p>

<p>The SUID/SGID bit can be removed with, for example, <code>chmod
-s /usr/sbin/kppp</code>. The executable can then be run by the
root user when needed.</p>

<h3 id="tools">5. Logwatch and Tripwire</h3>

Although we may do our best to secure our system, the reality of
the situation is that no matter how much effort we make we will
never be completely secure. Rather than burying our heads in the
sand and hoping for the best, there are a few other things we can
do to ensure that we know if and when our system is compromised. 

<p>One intrusion detection program that is often underestimated and
under used is Tripwire (<a href=
"http://www.tripwire.org/">http://www.tripwire.org/</a>). This
program checks your system's files periodically to see if they have
been changed. If any have that should not have, Tripwire will
generate a report for you to act on. Tripwire takes a little time
to configure and set up properly but it is well worth the effort;
Tripwire helped me to identify an intrusion on a server I was
administering a couple of years back. I will cover the proper
installation and configuration of Tripwire in next month's
article.</p>

<p>An invaluable source of information on what is going on in the
background of your computer are the log files (usually in 
<code>/var/log</code>). All logging on a Linux system is handled by
the <code>syslogd</code> daemon and its configuration file
<code>/etc/syslog.conf</code>. The configuration file specifies
what facilities or subsystems to record messages from (e.g. cron,
daemon, mail, etc), what level of messages to log (e.g. debug,
info, warn, etc) and what to do with these messages (append to log
file, send to printer, etc). If you wish to change the default
configuration you will find a lot of information in the various man
pages (<code>syslogd</code>(8), <code>syslog.conf</code>(5),
<code>syslog</code>(2), <code>syslog</code>(3) and more).</p>

<p>Syslog also allows remote logging; placing your log files on
another networked system. The advantage of this is that if your
system is compromised by someone they will be unable to remove
their steps from your logs making the tracing of their origin and
their actions all the easier.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there is far too much information in the various
log files for the average user to assimilate each day and for this
reason we turn to Logwatch. Logwatch (<a href=
"http://www.logwatch.org/">http://www.logwatch.org/</a>), as
described by its authors, &quot;parses through your system's logs for a
given period of time and creates a report analysing areas that you
specify, in as much detail as you require.&quot;</p>


<p>Logwatch is installed with most common distributions as standard
and by default it will usually generate daily reports and e-mail
them to the root user. As these reports are usually short they
should be read every day. They will highlight, depending on its
configuration, such information as invalid login attempts, network
connections to various daemons such as SSHD, possible port scans,
etc. Its configuration file is usually located in
<code>/etc/log.d/conf/logwatch.conf</code> and it is well
documented with comments to help you out.</p>

<p>There are a number of other intrusion detection systems you
might like to consider, such as Snort - <a href=
"http://www.snort.org/">http://www.snort.org/</a>, and you can
easily find them with a quick internet search.</p>

<h3>Closing Remarks</h3>

Security is not something that you consider at installation and
then put on the back burner; rather it <strong>must be</strong>
something that is always on your mind in everything you do; whether
it be ensuring your system is up-to-date, ensuring proper password
policies, governing whom you grant access to your system to and
what level of access, reading your daily logs, checking the
tripwire reports, reading the security mailing list of you Linux
distribution, etc. There is an old saying that is hugely relevant
to computer security: 
<em>&quot;A chain is only as strong as the weakest link&quot;</em>.
 It can just take one lapse of effort or
concentration on your part to open one security hole and all your
effort will be wasted. 

<p>This article covers the basics - the important procedures that
every user should do. There is always more that <em>can be
done</em> but each person will have to weigh up the potential
advantage against the cost in terms of the time and the effort
involved.</p>

<p>Some final nuggets of advice:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Never ever</strong> use telnet, ftp or any other
plain-text remote sessions that involve typing a user name or a
password. You should <strong>always and only</strong> use ssh, sftp
and similar utilities.</li>

<li>Have different user names/passwords for logging into unencrypted
(http) and encrypted (https) web pages and <strong>never
ever</strong> use the same user names and passwords that you use for
logging into your computers.</li>

<li><strong>Always</strong> use a restrictive firewall policy;
<code>DROP</code> all connections be default and only open those
you need in an as restrictive manner as possible. For example if
you need to ssh into your computer from work and no where else then
only allow your work-based IPs through.</li>

<h3>A Note on Last Month's Article</h3>

Thomas Adam pointed out a potential conflict in my article last
month (&quot;<a href="http://linuxgazette.net/104/odonovan.html">
Automatic Backups with rsync and Anacron</a>&quot;, Linux Gazette 
#104). In the article I had crontabs such as: 

<pre>
00 02 * * * rsync -r -e ssh --delete /home/username/mail
username@mycomputer.mycompany.com:/backups/mail
...
</pre>

Thomas rightfully informed me that &quot;this could cause a few issues
if one is already running some kind of &quot;ntp&quot; check, since the task
running at precisely 02:00 could clock skew. This would cause the
scheduled rsync process above to get reloaded by cron multiple
times or even not at all. Therefore, it is best to offset the time
to either a few minutes before the hour, or a few minutes
afterwards.&quot;

<p>Thanks for pointing that out. And, as always, I welcome all
feedback, compliments and criticism. You'll find my e-mail by
clicking on my name at the top of this article.</p>
