<h3>Car auction scam</h3>

Anybody who knows me knows how inappropriate this is.  What would I do
with a car, put it in my living room?  Note the terms: you pay a fee
and $10,000 deposit, we "promise" to return the deposit if your car(s)
don't win the auction.  "We cannot put prospective business partner
funds in our bank account,that's why we will be using e-gold payment
only."
</p>

<p>
This does count as the first time I've heard of anybody actually using
e-gold for anything.

&gt; Quoting the most recent press release on the VA $WHATEVER Web site:
&gt; 
&gt;   VA Software Corporation (Nasdaq: LNUX), the online media, software, 
&gt;   and e-commence leader in community-driven Open Source innovation, 
&gt;   today announced that Scott E. Howe has joined the company's Board 
&gt;   of Directors effective March 7, 2007. Howe brings more than eight
&gt;   years of experience in the areas of internet media, technology, and
&gt;   advertising.
&gt;   [...]
&gt;   Howe is President for DRIVE Performance Media, a division of
&gt;   aQuantive, Inc. aQuantive is a global digital marketing company and the
&gt;   parent company of interactive agencies, performance media and behavioral
&gt;   targeting businesses, and providers of integrated digital marketing
&gt;   technologies throughout the world. [...]
&gt; [...] 
&gt; In other words, one of the many firms quietly making money off
&gt; "metrics", i.e., spying on the user, data-mining / data sales,
&gt; consequent targeted advertising, etc., "integrated digital marketing
&gt; technologies" being one of the standard corporate euphemisms for spying.
</pre>

<p>
Apparently, Microsoft Corporation badly, badly wanted a ride on the same
bus, because they just acquired qQuantive for SIX GIGABUCKS (US $6 x 10^9).
</p>

<p>
US readers can be excused if they've become blase about huge dollar
figures after years of underwriting BushCo Federal budgets, but some
context may help:  Microsoft's _total equity_ is $34.9 x 10^9.  So, they
just sunk 1/6 of the full net value of their firm into this purchase.
</p>

<p>
(MSFT common stock took a $1 hit to $30.6, but is still near 7-year highs.)
</p>

<p>
Hmm, sudden, massive market diversification immediately following the
firm's annual Be Very Afraid Tour?[1]  Maybe a sign that those
unspecified patents are mostly crap, and that they fear increasing
danger to the monopoly gravy-train?

Western kind of 419 scam.  Note the empty addressee name.
</p>

<p>
---------- Forwarded message ----------
</p>

<p>
Dear,
</p>



<p>
My name is Grace Smith, I am 24 years old, from London - England,
where I school and work as a fashion designer for part time job I do
after my school. I am the only daughter of my parents my father died
on a fatal auto accident on his way to see my sick mother at the
hospital where she was admitted for Cancer treatments, she also die
when she heard about the death of my father in same day and hospital.
</p>



<p>
Before the death of my father, he had Willed part of his Real Estate
Business, Gas Stations and a total sum of =A350,700,000.00(Fifty
Million, Seven Hundred Thousand Pounds Sterling) to me. Now at his
death, and because things has become very hard for me paying my school
fees, putting food on the table and taking care of my other needs
which my fashion designer work I do as a part time work after my
school can't help, I went to the bank where my late father deposited
the funds on my behalf to with draw money to take care of my self and
pay for my school fees and other bills.
</p>



<p>
I was shocked when the Bank Manager explained to me that I will  not
be able to draw from the deposited money, because my father had
putting a clause on the Will, which he used in depositing the funds
with them, saying that before I will be given access to the money, I
will either have to be 30 years old or I will be given access to the
money, if I get married before the age of 30 , in which case, my
husband will be legible to collect the money on my behalf by standing
in as my late fathers next of kin to claim the deposited funds on my
behalf.
</p>



<p>
Today I am only 24 years old. And I have no access to the money till
I'm 30 years. So, I'm contacting you to stand in as my husband to
claim this fund on my behalf if you are married already, you can still
help me by standing in as my late fathers next of kin to the deposited
funds. So, please get back to me as to know how you will be
remunerated as I will part with 40% of the total sum =A350,700, 000.00
(Fifty Million, Seven Hundred Thousand Pounds Sterling) ,while 10%
will be mapped out for any expenses that we're to use to receive the
money from the deposited Bank.
</p>



<p>
Please remember that I am writing you this email purely on the ground
of trust so we can achieve this deal together. This transaction will
last for two weeks after you get back to me on how serious you are to
claim these funds on my behalf.
</p>




<p>
Yours Truly,
Grace Smith
