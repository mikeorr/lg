<h1>Sharing a keyboard and mouse with Synergy (Second Edition)</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/silva.html">Anderson Silva</a> and <a href="../authors/milner.html">Steve 'Ashcrow' Milner</a></b></p>

<p> 
<a href="http://synergy2.sf.net/">Synergy</a> is an open source project
that allows you to share a keyboard and a mouse among several different
computers, each connected to some sort of monitor, without any extra
hardware (e.g., KVM switches). Synergy runs over the network, and can be
used with several different operating systems.
</p>

<p>
Synergy runs as a client/server application, where the server is the
computer that will have the keyboard and mouse attached to it, and all
others will connect as clients. Switching from one display to another is
only a matter of moving the mouse to the edge of the screen, and Synergy
will detect the mouse pointer leaving one screen and entering another.
</p>

<h3>
Advantages of using Synergy
</h3>

<ul>
<li>You can copy and paste between computers, because Synergy merges 
    clipboards across the systems.</li>
<li>It synchronizes screen savers (lock screens), so they start up 
    at the same time.</li>
<li>If you have an old computer or laptop, you can use it as a Synergy 
    client through an SSH session, and you can make your multi-computer 
    environment behave like a multi-display workstation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Installing Synergy<br>
</h3>

<p>
If you use a Debian-based distribution, you should be able to run:
</p>

<p>
<code>sudo -c apt-get install synergy</code>
</p>
  
<p>
While on an RPM-based distribution, you can install by running:
</p>

<p>
As root:
</p>

<p>
<code>yum install synergy</code>
</p>

<h3>
Setting up Synergy as the server
</h3>

<p>
Create a config file called <tt>synergy.conf</tt>. (You may place it in /etc or in
~/.synergy.conf.) Below is a basic example of the synergy.conf file that
configures a client workstation to the right of the server. Notice that,
under the options section, we have turned on screensaver
synchronization.
</p>

<pre class="code">
section: options
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;screenSaverSync = true
end
section: screens
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;server.hostname:
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;client.hostname:
end
section: links
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;server.hostname:
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;right = client.hostname
client.hostname:
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;left = server.hostname
end
</pre>

<p>
The screens section defines what screens are available. In the links
section, the screens are set up relative to each other.  
</p>

<p>
You can find more detailed configuration options at <a
href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/configuration.html">Synergy's
configuration file format page</a>.
</p>

<h3>
Starting up Synergy as the server
</h3>

<p>
As your regular (non-root) user, start the server:
</p>

<pre class="code">
synergys --config /etc/synergy.conf
</pre>

<p>
The Synergy web site also has a dedicated session for <a
href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/autostart.html">auto-starting the
Synergy server on different platforms</a>.
</p>

<h3>
Setting up Synergy as the client
</h3>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you have installed the Synergy package on your client 
    machines, just as you did on the server.</li>
<li>Make sure your client and server have defined hostnames
    other than localhost. If not, you can still use an IP address to 
    designate Synergy's hostname.</li>
<li>Make sure you are logged in to your X environment.</li>
<li>Don't run synergyc as root</li>
<li>Open a terminal, and start up the client:
<code> synergyc -f server.hostname</code>
<br>
<br></li>
</ol>

<p>
If the connection is successful, you will see the message below, as 
part of the output from the connections:
</p>

<pre class="code">
NOTE: synergyc.cpp,247: connected to server
</pre>

<p>
If the connection fails, the client will keep trying to re-connect a few
more times, but we recommend you look at 
<a href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/">Synergy's troubleshooting
page</a>. Once you have successfully connected the client and the
server, you can remove the <code>-f</code> option
from the synergyc command, and it will run as a background process on
your computer.  
</p>

<h3>
Firewall
</h3>

<p>
As with any good server-client application, it is important to remember
that you may need to configure your firewall to allow the connections
between synergys and synergyc to be established. Synergy runs on port
24800 by default, but by using the -a option, you can customize the
server to listen on a different socket.  
</p>

<h3>
Privacy
</h3>

<p>
Note that, if you will be using Synergy over a network that is shared
with other users, you may want to look into wrapping your usage with <a
href="http://www.stunnel.org/">stunnel</a> or 
<a href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/security.html">SSH</a>.  
</p>

<h3>
Synergy+
</h3>

<p>
Since 2006, there haven't been any updates to Synergy. Since then,
a 'maintenance fork' has been created and called 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/" id="wvc9"
title="Synergy+">Synergy+</a> (synergy-plus). The new project has posted a
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/issues/list?can=1&amp;q=status:ReallyFixed,MaybeFixed,AlmostFixed"
id="i_qr" title="list of fixes">list of fixes</a> its developers have
implemented so far, and 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/issues/list?can=2&amp;q=&amp;sort=-milestone&amp;colspec=ID%20Stars%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Milestone%20Owner%20Summary"
id="ycfh" title="issues">issues</a> they want to fix or implement in future
releases, including the implementation of secure connections between
client and server.  
</p>

<h3>
QuickSynergy
</h3>

<p>
To make life even easier, two developers from Brazil, C&eacute;sar L. B.
Silveira and Ot&aacute;vio C. Cordeiro, have developed a GUI for configuring
Synergy. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/quicksynergy/" id="vn8a"
title="Quicksynergy">Quicksynergy</a> is available in several Linux
distributions, and is also available under Mac OS X (Leopard).  
</p>

The 'Share' tab is for your server, and the 'Use' tab for your client.<br>
</div>

<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>

<p>
With Synergy set up and installed, you no longer have to envy coworkers
with multi-monitor setups, and you will be able to breathe new life into
your old computers and displays.
