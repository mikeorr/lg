Greetings LG readers,
</p>

<p>
   When using LaTeX, there are times when you might want to place an
   image and a short paragraph side by side. Here's an illustration of
   what I'm referring to:
</p>

<pre>
   +---------------------+---------------------+
   |image goes here      | short paragraph     |
   |                     | goes here           |
   |                     |                     |
   |                     |                     |
   |                     |                     |
   |                     |                     |
   |                     |                     |
   |                     |                     |
   +---------------------+---------------------+
</pre>
   In that case, try using the minipage environment. The following
   snippet of LaTeX macro can be used to implement the above
   illustration:
</p>

<pre>
   \begin{center}
   \begin{minipage}[l][4.5cm][t]{4cm}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{path/to/your/eps/image/file}
   \end{minipage} \qquad\qquad
   %
   \begin{minipage}[l][4.5cm][t]{6.5cm}
   A short paragraph of text goes here.
   \end{minipage}
   \end{center}
</pre>
   Play around with the various options to get your desired effect.
</p>

<p>
Greetings LG readers,
</p>

<p>
The default boot loader in Slackware is LILO. On some platforms, such
as the IBM ThinkPad R40, my experience is that LILO can take quite
some time before it boots Slackware 12.0. You can add the option
"compact" to your /etc/lilo.conf to speed up the process, but this is
not guaranteed to work on all platforms. An alternative is to use the
GRUB boot loader.
</p>

<p>
If you boot Slackware 12.0 with GNU GRUB 0.97, you might see the
following boot message on your screen:
</p>

<p>
[snip]
</p>

<pre>
&gt; Testing root filesystem
&gt;
&gt; <strong>*</strong> ERROR: Root partition has already been mounted read-write. Cannot check!
&gt;
&gt; For filesystem checking to work properly, your system must initially mount
&gt; the root partition as read only. Please modify your kernel with 'rdev' so that
&gt; it does this. If you're booting with LILO, add a line:
&gt;
&gt;    read-only
&gt;
&gt; to the Linux section in your /etc/lilo.conf and type 'lilo' to reinstall it.
&gt;
&gt; If you boot from a kernel on a floppy disk, put it in the drive and type:
&gt;    rdev -R /dev/fd0 1
&gt;
&gt; If you boot from a bootdisk, or with Loadlin, you can add the 'ro' flag.
&gt;
&gt; This will fix the problem <strong>AND</strong> eliminate this annoying message. :^)
&gt;
&gt; Press ENTER to continue.
</pre>

<p>
The boot process hangs until you actually press the ENTER button on
your keyboard. To get rid of this boot message and the pause, try the
GRUB boot option "ro", or add this option to your /boot/grub/menu.lst.
For example, here is a snippet of my /boot/grub/menu.lst:
</p>

<p>
[snip]
</p>

<pre>
&gt; # Booting Linux distribution Slackware 12.0
&gt; title Slackware 12.0
&gt;     root (hd0,2)
&gt;     kernel /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/hda3 vga=0x31a resume=/dev/hda2 splash=verbose showopts ro
</pre>
[snip]
</p>

<p>
If you have done something such as adding a new partition that
changes all your partition numbers so that grub can't find the
right kernel do this at a grub prompt:
</p>

<p>
find &lt;kernel&gt;
</p>

<p>
Grub will then spit out the fully qualified path to the kernel in
question and allow you to edit your menu.lst to suit.

&gt;   Hi,
&gt; 
&gt;   I would like to report that the article "A Question Of Rounding" in
&gt; your issue #143 is completely misleading, because its author doesn't
&gt; understand how floating point works. Hence you published an article that
&gt; is particularly wrong.
</pre>

<p>
Thanks for your opinion; I've forwarded your response to the author.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt;   I'm sorry, but this article is very wrong, and give false informations
&gt; on a matter that isn't very well understood by many programmers, hence I
&gt; beg you to remove this article, for the sake of the teacher that already
&gt; have to fight against enough preconceived ideas about ieee 754 numbers
&gt; already.
</pre>

<p>
Sorry, that's not in the cards - but we'll be happy to publish your
email in the next Mailbag.
</p>

<p>
I understood, even before I approved the article for publication, that a
lot of people had rather strong feelings and opinions on this issue;
i.e., the author getting flamed when he tried to file a bug report on
this was a bit of a clue. Those opinions, however, don't make him wrong:
whatever other evils can be ascribed to Micr0s0ft, their approach to
IEEE-754 agrees with his - and is used by the majority of programmers in
the world. That's not a guarantee that they (or he) are right - but it
certainly implies that his argument stands on firm ground and has merit.
</p>

<p>
You are, of course, welcome to write an article that presents your
viewpoint. If it meets our requirements and guidelines
(<a href="../faq/author.html">http://linuxgazette.net/faq/author.html</a>), I'd be happy to publish it.

<h3>rsync not working when trying to update LG mirror</h3>

<p>
Hey everyone,
  I maintain a mirror for LG at my site and recently it was brought to 
my attention that the mirror had gone out of date. I had the update 
script set up as a cron job so didn't monitor it. But apparently it has 
been failing with the following errors:
</p>

<p>
u38576182:~/public_html/suramya.com/linux/gazette &gt; ./sync_mirror.sh 
      rsync: failed to connect to linuxgazette.net: Connection refused
rsync error: error in socket IO (code 10) at clientserver.c(97)
rsync: failed to connect to linuxgazette.net: Connection refused
rsync error: error in socket IO (code 10) at clientserver.c(97)
</p>

<p>
The sync script contains the following code:
</p>

<p>
u38576182:~/public_html/suramya.com/linux/gazette &gt; cat sync_mirror.sh
RSYNC_RSH=/usr/bin/ssh
export RSYNC_RSH
rsync -avz --exclude /ftpfiles/ linuxgazette.net::lg-all www_root
rsync -avz linuxgazette.net::lg-ftp ftpfiles
</p>

<p>
This only happens on this one particular system. When I try it on my 
local system it runs without issues. Any idea why the lingazette.net is 
rejecting the rsync connection? If I try to ssh to linuxgazette.net from 
the server I get a password prompt.
</p>

<p>
This server has rsync version 2.5.6cvs  protocol version 26 installed. 
Its a shared hosting account so I don't have root access on the server.
</p>

<p>
Any help would be appreciated
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
  Suramya

hi

<p>
 I got a hp pavillion dv1000 series laptop and it's loaded with Redhat
</p>

<p>
 I am unable to get the usb support working on it.
</p>

<p>
 I checked out the lsmod and it shows the uhci and ohci drivers inserted.
</p>

<p>
 I however donot see any hid driver or usbcore module. I did a slocate on my system but didnot find them either. I definitely chose to have these supports when compiling my 2.6.22.6 kernel.
</p>

<p>
 What am I doing wrong ?

Hi I'm on a P4 running an smp kernel ie.
</p>

<p>
uname -a :
 
Linux jims-laptop 2.6.20-16-386 #2 Sun Sep 23 19:47:10 UTC 2007 i686
GNU/Linux
</p>

<p>
For some reason occasionaly one of my cpu's runs away and starts showing
100% cpu usage, however top only shows the program using the most cpu at
7% or less. Where is that 93% going? This is driving me crazy. I have to
reboot the machine to get it back to normal. I've tried Fedora and
Kubuntu. Though Kubuntu appeared more stable it still happened. Played
around with changing max_cstate without success.I've just downgraded to
a 386 kernel to see if that helps. This isn't a real solution however.
Do you have any suggestions? I've asked around on forums and irc
channels without luck. Thanks.
Jim

<p>
I have a couple of scripts that almost work, and I was wondering if
anyone (Ben? <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> could tell me why...
</p>

<p>
First, I want to convert a list of tags in the IPA PAN's corpus format
(subst:pl:dat:f) to Apertium's tag format (n.f.pl.dat). I have this:
</p>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
 
use warnings;
use strict;
 
# tags to replace
my %terms = qw(n nt pri p1 sec p2 ter p3 subst n);
 
while (&lt;&gt;)
{
	my @in = split/:/;
	my @out = map { ($terms{$_} ne "") ? $terms{$_} : $_ } @in;
	if ($#out &gt; 3) {
		my $type = $out[3];
		$out[3] = $out[2];
		$out[2] = $out[1];
		$out[1] = $type;
	}
	print join '.', @out;
}
</pre>

<p>
That's broken, because it only works for tag sets which have more than
4 entries, but changing the if to "($#out &gt;= 3)" gives me this:
".sg.nomxxs.m3" from "xxs:sg:nom:m3". I also get a lot of warnings:
</p>

<pre>
Use of uninitialized value in string ne at foo.pl line 11, &lt;&gt; line 1085.
Use of uninitialized value in string ne at foo.pl line 11, &lt;&gt; line 1086.
</pre>

<p>
Next, I have a list of names extracted from a Polish morphology
dictionary[1] that I'm trying to convert to a list of word stems and
endings. I have this, which works (aside from a couple of errors):
</p>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
 
use warnings;
use strict;
 
use String::Diff qw/diff_fully/;
use Data::Dumper;
 
#test();
while(&lt;&gt;)
{
	s/,\W+$//;
	my $endings = $_;
	my @a = split/, /;
	my $stem = find_stem(@a);
	$endings =~ s/$stem//g;
	print $stem;
	if ($endings =~ /?/) {print ":n.f:";}
	elsif ($endings =~ /owie/) {print ":n.m1:";}
	else {print ":n.??:";}
	print $endings . "\n";
}
 
sub test()
{
	my $test = "Adam, Adama, Adaemie, Adamowi, Adamem, Adamach, Adamami, Adamom";
	my @t = split/, /, $test;
	print find_stem(@t);
	print "\n";
}
 
sub find_stem()
{
	my @in = @_;
	my ($r, $l, $cur, $last);
	my $i=0;
 
	while ($i&lt;($#in))
	{
		($r, $l) = diff_fully($in[$i], $in[$i+1]);
	
		$cur = $r-&gt;[0]-&gt;[1];
		$last = $cur if (!$last);
		if ($cur ne $last) {
			($r, $l) = diff_fully($last, $cur);
			$last = $r-&gt;[0]-&gt;[1];
		}
	$i++;
	}
	return $last;
}
</pre>

<p>
but if I change the end of the while() to this:
</p>

<pre>
	else {print ":n.??:";}
	my @ends = split/, /, $endings;
	sort(@ends);
	$endings = join(',', at ends);
	print $endings . "\n";
</pre>

<p>
to sort the endings, it... doesn't. What am I missing?

</p>

<p>
I did not touch any other file or area.
If I "killall httpd" and run /usr/sbin/httpd, then the index.html under
the /~user/public_html displays. That means that it seems worked for my
purpose. 
</p>

<p>
However, after I run "/etc/init.d/httpd restart", it displayed stopping
httpd [ok] starting httpd [ok], but I will not be able to see my
index.html file under the /~user/public_html 
</p>

<p>
The system index.html (the testing page) always worked.
</p>

<p>
 
</p>

<p>
The wired thing is after I taking out all the #lines within the
/etc/init.d/httpd file, I can use "/etc/init.d/httpd restart" to make it
work.  
</p>

<p>
 
</p>

<p>
However, when the machine reboots, it does not work again.  I have tried
to put "/etc/init.d/httpd restart" at end of the rc.local to force the
web serve stop and start at the boot.  The server will stop and then
start, but it does not display my web page.  
</p>

<p>
 
</p>

<p>
I have also tried to put "/etc/init.d/httpd stop" and "/usr/sbin/httpd"
at end of rc.local.  It does not display my web either.
</p>

<p>
 
</p>

<p>
The S85httpd is linked with .../init.d/httpd
</p>

<p>
 
</p>

<p>
I have tried with "/usr/sbin/apachectl start", it does not work either
manually or inside the rc.local
</p>

<p>
 
</p>

<p>
Here is the summary:
</p>

<p>
Manually /usr/sbin/httpd worked (after I killed all the httpd process)
</p>

<p>
Manually /etc/init.d/httpd worked (only after I took out all the #lines,
and I don't know why it matters)
</p>

<p>
Apachectl never worked.
</p>

<p>
The machine boot up does not work.
</p>

<p>
May you help me?
</p>

<p>
Thanks in advance.
</p>

<p>
Just wondering, why all the GNU/Linux man pages refer to copyright
only and do not have no reference / brief statement regd "copyleft".
</p>

<p>
Quicky browsing through the
"<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html</a>", I did understand that
this concept of copyleft is incorporated by applying copyright and
then adding terms of distribution.
</p>

<p>
To quote from the above URL,
</p>

<p>
"To copyleft a program, we first state that it is copyrighted; then we
add distribution terms, which are a legal instrument that gives
everyone the rights to use, modify, and redistribute the program's
code or any program derived from it but only if the distribution terms
are unchanged . . . "
</p>

<p>
Any thoughts ?
</p>

<p>
Hi all!
</p>

<p>
I am working on an article titled "Distributed Version Control with Mercurial".
</p>

<p>
Basically, I am a newbie to Mercurial, so the article will be a result
of learning, and putting it in a simple, as-i-did-it way.
</p>

<p>
1. Now, I would like to know thoughts, experiences on Mercurial from
those of you who have already used it.
</p>

<p>
2. If you have made the switch from CVS/SVN to mercurial, then why did
you do it?
</p>

<p>
3. Automated tools you use to facilitate CVS/SVN repos to Mercurial.
</p>

<p>
All comments, insights are welcome.
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
Amit

<h3>Version control for /etc</h3>

<p>
Hello,
</p>

<p>
I was looking at version control mechanisms to handle /etc
on the machines here. If people on TAG have used such systems I would
appreciate feedback.
</p>

<p>
CVS: seems to be the classic solution. Cons: People say it is old and
unmaintained code which is "end-of-life".
</p>

<p>
Mercurial: One of the modern VC systems considered "notable" on
Rick Moen's knowledge base. One difficulty with "hg" is that it
insists on the "distributed" model. Putting the version control
history outside /etc (a la CVS) would require convoluted mounts.
</p>

<p>
GIT: Another modern VC system (though not "notable" as per Rick's
kb). It is rather similar to Mercurial in many ways. One difference
is that one can use the environment variable GIT_DIR to point to a
different directory for storing VC history.
</p>

<p>
Some reasons to keep VC history outside /etc:
	1. This way one can easily check for "cruft" without
	   adding an explicit "ignore" for ".hg" or ".git" ...
	2. Uses less space in "/etc".
	3. Can keep the history on an "archival" disk safe from
	   potential corruption.
</p>

<p>
Any thoughts/suggestions by people on TAG are welcome as usual!
</p>

<p>
Regards,
</p>

<p>
Kapil.

<h3>Question on how to block a ssh host from being used as a Socks proxy</h3>

<p>
Hey Everyone,
  I have been using a SOCKs proxy via SSH (using port tunneling [1]) to 
browse the net from unsecure locations and it works great.
</p>

<p>
  However I have noticed that when I connect to certain hosts I am 
unable to use the connection as a SOCKS proxy and I was wondering how 
these hosts were configured to do this. It seems like a good feature to 
have on servers that I configure. Are there any disadvantages to this 
setup that I am missing?
</p>

<p>
  I have tried looking for a solution online but I guess I am not asking 
the right questions because I didn't find anything useful. So any 
idea's/suggestions on what/where to look?
</p>

<p>
Thanks in advance.
</p>

<p>
[1] To set up a SOCKS proxy using SSH from a windows system follow these 
steps:
</p>

<p>
Open PuTTY. You should be greeted with a configuration screen. First, 
you will enter the hostname or IP address of the SSH server. Type in a 
name for your connection settings in the box below ?Saved Sessions?, and 
click the Save button.
</p>

<p>
Now you need to look at the tree of options to the left; expand the SSH 
tree, and select ?Tunnels?. Enter 4567 (or any port number above 1024) 
in the Source Port area, and click the Dynamic radio button to select 
it. Leave the Destination field blank, and click ?Add?.
</p>

<p>
Now go back to the Session tree (very top of the left section), and save 
again. You will be prompted to enter a username, which is the username 
of your shell account. Type that in, hit enter, and then type in your 
password when it prompts you.
</p>

<p>
In your browser change the proxy setting to localhost and the port you 
used earlier and you can browse the net safely.
</p>
