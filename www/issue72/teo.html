<H2>1. Why do you need a mailing list?</H2>

<P>
Picture this:
</P>

<P>
You've just started working with your colleagues on a new project. After the
first meeting, everyone agrees that sending e-mails about each other's progress
to all the members in the group periodically is the way to go. Everybody leaves
the table, and you send out your first message to your colleagues' e-mail
addresses. Everything goes well for awhile... until somebody new joins the
group. Now everybody has to update their long list of addresses in the "To:"
field, some people forget, and the new person didn't receive all the e-mails
and starts complaining. Gradually, things start turning into a mess.
</P>

<P>
As things become more haphazard, you say to yourself, "Now, if only I can send
all my e-mails to a single address, and that e-mail will propagate out to
everybody else." Well, that is possible. What you need is a mailing list.
</P>

Most of us aren't strangers to mailing lists, especially if you're
an active or long-time participant in the Linux community. But trust me, there
are people out there who aren't familiar with mailing lists and how convenient
they can be.

<P>
Now, let's say you agree that you need a mailing list. But you don't
have time to set up one. If you have been a participant in a public and busy
mailing list such as Bugtraq, you'll notice that they run a mailing list
management program such as Majordomo or ezmlm. If you want a <I>simple</I>
mailing list, and you need it quick, you don't need to play around with those.
Plus, you don't really need the more complex features they offer. A standard
Linux system is sufficient for setting up a simple mailing list for a workgroup.
</P>

<P>
In this article, I'll discuss how to set up such a simple mailing list using
the standard Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) that come with a standard Linux
distribution, such as sendmail, Postfix or exim. Remember, though, the keyword
is <i>simple</i>. That means that our mailing list will not have the fancy
features offered by the heavy duty mailing list management programs.
</P>

<P>
As an added bonus, I've written another article in this same Linux Gazette
issue that discusses how to set up a simple web-based archive of this mailing
list (it's entitled <A HREF="teo2.html">"Setting Up a Web-based Archive for a
Mailing List"</A>). But if a mailing list is all you need, and/or you don't
have time, this article is all you need to read.
</P>

<H2>2. Setting up the mailing list</H2>

<P>
Setting up the mailing list is pretty straightforward. I'll first talk about
what you need, and then proceed to the actual instructions on setting it up.
</P>

<H3>2.1 What you need</H3>

<P>
First, here's what you need to set up the mailing list:
</P>

<UL>
  <LI> <B>A Linux system that is permanently connected to the Internet with
  a static IP address, or your office internal network.</B> This is
  pretty obvious, but I'm putting it here just in case! ;-) Additionally, this
  system should be running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, or at least during
  the times of
  the day when your workgroup will be mailing each other.
  <LI> <B>A Mail Transfer Agent such as sendmail, Postfix or exim.</B> Most
       Linux distributions should come with one of these by default.
</UL> 

<P>
Once you've got all the requirements,
the very first thing you need to do is to check that your MTA is actually
running. I usually check this by running netstat as follows:
</P>

<P>
<PRE>
lteo@mybox:~$ <B>netstat -a | grep smtp</B>
tcp        0      0 *:smtp                  *:*                     LISTEN
</PRE>
</P>

<P>
If the system responds with that line, it usually means that your MTA is
up and running. If it is not running, you need to activate it. The actual way
to do that depends on the system.  For example, on Debian run
"/etc/init.d/sendmail start".  On Red Hat, run "/etc/rc.d/init.d/sendmail
start".  (Your system may have the script in a different location.)  To make it
permanent, do a "chmod +x /etc/init.d/sendmail" (or wherever). On Slackware,
you'll have to uncomment the lines that activate sendmail in /etc/rc.d/rc.M,
and either restart the system, or run it manually for now using the command in
that file.
</P>

<H3>2.2 Let's set it up!</H3>

<P>
The first thing you need to do is to think of a name for your mailing list.
For example, if the Linux box you're using is called mybox.example.com, you
can call your mailing list address "theproject@mybox.example.com".
Any e-mails sent to theproject@mybox.example.com will then be propagated to
all e-mail addresses registered to it. For the purpose of this article, let's
say we want the mails
that reach that address to go out to linus@mybox.example.com,
alan@example.net, and esr@example.org.
</P>

<P>
The next thing you need to do is to set up the MTA's aliases file. The
aliases file is usually stored as /etc/aliases or /etc/mail/aliases
depending on your Linux distribution. Once you locate it, fire up your
favorite text editor and edit it. You may see some default lines in that
file, such as "webmaster: root", "postmaster:root", and so on. Just ignore
those lines and scroll to the end of the file. Now add the following lines:
</P>

<P>
<PRE>
# The Project mailing list
theproject:
  linus,
  alan@example.net,
  esr@example.org
</PRE>
</P>

<P>
You can now save and exit from your editor.
</P>

<P>
As you can see, we can just use the string "linus" for
"linus@mybox.example.com" since our machine is
mybox.example.com and linus is a user on the machine. You can
write comments by placing them after the # symbol. The # symbol must be the
first character in the line.
</P>

<P>
<B>Important!</B> Now here comes the extremely <I>important</I> step!
Depending on which MTA you
are using, you may need to run a command for your changes to the aliases
file for it to take effect. If you don't, the mailing list will <I>not</I> work!
The following table shows what command you need
to run after editing the aliases file.
</P>

<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="1" CELLPADDING="3">
	<TR>
		<TH>MTA</TH><TH>Command</TH>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>sendmail</TD><TD><CODE>newaliases</CODE></TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Postfix</TD><TD><CODE>postaliases /etc/aliases</CODE></TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>exim</TD><TD><EM>[No command needed.]</EM></TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<P>
Congratulations! You should now have a working mailing list. To test it,
just send an e-mail to theproject@mybox.example.com, and see if
linus@mybox.example.com, alan@example.net, and esr@example.org get it.
Personally, I test my mailing lists using free webmail accounts just to see
if it really works.
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> <EM>[Note: example.com, example.net and example.org are domain names 
reserved for testing per 
<A HREF="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2606.txt">RFC 2606</A>, and will
never be assigned to real sites.  So watch the spambots harvest the addresses
above and send spam to nonexistent sites.  Whee!  &nbsp;&nbsp;-Iron]</EM>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Adding and removing e-mail addresses is straightforward. Just use your
text editor and add or remove those e-mail addresses from the aliases file.
Again, remember to run that all-important command after editing the aliases
file to inform the MTA that you've made changes.
</P>

<P>
There is one thing you need to know about this mailing list, though. Unlike
the full-blown mailing lists run by majordomo or ezmlm, a third
party can send e-mails
to our mailing list address and it'll still be sent to our registered
recipients' e-mail addresses. Therefore, there may be a security issue here.
That's why I stressed so much that this mailing list is meant to be
<I>simple</I>.
But if you're using it within a small trusted workgroup, it should be fine.
Also, you may want to avoid revealing your mailing list address to the public,
both for security and privacy reasons, and also to avoid getting spammed.
</P>

<H3>2.3 Summary</H3>

<P>
That's about it regarding setting up the mailing list. Simple, isn't it? Just
to make sure you don't miss out anything, here's a short summary of our
previous discussion on setting up a mailing list:
</P>

<P>
<OL>
	<LI> Make sure that your MTA is up and running. You can use the command
	"netstat -a | grep smtp" to check this.
	<LI> Choose a name for your mailing list, e.g.
	theproject@mybox.example.com.
	<LI> Add the mailing list addresses and register the e-mail addresses
	in the aliases file (either /etc/mail/aliases or /etc/aliases depending
	on your distribution).
	<LI> If you're using sendmail or postfix, run "newaliases" or
	"postaliases /etc/aliases" respectively. If you're using exim, you
	don't need to run anything.
	<LI> Test your mailing list by sending a test mail to
	theproject@mybox.example.com.
</OL>
</P>

<H2>3. Parting notes</H2>

<P>
<EM>That's it! I hope you find your brand new mailing list useful. I've used
this method of setting up mailing lists many times for my workgroups, friends,
and whenever there's a need for a simple mailing list. Of course, this is
just one way of setting up such a mailing list. If you've found this
method useful, or if you have any comments or suggestions, please feel free to
write to me about them. I would really like to hear from you.</EM>
</P>

<P>
Remember, if you want to know how to set up a web-based archive of this list,
you can read <A HREF="teo2.html">"Setting Up a Web-based Archive for a Mailing
List"</A>, also in this issue of Linux Gazette.
</P>

<P>
Till then, have fun!
