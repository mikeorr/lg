I mentioned the infinite monkeys idea in relation to SMT in my
article... I found today that it has been done:
<a href="http://www.markovbible.com/">http://www.markovbible.com/</a>
</p>

<p>
"You've seen the King James, the Gutenberg and the American Standard,
but now here is the future ........ The Markov Bible.
</p>

<p>
Everyone has heard the saying 'a million monkeys typing for a million
years will eventually produce the bible'.
</p>

<p>
Well, we have done it!!! And in a far shorter time.
</p>

<p>
Using our team of especially trained Markov Monkeys, we can rewrite
whole books of the bible in real time."

You can, of course, do the same thing yourself - with a variety of
sources. As the "dadadodo" man page says, "Sometimes these sentences are
nonsense, but sometimes they cut right through to the heart of the
matter and reveal hidden meanings." Note that I haven't done much
cherry-picking in the texts below, except for copying only the most
insteresting para or two from the first page shown.
