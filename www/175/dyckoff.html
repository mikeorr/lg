<h1>Away Mission - Upcoming in June:  SemTech, USENIX, OPS Camp</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>


<p>
This year, the Semantic Technology conference initiates a long week of
overlapping events. Since its hard to jump across the US in a single
week, you may have to select a single venue.
</p>

<p>
Semantic Technology, or SemTech, is moving from San Jose to San Francisco,
a cooler clime this time of year. I am looking forward to the change of
venue since it saves me from early morning commutes into Silicon Valley.
Unless you live in the Valley, this should make it easier to visit SemTech,
which is one of the better events to view the state of smart web
technology.
</p>

<p>
Now in its sixth year, SemTech 2010 features five days of presentations,
panels, tutorials, announcements, and product launches.  The focus this
year seems to be on the adoption of Semantic Tech by the government for
Open Government and transparency initiatives as well as business uptake in
a variety of industries. Among the keynote speakers, Dean Allemang, Chief
Technology Consultant at TopQuadrant will speak on the Semantic Web for the
Working Enterprise.
</p>

<p>
SemTech is run by Wilshire Conferences, which also organizes the Enterprise
Data World Conference and the annual Data Governance Conference as well as
the Semantic Universe publication.
</p>  

<p>
The USENIX Annual Technical Conference comes to Boston the same week and it
shares the site with many sub-conferences such as WebApps '10, a new
technical conference on all aspects of developing and deploying Web
applications.  Also happening under the Federated Conferences banner is the
1st USENIX Cloud Virtualization Summit and an Android Developer lab. That's
almost enough to make me travel 3000 miles to check it out.  Although
USENIX events tend to be academically-oriented, they also present the very
latest in research and innovation. Its well worth the trip if you live on
the Eastern seaboard.
</p>


<p>
OPS Camp comes to Seattle the same week and Atlanta the week before.
Please see the other Away Mission article on OPS Camp and the  DevOps Day
USA conference on June 25, 2010 in Mountain View, CA.  Its all about adding
state-of-the-art software engineering technology to Operations and
Infrastructure management.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, I will not be recommending the Velocity Conference as
O'Reilly has blocked my attendance there and at other O'Reilly events.
But the DevOps Day following that conference will probably discuss the
ideas presented there and that is a free event. Sign up early so you won't
be disappointed.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the following week brings Cisco Live! to Las Vegas. Since Cisco is
building server racks and expanding its Data Center offerings, this is
another important IT event. Fortunately, you can get some of the content
streamed over the web if you register early.  This requires advanced
registration as a "Guest".
</p>  

<p>
So pick an event or two, and enjoy the summer.
