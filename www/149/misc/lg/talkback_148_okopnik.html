Could you ask the author of the review of the book, 'Installing Linux on a
Dead Badger', which features in the latest edition of Linux Gazette, what
the book is actually about?
Having read his admittedly witty and erudite review, I'm still no clearer.
Thank you,

Heh. Steve, I actually wrote that review, and it's pretty much what the
title and the review say (and as the first chapter, linked to in the
review, shows): a book of geek humor. If I try to look at it from your
perspective, I can see where "humor" could be taken as an adjunct to the
actual book content... but in this case, it <em>is</em> the content.
</p>

<p>
Besides, you weren't <em>actually</em> trying to find a serious manual for
installing Linux on a dead badger, right? I mean, Xenix, <strong>maybe</strong>; DOS,
possibly - but not Linux. It would really crawl. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

&gt; Hi Ben,
&gt; Many thanks for taking the trouble to reply so promptly.
&gt; I guess I sounded like a grumpy old jerk - didn't mean to.
</pre>

<p>
Nah, it was fine. I don't have a problem with that classic "other side
of the pond" snarkiness - I've been reading Terry Pratchett for years.

nobly striving (and managing) to maintain a toxic^Wdecent level of UK
humor at LG.

&gt; I simply felt the review was about how clever the review was (and it 
&gt; was), and not about the actual content of the book.
</pre>

<p>
Eh... you've caught me out. It was partly that, partly the fact that I
only had a few minutes to do it (while publishing an issue of LG, no
less), and partly the confusion that I'd mentioned. I suspect that
unless I announced something like
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
THIS IS A BOOK OF GEEK HUMOR. IT'S <strong>ONLY</strong> A BOOK OF GEEK HUMOR. ALL
HUMANS WITHIN RANGE ARE ADVISED TO TAKE IMMEDIATE COVER OR RUN FOR THEIR
LIVES.
</pre>

<p>
people would scratch their heads and go, "*yeah*, geek humor, but what's
the book <em>really</em> about?" Most people use geek humor as a seasoning
rather than the main course, and this book goes against that recipe, so
you're right - I should have been more explicit about it. Not a thought
that comes to mind when time's running out, though.
</p>

<p>
However, once this exchange is published, everyone will know that THIS
IS A BOOK OF GEEK HUMOR, etc. We'll hold you responsible for anyone
trampled in the rush.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; And FYI, I happen to have Debian running perfectly well on an old and 
&gt; under-powered weasel. I just thought 'nix on a badger would make an 
&gt; interesting next challenge.
&gt; ;-)

<p>
Woo-hoo! Linux for Mammals! Saaay... that could be the next big title
from the "Linux for Dummies", etc. people...
