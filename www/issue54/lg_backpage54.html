Part computer programmer, part cartoonist, part Mars Bar. At night, he runs
around in a pair of colorful tights fighting criminals. During the day... well,
he just runs around.  He eats when he's hungry and sleeps when he's sleepy.

helping bring Linux to more people. I have been working with computers
for seven years on my own, learning as much as possible. I currently am
looking for a sales position within the Linux community. Talks are under
way with VALinux; my dream company. I have been a volunteer for both
Debian and LPI.

<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Chris Stoddard</H4>
I work for Dell Computer Corporation doing "not Linux" stuff.  I have been

exclusivly since 1997.  My main interest is in networking implementations,
servers, security, Beowulf clusters etc.  I hope someday to quit my
day job and become the Shepard of a Linux Farm.

<!-- *** BEGIN Not Linux *** --->

<P> I really should change the title of this column, because most of the
material <EM>is</EM> about Linux....

<P> I'm really happy with how the Answer Gang is turning out.  Thanks also to
Michael "Alex" Williams for helping to format the Mailbag and 2-Cent Tips
starting this month.

<P> <EM>Linux Gazette</EM> is now available via anonymous rsync.  This is good
news for our mirrors, because it decreases their update bandwidth.  See
<A HREF="../faq/index.html#rsync">the FAQ, question 14</A> for instructions.

<P> I've got a new title now, <STRONG>Chief Gazetteer</STRONG>.  This was
invented by our sysadmin assistant Rory Krause.
