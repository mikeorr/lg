&gt; I hope you've been keeping well. Just got a question about one of your
&gt; articles, and thought you might want to participate in the free-for-all.

<p>
I was just rolling up the sleeves to dive in but I see it'd already been 
answered!

<p>
In any case, it's got me to renew my TAG membership so maybe I'll get to join 
in in the next question!

&gt; Subject: [TAG] Some stunnel questions (hopefully not too dumb)
&gt;
&gt;    Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;                       I'm trying to use Stunnel to create an encrypted
&gt; tunnel into my LINUX box from another LINUX box and as much as I hate to
&gt; admit it, I know relatively little about SSL implementation. I would like
&gt; to set up connection from a relatively dumb test client application which
&gt; requests of my test server to send out the contents of a file which I
&gt; specify to it. This is done by firing up my server and having it listen to
&gt; requests on specific port number which I have chosen, accept the connection
&gt; and respond with the data over the socket. I have recently found Barry
&gt; O'Donovan's article in the Linux Gazette which seems to specify how to set
&gt; up Stunnel-4.XX to create an SSL aware server. That much seems reasonable.
&gt; But my question is "How do I setup a similar scheme for the client?"  I've
&gt; found other articles, but they seem to be for older versions of Stunnel
&gt; using flags that do not seem to apply to Stunnel-4.XX. So here I am with
&gt; half the solution I need. Now what? Help!!!!
&gt;
&gt;                              Many Thanks for serious replies,
&gt;
&gt;                                           Paul Harmon
