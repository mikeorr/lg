<h4>Back to School Special</h4>

<p>
 Well, it's been another great month for Linux.  
 We hear that Intel and Netscape are investing in Red Hat Inc.  
 and Intel is joining Linux International.
</p>

<p>
 So, everything is looking rosy for our favorite platform.
</p>

<p>
 What could be better?
</p>

<p>
 Well, I read an interesting editorial in ``;login'' the USENIX
 (<a href="http://www.usenix.org/">http://www.usenix.org/</a>) 
 Association's monthly magazine.  This
 is by Jordan Hubbard, one of the founders of the FreeBSD project
 --- and an employee at Walnut Creek.  
</p>

<p>
 He talks about the tendency of the freenix "clans" to fragment
 and duplicate development effort over relatively petty differences
 in licensing and --- more often as a result of the slithings and 
 bites of "the snakes of Unrestrained Ego and Not Invented Here."
</p>

<p>
 This fragmentation has been crippling the overall Unix marketplace
 for twenty years.  The odd thing is that there is both a Unix 
 "community" and a "marketplace."  The members of the community 
 tend to form "clans" which may bicker but mostly feel that they 
 have mostly common goals.  We'll argue incessantly over the 
 advantages of a BSD'ish vs. a GPL license, or the superiority of
 'vi' over 'emacs' or vice versa (I'm a heretic on that battle
 --- I use xemacs in "viper" -- vi emulation mode).
</p>

<p>
 The Unix community has a long history of producing free software
 --- one that predates Linux, FreeBSD, X Windows, and even the Free
 Software Foundation itself.  The FSF's GNU project was the first
 <em>organized</em> and <em>formal</em> effort to produce a fully 
 usable system of tools that was unencumbered by corporate copyright 
 (some argue that the "encumberances" of the GPL are even too much --- 
 but that's back to the perennial clan feud; so let's skip it).
</p>

<p>
 We may believe that Linux is the culmination of that effort.  I 
 hope it's not.
</p>

<p>
 Jordan goes on to explain the FreeBSD attitude to software vendors
 that are expressing a renewed interest in the UNIX market and why
 he (and his associates) tell them "to port to Linux first (or at
 all)"
</p>

<p>
 The FreeBSD support for running Linux binaries is apparently pretty
 solid (my use of FreeBSD has only required native binaries).  It's
 possible that FreeBSD could be "fully Linux compatible" right down
 to compliance with the "Linux Standards Base."  (It's likely to be
 easier for FreeBSD to achieve compliance than it will be for the
 various non-x86 Linux ports).
<p>
</p>

<p>
 Jordan also goes on to speculate:
</p>

<blockquote>
	``
	Say, for example, that someone fairly prominent
	in the Linux community popped up and told various 
	users that they might want to give FreeBSD a whirl,
	just to check out what it has to offer lately.
	''
</blockquote>

<p>
 Well, I'm probably not "fairly prominent" enough to fullfill
 Jordan's wish here.  However, I've been saying that for years, here
 and in other fora.  I think some of the SVLUG members are sick of
 hearing me suggest it.
</p>

<p>
 My co-author (on the Linux book that we're writing) is a FreeBSD
 user.  Some of my best friends favor NetBSD.  My wife has been
 recently working for an outfit that uses FreeBSD for most of their
 desktop systems (only occasional spots of Linux) and Solaris for
 their servers.  (The FreeBSD support for Japanese is apparently
 very good --- and it seems to be *much* more popular than Linux in
 Japan)
</p>

<p>
 I've used FreeBSD and still recommend as an FTP server.  I tend to
 stick with Linux for two reasons.  The first is laziness, I've
 gotten much more used to Linux' quirks than FreeBSD's, and it's
 easy to pick up new CD's for Linux --- they're everywhere; I have
 to hunt around a bit for FreeBSD CD's.  
</p>

<p>
 However, I'm going to be trying a copy of 3.0 when it ships (I
 guess that will be near the end of this month).  I'd suggest that
 all serious Linux students and enthusiasts try one of the BSD's
 --- FreeBSD for x86's; NetBSD for just about anything else; OpenBSD
 if your putting up an "exposed" system and allowing shell access to
 it.
</p>

<p>
 Meanwhile I'll also suggest that you look at other operating
 systems entirely.  Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris .... 
 they're all Unix.  When you get beyond DOS/Windows/NT and MacOS
 all you see is UNIX.
</p>

<p>
 However there's quite a bit more out there.  You just have to 
 dig for them.  Here's one place where you can start:
</p>

	<a href="http://www.starshine.org/OS/"
	>http://www.starshine.org/OS/</a>

<p>
 I wrote that page a long time ago --- but most of the links
 still seem to be alive (O.K. Sven moved --- so I had to fix
 one link).
</p>
 
<p>
 Two notes of interest:  
</p>

<blockquote>
	Amoeba is now "free" 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	Amoeba is a distributed OS (think Beowulf clusters with
	lots of OS level support for clusering, process
	migration etc).  It was written as a research project
	by Andrew S. Tanenbaum of Vrije University (the author
	of Minix, and the text book from which Linus learned 
	some of what he know about OS design).  There was a 
	legendary "flamewar" (actually just a public debate)
	on the alt.os.minix newsgroup about the merits of
	monolithic kernels (Linux and the traditional Unix
	implementations) vs. "microkernels" (Minix, MACH, 
	the GNU HURD, NeXTStep, and many others).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	To learn more about Amoeba:
</blockquote>

<blockquote> <blockquote> <code>
		<a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/pub/amoeba/"
		>http://www.cs.vu.nl/pub/amoeba/</a>
</code> </blockquote> </blockquote>

<blockquote>
	The EROS project (Extremely Reliable OS) has apparently
	finally been completed (for its initial release).  I've
	mentioned this project in my earlier columns --- it is a 
	microkernel OS which implements a "pure capabilities"
	security and authority model.  This is so unlike the 
	identity and access control lists models we see in Unix,
	NT, Netware, VMS and other multi-user OS that it took me
	about a year to "unlearn" enough to get some idea of what
	they were talking about.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	EROS is not a free system.  However, there are provisions
	for free personal use and research.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	You can read more about EROS at:
</blockquote>

<blockquote> <blockquote> <code>
		<a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~eros/"
		>http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~eros/</a>
</code> </blockquote> </blockquote>

<blockquote>
	(The FAQ's explanation of capabilities and its comparison
	to ACL's and identity based authority models is *much* 
	better than anything that I found back when I first looked
	at this project a couple of years ago).
</blockquote>

<p>
 So, before you sing the praises of Linux to another potential
 convert --- consider your basis for comparison.  If you've only
 only used DOS/Windows/NT and Linux --- you'll want to go back to 
 school.
