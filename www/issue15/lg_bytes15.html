New Computer Operating System Rides Space Shuttle
</H3>
20 Feb 1997 <BR> 
A radically different new computer operating system is controlling an
experiment on a Space Shuttle mission in late March. The experiment
tests "hydroponics", a way of growing plants without soil that could
eventually provide oxygen and food to astronauts. The computer
controlling the experiment runs "Debian GNU/Linux", an operating system
built by a group of 200 volunteer computer programmers,
who give the system and all of its source code away for free.
Details are available on the group's web site: <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">
http://www.debian.org/</A>.  
<P>
The space shuttle experiment will fly on mission STS-83 in late March
and early April. Sebastian Kuzminsky is an engineer working on the
computer that controls the experiment, which is operated by Biosciences
Corporation. Kuzminsky said "The experiment studies the growth of
plants in microgravity. It uses a miniature '486 PC-compatible
computer, the Ampro CoreModule 4DXi. Debian GNU/Linux is loaded on this
system in place of DOS or Windows. The fragility and power drain of
disk drives ruled them out for this experiment, and a solid-state disk
replacement from the SanDisk company is used in their place. The entire
system uses only 10 watts", said Kuzminsky, as much electricity as a
night-light. "The computer controls an experiment in hydroponics, or
the growth of plants without soil", said Kuzminsky. "It controls water
and light for the growing plants, and sends telemetry and video of the
plants to the ground".

Linux Sponsored Penguin
</H3> 
<P>
SWANSEA, UK, January 29th, 1997 -- Linux users sponsor a penguin at Bristol
Zoo. A bunch of UK Linux fans and Linux World magazine confirms they have
sponsored Linus Torvalds a penguin for a christmas present.
<P>
"It has taken a bit of time for the paperwork to arrive but it has now been 
 scanned and can be found on http://penguin.uk.linux.org and is now leaving 
 for Finland." claimed Alan Cox, who leads the penguin sponsoring group. 
<P>
"It's not a suprise given the rumours circulating at usenet" said a prominent
Linux developer, "This has been on the cards for some time".
<P>
A plaque with the web site name on will also soon appear near the Penguin area
at Bristol Zoo which has been selected as the place to sponsor the penguin.
<P>
According to Alan Cox, Linus who as well as creating the Linux OS is also 
responsible for the choice of a penguin as logo, also gets ten free tickets 
to the Zoo as a result of the sponsorship. "It's not clear how he gets to
Bristol Zoo easily" admitted a spokesman who didn't wish to be named.
<P>
Linux is a high performance Unixlike OS that is winning major awards and
accolades. More information on Linux and the Linux Market are available
from <A HREF="http://www.uk.linux.org/">http://www.uk.linux.org/</A> and 
Linux International, <A HREF="http://www.li.org/">http://www.li.org</A>.
<P>
Bristol Zoo was founded in 1836 and is one of the oldest Zoos in europe. It
has an international reputation for its pioneering work with endangered species.
<P>
A penguin is... oh come on you must know what a penguin is...

RSA 56bit challenge
</H3> 
Fri, 21 Feb 1997 <BR> 
Some of you may now know about the attempt to break 56bit RC5 as part
of the RSA challenge. 40 and 48 bits have been done. 56bit is a colossal
challenge but has been started. Whichever group cracks the key gets $1000.
<P>
We are trying to get as many Linux folks as possible involved in the
challenge and hopefully as one giant group using the id
<P>
<A HREF="mailto:linux@linuxnet.org">linux@linuxnet.org</A>
<P>
and the sheer number of Linux users to stick ourselves on the top
of the stats page. 
[as of Feb 21, the linuxnet team is on the top of the charts with 
21million keys per second on 247 hosts.]
In the unlikely event we do crack the key the money
will go to the Linux Development Grant Fund (Linux International).
<P>
To join, ftp the clients from 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.genx.net/pub/crypto/rc5">
ftp://ftp.genx.net/pub/crypto/rc5</A> 
and run them with <BR> 
	./clientname linux@linuxnet.org <BR> 
or for some clients <BR> 
	./clientname -i linux@linuxnet.org <BR> 
<P>
SMP folks should run one client per CPU.
<P>
Non US sites please be aware of the potential crypto export rules...
<P>
You might want to run it via "nice". It will then just soak idle CPU.

Yggdrasil approved by The World Wide Web Consortium to develop
"Arena" Web Browser.
</H3> 
<P> 
San Jose, CA -- February 17, 1997 -- The World Wide Web Consortium
[W3C] has approved Yggdrasil Computing to coordinate future
development of Arena, a powerful graphical web browser originally
developed as the Consortium's research testbed.  Under the agreement,
Yggdrasil will undertake new development and support the developer
community on the internet.  Yggdrasil will issue regular releases,
provide a centralized file archive and web site, integrate contributed
enhancements and fixes, create mailing lists for developers and users,
and facilitate widespread use of Arena by others.
<P> 
Yggdrasil's additions to Arena will be placed under the "GNU General
Public License", which allows unlimited distribution both for profit
and not for profit, provided that source code is made freely
available, including source code to any modifications.  No exclusive
rights have been given to Yggdrasil.  Anybody could legally do what
Yggdrasil is doing, although the Consortium now considers Yggdrasil
the formal maintainer of Arena.

Spreading news about great lists of Linux friendly applications
</H3> 
Sat, 01 Feb 1997 <BR> 
From: Gary Swearingen, <A HREF="mailto:swear@aa.net">swear@aa.net</A> 
<P> 
I've found a GREAT list of applications compatable with Linux
which I think should be announced to the wide audience of the
gazette.
<P> 
<a href="http://hydra.tamu.edu/~baum/linuxlist.html">
a list of Linux software by Steven K. Baum</a>
<P> 
It's a very comprehensive, alphabetized list of (mostly free) 
software, which is described in a couple paragraphs, mentioning
weather it is available in binary or source, and a link to where
it is available.  A lot of the entries would be of interest only
to someone doing scientific programming, but much is of general
interest.

<P> 
Hi, I have been a long time reader of LJ and it has been a great help to
me, and I am sure that applies to many in the Linux Community!  Now, my
friends on the Net and I have also done something as a contribution to
Linux which I thought would be interesting to you and helpful to your
readers. This is to create an On-Line Linux Users Group for people
interested in learning more about Linux, providing help to other Linuxers,
and promoting Linux.
