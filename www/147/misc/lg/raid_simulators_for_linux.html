<p>
Hello!
</p>

<p>
Does any one here have experience using a RAID Simulator or know of
any? Basically, what I am looking for is 'emulating' RAID on a single
computer, single hard disk.
</p>

<p>
Looking forward to some insights
</p>

<p>

Amit

<p>
check out lvm - logical volume management.
It doesn't do all RAID modes but does mirroring.
There's an IBM developerworks article at

   <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-lvm/">http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-lvm/</a>

<p>
which might be a bit long in the tooth nowadays, but is ok as an intro.

<p>
I thought it was a useful answer, particularly if you follow the links
to the (similarly old) articles on Linux software RAID.
</p>

<p>
The precise details may not be relevant to your specific distribution
and kernel, but the fundamentals of "what is RAID, and why do I want
it?" remain.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Any suggestions?
</pre>

<p>
What do you think you mean by "simulating a RAID environment"?
</p>


<p>
RAID == Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (or something similar).
</p>

<p>
 From a kernel point of view, that means "multiple block devices",
which can mean "different disks" or "different partitions on a disk"
(or "different partitions on different disks").
</p>

<p>
So: decide what physical block devices you have available; decide which
of the many different types of RAID you want to play with today; and
find your distribution's utilities that probably begin "raid" or "md"
(multiple disk, or maybe multiple device) to start playing.
</p>

<p>
Once you recognise that you can partition your /dev/sdb into /dev/sdb1
and /dev/sdb2, then what the RAID part does is to join /dev/sdb1 and
/dev/sdb2 into a new logical entity /dev/md0. Outside the RAID config,
you ignore /dev/sdb[12], and only use /dev/md0 as a single block device
onto which you (typically) create a filesystem, trusting the lower-level
code to mirror/stripe/whatever the bits the way you asked it to.
</p>

<p>
(Granted, using two partitions on a single disk may not be the cleverest
for redundancy, resilience, or speed; but once you understand the concept,
you are better placed to choose what partitions to use for what part of
your simulation.)
</p>

<p>
LVM can be used to join multiple physical disks or partitions into
a single "disk" (volume group); and can then split that again into
"partitions" (logical volumes).
</p>

<p>
And then, if you really want to, you can use the md-utils on those logical
volumes as if they were /dev/sdb1 and /dev/sdb2 in the earlier suggestion.
</p>

<p>
The disadvantage of doing all of that is that you'd have to learn both
lvm and md. The advantages are that lvm is more convenient than fdisk in
resizing your "partitions" (so you can start over more easily), and
that lvm can possibly do what you were wanting to do with RAID without
directly involving md at all.
</p>

<p>
And depending on your interpretation, it is possible that none of this is
"simulating RAID", but is "real, live RAID", especially if you are using
inexpensive disks in a redundant configuration.
</p>

<p>
Good luck,
</p>

<p>
yes. LVM. that's why I answered.
</p>

<p>
LVM doesn't care where the partitions are is managers. So on the one disk 
you can mirror (one of the raid modes)  2 partitions quite happily. You 
can stripe etc etc. Of course there will be a performance hit 'cso of the 
one disk.
</p>

<p>
Maybe I misunderstood what you meant by "simulating". If so, you'll have 
to be a lot more specific about what you want to do.

<p>
Hi Amit,
</p>

<p>
Well, let's say you want to use a single file from your filesystem, and make it
available as multiple linux block devices?
</p>

<p>
 From there, you could use whatever RAID software you like,
feeding it these tasty new block devices. Sound tempting?
</p>

<p>
OK, so let's start with creating the single file in your filesystem.
Let's make it blank, of size 1GB:
</p>

<pre>
dd if=/dev/zero of=./somefile bs=1024k count=1024
losetup /dev/loop1 ./somefile
fdisk /dev/loop1
</pre>
Here, let's create a few 100MB partitions, e.g.:
</p>

<pre>
Disk /dev/loop1: 1073 MB, 1073741824 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 130 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes
Disk identifier: 0x68ed631d
 
      Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/loop1p1               1          10       80293+  83  Linux
/dev/loop1p2              11          20       80325   83  Linux
/dev/loop1p3              21          30       80325   83  Linux
</pre>
Now you can use the handy script by Christophe Saout
  <a href="http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/7/18/141">http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/7/18/141</a>
(also attached to this email, I needed to change /bin/sh to /bin/bash
for it to work
on Ubuntu, apparently because /bin/sh is a symlink to a speedier stripped-down
shell used for booting called "dash"), to make each of these
"partitions" of your
file into a linux block device, using device-mapper:
<pre>
  dmsetup-partitions.sh /dev/loop1
</pre>
The output would be e.g.
</p>

<pre>
loop1p1 63 160587
loop1p2 160650 160650
loop1p3 321300 160650
</pre>
and now you have these new block devices to play with:
</p>

<pre>
/dev/mapper/loop1p1
/dev/mapper/loop1p2
/dev/mapper/loop1p3
</pre>
This method can also be handy for "looking inside"
raw backups of flash memory sticks or other kinds of
image files which have been hastily dumped using "dd",
and have a partition table at the beginning.
</p>

<p>
For course, this answer might be completely unrelated to
what you're looking for with your original question.
</p>

<p>
Cheers,
Peter.

Are you telling that I simulate multiple computers using 'qemu' and
then combine all their 'virtual HDDs' to form a RAID array.

Correct me, if I am wrong.

<p>
"Real, live RAID"- it is.
</p>

<p>
Just to put things into better perspective and context, I am working
on a project which requires the design of a tool for "Trend analysis

systems in a large scale computing infrastructure which will have
"live" RAID implemented to ensure more reliable data storage.

<p>
I think, i have put my query into better perspective now.

<p>
Real and live RAID will have different implementations, especially for
RAID levels such as 4, 5 or 6. You have to be careful picking test
systems. A colleague of mine is specialised in data recovery and told me
that RAID5 controllers from different vendors have their own way of
distributing the data among the disks. This might be an issue when it
comes to comparing real and live RAID systems.

<p>
The easiest way to do this is to use virtualised GNU/Linux systems with
multiple virtual disk partition combined by the Linux software RAID.
mdadm can simulate drive failures
(<a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-RAID-HOWTO-6.html">http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-RAID-HOWTO-6.html</a>). This setup misses
the fun caused by stubborn hardware, but it's a start. I don't know if
this is sufficient for your testing environment.

<p>
As suggested use loopback devices or "real" partitions to create
pseudo-disks. You can emulate the failure of one or more disks in a
number of different ways:
</p>

<pre>
	a. write directly to some blocks on the block device
	   associated with one of the pseudo-disks.
	b. use blockdev to "suddenly" mark the blockdevice
	   "read-only".
	c. use an external USB disk as one of the elements of the
	   array and un-plug it during operation.
	d. use LVM to interleave a "zero/error" LVM device with
	   actual read/write disk space. Use <strong>that</strong> as one of
	   your pseudo-disk devices.
	e. suspend your array and replace one of the pseudo-devices
	   with another such device whose data is almost but not
	   entirely identical with the one before. Then resume the
	   array.
</pre>
and other such innovative techniques!
</p>

<p>
Have fun,
</p>

Kapil.

&gt; &gt; help emulate RAID devices. The simulated RAID environment will then be
&gt; &gt; uses to emulate disk failures, and other dummy RAID operations to
&gt; &gt; enable an "analysis" and hence the design of the application.
&gt;
&gt; The easiest way to do this is to use virtualised GNU/Linux systems with
&gt; multiple virtual disk partition combined by the Linux software RAID.
&gt; mdadm can simulate drive failures
&gt; (<a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-RAID-HOWTO-6.html">http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-RAID-HOWTO-6.html</a>). This setup misses
&gt; the fun caused by stubborn hardware, but it's a start. I don't know if
&gt; this is sufficient for your testing environment.

Thanks, Rene. For the moment, Virtualized GNU/Linux systems is
possibly <strong>the</strong> way to start off my experiments. The Software RAID
How-To will be a good starting point, and I plan to use 'qemu' for my
works.
