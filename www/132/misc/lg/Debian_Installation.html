<p>
Well I've had enough of the creeping bit rot in my Mepis installation and I 
want to be rid of Mepis. I'm trying to go back to a plain vanilla Debian 
installation. I've also recently upgraded my system with a SATA conroller and 
a 200GB hard disk, onto which I tried to install Debian with the Debian 3.1 
net installer.
</p>

<p>
The default install hung, so I went for the "expert" install and got an 
installation on the SATA disk. It's definitely there, I can see it, but I 
can't boot from it. 
</p>

<p>
It's on /dev/sda5, and grub loads the kernel up, but the kernel panics because 
as far as it's concerned /dev/sda5 doesn't exist. I can only assume that the 
kernel it has installed doesn't have the right module (SiI3112) installed for 
the SATA controller. 
</p>

<p>
Is there a way to check what modules are built into this kernel? 
</p>

<p>
Is there a simple way around this? 
</p>

<p>
Is it best just to build my own kernel to replace the one that has been 
installed? 
</p>

Yes -- you'd need a 2.6 kernel at least, I'd have said.  This is what
the "expert" install allows for.

That's an initrd issue then -- since this <strong>must</strong> have the SATA

<p>
You need to install a 2.6 kernel. Use expert26 to boot the install
again (or use rescue26) and get it to install the 2.6 kernel image. 
</p>


<p>
<pre>
&gt; Is there a way to check what modules are built into this kernel? 
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Debian "stock" kernels rarely have <strong>any</strong> modules built in nowadays.
All hardware support is loaded using modules that sit in the initrd.img.
</p>


<p>
<pre>
&gt; Is it best just to build my own kernel to replace the one that has been 
&gt; installed? 
</pre>
</p>

<p>
I would say "No". Given the modular nature of the current Debian
kernel package it is usually not necessary to re-build it. However, in
the interests of seeing both sides here is the list of pros and cons.
</p>

<p>
<pre>
Pros:
	1. You get to make your computer do some hard work as soon
	   as it is set up.
	2. You can build in exactly the drivers you need and skip
	   all the business of auto-loading modules.
	3. Disabling module loading in the kernel (as opposed to 
	   via the proc interface) <strong>may</strong> be stronger security.
	4. You can work without "udev". (The new kernels in Debian
	   depend on "initramfs-tools" which in turn depends on
	   "udev").
	5. If you have <strong>really</strong> unusual hardware this may be necessary.
</p>

<p>
Cons:
	1. You tie your kernel down to your specific system (think
	   hardware upgrades).
	2. You might not be able to use a number of external module
	   packages like "unionfs", "squashfs", "reiserfs4",.... You
	   will have to build these for your kernel yourself.
	3. Some of the settings for kernel related packages like
	   "uswsusp", "acpid", "hibernate" assume that you have
	   certain features compiled in. You may not know in advance
	   which features you want.
	4. It kind of goes at 45 degrees to Debian philosophy.
</pre>
Some explanation of (4). The angle is the metaphoric distance between
Debian and Gentoo. (Note that it is not 90 just 45 <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">)
</p>

<p>
In Debian you <strong>can</strong> re-build any package you want. You can even setup
your own "buildd" to re-build the system the way it is done for the
Debian archive packages (use the "sbuild" package). However, you don't
actually do this unless it is necessary.
</p>

<p>
The reasons are many but an important one is "community". Part of
being a community supported distribution is that you trust your
co-developers to:
''
	(a) have built a good package if they have affixed their
	signature to it.
	(b) have made decisions regarding that build that would be
	useful to everyone.
	(c) have given you just the right amount of configurability
	so that you can fine tune.
''
Having said that there are of course "edge cases" when recompiling
with alternate configurations may be necessary. The packages
"kernel-package", "module-assistant", "debnest", "pbuilder",
"sbuild" and so on are there to help you in this case.
</p>

<p>
Hope this helps,
</p>

</p>

<p>
In fact, you <em>can't</em> do a number of those things without modules - as I
learned a while ago, when I was first experimenting with ACPI and ALSA.
Neither of these would work properly when compiled into the kernel - not
that there was an obvious way to tell. Actually, Kapil, if I recall
correctly, I think it was you who clued me into the solution with ALSA;
I probably would have kept banging my head against it for quite a while
longer otherwise.

It might not be necessary, but it is a relatively quick and simple way of 
making sure that it has the right module loaded. If it still doesn't see the 
SATA disk, it tells me that my initial assumption is wrong and I need to look 
elsewhere for the problem.
</p>

<p>
Debugging an initrd.img to see why it's not recognising the disk might be 
informative, but, at this time, I'd prefer a solution that doesn't require me 
to learn the ins and out of initrd images.

There is <em>some</em> support for Silicon Image 3112 in 2.4 kernels, depending
on specific version, but other commentators are correct that 2.6
coverage is a lot better.   The guy I shave has spent the last several 
years documenting this situation:  <a href="http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Hardware/sata.html">http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Hardware/sata.html</a>

Well, how odd.  The SiI 3112 has had pretty good coverage for a long
time, and I'd have expected the "sarge" default installer to do well
with it.
</p>

<p>
Another page I maintain,
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Debian/installers.html">http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Debian/installers.html</a> , lists quite a number
of third-party Debian netinst images.  I have no idea which would be

<p>
I didn't understand your question. All the modules that are <strong>built</strong>
for the default kernel are listed in /boot/config-2.6.8-*. The list
for the current "stable" Debian 2.6.8 kernel is enclosed in a gzipped
file for yur reference. It seems to support SATA for a number of
devices...
</p>

<p>
Come to think of it. You succeeded in installing your system so I
would imagine that the disk <strong>is</strong> recognised. Perhaps there was an
error in installing the initrd.img. Here is a possible way out for
you.
</p>

<p>
Let me <strong>assume</strong> that you managed to install the system and your
problem is that the system doesn't boot from disk with the initially
installed kernel image+initrd combination.
</p>

<p>
Try to boot the installer into "rescue" mode. You will be prompted
for the name of the root partition.
</p>

<p>
After this the system should boot "normally". Of course you do not
want to use the CD in "rescue" mode to boot everytime. So let us try
to fix that.
<pre>
	apt-get --reinstall install kernel-image-2.6.8-3-686

Or you may wish to choose 386 or some other architecture.

<p>
I wonder if the difference is that in the first version the kernel itself 
tries to load the initrd.img and can't because the driver it needs to load 
the image is in the image it's trying to load, whereas, in the second boot 
stanza, I assume that GRUB loads the image before loading the kernel?

I can't say what is supposed to happen in the first instance but
certainly in the second instance it is grub that loads the initrd.img
into memory and passes the location to the kernel (by putting it in a
specific location in the kernel data area).

<p>
If what you think does in fact happen then a stock Debian kernel
<strong>cannot</strong> boot with the first line since it has <strong>no</strong> disk drivers
built-in. Even IDE drivers are loaded as modules.

Few days back, I downdloaded the 3 images of Deian 3.1r3 from one of

<p>
I burnt the images (iso) in three separate CDs but could not boot from
the first CD.

<p>
Is this the right way to install Debian ?

<p>
Yes, I understand, the Debian installation manual can help me, but
could not find the correct answer, hence posting to this forum.

I doubt it. I would have thought that update CDs are only sufficient to update 
an existing installation, not to install from scratch.

If you want to minimise the number of CDs you have to create, I would suggest 
that the network installer is probably best

<p>
debian-31r3-i386-netinst.iso
</p>

<p>
I'm assuming that you have a suitable connection for a network installation, 
as you have the bandwidth to download CDs.
</p>

<p>
Assuming that the update CDs are supposed to be bootable, you also need to 
check the method you used to burn the CD. It's a common error to create a new 
filesystem on the CD containing the .iso file, rather than copying the 
filesystem from inside the .iso onto the CD.
</p>

<p>
If you're burning the CDs with k3b you need "Tools-&gt;Burn CD Image", not "new 
data project".

OK, I tried this, downloaded the net install version of .iso and
installed Debian.At the end of installation, it detected other
operating systems (Fedora core 5) and updated the GRUB.

<p>
Post-installation status:

<p>
At the time of installation, Debian could not recognize Ethernet card,

able to boot but had to skip the section regd network configuration
settings.

Looks like, I have to spend time over the weekend and restore working

Perhaps this is a problem with using the same swap space. 
</p>

<p>
1. You may need to make swap with 'mkswap -v1' to ensure that both
   systems use the newer type of swap space.

<p>
2. You should (of course) not use suspend to swap on one of the

I've only been partially reading this thread, but it seems you've
already made hard work for yourself without doing some very basic
reading off the Debian site about which ISO is for you.
</p>

<p>
Assuming you have a decent Internet connection all you <em>need</em> is
something like the business ISO (~150MB) which will shove a basic shell
and console on your machine upon which you can then apt-get a load of
stuff fron the 'net.  Conversely, if you don't have an Internet
connection, you can download all 15 ISOs, and create yourself a
distribution from that (or the equivalent DVD ISOs; whichever you
prefer).

Of course; this is what <em>any</em> installation should do, rather than blat

<p>
What card do you have (more importantly what chipset is it?)  You can
find out using the 'lspci' command amongst others.  Note that my only
gripe with the netinstall ISO is that like all the others, they seem to
default to using a 2.4.X kernel by default.  Whilst I can fully see why
this is so, it does force more and more people with esoteric hardware to
use the 'expert' install option just so they can have a 2,6.X kernel.
Alas, not everything backported into 2.4.X at the time of the release.

<p>
Then do what anyone else would have done -- get DeadHat to boot into
Single User Mode:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
Linux S
</pre>
Then you can:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
telinit 3
</pre>
(Which under DeadRat is everything bar $DISPLAY_MANAGER) and see what
happens.  I suspect though it's booting before it ever reaches Init in
which case it could be that the two kernels are trying to share the same
initrd, or somesuch.

<p>
No, you don't.
</p>

<p>
You can install a reasonable Debian system using CD#1 or DVD#1 only --
or the business card image or netinst image plus Internet access.
</p>

<p>
Additional disks just have packages and catalogues of more software. 
Over here in cheap-bandwidth land (USA and Canada), it's most common to 
use netinst + Internet, on grounds that any Linux CD image you burn and
use was already obsolete on release day, you're going to replace the
contents from Internet updates anyway, and so you might as well use as
small a CD as possible.  (This logic applies much more on the
quicker-moving Testing and Unstable branch than in the slow lane that is
Debian Stable.)
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, if you expect to do off-Net installs, that might be a
sufficient reason to download all 17 or whatever Official Debian CD ISOs.
(I personally never do.)

I don't think so.  
</p>

<p>
The current "debian-installer" ("d-i") program used in Debian 3.0
"Sarge" and later incorporates many hardware-autorecognition programs
not automatically included by the prior "boot-floppies" installer
program of 2.2 Potato and earlier.  I vaguely recall there being no
additional modules included in Ubuntu's recycling of d-i, though I could
be wrong.
</p>

<p>
I kept for many years a roster of optional hardware-autorecognition
packages in <a href="http://linuxmafia.com/kb/Debian/">http://linuxmafia.com/kb/Debian/</a> , but it's probably a bit
out of date.  My <em>personal</em> general attitude was always that such
programs cause way too many problems and (e.g.) inexplicably hangs
because some option ROM was poked the wrong way, so I thought it A Very
Good Thing for those to not be installed and activated by default.
</p>

<p>
Now that such things <em>are</em> tending to be installed by default, in the
event of trouble, you have to abort and try again in "expert" mode so
that you can disable them.

Even before they got rid of boot-floppies, the Debian people already
offered a choice of <em>either</em> the dselect swamp or the "tasksel"
metapackage (package groups) picker, for the latter part of
installation.  "tasksel" was described as the "simple package selection"
choice in the install screens, if memory serves.

Yeah, I was thinking mostly of the Sarge install I tried a couple of years
back.  The install completed without a problem, but then when I was
confronted by the thought of having to go through setting up / tuning X to
get from wherever the install had left it to where I envisioned having it,
I decided that I'd try something else.

Since the Linux kernel has reached the maturity level it currently has
with the 2.6 series, I find myself twiddling the configuration a lot less
frequently than I remember doing in years past, but I'm still partial to
running a stock kernel which I've compiled myself.  So I was referring to
the packaged binaries.
</p>

<p>
In most situations the difference is probably just academic, but in some
cases, e.g., "transcode", where one is dealing with long, CPU intensive
processes, the difference becomes a practical one.  This is where the
Gentoo users have an edge.  Although must say that I don't find the
thought of compiling Open Office, KDE, etc. very entertaining either.

&gt;&gt; [1] For an environment which will serve as a system for general personal
&gt;&gt; use, I find myself installing numerous development libraries, as well as
&gt;&gt; both KDE And Gnome to support running various multimedia apps, the ability
&gt;&gt; to compile things like "transcode" (which demanded a lot of schlepping for
&gt;&gt; auxiliary packages right there), etc anyway, so that tends to cancel out
&gt;&gt; the advantage of carefully choosing the package set during install for me
&gt;&gt; anyway.
&gt;
&gt; Even before they got rid of boot-floppies, the Debian people already
&gt; offered a choice of <em>either</em> the dselect swamp or the "tasksel"
&gt; metapackage (package groups) picker, for the latter part of
&gt; installation.  "tasksel" was described as the "simple package selection"
&gt; choice in the install screens, if memory serves.

<p>
Sometime in the future I'll have to try find some time to try a more
recent Debian release to see where I might end up with it.  I tend to
envision taking the approach of doing a lighter weight install, then
filling it out using a tool like synaptic or adept.
</p>

<p>
I guess the point I was trying to make is that although a distro like
Ubuntu or $PICK-A-DISTRO-AIMED-AT-NEWBIES may have it's origins in being
designed for the non-geek users out there who are looking to replace the
more ubiquitous family of OS's, the easier installs and the ready-to-use
configuration can also provide a choice for more convenience for some of
the more experienced users too.

&gt; Yeah, I was thinking mostly of the Sarge install I tried a couple of years
&gt; back.  The install completed without a problem, but then when I was
&gt; confronted by the thought of having to go through setting up / tuning X to
&gt; get from wherever the install had left it to where I envisioned having it,
&gt; I decided that I'd try something else.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Confronted with the same problem, I spent ten minutes browsing the Web
and package catalogues, to see what optional hardware-autorecognition
packages might be relevant to X11 -- and immediately found read-edid 
(hardware information-gathering tool for VESA PnP monitors), discover
(likewise improves video probing), kudzu, kudzu-vesa (VBE/DDC stuff for
autodetecting monitor characteristics), and mdetect (mouse detection).
All of those assist X11 setup, if present.
</p>

<p>
And, being publicly spirited, I spent the <em>next</em> ten mintues creating
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Debian/hardware-detection.html">http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Debian/hardware-detection.html</a> .

<p>
Could be as high as a 10% gain, in edge cases -- in my experience.  Of
course, one can do that with Debian source packages and tools, if so
inclined.

You're making the common error of confusing a distribution with an
installer.  There are actually dozens of very distinct installers that
can produce a Debian system, some of them droolingly simple and GUIfied.
See:  <a href="http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Debian/installers.html">http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Debian/installers.html</a>  (in need of
updating, but it illustrates the concept)

The new "etch" installer for Debian has (at least) the following "features":
</p>

<p>
1. Can install from USB|CD|floppy|hard-disk. The former is really
useful when your SATA controller doesn't combine with "linux" to give
access to your CD-ROM.
2. Has a GTK/X/VESA install for those who need it.
3. Can create LVM|Raid|Encrypted file systems at installation time.
4. On-line as well as off-line installation. Can help if your network
card is so new that the driver has not been integrated with
"linux".[*]
</p>

<p>
As you say "install" is an over-rated aspect of Distribution
comparison.
</p>

<p>
What Ubuntu <strong>could</strong> do for those Debian users who wish to track
"testing/unstable", but not worry about random breakage, is to give
them a system that they do^H^Hshould not need to update too often.
Unfortunately, Ubuntu haven't quite achieved that goal, since the
number of updates, that follow an base install <strong>before</strong> the next
release, is similar to the number of updates that one makes by running
"testing" even with bits from unstable. At least this is my experience.

[*] What is the correct capitalisation rule for "linux"---the kernel?
The problem with using "Linux" is well-known---one set of people think
you are writing about the system as a whole while another set thinks
you are one of the first set and so set about correcting you.
