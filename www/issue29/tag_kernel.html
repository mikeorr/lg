<p><strong>From David W. MacDougall on 18 May 1998

<br><br>
Hello Answer Guy,

<br><br>
   Since December, I have tried posting this problem to
newsgroups and the responses I received were not
helpful.

<br><br>
   I am running Red Hat 5.0 on a Pentium 233 processor with 128mb of EDO RAM,
<a href="http://www.award.com/nofrhome.htm">Award</a> BIOS, Award PnP BIOS, 
an <a href="http://www.adaptec.com/">Adaptec</a> 2940 Host Adapter, 
and a <a href="http://www.quantum.com/">Quantum</a> SCSI 3.2gig hard drive. 
One of the boot up messages I get from the BIOS is "Checking DMI pool data."

<br><br>
   I have tried running Slackware and Red Hat, both
with kernel version 2.0.31 and 2.0.31. No matter what I
do, it seems the kernel will "see" only about 14 mb of
RAM (see meminfo file below). The first advice I got
was to use an append command in LILO "<tt>mem=128mb</tt>" and
several variations thereof. I tried entering that
command every possible way, and though it did increase
the amount of RAM available, the system would crash
almost immediately, or as soon as I tried to access a
disk drive. I would get a kernel panic message, then
some messages about the SCSI hosts and then a complete
freeze-up.

</strong></p>
<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" width="50" height="28" alt="(!)"
align="left" border="0">
	First that append directive should be:

<blockquote><code>
		append="mem=128M"

</code></blockquote>
	note that the quotes are required to assign this value to
	the append directive because of the "<tt>=</tt>" sign that 
	is contained within the value.  Also note that this
	value should be written with a capital letter "<tt>M</tt>" 
	and not as "<tt>mb</tt>" (I'm hoping that your question has
	a typo that's not reflected in your actual <tt>lilo.conf</tt>
	file).  You could also specify the size in hexadecimal
	(precede it with "<tt>0x</tt>") and I suspect that you could
	specify it as something like <tt>mem=134217728</tt> (which is
	128M in decimal).  However I've never seen anyone 
	do that.

<br><br>
	Note also:  You can pass a parameter such as <tt>mem=128M</tt>
	to your kernel by simply typing it it on the <tt>lilo</tt>
	command line during boot.  In other words, when you
	pause your system at the '<tt>lilo</tt>' prompt during the
	boot cycle you can manually "append" kernel parameters
	as you select which kernel/lilo image to load.

<br><br>
	For example most of my lilo configuration have <tt>org</tt> 
	"original," <tt>old</tt>, <tt>cur</tt> "current," and <tt>new</tt> 
	stanza (images).  So I could temporarily limit this machine 
	(canopus) to use only 32 of its 64Mb of RAM by typing something like:

<blockquote><code>
		new mem=32M
</code></blockquote>

	... at the lilo boot prompt.  A line like:

<blockquote><code>
		old root=/dev/sdb1 single mem=8M
</code></blockquote>

	... would run my "old" kernel, mounting the first partition
	on my second SCSI disk as the root filesystem, and limiting the
	kernel to only use eight megabytes of RAM (and I'd better hope
	that the rc scripts on <tt>/dev/sdb1</tt> give me a bit of swap space 
	or that first few minutes will be painful on with only eight
	MB).  You can also pass these parameters to your kernel via
	<tt>LOADLIN.EXE</tt>.

<br><br>
	You can learn all about the other boot prompt parameters
	in the BootPrompt-HOWTO at any LDP mirror:
<br><a href="http://www.linuxresources.com/LDP/HOWTO/BootPrompt-HOWTO.html"
	>http://www.linuxresources.com/LDP/HOWTO/BootPrompt-HOWTO.html</a>

<br><br>
	If your actual attempts have been in the correct syntax
	(and the error is just in your question) than it sounds 
	suspiciously like a memory hole or a chunk of address space 
	being used as a framebuffer (like a weird video card).

<br><br>
	In the early 386 days (many years and three or
	four generations of processor ago) there were some
	systems that had 'top memory' or a 'memory hole'
	--- a chunk of address space used by the motherboard's
	chipset at about the 16Mb line (since <strong>nobody</strong> would
	have more than 16Mb of RAM <img src="../gx/dennis/smily.gif"
	alt="&lt;g&gt;" width="20" height="24" align="absmiddle">).  
	Back in those days I was on the Quearterdeck tech support team (Linux 
	didn't exist, yet) and we used to use the QEMM "<tt>notop</tt>" 
	switch (if I remember it correctly) to work around the problems 
	when this oddity wasn't automatically detected by QEMM.

<br><br>
	However I don't think any Pentium or PII motherboard
	would have such a problem (it would <strong>definitely</strong> be
	considered a design flaw these days).

<br><br>
	Are you saying that the kernel seems to be stable 
	when you run it with only 14 or 15Mb of RAM --- but
	crashes soon after you force your kernel to use
	the rest?  Have you tried setting the append line
	to 64Mb (or just manually passing a <tt>mem=64M</tt> parameter
	to your kernel)?  

<br><br>
	You basically want to narrow down exactly where the
	crash is occuring.  Once you think you have it ---
	it's worth taking out your RAM DIMM's (SIMM's or
	whatever they are in your case) and swapping them
	(put all the DIMM's from one bank into the to 
	slots and vice versa).  If the crase "moves" with
	the chips than replace the RAM modules (the things
	might even work in another box --- since you can
	sometimes see some inexplicable "timing" glitches
	that amount to:  &quot;this board doesn't "like" those
	chips&quot;

<br><br>
		(Sounds scientific, doesn't it!).

<br><br>
	Other than that you might consider removing all the 
	cards in the system --- putting in the cheapest,
	plainest video card and IDE/multi-function card and
	drive you can find and testing it with that configuration.
	(Then you re-introduce your preferred adapters until
	the problems re-occur.  In this way you isolated the 
	problem to a specific hardware or software component).

<p><strong><img src="../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" width="50" height="28" alt="(?)"
align="left" border="0">
   My question is this: Where is my problem? Is there
something inherent in the kernel that won't let it see
any more than 14mb of RAM on this system without my
having to add append statements to LILO? And why does
the kernel panic once is does see more memory? I have
tried adjusting the amount of memory stipulated in the
command line to lower levels, tried entering it in HEX,
and in bytes. The results are always the same.

</strong></p>
<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" width="50" height="28" alt="(!)"
align="left" border="0">
	There is definitely nothing that limits Linux to 
	14Mb of RAM.  My oldest system ('<em>antares</em>' --- the
	old 33Mhz 386 that handles my <tt>uucp</tt> mail, INN netnews, 
	fax, dial-in and dial-out modem, is the household
	web and POP server, and is the backup masquerading
	router when my ISDN goes out) has used 32Mb of RAM 
	(auto-detected) for several years --- from Linux 0.99p10 
	through my current 2.0.33.  That machine is about
	a decade old now.  '<em>Betelgeuse</em>' and '<em>Canopus</em>' each
	have 64Mb.  I've managed and configured systems with
	128Mb and more (although most PC hardware tops out at
	128 or 256 Mb).

<br><br>
	Most systems will need the <tt>mem=</tt> parameter if they have
	more than 64Mb since there is no standard way to
	detect more than that.  The 2.1/2.2 kernels may auto-detect
	large memory configurations on <strong>some</strong> systems, but 
	I've heard that some of the methods for probing for this
	sort of RAM can lock up some other systems (something that
	prevents users from installing NT on some of those "unsupported"
	systems on the Microsoft "bad boy" list --- or so I've heard).

</blockquote>
<p><strong><img src="../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" width="50" height="28" alt="(?)"
align="left" border="0">
   Or is my problem more with my Adaptec host adapter?
Why will it work just fine with only 14mb of RAM but
fall to pieces with more? (I also have an SCSI CD-ROM
drive and a second 3.2 SCSI Quantum hard drive (which I
use for Windows 95 in this dual-boot system.)

</strong></p>
<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" width="50" height="28" alt="(!)"
align="left" border="0">
	As I've said, I don't know.  It could be any 
	component of the system.  However I've used Adaptec
	2940's in 128Mb systems with Linux and 
	<a href="http://www.frebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>.  
	So that, by itself, is not likely to be the problem.

<br><br>
	It's also almost inconceivable that the model of hard drive would 
	affect this situation.  Basically any SCSI hard drive will usually 
	work on any <strong>supported</strong> SCSI controller without 
	crashing the kernel.  (A couple of SCSI devices can fight with one 
	another and crash the SCSI bus --- particularly if you mix 
	"differential" devices with others.  However, you'd get kernel 
	messages that would clearly indicate the subsystem involved --- and
	it would be independent of the memory layout (in every case
	I can think of).

</blockquote>
<p><strong><img src="../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" width="50" height="28" alt="(?)"
align="left" border="0">
    I am reluctant to keep fiddling with the append parameters because every 
time the system crashes, it eats a hole or two in the filesystem. A 
Linux-knowledgeable friend suggested I might want to try upgrading to the 
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.1/">development kernel</a> 
(2.1.??) to see if that would cure the problem. He also suggested I write to 
Linux Torvalds, but I thought I should try you first. 

</strong></p>
<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" width="50" height="28" alt="(!)"
align="left" border="0">
	I would definitely not bother Linus Torvalds directly with a problem 
	of this sort.  If I could isolate it to a specific module or block 
	of code I <strong>might</strong> --- but I'd problem just post it 
	to the <a href="http://linuxwww.db.erau.edu/mail_archives/linux-kernel/">Linux Kernel mailing list</a> in <strong>any</strong> event.  
	Linus is quite active on that list
	--- and it would simply be rude to request is personal
	attention to something that any kernel developer might
	be able to handle.

<p><strong><img src="../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" width="50" height="28" alt="(?)"

    I feel sad sitting here with the world's greatest
OS and all this RAM I can't use. Any guidance or
direction you could give me would be greatly
appreciated!

</strong></p>
<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" width="50" height="28" alt="(!)"
align="left" border="0">
	Again, double and triple check the syntax of your 
	mem= parameter.  Then try different values --- 64Mb,
	96Mb, etc to isolate the specific limit.  Read the
	<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/BootPrompt-HOWTO.html"
	>BootPrompt-HOWTO</a>.  Try taking out that Matrox Mystique
	and using just a plain VGA card for testing.  Disable
	all "Plug-n-Pray" features on your motherboard.  

<br><br>
	The first steps in all troubleshooting are to precisely
	describe and isolate the problem.  In the worst case
	you might have a bad motherboard or some bad memory chips.
