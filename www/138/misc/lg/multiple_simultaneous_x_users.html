Hi All,
</p>

<p>
I'd like to have 2 users using separate X-sessions on the same CPU - simultaneously.  That is, two
different monitors plugged into two different graphic-cards (or a single dual-headed card), each
matching two different keyboards and mice, but all using one CPU.
</p>

<p>
I know this can be done with Linux, but the information I found on how to do this is over a year
old, is for a 2.4 series kernel, and instructs the user to patch the kernel and/or X in order to
get the keyboards to be treated as separate from each other.
</p>

<p>
I'd like to avoid any patching, if possible, because I like to keep my kernel and X server up to
date and don't want to have to re-patch them every time I get another update.  I'm currently
running an up-to-date Fedora Core 5 system (2.6.20-1.2300.fc5smp and
xorg-x11-server-Xorg-1.0.1-9.fc5.6) and will be moving to a FC6 kernel and xorg-x11 server soon. 
I found the "startx -- -layout Multihead" command, and intend to buy a second video card
(PCI-based), monitor, USB keyboard and mouse.  Assuming I do a fresh install of FC6 with both sets
of equipment installed, will patching still be required, and what else might I have to do?  Thanks
in advance.
</p>

We've two setups at work doing that -- one 2 seats, another with three.
I didn't set them up myself but it was a major headache until it
finally worked. I can try to get details for you.

I'm pretty sure we run a recent 2.6 kernel. There are about three (or
so) possibilities to separate the keyboard input (mouse is easier) for
the two screens. Our first setup used the kernel patch IIRC
(using Ubuntu, which already has that patch?) and uses a kdm setup which
starts the two screens. Major drawback -- if one screen dies for some
reason you've to reset kdm which in turn resets both screens.  The
3-head system simply refused to work that way -- displays shifted, very
frequent X crashes or freezes,logout on one screen reset or messed up
the others screens,... . 
</p>

<p>
The keyboard splitting with the event driver was not working easily as
well because we had identical keyboards with the same identifiers. Now
I think they are matched to the screens by their position on the USB
hubs. Each user one hub. The now running three-head setup is via some
meta X server -- one for all three screens -- on top of that run three
kdm's with their login screens. This allows bascially to restart one
kdm/X session without restarting the ground layer X server. Some
caveats: Forget about 3D acceleration. And 2D speed of these screens
will not make highscores in benchmarks as well -- they are quite usable,
though.

<p>
That might or might not bring up two screens. But they both will
receive the input of both keyboards if you do not separate that
somehow.

I asked the fellow who set everything up....

<p>
This meta-server is calle xephyr
</p>

<p>
set everything up as described in:
<a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Multiterminal_with_Xephyr">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Multiterminal_with_Xephyr</a>
<a href="http://www.c3sl.ufpr.br/multiterminal/howtos/howto-xephyr-en.htm">http://www.c3sl.ufpr.br/multiterminal/howtos/howto-xephyr-en.htm</a>
</p>

<p>
And he suggests using gdm -- kdm refused to work on our system. 
</p>

<p>
This makes all kernel patches unnecessary as xephyr itself handles the
event distribution to the different screens.

Thanks a bunch!  I'll give it a try.
