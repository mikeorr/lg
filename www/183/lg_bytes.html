<h2>News in General</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Debian 6.0 Squeeze to have Completely Free Linux Kernel</h3>

<p>The Debian community is inching toward the full release of a major 
update of its Linux distro that will be a major milestone for the 
Linux Community.  That release has been rescheduled to February 5th or 
6th and should include a fully open source distro with earlier, 
optional non-free elements in a separate branch.</p>

<p>The Debian project has been working on removing non-free firmware from 
the Linux kernel shipped with Debian for its past two release cycles 
but it was not yet possible to ship Linux kernels without non-free 
firmware bits - until now.</p>
<p>(See the full text in the Distro Section, below)</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">CLUG's Survey</h3>

<p>The CLUG (Calgary Linux User Group) is aplying a survey to gather some data
on Linux User Groups across North America, aiming to improve the user experience.</p>

<p>"We've made a survey for Linux User Group members across North America. 
We would like to get the pulse of different groups and see what's working 
so that all LUG's can improve the experience. This data will be published 
on <a href="http://clug.ca">http://clug.ca</a> (the Calgary Linux User Group website) in August, 2011.
The survey is only 12 questions, and shouldn't take more than 5 minutes to 
complete" said <a href=" http://linuxgazette.net/authors/crosby.html">Dafydd Crosby</a>.</p>

<p>So, if you have a few minutes to spare, take part in the survey, which can be found here:

<p>The Linux Foundation has announced the expansion of its leading Linux
technical conference, LinuxCon, to Europe.  LinuxCon Europe will take
place October 26-28, 2011, in Prague, Czech Republic, and will be
co-located with the Linux Kernel Summit, the GStreamer Conference, and
Embedded Linux Conference Europe.</p>

a result of last year's merger between The Linux Foundation and the 
Consumer Electronics Linux Forum.</p>
<p>The Embedded Linux Conference, now in its sixth year, is dedicated
exclusively to embedded Linux and embedded Linux developers.</p>

<h2>Distro News</h2><h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Debian 6.0 Squeeze to have Completely Free Linux Kernel</h3>

<p>Debian is inching toward the full release of a major 
update of its Linux distro that will be a major milestone for the 
Linux Community.  That release has been rescheduled to February 5th or 
6th and should include a fully open source distro with earlier, 
optional non-free elements in a separate branch.</p>

<p>The Debian project has been working on removing non-free firmware from 
the Linux kernel shipped with Debian for its past two release cycles 
but it was not yet possible to ship Linux kernels without non-free 
firmware bits - until now.</p>

<p>In December, they announced that all issues were fundamentally solved 
and they will be able to deliver a Linux kernel which is completely 
'Free', according to the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG), with 
Debian "Squeeze"  or version  6.0.</p>

<p>Recognizing that some users may require the use of works that do not 
conform to the DFSG and might include non-free firmware bits, for the 
time being, there will be a non-free area in the archives for 
alternative installation images and additional packages for Debian 
Squeeze that include non-free firmware bits needed for specific pieces 
of hardware. These elements  cannot and will not be supported to the 
same extent as the Free firmware.  </p>

<p>This is the first Debian release that supports the Haskell Platform, 
in version 2010.1, including the ghc compiler in version 6.12.1, and 
ships more than 200 additional Haskell libraries.  This version of 
Debian Linux will also sport a graphical installer.</p>

<p>As of mid-January, there were 4 blocker bugs for the release of 
Squeeze, but all of them are fixed in the unstable/sid release.</p>


<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">New Release of OpenIndiana, an Open Source Solaris</h3>

<p>December saw a new release of OpenIndiana, version oi_148.  This 
version may shortly form the basis for the project's first stable, 
production-ready release.</p>

<p>OpenIndiana continues the OpenSolaris legacy and aims to be binary and 
package compatible with Oracle Solaris 11 and Solaris 11 Express.</p>

<p>Version oi_148 fixes Java SSL crypto problems, adds PostgreSQL 
packages back in, and has admin improvements.  Since several users of 
this version and oi_147 are applying it to production servers, the 
project community is considering applying several package fixes and 
security updates to oi_148.</p>

<p>The release would be planned for February or March with a limited set 
of server-oriented packages and may be called  "Open Indiana 2011.02". 
It would be based on oi_148 with only the Text Installer and Automated 
Installer ISOs.  To make the release easier to manage, versions of 
Apache, PHP, MySQL, Tomcat, etc, would match the same versions shipped 
in RHEL 6/CentOS 6.</p>

<p>From the September 2010 announcement on the forming of the OpenIndiana 
project:</p>

<p>"OpenIndiana is a brand new distribution of OpenSolaris, constructed 
by the community, for the community. Our primary goal is to be a 
binary and package compatible drop in replacement for the official 
OpenSolaris and forthcoming Solaris 11 and Solaris 11 Express 
releases."</p>
<p>"This project was created to address the longstanding issue that the 
OpenSolaris distribution has constructed entirely by Sun/Oracle, not 
by the community. Depending on a single commercial entity has led to 
several issues, notably that bug fixes and security updates are only 
available via a paid for support subscription, that community 
participation has been limited in steering the direction of the 
operating system, and that commercial decisions have led to stricter 
licensing terms."</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Zend Studio 8.0 PHP IDE Released</h3>

<p>Zend Studio 8.0 Streamlines PHP Application Development in VMware 
Virtualized Environments and Features Enhanced Support for Building 
Ajax and PHP Applications.</p>

<p>In November, Zend Technologies  announced the general availability of 
Zend Studio 8.0, its leading Integrated Development Environment (IDE) 
for professional PHP developers. The new release helps PHP developers 
streamline development and testing processes through integration with 
VMware Workstation and revamped support for servers running on-premise 
or in the cloud. Zend Studio 8.0 also delivers extensive support for 
the development of rich Internet applications that use JavaScript 
front-ends and PHP back-ends. </p>

<p>Zend provides ready-to-use virtual images for Zend Server to further 
optimize the debugging experience.  A new pricing model was also 
announced for Zend Studio 8.0, making it accessible to more 
developers.</p>

<p>"VMware is committed to increasing the productivity of software 
development organizations and evolving application and data delivery 
environments into a user-centric model," said Parag Patel, vice 
president, Global Strategic Alliances at VMware. "Our partnership with 
Zend brings the full benefits of virtualization to PHP developers, 
enabling them to accelerate software development times and reduce 
hardware costs."</p>
<p>Developing PHP code on a remote server running on-premise or in the 
cloud is significantly easier in Zend Studio 8.0, with its simplified 
workflow and improved performance. SSH or FTP connections can be used 
to import projects into Zend Studio, and then export them back to the 
remote server to be run or debugged.</p>

<p>Zend Studio 8.0 enables faster coding of PHP and JavaScript 
applications through the built-in Content Assist support for many 
JavaScript-based libraries including jQuery, Dojo, Ext JS and 
Prototype. A new set of integrated Ajax tools simplifies debugging of 
PHP and JavaScript applications by supporting debugging of the 
JavaScript front-end and the PHP back-end in one combined session.</p>

<p>For more information about the new features and functionality in Zend 
Studio 8, please visit <a href="http://www.zend.com/products/studio">http://www.zend.com/products/studio</a>.</p>
