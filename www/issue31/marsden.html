<P> <HR> <P> 


<h1>Customizing Emacs</h1>
    
<p> Typical applications have a configuration file which allows you to set
    the value of a few variables. Emacs goes a lot further, since the user
    can customize pretty much any feature of the system. This flexibility
    is due to a majority of the system being written in its extension
    language. The first implementations of Emacs used a cryptic string
    processing language named <a
    href="http://www.netmeg.net/jargon/terms/t.html#teco">TECO</a> (you
    thought <a href="http://www.perl.com/">Perl</a> was cryptic? <a
    href="ftp://ftp.mindlink.net/pub/teco/">Look at</a> TECO), with support
    code in <a
    href="http://www.netmeg.net/jargon/terms/p/pdp-10.html">PDP-10</a>
    assembly; later versions use Emacs Lisp as an extension language, with
    some components (the Lisp interpreter and the display code) written in
    C.

<p> This extensibility is fundamental to Emacs. Users can experiment with
    modifications and improvements to the system and pass them on to
    friends if they work well; ideas which catch on can be integrated in
    the core distribution. The now defunct <a
    href="http://www.eval-apply.com/LispOS/memo444.htm">Lisp Machines</a>
    at <a href="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a> extended this openness to the
    level of the operating system, which was written in Lisp (and ran on <a
    href="http://www.lavielle.com/~joswig/symbolic-computing.html">custom
    hardware</a>, specially designed to run Lisp efficiently). Lisp Machine
    users had a far greater degree of control over their machine than Linux
    users today. The <a href="http://squeak.cs.uiuc.edu/">Smalltalk</a>
    systems at <a href="http://www.parc.xerox.com/history.html">Xerox
    Parc</a> provided a similarly deep level of customization.

<p> Indeed, there is a profound difference between the development
    philosophy which led to Emacs (the MIT approach), and that which led to
    Unix and C (the New Jersey approach). These are compared in an
    excellent paper by Richard Gabriel called <a
    href="http://www.naggum.no/worse-is-better.html">Worse is Better</a>,
    from which I have extracted the following:

<!-- hope nobody is concerned about copyright on this ... -->    
<blockquote><font face="Helvetica">

<p> Two famous people, one from MIT and another from Berkeley (but working on
    Unix) once met to discuss operating system issues. The person from MIT was
    knowledgeable about ITS (the MIT AI Lab operating system) and had been
    reading the Unix sources. He was interested in how Unix solved the PC
    loser-ing problem. The PC loser-ing problem occurs when a user program
    invokes a system routine to perform a lengthy operation that might have
    significant state, such as IO buffers. If an interrupt occurs during the
    operation, the state of the user program must be saved. Because the
    invocation of the system routine is usually a single instruction, the PC of
    the user program does not adequately capture the state of the process. The
    system routine must either back out or press forward. The right thing is to
    back out and restore the user program PC to the instruction that invoked
    the system routine so that resumption of the user program after the
    interrupt, for example, re-enters the system routine. It is called PC
    loser-ing because the PC is being coerced into loser mode, where loser is
    the affectionate name for user at MIT.
    
<p> The MIT guy did not see any code that handled this case and asked the New
    Jersey guy how the problem was handled. The New Jersey guy said that the
    Unix folks were aware of the problem, but the solution was for the system
    routine to always finish, but sometimes an error code would be returned
    that signaled that the system routine had failed to complete its action. A
    correct user program, then, had to check the error code to determine
    whether to simply try the system routine again. The MIT guy did not like
    this solution because it was not the right thing.
    
<p> The New Jersey guy said that the Unix solution was right because the design
    philosophy of Unix was simplicity and that the right thing was too complex.
    Besides, programmers could easily insert this extra test and loop. The MIT
    guy pointed out that the implementation was simple but the interface to the
    functionality was complex. The New Jersey guy said that the right tradeoff
    has been selected in Unix: namely, implementation simplicity was more
    important than interface simplicity.

</font></blockquote>

    
<p> Let me come back to more concrete issues. The traditional way of
    customizing [X]Emacs is to write simple Emacs Lisp expressions in a
    file called <tt>.emacs</tt> in your home directory. These expressions
    can either set the value of a variable, or call a function, or load a
    library&nbsp;: </p>

<table border="0" bgColor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<pre class="programlisting">
    <font color="red">
    ;; set the values of a few variables. `t' stands for true and `nil' for
    ;; false </font>
    (setq dired-listing-switches "-alF")
    (setq tab-width 4)
    (setq line-number-mode t)
    (setq global-font-lock-mode t)
    (setq next-line-add-newlines nil)

    <font color="red">
    ;; call a function which will organize to have the time displayed in
    ;; the modeline</font>
    (display-time)

    <font color="red">
    ;; load an Emacs Lisp library and call its initialization function</font>
    (require 'jka-compr)
    (auto-compression-mode 1)</pre></td></tr></table>

<p> The syntax tends to irritate people (who deride the presence of
    ``<b>L</b>ots of <b>i</b>rritating <b>s</b>purious
    <b>p</b>arentheses''), but using a fully-featured programming language
    in a configuration file has genuine and significant advantages. It
    allows you to test for features of the local setup, for example&nbsp;:
    </p>

<table border="0" bgColor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<pre class="programlisting">

    (if (file-exists-p "/bin/bash")
       (setq explicit-shell-file-name "/bin/bash"))</pre>
</td></tr></table>

       
<p> which makes Emacs use the bash in <tt>*shell*</tt> buffers if it
    exists on the machine. Another reason for using a real language for
    setup files is that it avoids the endless proliferation of
    configuration files, each with its own ideosyntractic syntax (think
    ~/.Xdefaults, window manager setup files, ~/.inputrc,
    ~/.procmailrc, etc). Hopefully the spreading use of <a
    href="http://www.red-bean.com/guile/">Guile</a> as an embedded
    scripting language will resolve this problem. A last advantage is that
    a genuine programming language empowers the user. Indeed, in one of the
    <a
    href="ftp://ftp.dl.ac.uk/pub/fx/emacs/emacs-AI-memo/AI-519a.html">first
    technical reports</a> about Emacs, <a
    href="http://www.gnu.org/people/rms.html">Richard Stallman</a> presents
    this as an important goal:

<blockquote><font face="Helvetica">

   When large numbers of nontechnical workers are using a programmable
   editor, they will be tempted constantly to begin programming in the
   course of their day-to-day lives. This should contribute greatly to
   computer literacy, especially because many of the people thus exposed
   will be secretaries taught by society that they are incapable of doing
   mathematics, and unable to imagine for a moment that they can learn to
   program. But that won't stop them from learning it if they don't know
   that it is programming that they are learning!

</font></blockquote>



<h2>Customize</h2>

<p> Recent versions of [X]Emacs include a package called
    <em>Customize</em>, which helps you adapt Emacs to your liking without
    writing any Lisp. Customize is written by <a
    href="http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~abraham/">Per Abrahamsen</a>, also the
    author of the popular <a
    href="http://sunsite.auc.dk/auctex/">Auc-TeX</a> package for TeXnical
    typists. It allows users to visualize the list of all the
    user-configurable variables in Emacs, and to modify them to their
    liking. You can reach Customize (it only exists on recent Emacsen) from
    the Help <tt>-></tt> Customize menubar. In XEmacs it looks like this:

<p align="center"> <img src="./gx/marsden/customize.gif" alt="Customize screenshot"
         width="535" height="668">

<p> Customize requires each Emacs Lisp library to declare the
    user-modifiable variables it exports. The type of the variable is
    specified, whether boolean or integer or string or selection from
    several options, and several variables can be put in the same group,
    which allows a hierarchical presentation of information. The
    modification screens are then generated automatically on demand. It's
    an elegant design, since programming the thousands of dialog boxes
    manually would be a huge job, and require large amounts of storage. The
    modifications made by the user are stored in a file which is read by
    [X]Emacs at initialization time.

<p> An unfortunate aspect of Customize is that it introduces two methods of
    doing the same thing. Users wanting to go beyond the simple
    customizations possible with the graphical interface will be confronted
    with an entirely new way of doing things, and may be put off. There is
    a difficult path to tread between making <a
    href="http://lieber.www.media.mit.edu/people/lieber/Teaching/Simple-Simple/Simple-Simple-Intro.html">
    simple things simple and complex things possible</a> and the old adage
    <i>Build a system that a fool can use, and only a fool will use it</i>.
    


<h2>Keybindings</h2>

<p> Keybindings are a particularly treacherous field for customization, the
    principal problems comings from differences between X11 and console
    operation (particularly with the <a
    href="http://www.via.ecp.fr/LDP/HOWTO/Keyboard-and-Console-HOWTO-5.html">backspace
    key</a>), and between the syntax used by Emacs and XEmacs. One of the
    first things you might want to do is set the Delete, Home and EndOfLine
    keys to their standard meanings in the PC world&nbsp;: </p>

<table border="0" bgColor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<pre class="programlisting">

    (pc-selection-mode)         ; pc-select.el</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p> This will also allow you to select regions of text with shift and the
    cursor keys, and Cut/Copy/Paste with Shift-Delete, Control-Insert and
    Shift-Insert respectively. You can bind function keys as follows (this
    syntax should work equally well with Emacs and XEmacs)&nbsp;: </p>

<table border="0" bgColor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td><pre>

    (define-key global-map [(f2)]  'save-buffer)
    (define-key global-map [(f4)]  (lambda () (interactive) (kill-buffer nil)))</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p> The first line makes the <tt>F2</tt> key save the current buffer (by
    binding to the built-in function <tt>save-buffer</tt>), and the second
    shows how to bind to your own function: the <tt>lambda</tt> introduces
    an anonymous function in Lisp; the <tt>(interactive)</tt> means that
    you will be able to access the function interactively, the rest kills
    the current buffer without asking confirmation. The <tt>global-map</tt>
    means that these bindings apply everywhere in Emacs, whether you're
    reading email or composing some HTML. You can also define local key
    bindings, which apply only to buffers which are in specific
    modes&nbsp;: </p>

<table border="0" bgColor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td><pre>

    (define-key emacs-lisp-mode-map [(control c) (control e)] 'eval-buffer)
    (define-key c-mode-map [(f5)] 'compile)</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p> The Emacs FAQ (available online by saying <tt>C-h F</tt>) presents
    another method of binding keys, which may not work across Emacs
    versions. Jari Aalto has written a <a
    href="ftp://cs.uta.fi/pub/ssjaaa/ema-keys.html">long guide to
    keybindings</a> which describes many different ways of rebinding keys.

<p> If you are lucky enough to have a Windows 95 keyboard you can put those
    lovely keys to use in X11 with a little <a
    href="http://hoth.stsci.edu/man/man1/xmodmap.html">xmodmap</a>ping. The
    X Window System has five possible key modifiers, the first three being
    Shift, Control and Alt on PC keyboards. You can set the windows keys to
    Super and Hyper modifiers as follows (this is for a French keyboard;
    use <a href="http://www.rob.cs.tu-bs.de/man/xev(6)">xev</a> to work out
    the keycodes for your keyboard)&nbsp;:</p>


<table border="0" bgColor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<pre>

    (shell-command (concat  "xmodmap "
                            "-e 'keycode 115 = Hyper_L' "
                            "-e 'keycode 116 = Hyper_R' "
                            "-e 'keycode 117 = Super_L' "
                            "-e 'add mod4 = Hyper_L' "
                            "-e 'add mod4 = Hyper_R' "
                            "-e 'add mod3 = Super_L' "))
    (message "Setting up Hyper and Super keys")
    (define-key global-map [(hyper tab)] 'complete-tag)
    (define-key global-map [(super !)]   'speedbar-get-focus)
</pre></td></tr>
</table>



<h2>Backups</h2>

<p> In its default configuration, Emacs makes backups with a tilde appended
    to the filename, in the same directory as the original file. If you
    would prefer having all backups in one spot, try the following code. 
    Emacs can also keep a series of numbered backups <i>&agrave; la</i> VMS; look
    at the variable <tt>version-control</tt>.</p>

<table border="0" bgColor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<pre class="programlisting">
    <font color="red">
    ;; make backup files in ~/.backups/ rather than scattered around all
    ;; over the filesystem. </font>
    (defun make-backup-file-name (file-name)                     <font color="brown">
      "Create the non-numeric backup file name for `file-name'." </font>
      (require 'dired)
      (if (file-exists-p "~/.backups")
          (concat (expand-file-name "~/.backups/")
                  (dired-replace-in-string "/" "|" file-name))
        (concat file-name "~")))

    <font color="red">
    ;; disable backups for files in /tmp or in my Mail or News directories. </font>
    (defun ecm-backup-enable-predicate (filename)
      (and (not (string= "/tmp/" (substring filename 0 5)))
           (not (string-match "/Mail/" filename))
           (not (string-match "/News/" filename))))
    
    (setq backup-enable-predicate 'ecm-backup-enable-predicate)
</pre></td></tr>

<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p> <a href="mailto:zweije@xs4all.nl">Vincent Zweije</a> wrote to me
    regarding my gnuserv column, where I suggested using <tt>cat
    /etc/passwd | md5sum</tt> as a means of generating a cookie for xauth.

<p>  While allowing access to your X display is bad enough (someone could
     capture all your keystrokes, for example), giving remote access to
     your Emacs process is much more worrying, since Emacs can execute
     arbitrary commands under your id, delete files, send insulting email
     to the President of the United States, etc.

<p>  Or maybe more dangerous, send insulting email to the president of an

<p>   Since release 2.1, gnuserv is able to use MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1
      authentication for remote requests. This protocol uses the contents of
      your ~/.Xauthority file, as described in the xauth(1) man page.
      Gnuserv requires a cookie for display number 999, which you can create
      as follows (blade is the name of the machine) :
<pre>     
      ~$ xauth add blade:999 . `cat /etc/passwd | md5sum`

     <font color="darkslateblue">
<p>  You have picked an unlucky example.  There is a real danger that
     /etc/passwd is stable over a long period.  This means that it will
     generate the same magic cookie for many times.
     
<p>  This is a problem when you have given a cookie away (either voluntarily
     or involuntarily), and intend to revoke permissions by generating a
     new cookie.
     
<p>  Best is to select a source of data that is volatile such as the output
     of ps -al or /proc/interrupts, or use mcookie, as you indicated later.

<p> These remarks are particularly important if the site is using shadow

    left to ordinary users&nbsp;:

<table bgColor="#FAF0E6">
<tr><td><font color="darkslateblue">

<p> Come to think of it, it's probably just a bad idea to let ordinary users   
    arrange their own security, as with magic cookies.  They're just not
    enough concerned with security - they want to get their job done.
    
<p> You'd be amazed at how many times on usenet I've seen suggested to do
    &quot;xhost +&quot; to allow X connections from anywhere. Such people
    often don't even realise that they're dealing with security. They see
    disallowing X (gnuserv) connections as a hindrance, and just want a
    magic incantation to remove it. It's a perception thing.

<p> Someone who deals with security simply has to know what he's doing.
    However, first you have to realise that it is security that you're
    playing with.

<h2>Next time ...</h2>

<p> Next month I'll look at the different abbreviation facilities in
    Emacs. Don't hesitate to contact me at
    <tt>&lt;emarsden@mail.dotcom.fr&gt;</tt> with comments, corrections or
    suggestions (what's <em>your</em> favorite couldn't-do-without Emacs
    extension package?). <code>C-u 1000 M-x hail-emacs</code> !

<p> <strong>PS</strong> : Emacs isn't in any way limited to Linux, since
    implementations exist for many other operating systems (and some
    systems which only halfway operate). However, as one of the leading
    bits of free software, one of the most powerful, complex and
    customizable, I feel it has its place in the <i>Linux Gazette</i>.
