LWN has a new story (currently subscriber-only) about SugarCRM 
announcing that its upcoming 5.0 release of SugarCRM Community Edition
will be under GPLv3 (as opposed to the company's current badgeware
licence, this having been the firm that invented the concept).

I've just posted this comment to LWN:

*Is this a blunder, or just too subtle for me?*

I may be missing something, here, so I'm phrasing this in the form of a
question or two, and it's not rhetorical: Didn't FSF bow to pressure
from sundry interest groups and <em>remove</em> the "ASP loophole" language[1]
that had been present in some GPLv3 drafts? Therefore, what in Sam Hill
is a Software as a Service (Saas) / ASP / Web 2.0 firm doing adopting a
copyleft language whose copyleft language gets finessed by hosted
deployment?
</p>

<p>
FYI, there are a number of genuinely open source licences, a couple of
them OSI certified, that do apply copyleft obligations to the ASP
industry. One of the best is Larry Rosen's OSL, and there is also
Apple's ASPL, both of those being OSI-certified. Non-certified options
include Affero GPL (newly reissued as a patch to GPLv3, by the way) and
Honest Public License.
</p>

<p>
On the basis of recent history, it's possible that SugarCRM not only
lacks any clever, non-obvious reason why it picked a non-ASP copyleft
licence for ASP code, but also doesn't really have any idea what it's
doing in this area, and picked GPLv3 just because it has had good press
(good press that it generally deserved, IMVAO). Remember, this is the
firm that created the first MPL-based ASP licence, and then acted
shocked and indignant when it belatedly discovered that its licence
permitted forking (when TigerCRM of Chennai forked the codebase), and
overreacted by writing what became the prototype MPL + Exhibit B
"badgeware" licence that impairs third-party usage through mandated logo
advertising without a trademark licence.
</p>

<p>
It'd be more reassuring if I thought this firm had a master plan, but I
now rather strongly suspect it's just a bunch of sales people in an
office in Cupertino, staggering from one inadvertant move to the next.

Did any of you see the story about Eben Moglen calling out Tim O'Reilly at OSCON? I spoke with Eben just after he did that, but I wasn't aware of what happened because I had just entered the room. Maybe that was why he was combative with me at first (or maybe because I interrupted his conversation with Ian Murdock ;)  Check it out:
