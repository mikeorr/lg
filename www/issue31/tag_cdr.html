With disk at once, the laser is turned on, the leadin is written,

the laser is turned off.

I was trying to eliminate a need for my Windows box but things keep

I use it for 3 things:

I've never successfully written a multisession CD either.  I've made a

so I didn't bother trying to continue writing to them. Just in case I 
lost the first session.

This is correct.  For example you can write 3 tracks multisession using 
DAO.  Then come back later and write a few more tracks using DAO.

Mixed mode is simply multiple tracks with different data formats.
The most common is Computer games  with 1 data track followed by several 
Audio tracks, these can be written with TAO.
<br><br>
The main difference between DAO and TAO is that for DAO the laser is 
never turned off during the recording.  You can even do a single track in 
DAO mode.  The difference here is that DAO disks can be taken to CD 
publishing company while TAO disks can not (due to gaps in the track 
data, where the laser has been turned off)
