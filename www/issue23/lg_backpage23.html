<P>
Thanks to all our authors, not just the ones above, but also those who wrote
giving us their tips and tricks and making suggestions. Thanks also to our
new mirror sites.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=bottom ALT="" SRC="../gx/rose.gif">
While I'm passing out thanks I must include Amy Kukuk and Margie
Richardson,
who have done much of the work to get this issue out. Margie has been
working hard to get me up to speed on this task, but I've still a ways to
go. My professional background has been in the oil business as a
geophysicist, where I usually worked on dumb terminals connected to IBM
mainframes or Digital minicomputers. At home I've been a Macintosh man for
many years, so learning Linux/Unix, vi and HTML all at once has been, shall
we say, exciting.
<p>
As Margie has indicated in the past, we share a passion for the outdoors
which we satisfy via camping and motorcycling. With winter close upon us now my
adult son, Keith, and I will likely turn to cross country skiing in favor
of motorcycling. Although I've not done so lately, I also fly as a private
pilot and am rated for both single engine land and sea planes.
<p>
<IMG ALIGN=right ALT="Turkey" SRC="./gx/turkey.gif">
This last week of the month of November Margie and I indulged in that most American of
pastimes--eating too much at the Thanksgiving table. We split cooking duties
with my sister, Roxanne, who also hosted. The afternoon was grand, the
food great, and we even came home with enough leftover turkey meat
for several days worth of sandwiches. 
<p>
As a final note, Margie and I will be out of town for the Christmas
holidays, so expect the next issue of <i>Linux Gazette</i> to be a little
late coming out.
<p>
Have fun!
