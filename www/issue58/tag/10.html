More on: Shell Variable Scoping

<P><STRONG>
Thanks for the answer, that did not dawn on me, I'm perfectly aware of
how things exist in an environment and the need to export them. I guess
I'd have to say it didn't dawn on me because of the fact that it works
in a ksh environment on Solaris and Tru64 UNIX and I wasn't thinking
along the lines of forked processes.

You were observing the behavior without understanding the
underlying mechanisms.

I'm curious as to why it does work there though, what magic is the shell
doing so that the variables exist that were used in the read when the
forked read process no longer exists and control returns to the parent?
Is the shell transposing the two commands and doing the read in the
context of the parent and forking the function so that the variables
remain?  ...

You still don't understand.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A pipe operator (|) indicates a<TT> fork()</TT>.  However, it
doesn't necessitate an <tt>exec*()</tt>.  External commands require
an <tt>exec*()</tt>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the cases of newer ksh (Korn '93 and later?) and zsh
the<TT> fork()</TT> is on the left of the pipe operator.  That is to
say that the commands on the left of the operator are
performed by a child process.  In the other cases the commands
on the right are performed by the child.  In either case the
child executes the commands and exits.  Meanwhile the parent
parent executes the other set of commands and continues to live.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Thus the question is whether the parent (current process) or a
child will be sending data into pipes or reading data from
each pipe.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Arguably it makes more sense for the parent to receive data
from the children, as the data is likely to be of persistent
use.  Of course it also stands to reason that we may want to
read the data into a variable --- or MORE IMPORTANTLY into a
list of variables.  This is why the Korn shell (and zsh) model
is better.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the case of a single variable we can always just restructure
the command into a set of backtick operators (also known as a
"command substitution expression").  For example:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
foo | read bar
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... can always be expressed as:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote><code>
bar=$( foo )    # (or bar=`foo` in older shells and csh)
</code></BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However this doesn't work for multiple variables:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
foo | read bar bang
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... cannot be  written in any command substitution form.
Thus we end up trying to execute the rest our script inside of
the subshell (enclosing the 'read bar bang' command in a set of
braces or parentheses to group it with a series of other commands
in our subshell), or we resort of saving all of command 'foo's
output into one variable and and fussing with it.  That greatly
limits the flexibility of the 'read' command and makes the IFS
(inter-field separator: a list of characters on which token
splitting will be done for the read command) variable almost
worthless.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
One way to handle this would be to write the output of 'foo'
to a temporary file, and then read with with simple re-direction:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote><code>
foo &gt; /tmp/somefile.$$ ; read bar bang &lt; /tmp/somefile.$$
</code></BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... but this introduces a host of potential race conditions and
security issues; requires that we clean up the temp file, suggests
that we should create a 'trap' (signal handler) to perform the
cleanup even if we are hit with a deadly signal, and is generally
inelegant.  We could also create a named pipe, but that has most
of the same problems as a temporary file.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So we end up using the process subsitution expression as
I described (and as you mention below):
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
... The real use of this technique is in the example script given
that includes the function. I was able to get it to work when I did it
per your suggestion:
</STRONG></P>
<Pre><STRONG>read a b c &lt; &lt;( dafunc )
</STRONG></Pre>
<P><STRONG>
-Curt Blank
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
Of course.  This is the same as '<tt>read a b c &lt; /tmp/somefile.$$</TT>'
except that we are substituting a file for a filename.  Thus
the <tt>&lt;( ... )</tt> expression returns a filename.  That file is a
virtual file --- that is to say that it is a file descriptor
connected to another process (just like a pipe) but it can be
represented (on many UNIX systems, including Linux) as an entry
under <TT>/def/fd/</TT> (the "file descriptor" directory).  Under Linux
<TT>/dev/fd/</TT> is a symlink to <TT>/proc/self/fd.</TT>  Under other forms of
UNIX it might have different underlying mechanics.  It might
actually appear as a directory with a bunch of character mode
device nodes or it might be some sort of virtual filesystem
(like <TT>/proc</TT>, <TT>/dev/pts</TT>, etc).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I still think that bash should switch to the Korn shell
semantics.  The <tt>&lt;(...)</tt> is sufficient to provide the features.
However, it seems to be unique to bash.  For bash to offer the
best portability it seems that it should conform to the latest
Korn shell design.  (BTW: If the switch was to break some script
that depended on the old semantics, on the subshell "leaning" to
the right --- than that script was already broken under different
versions of ksh.  However, I could certainly see a good argument
for having a shell option (shopt?) that would set this back
to the old semantics if that was necessary.  I have yet to see a
case where the old semantics are actually more desirable than
the new ones --- but I haven't really tried to find one either.
