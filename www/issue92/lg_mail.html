Hiya guys..
</P>
<P>
I have a problem ( d' aah)
</P>
<P>
I've tried to use SmartDraw under wine.. and then.. after I configure
everything.. It works!  At least, I think that, when I see SmarrtDraw
starting.. showing the initial WELCOME.. etc.. but.. when he tries to
show  me  the initial screen &lt; to chose the objects of my diagram&gt;
BUMMER!  My wine DIES.
</P>
<P>
my log is so big.. and every thing happens about BiDi...
</P>

<blockquote><pre>#] warn:font:GetCharacterPlacementW The BiDi algorythm doesn't conform
to Windows'
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
And then.. BiDi throws a lot of junk &lt; i suppose&gt; in my memory causing
some HEAPS Faults:.
</P>

<blockquote><pre>#] warn:heap:HEAP_IsRealArena Heap 0x40db0000: block 0x408acf is not
inside heap
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
there's not an upgrade for BiDi available.. and.. since November 22..
BiDi has been going crazy... with some programs that request some kind of..
font.. i don't know...
</P>
<P>
The HEAP Faults problem.. I solved myself making a bigger "X:/temp"
and includding a new path for junk.. but.. <A HREF="http://www.winehq.com/">WINE</A> couldn't pass through
BiDi, when it get a crash.. cause the BiDi NEVER stops to send some..
THING. &lt; i don't know what either.&gt; to the memory.. that fills up..
whatever is your <TT>/temp</TT> size! &lt; mine is 2 G!&gt;
</P>
<P>
I just don't know what to do!
I'm really really lost.. and.. I need to make wine work... it's not
for the program itself.. it's for the HONOR!  AHUuhauahh
</P>
<P>
DO you guys know ANYTHING about that Suddenly Crashing?!? Or..
incompatibility ? Or whatever you call it... ...
</P>
<P>
Tnkx so much for reading my crappy email...
</P>

PS:.  .. HEEEEEELP!

Hi there,
</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000066"><EM>
I use squid as a proxy server (default configuration) and it seems that i
can't connect to ftp sites through it.
Do I have to do anything?
</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000066"><EM>
Nickos, Greece
</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
It appears that this is an FAQ in the land of Squid, number 12.17 --
"Can I make my regular FTP clients use a Squid cache?"
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Nope, its not possible. Squid only accepts HTTP requests. It speaks
FTP on the server-side, but not on the client-side.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The very cool wget will download FTP URLs via Squid (and probably any
other proxy cache).
</STRONG></P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">However, it would be fun to have an article about somebody using Squid
and/or other site caching software in powerful ways to make their site's
view of the web more fun.  There are a bunch of add-ons at Freshmeat for
it, so I'm sure someone out there has a great example for us to follow.
Don't forget to read our author submission guidelines.

<P>
Hi people, I have a problem......
</P>
<P>
I'm actually trying to mirror the hard disks using RAID 1 in <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> 9.It
can work perfectly but the bug is that i can only boot up the first hard
disk, i suppose lilo is stored as th MBR in it. The second hard disk during
booting up, shows LI and i boot it using a bootup diskette instead.  I'm
wondering how to implement lilo in the second HDD in such a way that it auto
boots up just like the 1st HDD.Is it possible?
</P>
<P>
Is it true that only 1 MBR could be used will it work on 2 MBR in 2
respective hard disks?
</P>
<P>
I visited the Boot+Raid+Root+ Lilo How to documentation:
&amp; i tried this method to boot up second HDD..but there's error
</P>
<P>
it is known as a raid LILO config file pair that I implemented:
</P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/wanted/geraldine.lilo.conf.hda.txt">geraldine.lilo.conf.hda.txt</a></tt></p>
<P>
I created this 2 lilo configuration file but not too sure whether is eing
read anot because i still have a current default lilo file <TT>/etc/lilo.conf</TT>
</P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/wanted/geraldine.default.etc-lilo.conf.txt">geraldine.default.etc-lilo.conf.txt</a></tt></p>
<P>
Bacially that's about all...I hope your gang can resolve my roblem.Sorry if
i bored you to sleep with such a long email.
Hope to hear from ya soon...
</P>
<P>
Cheers,
Geraldine

You can use "bibelot" (available on <A HREF="http://www.freshmeat.net/">Freshmeat</A>, IIRC); it's a Perl script
that converts plaintext into Palm's PDB format. I have a little script
that I use for it:

"The Complete Shakespeare" was over 5MB. No trouble at all, except for
uploading it ("jpilot" wouldn't do it; neither would the Wind0ws prog on
my brother's machine. Kudos to "coldsync".)
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Plucker is an open source palm document reader and in my humble opinion THE
BEST. There are some really good Linux GUI document converters available for
it.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I checked out site-scooper but unfortunately they are very out of date, I'll
have to look at installing the scripts on my own box.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The issue I have when converting the site manually is that as the site
refences links external to the main document I get duplicate copies of the
articles in one document hence an extremely large file (Issue 91 is 1.98MB
!!)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Anyway thanks very much for your help, I was quite surprised to get a
<BR>response for such a trivial question --- thanks again

<P>
I have done some searching on the internet for semaphores and have
found very little info, and no tutorials. I think that you could use
this as a topic to suppliment your article on Message Queues in
Issue-89 (
<a href="../issue89/raghu.html">"Exploring Message Queues, Part I"</a>
, Raghu J Menon).
</P>
<P>
Suggested Sections
</P>
<P>
1 SystemV Semaphores (semget, semop semctl)
</P>
<P>
2 POSIX 1003.1b Semaphores (sem_init, sem_wait, sem_trywait,
sem_post, sem_get_value, sem_destroy)
</P>
<P>
I have heard mention of something called pthread semaphores, but I am
unsure as to what these are, or how to use them.
</P>
<P>
BTW, SystemV semaphores use key_id (int) which must be unique. <TT> ftok()</TT>
can be used to hash a key from a filepath and a project id, but there
must be other ways to generate keys...
</P>
<P>
It would be really nice to see examples of this in action, as that is
one thing that I could not find (exclusively for Linux that is).
</P>
<P>
Great Magazine!

Thanks,

Ooh, ooh. . . . I used to ... at a former job, and hereby volunteer

Black helicopter request has been filed.   It'll be right over as soon
as our local operative-in-dark-glasses can fix the autopilot.   Of
course, if you finish the article before liftoff, do let us know, and
we'll send over one of Wooner's beautiful dame clients to pick up the
package...

Will do. Um... over and out (?)
