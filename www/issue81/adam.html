<P>Well Howdy. Glad you could all make it. How are you all??? Still keeping
up the pace with the rest of the LG thus far? I hope so, 'cos I can't see
that this article is going to be any different :-)</P>

<P>News for this month?? Well, I have installed myself in my house now.
When I get the chance, I'll get some pictures together for you all to have
a sneak preview into the isolated, but pretty corner of Somerset that I
now reside in when I am not at University, that is.</P>

<P>I also have a new job!! I work in a small factory, which produces eight
different types of luxury dessert for a chain-store called <I>Waitrose</I>.
For those of you who don't know who this company is, <I>Waitrose</I> is
part of the <I>John Lewis Partnership, plc</I>. They specialise in nice,
high quality food. For the really curious among you, here is a list of the
desserts I make:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Chocolate Mousse</LI>
  <LI>Zabaglioni (Amorretti biscuit-base mousse)</LI>
  <LI>Lemon Dessert</LI>
  <LI>Rhubarb Syllabub</LI>
  <LI>Blackberry Syllabub</LI>
  <LI>Creme Brulee</LI>
  <LI>Creme Brulee with Chocolate and Grand Marnier</LI>
  <LI>Creme Brulee with Raspberry Compote</LI>
</UL>

<P>I start at 6:00am :-) That's the only the drawback. However it does
mean that I finish around 2-4 in the afternoon.</P>

<P>That's about as exciting as my life gets really, I think it is time to
move on to some proper material.<B> Linux.....</B></P>

<H2><A NAME="Q-wiq">What is Quota?</A></H2>

<P>Way, way back in <A HREF="../issue13/slew.html">
issue 13</A> Jim Dennis wrote a small article about how to set up your 
Linux machine so that it would tell you if you were going to run out of 
disk space. (SLEW). I read this article, and decided that you can make sure that 
your users do not run amok on disk space by enforcing a set <B>rules</B> 
by either specifying the number of inodes or blocks that a particular 
user cannot exceed.</P>

<P>Quota is handled on a per-user basis though, and is only active on one
file system at a time. Thus, if a user has access to more than one file
system, and you wish to enforce quotas on each of them, then you must do so
separately.</P>

<P>So in short, quota is a way of setting maximum disk space that a user
can consume, at any one time</P>

<HR WIDTH=25%>

<!-- ========================== -->
<!-- END: Quotas: What is Quota -->
<!-- ========================== -->

<!-- ========================== -->

<!-- =========================== -->
<!-- BEGIN: Quotas: Installation -->
<!-- =========================== -->

<H2><A NAME="Q-inst">Installation</A></H2>

<P>As of Kernel version >=2.0, Quota support has been bundled in with the
kernel, and as such, if you come from the dark ages, and have a kernel
version <2.0, then obtain the latest source (<A
HREF="http://www.kernel.org">www.kernel.org</A>) NOW!!</P>

<P>And as for the rest of the GNU/Linux planet, you should find that you
already have quota support enabled by default in the kernel anyway. If you
<I>think</I> you have not, then download the latest stable release and
re-compile. It can't hurt.....much :-). For instructions on how to do this,
please refer to the INSTALL file, under the source directory.</P>

<P>Incidentally, for those users running a nice shiny SuSE Box, Quota
automatically comes compiled into the kernel :-)</P>

<P>But the fun-and-games continue, since Quota is not directly runnable
from the kernel itself (i.e. it is not a self-contained module). You have
to either install an RPM for Source file.</P>

<P>The RPM file (should you be using a distribution that uses this system
of package handling) in question is:</P>

<B>quota-1.70-263.rpm</B>

<P>And the tarball file is called:</P>

<B>all.tar.gz</B>

<P>Both of which are available from the following FTP repository:</P>

<A HREF="ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus/subsystems/quota/">
ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus/subsystems/quota/</A>

<P><U>To install the RPM file:</U></P>

<P>Issue the command:</P>

<B>su - -c'rpm -i /path/to/quota-1.70-263.rpm'</B>

<P><U>To install the source file</U></P> 

<PRE>
1. <B>su -</B>
2. <B>cd /path/to/tarball/</B>
3. <B>tar xzvfm ./all.tar.gz</B>
4. <B>./configure</B></PRE><I>[ Allow for configure script to run ]</I>
<PRE>
5. <B>make && make install</B>
6. <B>logout</B></PRE><I>[ To exit out of root's &quot;su;ed&quot; account
]</I>

<P>That's all there is to it :-) Now the <I><B>real</B></I> fun begins</P>

<!-- ======================== -->
<!-- END: Quota: Installation -->
<!-- ======================== --> 

<HR WIDTH=25%>

<!-- ============================ -->
<!-- BEGIN: Quota: Setting Quotas -->
<!-- ============================ --> 

<H2><A NAME="Q-sq">Setting Quotas</A></H2>

<P>The first step in configuring this, is to have a logical idea in your
head as to how you are going to organise this. Quota gives you the option
of either specifying a single user, or a group (which has been assigned to
specific users), or both. If you are on a large network, then perhaps a
mixture of the two is preferable. Think about it :-)</P>

<P>Group version is usually good, if you assign <B>all</B> users to that
specific group. Makes life easier, <EM>n'est pas?</EM></P>

<P>But the first actual step is to make some system-wide changes. For
this, log in as user <B>root</B>. Please though, do not simply
&quot;su&quot; in, as this simply changed your effective UID, and does
nothing about export variables, etc.</P>

<P>We must first modify &quot;/etc/fstab&quot; so that the kernel knows
that the filesystem mount point will make use of the quota support. A
typical &quot;/etc/fstab&quot; file looks like the following:</P>

<PRE>
/dev/hda1	/boot	       ext2	defaults 1 2
/dev/hda2	swap	       swap	defaults 0 2
/dev/hda3	/	       ext2	defaults 1 1
/dev/cdrom	/cdrom	       auto	ro,noauto,user,exec 0 0
/dev/fd0	/floppy	       auto	noauto,user 0 0
proc	        /proc	       proc	defaults 0 0
usbdevfs	/proc/bus/usb  usbdevfs	defaults 0 0
devpts	        /dev/pts       devpts	defaults 0 0


#NFS clients....
#Updated: Thomas Adam, Tuesday 03:45am??? -- Can't remember.
server:/etc	    /mnt/etc    nfs    rw,user,rsize=1024,wsize=1024,hard,intr 0  0
server:/home	    /mnt/home   nfs    rw,user,rsize=1024,wsize=1024,hard,intr 0  0
server:/usr/doc/lg/lg/lwm	    /mnt/lwm	nfs    rw,user,hard,intr 0  0

server:/dev	    /mnt/dev	nfs    ro,user,rsize=1024,wsize=1024,hard,intr 0  0
</PRE>

<P>What we are concerned with, is not the last part of the file <I>[ ** although
<B>quota</B> can be used with <B><I>nfs</I></B> exported file types -- see
&quot;man rquota&quot; ** ]</I>, but with
which mount point is to be issued with quota support. This will depend
upon where your user's $HOME directories are located. Unless you have got a
separate partition or drive for this, then typically the mount points you
will want to use is either &quot;/&quot; or &quot;/usr&quot; (if
<B>/home</B> is a symlink to &quot;/usr/local/home/&quot; -- and
&quot;/usr&quot; is on a separate drive or partition.)</P>

<P>Now I come back to my original question that I first posed at the
beginning of this section. How are the users going to be managed? If you
have decided to do it just on a user by user basis, then add
<B>usrquota</B> to your fstab file. If you are going to do it by group then
add <B>grpquota</B>. If you are going to use a mixture of the two, then add
them both.</P>

<P>Thus, we are now concerned with adding to the fourth field the
following:</P>

<PRE>
/dev/hda3	/	       ext2	defaults,<B>usrquota,grpquota</B> 1 1
</PRE>

<P>Change as appropriate for your version of fstab. If you are unsure as to
which quota to use, I recommend that you include both in the fstab file,
since it means that should you need to swap, you'll already have it set up.
Now save the file.</P>

<P>OK. The next thing we have to do is to make sure that for whichever
option you chose (i.e. namely <B>usrquota</B> or <B>grpquota</B>), that you
create the necessary file(s) on the root of the partition that you changed
in the fstab file. To do this, enter the following commands (still as user
<B>root</B>)</P>

<PRE>
touch /top/of/partition/quota.user && chmod 600
/top/of/partition/quota.user

touch /top/of/partition/quota.group && chmod 600
/top/of/partition/quota.group
</PRE> 

<P>Lastly, you have to ensure that when your system boots up, that quotas
are enabled along with it. For those of you who installed <B>Quota</B> from
an RPM/.DEB, etc should find that they already have a script named
&quot;quota&quot; or something similar in &quot;/etc/init.d/&quot;. If you
installed from source however, this might not be the case, which means that
you will have to add the following script into your main init-script AFTER
the mounting of all files in &quot;/etc/fstab&quot; has taken place.</P>

<PRE>

<A HREF="misc/adam/quota.sh.txt">(text version)</A>

#Check quotas
[ -x /usr/sbin/quotacheck ] && {
  echo "Checking Quotas (please wait)...
  /usr/sbin/quotacheck -avug
  echo "Done."
} || {
  echo "Checking Quotas FAILED"
}

[ -x /usr/sbin/quotaon ] && {
  echo "Initialising Quotas..."
  /usr/sbin/quotaon -avug
  echo " Done."
} || {
  echo "Turning Quotas On: FAILED
}
</PRE>

<P>What the above does, is runs a test on the named file, for the
&quot;-x&quot; flag which means that it is checking to ensure that the file
is executable, before it processes the rest of the script. It checks to see
what quotas are defined (if any), and then goes on to enable them.</P>

<P>Once you have done that, issue:</P>

<PRE>
<B>init 6</B>
</PRE>

<P>And wait for your computer to reboot. <BR><BR><FONT COLOR="red">Caveat Emptor:
If you did have to recompile your kernel, ensure that if you are using LILO
as your boot-loader that you run: <BR><BR>
<B>lilo</B><BR><BR>
BEFORE you reboot so that it knows about your new kernel-image
:-)</FONT></P>

<!-- END: Quota: setting quotas -->

<HR WIDTH=25%>

<!-- ============================ -->
<!-- BEGIN: Quota: An Example     -->
<!-- ============================ --> 

<H2><A NAME="Q-an">An Example</A></H2>

<P>Right. We should now have your machine acknowledging the fact that we
are going to use Quota. What we haven't done yet, is the most important
bit, and that is, who or which groups will be using the quota rule.</P>

<P>What I have decided to do, is to use an example if a user, and show you
how you go about setting up a quota limit for him. We shall call the user
<B>lg</B>.

<P>Assuming <B>lg</B> is already on your system, what we must do is,
depending on which format you are using, edit the appropriate file. For the
purposes of this example, I shall do this on a per-user basis (i.e. I shall
be using the <B>usrquota</B> format, although everything I shall explain
here, is exactly the same for the <B>grpquota</B> option, if you have
decided to do that.</P>

<P>The command that we shall be using is called &quot;edquota&quot; What we
must do is edit a quota for user <B>lg</B> by issuing the command:</P>

<PRE>edquota -u lg</PRE>

<P>What this does, is launches an editor, and opens a new quota. If you
haven't set the environment variable EDITOR="/usr/bin/jed" or some
equivalent editor, then this command will not work. To set up this
variable, add this to your &quot;~/.bash_profile&quot;</P>

<PRE>
EDITOR="/usr/bin/jed"
export EDITOR
</PRE>

<P>Change the program as you see fit, i.e. Vi, jed, joe, emacs, etc. Then
to make the changes active, source the file, by typing:</P>

<PRE>source ~/.bash_profile</PRE>

<P>What you should find, is that for user <B>lg</B> you get something
similar to the following:</P>

<PRE>
Quotas for user lg:
/dev/hdb2: blocks in use 0, limits (soft = 0, hard = 0)
      	   inodes in use: 356, limits (soft = 0, hard = 0)
</PRE>

<P>Now your thinking: &quot;err....&quot :-) Don't worry. It is much more
simpler than it looks.</P>

<P><B>Blocks</B> indicate the total number of blocks that a user has used
on a partition (measured in Kilobytes, KB).</P>

<P><B>Inodes</B> indicate the total number of files that a user has on the
partition. N.B. These values you cannot change.</P>

<P>What we are concerned with, is the bit in brackets, right at the end of
each line. This is the key to setting the entire quota. You'll notice that
there are two options, one for <B>soft</B> and one for <B>hard</B>. 

<P><B>Soft limits</B> indicate the maximum amount of space (in Kilobytes)
that <B>lg</B> is allowed to have. It acts as a boundary which when set
along with a <B>grace period</B> informs to user <B>lg</B> that he is
exceeding his limit.</P>

<P>A <B>grace</B> limit is a period of time before the <B>soft</B> limit is
enforced. This can be set from (sec)onds, (min)utes, hour, day, week,
month. This is set by issuing the command:</P>

<PRE>edquota -t</PRE>

<P>You'll see that you should get the following:</P>

<PRE>
Time units may be: days, hours, minutes, or seconds
Grace period before enforcing soft limits for users:
/dev/hdb2: block grace period: 0 days, file grace period: 0 days
</PRE>

<P>Change both values for <B>block</B> and <B>file</B> to whatever you see
fit. I recommend 14 days (2 weeks) for both. But then, I am generous
:-)</P>

<P>A <B>hard</B> limit indicates the maximum amount of space that a user
<I>cannot</I> exceed. This only works when a grace period has been set.</P>

<P>That's all there is to it. Now, you are probably wondering how the hell
you are supposed to assign the same quota to every user on your system.
Well, having just followed the example for <B>lg</B>, what you can do, is
to use user <B>lg</B> as a template, and issue the command:</P>

<PRE>awk -F: '$3 >= 500 {print $1}' /etc/passwd'</PRE>

<P>What this does, is prints a list to the screen of all users who start
with a UID greater than 499 (i.e 500 onwards). If this set of users on the
screen looks OK, then we can use the above, in conjunction with the
<B>edquota</B>, as shown below:</P>

<PRE>edquota -p lg $(awk -F: '$3 > 499 {print $1}' /etc/passwd')</PRE>

<P>This uses the quota we have already enabled for <B>lg</B> as a template
to assign it to the string of users that the awk script produces for
us.</P>

<P>That's all there is to it :-). I have found quota to be an excellent
tool in keeping users at bay. I use it for my non-root account, as it stops
me from going wild in my home directory, and thus forces me to clean it out
once in a while.</P>

<HR WIDTH=25%>

<H2><A NAME="DG-wis">What is DansGuardian?</A></H2>

<P>For those of you who followed my last miniature introduction to the world
of linux proxying for <B>Squid</B> and <B>SquidGuard</B>, 
<A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/issue78/adam.html">will remember</A> that
I showed you how you could filter certain webpages that matched a certain
regex. What <B>Dansguardian</B> does. is take the concept of filtering and
stretches it so that you can filter webpages, based on <B>content!!</B>. Also
though, Dansguardian allows you to filter out mime-types and block file
extensions, thus meaning that should your users have the unfortunate punishment
of using an M$-Windows machine, you can block files such as <B>.exe, .com,
.dll, .zip .... etc</B></P>

<!-- ======================================== -->

<HR WIDTH=25%>

<H2><A NAME="DG-ins">Installation</A></H2>

<P>Dansguardian can be obtained from the following:</P>

<A HREF="http://www.dansguardian.org">http://www.dansguardian.org</A>  

<P>You can either download an RPM or tar.gz file from his site. If you're a
budding Debian GNU/Linux user, then you can always use the <B>alien</B>
package to convert the RPM file to a DEB file :-). To actually install the
files, follow the <A HREF="#Q-inst">instructions</A> as in the Quota
section.</P>

<P>It is also worth noting, that Dansguardian requires the use of the
<B>nb++</B> library. There is a link to a download site, on the main site
of dansguardian. This library is used to look at the content of webpages,
and is thus essential to the operation of Dansguardian.</P>

<P>On install, dansguardian, main program is installed as
&quot;/usr/sbin/dansguardian&quot. What you must do, is either in
&quot;/etc/init.d/rc.local&quot; OR &quot;/etc/init.d/boot.local&quot;
(depending on which distribution you are using), add:<P>

<PRE>
/usr/sbin/dansguardian 
</PRE>

<P>So that Dansguardian is loaded up on init.</P>

<!-- ======================== -->

<HR WIDTH=25%>

<!-- ======================== -->
<!-- BEGIN: DG: Configuration -->
<!-- ======================== --> 

<H2><A NAME="DG-conf">Configuration</A></H2>

<P>There really is not <I>too</I> much to configure when it comes to
Dansguardian. What takes all the work, is the various regex expressions
that you may want to build for really accurate content filtering.</P>

<P>It should be pointed out that DansGuardian can be used in conjunction
with <A
HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/issue78/adam.html#squidg">SquidGuard</A>
so that you don't have to replace any existing filters that you may already
have in place :-) Good, eh?</P>

<P>So, the first thing we should do, is check where the package has put the
configuration files. Well, it should be no surprise that they have been out
in &quot;/etc/dansguadian&quot;, and it is the files contained in this
directory that we shall concentrate on. We shall begin by looking at the
configuration file <B>/etc/dansguardian/dansguardian.conf</B>.</P>

<P>This is all the settings that Dansguardian will require. Typically, the
only options that I have had to change are listed below:</P>

<PRE>
#DansGuardian config file

[Reporting]
reportinglevel = 1 #  0 = just say 'Access Denied'
                   #  1 = report why but not what denied phrase
                   #  2 = report fully

[Network Settings]
filterport = 8080   # the port that DansGuardian listens to
proxyip = 127.0.0.1 # loop back address to access squid locally
proxyport = 3128    # the port DansGuardian connects to squid on
accessdeniedaddress = "http://grangedairy.laptop/cgi-bin/dansguardian.pl"

[Logging] # 0 = none  1 = just denied  2 = all text based  3 = all requests
loglevel = 2

[Content Filtering]
bannedphraselist = "/etc/dansguardian/bannedphraselist"
bannedextensionlist = "/etc/dansguardian/bannedextensionlist"
bannedmimetypelist = "/etc/dansguardian/bannedmimetypelist"
exceptionsitelist = "/etc/dansguardian/exceptionsitelist"
exceptioniplist = "/etc/dansguardian/exceptioniplist"

[Phrase Scanning] # 0 = normal  1 = intelligent
scanningmode = 1
# normal does a phrase check on the raw HTML
# intelligent does a normal check as well as removing HTML tags and
#  multiple blank spaces, tabs, etc - then does 2nd check


[ ** Many other options elided ** ]

</PRE>

<P>The only things I changed here, was the <B>filterport</B>, the
<B>proxyport</B> and the <B>accessdeniedaddress</B> tags, to reflect the
configurations I used in <B>&quot;/etc/squid.conf&quot;</B>. Having
changed your options accordingly, you can save the file, and ignore it
:-)</P>

<P>OK, moving on. In the same directory, you should notice files with the
following filenames:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>bannedphraselist</LI>
  <LI>bannedextensionlist</LI>
  <LI>bannedmimetypelist</LI>
  <LI>exceptionsitelist</LI>
  <LI>exceptioniplist</LI>
</UL>

<P>I shall take each file in turn, and explain what each one does. Where
appropriate, I shall list small portions of the file.</P>

<B>bannedphraselist</B>

<P>This file contains explicit words and as such, I shall not list its
contents here. Suffice to say, this is the file that holds keywords which
are blocked if found anywhere in the HTML page.</P>

<P>As you will see, each word is enclosed within &lt;  &gt; signs, as
in:</P>

<PRE>&lt; sex &gt;</PRE>

<P>These angled brackets are important, since without them, the word would
not be blocked.</P>

<P>You will also notice, throughout the file that some words have a space
either side of the angle brackets, and some only have one space, either end
of the bracket. This is important, since it says to dansguardian how to
block the word.<P>

<PRE>&lt; sex &gt;</PRE>

<P>Indicates that the word sex (and only the word sex) should be blocked
when it is found, nothing more.</P>

<PRE>&lt;sex&gt;</PRE>

<P>Indicates that the word sex should be blocked, regardless of where it is
found in a sentence or phrase. I.e. if it is found in
<B>hellosexyhowareyou?</B> then it will be blocked.</P>

<PRE>&lt; sex&gt;</PRE>

<P>Means that anything is blocked, to the left of the word.</P>

<PRE>&lt;sex &gt;</PRE>

<P>Is the converse of the above.</P>

<P>As you look down the file, you'll see a number of different words which
are being blocked. :-) You will also notice that there a number of comments
of example words or hyphenated phrases which are not blocked, because you
have already blocked part of that word. For example:</P>

<PRE>&lt;middlesex&gt;</PRE>

<P>Need not be blocked, since the phrase:</P>

<PRE>&lt;sex&gt;</PRE>

<P>is already blocking any other word that contains the word <B>sex</B>.
That is an important fact to remember of you are going to be adding to the
list at a later date.</P>

<B>bannedextensionlist</B>

<P>Simply contains a list of file extensions that will be blocked by
dansguardian, thus:</P>

<PRE>
#Banned extension list

.gz 
.tar
.zip
.mp3
.mpeg
.mpg
.avi
.exe
.sys
.ini
.bat
.doc
.xls
.scr
</PRE>

<P>This is pretty much self explanatory!!</P>

<B>bannedmimetypelist</B>

<PRE>
# banned MIME types

audio/mpeg
audio/x-mpeg
audio/x-pn-realaudio
video/mpeg
video/x-mpeg2
video/acorn-replay
video/quicktime
video/x-msvideo
video/msvideo
application/gzip
application/x-gzip
application/zip
application/compress
application/x-compress
application/java-vm
</PRE>

<P>MIME types are used to identify different multi-media portions of
applications, and as such is particularly useful when sending e-mail,
however MIME has its uses in HTML too :-)</P>

<P>Again, I would add some other options here.</P>

<B>exceptionsitelist</B>

<P>Lists those sites which, are allowed to be viewed, even though it would
ordinarily be blocked by the rules defined in any of the other files,
thus:</P>

<PRE>
#Sites in exception list
#Don't bother with the www. or
#the http://

jadeb.com
</PRE>

<P>You can obviously add more sites as you are going along :-)</P>

<B>exceptioniplist</B>

<PRE>
#IP addresses to ignore and just
#pass straight through.
#
#These would be servers which
#need unfiltered access for
#updates.  Also administrator
#workstations which need to
#download programs and check
#out blocked sites should be
#put here.
#
#Only put IP addresses here,
#not host names

192.168.0.1
192.168.0.2
192.168.42.2

#these are examples above
#delete them and put your own
#in if you want
</PRE>

<P>The comments in this, pretty much say all :-). Obviously I would say be
careful as to which machines you allow override access to :-)</P>

<P>And that rather short explanation explains how dansguardian works. You
may well find, as I did, that it is very frustrating at first, since it
really does block what you tell it to, but once you yourself have shoved a
whole load of domain names into the <B>exceptionsitelist</B>, things should
not be too bad at all! :-)</P>

<H2><A NAME="touchrec">Touchrec: Recursively touches files in a
directory</A></H2>

<P>In <A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/issue66/tag/2.html"
TARGET="_blank">issue66</A>, there appeared a thread about how to 
recursively touch files in a given directory. Since the GNU 
version of touch does not support an option (yet), a few 
suggestions were offered using GNU find.</P>

<P>Indeed I was intrigued by this idea. I have often been in a situation
where having a recursive feature to touch all files and/or directories was
a necessity. Such an example is where I had forgotten to add the
&quot;m&quot; flag to the tarball I was un-tarring, and as a result had a
while load of future modification dates on my files (See <A
HREF="../issue79/lg_tips.html#tips/3">
issue79</A>). Deleting the entire directory would have been a pain, since
it took <I>ages</I> to untar. Thus, I decided to write the following
shell-script :-)</P>

<P>For those of you who are completely new to BASH programming, please
refer back to Ben Okopnik's excellent tutorial earlier on in the LG series
(<A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/issue52/okopnik2.html"
TARGET="_blank">issue52</A> onwards). For those experienced programmers, 
you'll notice that I have used the &quot;[ ..... ] && {} ||&quot; 
construct, rather than the more traditional &quot;if..then..else..fi&quot; 
method, since the former gives more control with exit status :-), and 
I prefer coding like this anyway. Perl also requires this syntax too :-)</P>

<P>The script in itself is quite simple. Basically what happens is that I
initialise all of my variables first. Now, BASH does not require this, but
I find it much easier to know what's going on if I do.</P>

<P>I set up various variables, most of which are just switch identifiers so
that I can tell whether or not any command-line switches (and which ones)
have been issued. I set up another variable <B>bname</B> which returns the
name of the program, with the PATH stripped, which I used in my
<I>help_user()</I> function.</P> 

<P>The other variable I defined is the <B>redir</B> variable. This is
initially set to whichever tty you invoke the script from, so that if you
did not specify the &quot;-q&quot; option, you will get messages to your
screen. I think I have been quite clever since, whenever a file/directory
is found, I issue a command thus:</P>

<PRE>echo "touching $lists/" >$redir</PRE>

<P>which, as I say is set to whatever tty you invoked it from.
(/dev/tty1)???. But, if you specified the &quot;-q&quot; flag $redir equals
&quot;/dev/null&quot; so that no messages appear</P>

<P>With regards to command-line switching, I have made good use of the
<B>getopts</B> command. Refer to <B>man 1 touchrec</B> for more information
on that.</P>
  
<P>I was so taken by this, that I even wrote a manual page :-).
Simply download the tar.gz file, untar it, and run
&quot;install.sh&quot;</P>

<P>For more information about how to use this script, please refer to
&quot;man touchrec&quot;. Hope you get good use out of it :-)</P>

<H2><A NAME="gnufind">GNU Find: Evaluating its effectiveness</A></H2>

<P>How many of you have been guilty of using <B>mc</B> (midnight
commander), hitting the key sequence
&quot;&lt;ALT&gt;&lt;SHIFT&gt;&lt;?&gt;&quot; before, and then filling out
that nice dialog box to find the file that you require?? Don't lie, we've
all done it <B>(Hi Ben :-))</B>. And why? All that dialog box is, is a front
end to the command <B>find(1)</B> anyway. This article will help try and
wean you off pretty command-line dialog boxes. While there is nothing wrong
with using <B>mc's</B> searching feature, it does not give you the full
benefit to do complex searches. GNU <B>find</B> is a very
powerful tool indeed.</P>

<H2>Finding one particular file</H2>

<P>The most common use of find, is knowing where a certain file is. Now,
usually, if it is a binary file, you would most likely either use the
commands <B>which</B> and <B>where</B> to find it :-), but what if you were
looking for that file called <B>etherh.c</B>? You'd issue the command:</P>

<PRE>
cd /
find / -name etherh.c -print 2>/dev/null
</PRE>

<P>Now don't panic :-) The syntax of the find command is thus:</P>

<PRE>find {/path/} [name_of_file/expression] [options...]</PRE>

<P>So, what the command does, is beginning at &quot;/&quot; (the root
directory of the partition), search for the file called <B>etherh.c</B>,
when it finds it, <B>-print</B> it to stdout (and in this case the
<I>2&gt;/dev/null</I> redirects any errors to oblivion. -- used here
because I am not user <B>root</B> I obviously have permission problems
looking at certain files from &quot/&quot; that I don't care to know
about!)</I>.</P>

<P>The <B>-name</B> flag above has more than just one use as shown here. It
is in fact a flag which allows you to pass shell metacharacters to the
filename that you are trying to look for, and we will discuss that in the
next section.</P>

<P>If you have your kernel sources installed, you should find that the
file, is at:</P>

<PRE>/usr/src/linux/drivers/acorn/net/etherh.c</PRE>

<H2>Finding filenames using shell metacharacters</H2>

<P>It is all very well, knowing the exact name of the file that you trying
to search for. That makes life easier. But what if you didn't know the
exact name of the file, what then?</P>

<P>Well, in that situation, you would obviously have to use wildcards, or
more specifically shell metacharacters. These are characters such as:</P>

<PRE>
*
?
[]
{} -- [ although these have their uses as we shall see later on ]
</PRE> 

<P>Quite simply then, we can try something like the following:</P>

<PRE>
find /usr/bin -name 'xa*' -print
</PRE>

<P>Which should return:</P> 

<PRE>
/usr/bin/xargs
</PRE>

<P>The sharp eyed among you will have noticed that I

<H2>Find involving actions</H2>

<P>You can also tell find to run a program on the file(s) that it finds
too. This is an extremely useful feature, and you will be surprised at just
how often you will have cause to use it.</P>

<P>Suppose you have a bunch of files, say in $HOME, and I wanted to look
for a regular expression in each of them, i.e. "#!/bin/bash". I can do the
following:</P>

<PRE>
find $HOME -name '*' -print -depth -exec egrep -n '#!/bin/bash' {} \;
</PRE>

<P>The syntax of the last part, may seem strange, but what is happening is
that the flag <PRE>-exec</PRE> accepts first the command, and then any
addition options (in this case, a regular expression), followed by two
brackets {} which when run, will be expanded to the current filename which
is returned by the find parameter (be it a regular expression or specific
filename -- in this case all files (*). The backslash (\;) terminates the
command.</P>

<P>Therefore, in short, the syntax is:

<PRE>
find -path -name {pattern/regex} -exec {name_of_program} [options] {} \;
</PRE>

<P>You can then apply this principle to use any command that you can see a
use for :-)</P>

<H2>Finding particular types</H2>

<P>Once again, find makes our life even easier, by allowing us to look for
specific file types. Now, while you might well think that you could use a
combination of <PRE>ls, test, find</PRE> to do the same thing, <B>don't
re-invent the wheel</B> :-). Here are some examples:</P>

<PRE>find / -name '*' -print -depth -type d</PRE>

<P>-- which prints only directories</P>

<PRE>find / -name '*' -print -depth -type f</PRE>

<P>-- which finds only files</P>

<PRE>find / -name '*' -print -depth -type l</PRE>

<P>-- finds symbolic links only</P>

<P>If you only want to search say, on the top-level directory, and not
traverse any lower, then you can use the:</P>

<PRE>-maxdepth {number}</PRE>

<P>switch. For example, if you only wanted to search for directories which
is in your $(pwd) -- (current working directory) you can do:</P>

<PRE>
find / -name '*' -type d -maxdepth 1 -print
</PRE>

<P>Which on my computer (laptop) returns the following:</P>

<PRE>
/
/lost+found
/boot
/proc
/var
/tmp
/etc
/sbin
/bin
/lib
/root
/usr
/cdrom
/floppy
/home
/mnt
/opt
/dev
/chess
/pavement
</PRE>

<P>The number indicates the number of subdirectories that you wish to
descend during your search.</P>

<P>But the fun doesn't stop just with this mini-article. <B>find</B> has a
whole host of other options many of which I cannot ever see the need
for, but that's only because I have a limited use for it.....</P>

<P>Definitely check out the command:</P>

<B>man find</B>

thie Weekend Mechanic series. I was <B>really</B> pleased when John sent me an

<BR><BR>

<I><FONT COLOR="blue"><B>[John]</B></FONT></I>: &nbsp; <PRE><B>Dear Thomas,

I want to say thanks for keeping up the "Weekend Mechanic" column in the 
LG.  I have to admit that I've had little time for pleasure reading (and 
much less for writing) these past several years.  On a whim, I started 
reading the latest LG (after seeing an announcement for it on the lwn.net 
site) and noticed the WM column was still there.  I'm absolutely delighted 
that you're keeping it going and wish you the very best.

Trust your end-of-semester exams go well.  Have a great summer 'linuxing.

cheers,

John

p.s., kudos for providing "install from source" instructions for squid.  I 
suppose that a growing number of users are simply dependent on rpm or deb 
binaries (and there are good reasons for using these) but I still tend to 
"roll my own" from source and make a package out of it when I'm not feeling 
so lazy :-)
</B></PRE>

<I>[Thomas]</I> &nbsp; 
<PRE>Hello. I must say that I feel *very* honoured to have
received an e-mail from you -- especially as you
founded the Linux Gazette :-) You have no idea just
how much I valued your efforts way back in 1996. Had
you any idea that the LG would be as popular as it is
now?
</PRE>

<I><B><FONT COLOR="blue">[John]</B></FONT></I>: &nbsp;
<PRE><B>
Absolutely not.  I started getting interested in Unix/Linux during the 
summer of 1994.  I had just switched from being a general surgery resident 
at a very busy tertiary care hospital to working as a research assistant in 
the lab of one of the hepatobiliary surgeons.  I managed to get a dial-up 
account on the universities VAX machine (2400 baud :-) and started using 
gopher.  Somehow, I ran across information on Linux and decided to give it 
a try since I was interested in doing a medical informatics fellowship.

It took countless days to download the installation floppy set from TAMU 
(Texas A&M Univ.).  I had a 2 MB limit on my shell account so I would ftp 
an image to the account and then turn around and transfer it to my local 
box via kermit.  TAMU was the first distribution I ever tried.  Almost 
immediately, I decided to give Slackware a try -- it was the "new kid on 
the block" and was supposed to be so much better than SLS.  That was 
August, 1994.

After playing with Linux for a year or so I decided that I wanted to learn 
how to write HTML and so the Linux Gazette was born out of similar 
"itches":  learning Linux and learning HTML.  I absolutely loved Linux, and 
do so to this day, so it was easy to come up with content.  I just wrote 
about the things I loved and found exciting.  I had no earthly notion that 
it would be that popular.  I had a good deal more time on my hands back 
then and so I was able to do almost everything -- write columns, coordinate 
inclusions by others, format the entire batch so that the HTML was at least 
reasonably "legal", etc.

About a year later (issue 8) I was in over my head and was now back in 
school full time working on a computer science degree (actually, I was a 
non-degree seeking graduate student, but I took the entire computer science 
curriculum and enough math courses for a math minor).  Phil Hughes from the 
Linux Journal got in touch with me.  He was interested in an online 
magazine of this type and offered to take over the administrative 
work.  So, I was terribly relieved to turn the reins over to him and 
continue writing.

What are you doing these days??? Your last ever
article said that you'd finished your degree
(congratulations) and was going to work for a medical
centre?? Is this still the case?? How is your wife??
</PRE>

<I><B><FONT COLOR="blue">[John]</B></FONT></I>: &nbsp;
<PRE><B>
At the moment, I'm within a couple years of finally finishing up my medical 
training!  I went on to do a brief medical informatics fellowship under 
Drs. Randolph Miller and William Stead at the Vanderbilt University Medical 
Center and then decided to finish my formal medical training in 
Pathology.  I matched at Yale (here in New Haven, Connecticut) and have 
completed 2 years of Anatomic Pathology training.  This year, I was able to 
take a year off to do some medical informatics research with Dr. Prakash 
Nadkarni.  We've just finished writing our first paper (in information 
retrieval) and I'm working on two additional projects.  I start back "on 
the wards" as a Clinical Pathology (AKA, Laboratory Medicine) resident on 
July 1.

Life has gotten a rather busy of late.  My wife and I adopted a little girl 
from China in August, 2000.  She's a cutie pie, but definitely takes a good 
deal of what little "free time" we had left :-).  Any more, I try to keep 
up with things in the Linux Community but I've had no time to write.

What distribution are you using?
</B></PRE>

<I>[Thomas]</I>: &nbsp;

<PRE>
I'm using SuSE 7.1, soon to switch back to using <B>Debian</B>
</PRE>

<I><B><FONT COLOR="blue">[John]</B></FONT></I>: &nbsp;
<PRE><B>
I'm still using Slackware :-).  You mentioned that you've been using Linux 
for around six years.  That's long enough that you've probably given a 
number of distributions a whirl.  I have to say that I really like 
Mandrake, and I've run Debian for short time.  Eventually, however, 
managing the *.deb's and *.rpm's becomes a headache and I start fighting 
with the package manager.  In time, I just get disgusted and go back to 
Slackware.  It's stable, Patrick V. does a nice job of keeping current 
without pushing too far toward the bleeding edge.  And I still compile 
nearly everything from scratch.
</B></PRE>

<I>[Thomas]</I>: &nbsp;

Thanks again John :-)
Keep in touch,

<EM>My name is Thomas Adam. I am 18, and am currently studying for A-Levels
(=university entrance exam). I live
on a small farm, in the county of Dorset in England. I am a massive Linux
enthusiast, and help with linux proxy issues while I am at school. I have been
using Linux now for about six years. When not using Linux, I play the piano,
and enjoy walking and cycling.</EM>
