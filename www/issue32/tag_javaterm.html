>Java Telnet/Terminal: </H3>
<p><strong>From Spencer T. Kittelson on 28 Jul 1998 </strong></p>
<!-- begin body -->



<p><strong>They're out there but not <EM>all</EM> there.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>We have some old code that runs on terminals that we would like to
drive with a Java based server.  We are looking for the reverse
equivalent of a terminal emulator, i.e. a Java toolkit that
multiplexes serial/network character streams and provides support
for character based devices.  In particular we are looking for the
Java equiv. of the C curses library.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Any ideas if and where such a thing exists?
<br>Spencer

>The canonical resource for finding Java applets
and applications on the web is at "developer.com"
(formerly known as Gamelan).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Here's URL that will provide you with a list of 
some telnet and terminal emulators writting in Java
</blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><code
	><A HREF="http://www-c.developer.com/directories/find.cgi?search=Java+Telnet&amp;num=50&amp;sp=sp"
	>http://www-c.developer.com/directories/find.cgi?search=Java+Telnet&amp;num=50&amp;sp=sp</A>
</code></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote>(Be sure to cut and paste that without the linebreak,
and the extraneous backslash that I use to indicate
the line continuation).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>There are a number of these listed there and I
haven't tried any of them (well, I tried WebTerm
awhile back and I did look at the online demo
of JXterm, and Crosstie).  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>I've played with <a href="http://www.sco.com/">SCO</a>'s 
Tarantella --- which seems to 
be more of an X Windows in a Java frame --- and 
also provides support to access NT desktops through
a Java frame.  Alas, that seems to be a proprietary
technology and it seems to require a SCO OpenServer
to host part of it. (I suspect that means that it
doesn't qualify as a "Pure Java" solution -- 
though the client side of it might be "pure Java").
</blockquote>
<blockquote>WebTerm seems to be available for non-commercial use
--- but doesn't define the term (do they mean
you can't use it in your business environment or 
just that you can't sell copies of it).  JXTerm
and Crosstie seem to be commercial products.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>One limitation of most of the Java implementations
in existing web browsers is that the Java applets
can normally only open connections to the same 
address from which they were fetched.  This means
that your host would have to run a web server with
some HTML pages that contained the required
applet markup.  You could also distribute these
to your systems along with an installation of the
JRE (Java Runtime Environment) and a copy of 
'appletviewer' --- that would allow you to run
these without the common browser restrictions.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Another problem with these is that they are not	
trivial to install and run via the 'appletviewer'
WebTerm 2.0 gave me grief about "missing resources"
while the same copy of appletviewer was
perfectly content to run the various other 
demos that I had laying around.  I'm sure that it's
some fussing with the <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> variable or 
some other thing that I don't have configured
to it's liking.  Frankly I haven't worried about it
much.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>I presume that your clients are PC's or NC's rather 
than Linux boxes.  Otherwise I presume you'd just
configure your browswers with 'telnet' configured
as a helper app and just embed URL's of the form:
</blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><code>&lt;a href="telnet://appserver.mydomain.org"&gt;
	Telnet to our Application Server&lt;/a&gt;
</code></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote>... and be done with it.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Naturally you can do that on your Windows boxes
as well --- just install some sort of telnet utility
and configure the browsers to use it.  I personally
like C-Kermit for telnet -- so you might consider
using K'95 (the Win32 Kermit from Columbia University).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>That would give you a consistent scripting, telnet and
file transfer environment across your systems.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>That approach (using helper apps) is likely to be much 
faster, more robust and probably and cheaper than trying
to do this with Java applets.  The usual telnet utilities
have had years to mature and are written to the clients
native API's --- so there's no fussing about that.
