</H3> 

<P> Las Vegas, NV  May 9, 2000  Today at Networld+Interop (N+I), Axis 
Communications is demonstrating a new wireless solution that provides 
broadband access to the Internet and LANs for a wide range of emerging 
wireless devices. General availability is 
expected in the fourth quarter.
The Bluetooth Access Point will be used to create local "hot spots," areas 
where instant wireless broadband access to the Internet or a network is 
available to Bluetooth enabled devices, such as cell phones, PDAs, laptops 
and emerging Webpads. These hot spots will enable new and innovative 
services for a variety of user environments, in the office, home, hotels, 
retail establishments and other public places such as the airport.

<P> In the hotel of the future, while you check into your room, your laptop 
checks into the office - retrieves e-mail, voicemail and accesses corporate 
Intranet services - all with broadband speed. Phone calls will be routed 
automatically via telephony services to your personal mobile phone, 
providing one number simplicity and lower-cost phone bills. The hotel will 
offer new conveniences: such as easy wireless faxing and printing from 
anywhere in the hotel to the business center, poolside food service 
ordering and streamlined checkout payment all from your PDA.

<P> The Bluetooth Access Point from Axis is the first to support both data and 
voice services. The product platform is based on Axis' integrated 
system-on-a-chip technology and embedded Linux, which includes a Bluetooth 
stack for Linux developed by Axis and recently released under GNU General 
Public License (GPL) to the open source community.

Official press release from Red Hat</A>)


<P> RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C.--April 25, 2000--Red Hat, Inc.,
 announced today that it is now taking orders for 
developer tools and services for the embedded Linux market. 
The Red Hat Embedded DevKit (EDK) begins shipping immediately and answers 
the demand for open source software and tools in the growing
embedded space, which includes Internet appliances and handhelds.

<P> The Red Hat EDK provides an integrated development environment (IDE) to 
deliver software developers everything needed to quickly and easily create 
embedded Linux applications on a wide spectrum of pervasive computing 
platforms. The targeted markets include manufacturers who are building 
Internet infrastructure appliances and consumer Internet appliances, 
as well as the traditional telecom, datacom, industrial and embedded
enterprise markets.

<P> The Red Hat Embedded DevKit is a completely open source software package 
and is sold via redhat.com with varying levels of services starting 
at $199.95.


<P> A key advantage to the Red Hat Embedded DevKit is access to the premium
support services that Red Hat has pioneered in the open source space. Red Hat
Support customers receive assistance on the usage of the Embedded DevKit and
response to questions about embedded Linux. In addition, customers are entitled
to priority response on corrections to any EDK or kernel problems they submit.
This ensures that customer projects stay on schedule.

<P> For EDK, Red Hat offers two types of premium support:

<P> Incident support for small workgroups, and Platinum Support for larger 
development teams. Incident packages provide the customer with priority 
response on a fixed number of requests. Platinum packages provide priority 
response on an unlimited number of requests, but are based on the number 
of software developers using the EDK.

</FONT>
</H3> 


<P> FHS 2.1 is done!

<P> I'm pleased to announce the release of FHS 2.1, a updated version of the
Filesystem Hierarchy Standard for Linux and other Unix-like operating
systems.  FHS is part of the draft Linux Standard Base specification,
which will soon be updated to reflect FHS 2.1.

<P> FHS 2.1 supersedes both FSSTND 1.2 and FHS 2.0.  There have been some
significant improvements and bug fixes since FHS 2.0.  Please see the
FHS web site for details.  (It has been a few years since the last
official release, so check it out if you're using a previous version
of FHS or FSSTND.)

<P> What is FHS?

<P> FHS defines a common arrangement of the many files and directories in
Unix-like systems (the filesystem hierarchy) that many different
developers and groups have agreed to use.  See below for details on
retrieving the standard.

<P> The FHS specification is used by the implementors of Linux distributions
and other Unix-like operating systems, application developers, and
open-source writers.  In addition, many system administrators and users
have found it to be a useful resource.

<P> FHS or its predecessor, FSSTND, is currently implemented by most
major Linux distributions, including Debian, Red Hat, Caldera, SuSE,
and more.

<P> FHS 2.1 and other FHS-related information is available at
<A HREF="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">http://www.pathname.com/fhs/</A>

<P> IRVINE, CA (May 17, 2000) - Magic Software Enterprises announced completion
of two key acquisitions.  Magic purchased a majority interest in Sintec Call
Centers Ltd. (Sintec), a Magic Solutions Partner that is the developer of the
leading call center management software in Israel.  Magic plans to market and
sell the Magic-based solution -- which already has been implemented extensively
in Israel -- worldwide under the brandname, "Magic eContacit"  Magic also has
acquired ITM, another Magic Solutions Partner with expertise in the development
and implementation of e-commerce projects.


<P> IRVINE, CA (May 22, 2000) - Magic Software Enterprises (Nasdaq: MGIC), a
leading provider of state-of-the-art application development technology and
business solutions, announced today that it has signed a deal with Compass
Group PLC, a major worldwide foodservice organization, to deliver an
e-procurement solution.  The e-procurement solution, which is being developed
and implemented by Magic's French subsidiary at Compass Group France, will be
built using Magic's award-winning business-to-business e-commerce solution,
Magic eMerchant.   The new application is expected to become operational in
June 2000.

<P> "We chose Magic over Oracle and IBM because they were able to provide us a
competitive, fixed-price solution that could be implemented much more quickly
and efficiently than the other two, and would adhere exactly to our specific
data model," said Ludovic Penin, Compass Group's IS director in France.

<FONT COLOR="green">Solemates chooses Lutris Technologies
</FONT>
</H3> 

<P>  SANTA CRUZ, Calif. - May 22, 2000 - Lutris Technologies, Inc., an Open
Source enterprise software and services company, today announced that its
Professional Services group was chosen to deliver the interactive customatix
(<A HREF="http://www.customatix.com">www.customatix.com</A>) Web site for
Solemates.  Customatix.com is an interactive E-commerce site that enables
customers to design and build their own shoes click-by-click from the sole up.

<P> Solemates, the company behind customatix.com, relied on Lutris Technologies'
Professional Services group to develop a site capable of delivering the
three billion trillion combinations of custom shoe designs that only a
Web-based business could offer customers.  Visitors to customatix.com can
select from a vast assortment of shoe design elements, including sole
heights, materials, colors, laces, and other options to build a uniquely
individual pair of shoes.

<P> Lutris made customatix.com come to life quickly.  Using Enhydra
(<A HREF="http://www.enhydra.org">www.enhydra.org</A>), a leading
Open Source Java(tm)/XML application server, the Professional Services group
built a complex, multi-faceted application, architecting a solution that
integrates seamlessly with Solemates' partners, including UPS, Cybersource,
and FaceTime.  The Enhydra Open Source application server decreased
Solemates' time-to-market to a fraction of what it could have been using
closed source, proprietary software.

<P> Using Enhydra XMLC, Lutris was able to deploy Solemates' business in five
months-roughly half the time it would have taken without this innovation,
and at a cost of approximately one-third of what a pioneering site typically
costs, according to recent GartnerGroup survey data.  Enhydra XMLC separates
HTML design and coding from business logic, allowing interface designers and
Java programmers to work simultaneously yet independently.  Since a core
benefit of customatix.com's vision lay in allowing customers to view their
creations in real-time, Enhydra XMLC provided the precise technology to
support such an inventive business strategy.

</H3> 

<P> With "Heavy Gear II" Loki Entertainment Software is
opening the door to new dimensions in the Linux world: with 3D audio effects
and joystick support, a further step has been taken towards the acceptance of
Linux by the home user.

<P> With the release of the first "big" Linux game, "Civilization: Call To 
Power" (awarded the "Best End User Product of 1999" by Linux Journal), 
Loki Entertainment has already made a name for itself. Just like its 
successors, "Heavy Gear II" makes optimal use of the qualities of Linux 
in the network, whereby multi-player games based on rounds, or real-time, 
are possible. Due to its success, it is no surprise that around a dozen 
more titles are planned on being ported to Linux for the year 2000.

<P> Loki is currently placing its main emphasis on 3D sound support by means 
of OpenAL. "OpenAL represents a milestone for Linux," realizes Scott 
Draeker, president of Loki Entertainment Software. "Until now, 3D audio 
features in games were reserved for users of other platforms. This has 
all changed now."

<P> OpenAL, entirely in the tradition of the Open Source community, is issued 
under the LPGL license (GNU Library Public License).

<P>  Loki released 7 front-line Linux game titles in 1999, and 
plans 16 titles for 2000. For more information, visit

<P> We proudly announce the beta release of Linux SDK for use with Quake III 
Arena.

<P> The full version of Linux SDK will benefit Linux enthusiasts and aspiring 
game developers alike by allowing them to create maps and game code 
modifications under Linux. Windows users have had this capability since 
the release of the original Quake game.

<P> Linux SDK offers Linux users a toolchain for content creation. It 
combines software for image processing, conversion and editing with a 
fully-featured map editor compatible with the Quake III engine. The 
features include custom texturing, lighting, patches, shaders, entities 
and more. It is based in part on the QERadiant code from id Software, Inc.
