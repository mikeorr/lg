<h1>Retrospectives</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/dennis.html">Jim Dennis</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>
I skipped my retrospectives article last month, but should be
in the regular swing of things again now.  So, 100 issues ago,
in August of 1995, John M. Fisk published his 
<a href="../issue01to08/linux_gazette.aug.html">
second issue of the Linux Gazette</a>. He describe the 1990s as a time
when "we're supposed to be shallow." In retrospect I suppose it was the
a little the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fin_de_siecle">fin de
sie&egrave;le</a> for the 20th century; the "dot com" bubble was that century's <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_Song">swan song</a>.  </p>

<h3>Mailbag:</h3>

<p> We start with praise for the
"Keystroke-HOWTO" To me this calls to mind the <a
href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Keyboard-and-Console-HOWTO.html"
target="_top">Keyboard-and-Console-HOWTO</a>, the <a
href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Accessibility-HOWTO/index.html"
target="_top">Accessibility-HOWTO</a> and perhaps the
<a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Intkeyb/index.html"
target="_top">Intkeyb</a> (internationalization (i18n) of keyboards using
xmodmap and xkb support). The latter of these is quick to point out that
modern Linux systems have support for a LANG= environment variable and
that his HOWTO is a legacy from older systems.

</p><p> On the issue of accessibility I had to figure out how to set up 
sticky keys for a friend of mine years ago; before that HOWTO was written. 
He'd had as stroke and needed to be able to type with a single hand; the
sticky keys features allow one to type [Shift], [Ctrl], [Alt] and similar
keys as separate keystrokes which then apply to the the next "regular"
key pressed before reverting to their unpressed state. I set up the
keys on the left to be "sticky" and the keys on the right to be "locks"
(so the right [Alt], [Shift], and [Ctrl] keys would all act as toggles,
staying virtually pressed until they were tapped again). Now one might
just read the <a href="http://www.eklhad.net/linux/app/onehand.html"
>One Handed Typing</a> though my old approach would still work, too.
It was done at the console (using the <i>loadkeys</i> command, and in
X using Xmodmap).  
</p><p> 

Linux also supports a few voice recognition packages
though the best of these is almost certainly the commercial <a
href="http://www.ibm.com/software/voice/viavoice/">ViaVoice</a> from IBM.
However, there are other efforts out there as described by:
<a href="http://volker.dnsalias.net/linux/speechrec.html">Speech/Voice
Recognition for Linux</a>,
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6383">
Linux Review: ViaVoice and XVoice: Providing Voice Recognition
</a>

</p><p>

Of course on the downside some people, some of the time might still need
to read the <a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/BackspaceDelete/index.html"
target="_top">BackspaceDelete</a> HOWTO.

</p><p> 

This same correspondent also offered a hint to users of the old sbpcd
(SoundBlaster Pro CD-ROM drives and adapaters). Thankfully all the CD-ROM,
CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-ROM, DVD+/-RW/+/-R drives on the market today are ATAPI
(IDE) or SCSI. So they just work now.

</p><p> 

And finally this correspondent had choice words about the peversity
and bloat of EMACS, the atavistic nature of vi and problems running an
ELF binary of xemacs. ('95 was back in the transition from a.out to ELF
binary formats in Linux --- ELF is executable linking format). A modern
Linux distribution would avoid those issues by simply providing packages
(RPMs or .deb files). Package management has come a long way in Linux.

</p><p> 

John's response referred to the (then upcoming) release of WordPerfect for
Linux by Novell (now the proud owners of S.u.S.E.) and Caldera (now known
as "The SCO Group" and currently embroiled in a lawsuits with Novell, IBM,
Red Hat, Daimler-Chrysler Corporation, AutoZone and others --- allegedly
over Linux issues; although each of these cases is really about contract
disputes, Lanham Act violations (akin to slander/libel) by SCOG , etc).

</p><p> I could go on at great length about The SCO Group or about the
failure of WordPerfect (which was eventually released for Linux by Corel
Inc; but seems to be basically unavailable now).


</p><p> However, today the obvious responses would be: text editing with
nedit for Linux X Windowing System users who don't like EMACS/xemacs
and vi/vim, and <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a>
for the word processing and other office productivity operations.
At this point there are a significant number of organizations that are
deploying or at least evaluating deployment of OpenOffice or it's commercial
twin StarOffice on their MS Windows systems. This trend is far more
pronounced internationally and is, for many, a transitional phase in a
long term migration towards Linux on the desktop.
</p><p>

The next letter was from a user of multiple operating systems.  He gave a
list of his most important packages: 

<dl>
<dt><a 
href="http://www.igd.fhg.de/~aschaefe/fips/">fips</a></dt>
<dd>an MS-DOS program for splitting partitions without damaging FAT (file allocation table) filesystems residing on them.  This is the free alternative to <a 
href="http://www.powerquest.com/">Partition Magic</a> (now owned by
<a href="http://www.symantec.com">Symantec</a>).</dd>
<dt><a href="http://elserv.ffm.fgan.de/~lermen/">LOADLIN</a></dt><dd>a
utility to load a Linux kernel from an MS-DOS prompt.  It was later covered
in an article by Bill Bennet in <a 
href="../issue34/bennet.html">LG #34: LOADLIN.exe
Installer</a></dd>
<dt><a href="http://channels.netscape.com/ns/browsers/download.jsp">
Netscape Navigator</a></dt><dd>... which is still alive and kicking at
version 7.1, though <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> is more
popular among Linux users and there are many other browsers.
There are several scattered among the list of <a href="
http://www.linux.org/apps/all/Networking/WWW.html">WWW Applications</a> at
<a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux.org</a> and and there are other
lists like: <a href="http://linux.about.com/cs/softbrowser/">
this</a>, <a href= "http://linux.tucows.com/web_browsers_default.html">
this</a>, <a href="http://gcross.customer.netspace.net.au/browsers.html">
this</a>, and <a href=
"http://www.techtv.com/screensavers/linux/story/0,24330,3399999,00.html">
this article</a> by Chris DiBona
</dd>
<dt><a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/">kermit</a></dt>
<dd>the classic communications software, known for robust file transfer over
serial lines, while its extensive scripting and networking features go
gravely under-appreciated.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">GNU EMACS</a></dt>
<dd>and its derivative <a href="http://www.xemacs.org/">XEmacs</a>, of course.
</dd>
</dl>
</p><p>
His only complaint related to data exchange between Linux and NT. Linux can
read and write NTFS with the latest
<a href="http://linux-ntfs.sourceforge.net/">Linux-NTFS</a> and even the newer
LDM (logical disk manager) features of MS Windows 2000 (and XP Pro).
</p>
<h3>More tar Tricks:</h3>
<p>
The old <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/tar.html">GNU tar</a>
utility is almost unchanged in the last several years. However, it's worth
noting that the support for <a href= "http://acl.bestbits.at/">
ACLs and EAs</a> (access control lists and extended attributes) in the
2.6 kernels means that many system administrators will need to consider
updated tools to store, transfer, and restore these additional forms of
meta-data.  This will be especially true of those using <a href=
"http://www.samba.org">Samba</a>, which support ACLs if they're available.
Samba provides filesharing services to MS Windows clients, which is a community
that expects ACLs to be available.

Luckily the necessary software has been around for a long time; Joerg
Schilling's <a href="http://www.fokus.gmd.de/research/cc/glone/employees/joerg.schilling/private/star.html">star</a> has been around for a long time and
support ACLs and EAs in a POSIX-compliant fashion.  <i>star</i> has a number
of other advantages over GNU <i>tar</i> as well. (Not the least of which, it
can be forced to read past corrupt headers and recover the rest of the files
from an archive --- a glaring failure of GNU's version which is not present
in the .tar file support in star, cpio, pax, or any other modern utility that
can handle .tar archive files)!
</p>
<h3>Vim:</h3>
<p>
In his next article John sang the praises of <a href="http://www.vim.org/"
>vim</a> over other versions of <i>vi</i>.  While there are still three
camps keeping their torches burning in the <i>vi vs. emacs vs. <b>anything but either</b></i> flamewars, there is no need to fight. <i>De gustibus non est disputandum</i> (there's no accounting for matters of taste).
</p><p>
I personally have been the ultimate heretic in this particular religious war.
While I tend to use <i>vim</i> on systems I administer I often use
<i>XEmacs</i> in <b>viper</b> mode (<tt>M-x viper</tt> brings up a superb
emulation of the <i>vi</i> interface inside of <i>emacs</i> or <i>XEmacs</i>
while still providing access to the many features and modes of the 
<i>emacs</i> environment.
</p><p>
This is a key point that many people don't understand.  <i>emacs</i> is an
applications environment which happens to use text editing as its unifying
interface.  It has mail readers, web browsing, file and directory management
(including remote access and file management), and many programming tools
(especially features for checking files into and back out from several
different back-end revision control systems, and for comparing and merging
different revision).  When you think of emacs as a text applications
environment then you see that the choice of editing modes is less of an
issue.
</p><p>
What people don't understand about <i>vi</i> is that it's made for power
users who are likely to spend a large part of every day editing text files
and scripts on varied and diverse systems.  Thus, systems administrators
use <i>vi</i> and programmers tend to use <i>emacs</i>.
</p><p>
<i>vim</i> is the most powerful version of <i>vi</i> and supports many
extensions and integrates with several scripting languages.  One thing
that's evolved over the years since LG#2 is vim's syntax highlighting. You
can install a minimal version of vim but if you install the full package
and run it from a color-capable console or terminal emulator (such as the
Linux console, <i>xterm</i>, or <i>rxvt</i>) and enable the syntax
highlighting (<tt>:syntax on</tt> from inside it, or edit your <i>.exrc</i>
or <i>.vimrc</i> files) that many of the files you edit are parsed for
patterns and the text is set to various colors for different syntactic
contexts.  For example I'm editing this HTML in vim and all the HTML tags
show up in yellow, while main text is displayed in cyan on black (as set
by the <tt>-fg</tt> and <tt>-bg</tt> options to my <i>xterm</i>.  Inside of
anchor tags the <tt>href=</tt> is in green, the URLs are in red, and the
link text is in underlined purple.  <i>Italics</i> are in inverse video
(black on cyan) while <b>bold</b> is in a brighter (bold) cyan, and so on.
</p><p>
In other types of files the highlighting is set according to the syntax of
your C, shell scripting, Perl or Python, Makefile, or other code or content.
In e-mail and Netnews postings the headers are colorized and "quoted"
excerpts are distinct from your responses.  In some cases *emphasized*
text (that is text enclosed in <tt>*</tt>s is also set to a bold color.
Naturally this is all customizable and extensible.  The package comes with
a <i>.../syntax/</i> directory full of <tt>*.vim</tt> files while are simple
scripts that implement all of the parsing and highlighting.  Yes, you can use
<i>vim</i> to editing these <tt>.vim</tt> files and, of course, they will be
syntax highlighted by the code in the <tt>vim.vim</tt> file which is one of the largest <tt>.vim</tt> in my set.  There are about 400 of these files on my
system &mdash; which is just a typical copy of <a href=
"http://www.knoppix.net/">KNOPPIX</a>.
</p><p>
Of course syntax highlighting is a feature of all modern editors.  In emacs
this would be enabled with the <b>M-x global-font-lock-mode</b> and then
the <b>M-x html-mode</b> for HTML files, and so on.  Of course all of that
magic is hidden in the <tt>.emacs</tt> file or under the <tt>.emacs.d</tt>
directory in an <b>emacs</b> user's home directory.
</p><p>
The question of GUI vs. text mode text editors comes up frequently, too.  
Emacs and XEMacs will detect a <b>DISPLAY</b> environment variable and
automatically come up in a graphical window if possible.  This can be
over-ridden with the <tt>-nw</tt> (no windowing) command line switch.  There's
<tt>gvim</tt> which is a GUI wrapper around <i>vim</i>. Amusingly, <i>vi</i>
started as a curses wrapper around the <i>ex</i> "extension" to the <i>ed</i>
line mode editor; thankfully it's still possible to run <i>vim</i> in <i>ex</i>
mode.  Rarely necessary but still handy when you really need it (i.e. your
terminal emulation and curses support libraries are badly mangled).
</p><p>
In the <b>anything but <i>vi</i> or <i>emacs</i></b> camp I suggest <a href=
"http://www.nedit.org">Nedit</a>.  It's simple enough for the most novice
computer user.  Yet powerful enough
that one needn't outgrow its features.  Nedit is GUI-only (there's no
terminal-mode support).
</p><p>
Personally I still recommend that system administrators still learn <i>vi</i>
because it's been available on every UNIX-like system for thirty years.  As
sysadmins, we are frequently called upon to edit files on new and minimal
systems which might not have any GUI libraries or other editors installed.
I don't go so far as to push people towards proficiency in <i>ex</i>, but
a half hour running through the <b><i>vimtutor</i></b> tutorial (included as
an interactive wrapper script with the <i>vim</i> package) is an investment
that any systems administrator will find rewarding.
</p><p>
He also mentions <a href="http://xcoral.free.fr/">xcoral</a>, and 
<a href="http://www.identicalsoftware.com/xwpe/">xwpe</a> as IDEs (integrated
development environments).  I hadn't heard of them for years, but quick 
<a href="http://www.google.com">Google!</a> searches shows that they're
still actively maintained by their niche communities. 
</p><p>
Of course the new kid on the IDE block now is the 
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> project.  This may eventually
become the mainstream IDE for Linux and other open source operating systems.
However, its fate and future are tied inextricably to those of the
<a href="http://java.sun.com">Java</a> platform even though the tool can be
used in developing any sort of code.  In many ways Eclipse seems to be an
effort by Java developers to "eat their own brand" and to prove to a broader
developer community that a suite of user interface intensive programs written
in Java can offer the performance, stability, and native graphical "feel"
that's comparable to those compiled from C/C++ and other "native" sources.
</p><p>
The differences between full-featured text editors and "integrated 
development environments" have always been somewhat blurred.  
As I've said, <i>emacs</i> is more of an environment (development
and for other uses) while <i>vi</i> and <i>nedit</i> tend to be less
integrated with the rest of the developer's toolchain.  Since they are
powerful, extensible editors with scripting languages built-in (or available
as plug-ins in the case of <i>vim</i>) they can be as integrated with other
tools as anyone cares to make them.
</p>
<h3>PPP Scripts:</h3>
<p>
All I can say about this is: <b>Wow! I'm glad I've got a broadband
connection!</b>  It's not about speed.  I only get 144Kbps over my ISDL
(DSL over ISDN) line.  However, it's always up and running, no waiting
for dialing and connecting; and the latency is lower than any modem ever
was.  Of course many Linux users still need to rely on dial-up and the
old PPP package is still well supported.  Many users would prefer to use
<a href="http://open.nit.ca/wiki/?page=WvDial">wvdial</a> perhaps with
one of its GUI wrappers like <a href="http://www.mtoussaint.de/qtwvdialer.html"
>QtWvDialer</a> or <a href="http://www.lika.de/open/x-wvdial/">X-wvdial</a>,
<a href="http://docs.kde.org/en/3.2/kdenetwork/kppp/">KPPP</a> for 
<a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a>.
</p><p>
A quick <a href="http://freshmeat.net/search/?q=PPP&section=projects">Freshmeat
search: PPP</a> lists over a hundred utilities and packages related to PPP.
Very few people should have to fuss with custom chat scripts any more and the
many other packages can log, generate statistics and help with other aspects
of PPP.  Thankfully, SLIP (serial line IP) is a fading memory (though there
are still 20 packages that mention it at <a href="http://www.freshmeat.net"
>Freshmeat</a>.
</p>
<h3>Pine+popclient:</h3>
<p>
While the <a href="http://freshmeat.net/redir/pine/8102/url_homepage/pine"
>pine</a> mail reader (MUA, mail user agent) is still maintained and available,
many users have switched to <a href="http://www.mutt.org/">mutt</a>.  The
<i>popclient</i> utility seems to have disappeared completely, though the
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/fetchmail/">fetchmail</a> package has taken
up the slack.  Of course there are many GUI mail readers and the needs of
Microsoft Outlook users go beyond simple text mail interfaces.  For them
there is <a href="http://www.ximian.com/products/evolution/"
>Ximian Evolution</a> or any of over a hundred others found on 
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/~rick/">Rick Moen's</a> list of
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Mail/muas.html">MUAs</a>.
</p><p>
Of course all those instructions for building pine from source are generally
unnecessary now. Pine is widely available in RPM format and one can find
<i>apt-get</i>i-able <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> packages 
can be with a <a href="http://www.apt-get.org/search.php?query=pine">search</a>
at <a href="http://www.apt-get.org/">www.apt-get.org</a>.  (This is the
general way of finding unofficial sources for Debian packages; for programs
that aren't quite free enough, or aren't among the 12 thousand packages in
the official Debian archive/mirror system).
</p><p>
On a broader level the big issues in e-mail these days are spam and the
plethora viruses that infest MS Windows networks and flood my inbox with about
a thousand pieces of trash every day.  (That is no exaggeration, I get
1000 slices of spam, virus, or erroneous bounce/error e-mail every day).
Tools like <a href="http://www.spamassassin.org/">spamassassin</a> and
<a href="http://www.clamav.net/">ClamAV</a> only solve about 95% of that
problem for me. Many more tools are available, but deploying and maintaining
them gets harder as you intertwine more of them together.  Your risks of
hitting false positives (blocking legitimate mail) increase as we take more
aggressive anti-spam and anti-virus measures.

</p><p>
For years I just "leaned on the <tt>[d]</tt> key" manually deleting it all.
However, I got the the point where I was sure that I was more likely to
err out of sheer numbed mind exhaustion than any decent anti-spam tools
were out of over-aggressive pattern matching.  So now I can't use e-mail
at home without spamassassin.

</p><p>
The average Linux user is increasingly less likely to run his or her own
mail server.  However, it's a battle that professional sysadmins fight every
day (and mostly lose).  Many users rely on free webmail services such as
those provided by Microsoft at <a href="http://www.hotmail.com">hotmail</a>,
or <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">Yahoo Mail</a> or the exciting new <a 
href="http://gmail.google.com/gmail/help/about.html">Google Mail</a>. 
Also any accounts with <a href="http://www.aol.com">AOL</a>, 
<a href="http://www.msn.com">MSN</a>, or other major ISPs will also include
some spam blocking features.
</p><p>
I'll continue to suffer the pain of managing my own e-mail, but mostly
as an investment in maintaining my skill set for my consulting customers.
Otherwise I'd probably just subscribe to an account with
<a href="http://www.imap-partners.net/">IMAP Partners</a> and outsource
my mail hassles my friends that run it.

</p><h3>Configuring X:</h3><p>

Configuring the X Windowing System is no longer a rite of passage for the
Linux newbie.

</p><p>
Mostly I think we can thank the advent of PCI which makes the automated
identification of video cards and other adapters in a PC or other computer
a simple automated affair.  Automatic detection of a VGA monitor's
capabilities via the <a href="http://www.vesa.org/summary/sumvbeddc11.htm"
>VESA VBE/DDC standards</a> has also helped quite a bit.

</p><p>
But, most of all we can thank the countless thousands of man hours spent by
volunteers, on building databases used by 
<a href="http://john.fremlin.de/programs/linux/read-edid/">
read-edid</a> and similar utilities.  You might never run <i>read-edid</i>
yourself, but the chances are pretty good that your free operating system's
installation and configuration tools used that code to make a formerly
painful "rite of passage" into a simple routine click of the mouse or tap
on your <tt>[Enter]</tt> key.
</p><p>

Of course most of customization hints in John's article are still valid
today.  They're somewhat obscure and generally not necessary for someone
using the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> or <a href=
"http://www.kde.org">KDE</a> environments.  However, today's Linux users
can still customize X and run <a href="http://www.fvwm.org/">fvwm</a> or
<a href="http://www.plig.org/xwinman/vtwm.html">twm</a> for a minimalist and
traditional X-perience.

</p><h3>Customizing X with vgaset:</h3><p>

I don't remember the <i>vgaset</i> utility; I think it was completely
superceded by <a href="http://www.xfree86.org/4.4.0/xvidtune.1.html"
>xvidtune</a>.  We rarely resort to using that these days either.  However,
if you should need to use it be sure to read the <a 
href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/text/XFree86-Video-Timings-HOWTO"
>XFree86 Video Timings HOWTO</a> and the <a href=
"http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/text/XWindow-User-HOWTO">XWindows User HOWTO</a>.


</p><h3>Customizing X with the Xaw3d libs:</h3><p>
Here also used the dreaded "blink" tag (HTML) in his exhortation for
Linux supporters to subscribe to the Linux Journal.  I still think LJ
is the best printed magazine for Linux; but for my money the most important
Linux subscription these days would be <b>online</b> at 
<a href="http://www.lwn.net">LWN</a> (though slackers can still wait a
couple weeks to see all of their content for free).

</p><p>
As for the old Xaw3d libraries, they're just included with every mainstream
distribution and have been for many years.  The most you'd have to do is
run an RPM command to install them when some other package barked about
a missing dependency.  (Of course <i>apt-get</i> would just resolve the
dependency for you, too).  Most of us probably have had it installed on our
desktop machines for years and been blithely unaware of it; as it should be
with libraries, for users.

</p><h3>Conclusion:</h3><p>

Looking over the many links I've included in this retrospective, we see
again that UNIX and Linux programs can stand the test of time. John's
articles didn't include links to many of these projects, and many of those
old links would certainly have been obsolete; but we find that almost all
of those old free packages are still available, and maintained.
</p><p>

Of course there are many new packages, too.  GNOME, KDE, OpenOffice.org,
Abiword, Gnumeric, Evolution, even the ability to run Microsoft Windows
programs via WINE and Crossover-WINE, VMWare among others.
</p><p>

Despite all of those advances, I think the most profound effect of Linux
and the GNU project has little to do with software!
</p><p>

Early in this column I made a couple of literary references.  Perhaps you
followed those links out of curiosity, even if you were familiar with
idioms like "fin de si&egrave;cle" and "swan song."  These lead to <a href=
"http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> a collaborative world-wide
encylopedia.  The whole notion of a free general-topic encycopedia
which is maintained by <em>anyone with a web browser and access to the
Internet</em> was almost unthinkable back in 1995!  Now it is not only a
reality but almost unremarkable!  It has grown over the last five years
to include a quarter of a million articles in English (a half dozen of
which where initially written by me; and about a 100 of which I've
touched at some point or another).  There are other articles in many
other languages and there are sibling projects such as the 
<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wiktionary</a> dictionaries,
for English and many other languages, and 
<a href="http://quote.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikiquote</a> a 
dictionary of famous and notable quotations.
</p><p>

While Wikipedia and it's siblings are probably hosted on Linux (I honestly
don't know), and the <a href="http://meta.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediawiki"
>Mediawiki</a> software package that runs all of these sites is free and
open-source software, relying heavily on <a href="http://www.mysql.com"
>MySQL</a>, one of the two major free SQL RDBMS (relational database
management system) packages &ndash; this is not about the software.  What
is more important is that the information is <em>free</em> and that sites
like Wikipedia are becoming an information utility.
</p><p>

Regardless of the software base for Mediawiki it seems that the philosophy
of <em>freedom</em> and <em>collaboration</em> is the real accomplishment
of the last decade.  Even through the infamous "dot com bomb"  (and the
shallowness that John dismissed with such levity), the social movement of
people contributing their work and knowlege in ways that the enjoy survives and
seems to be thriving.  </p><p>

Another resource that I used extensively is <a href="http://www.google.com"
>Google</a>.  In fact I used Google to find the latest and most authoritative
URL for almost every link I used in this column.

Google is, of course, a commercial entity.  They are a advertising medium,
just like a radio station or your TV broadcasters.  However, they've also
become an indispensable utility on the Internet.  Linux is a key enabling
force for them; primarily for economic rather than technical reasons.  Google
runs over 10,000 (<em>ten thousand</em>) Linux nodes to provide various
aspects of their indexing and searching services.

To me Google is more and more indispensable resource, but Wikipedia is the
more impressive accomplishment.

Meanwhile I continue to see articles that try to depict the Linux movement
as a war against Microsoft in particular and against commercial software
in general.  These are journalists that just don't get it.  Sure, some
participants are motivated by animosity or disgust.  However, more of us
are simply doing our part to build something that we want for ourselves,
and the gyrations of the multi-national behemoths is irrelevant to the degree
that they don't interfere with that.

Jim has been using Linux since kernel version 0.97 or so.  His first
distribution was 
SLS (Soft Landing Systems).  Jim taught
himself Linux while working on the technical support queues at
Symantec's Peter Norton Group.
He started by lurking alt.os.minix and alt.os.linux on USENET
netnews (before the creation of the comp.os.linux.* newsgroups), reading them
just about all day while supporting Norton Utilities, and
for a few hours every night while waiting for the rush-hour traffic to subside.

<P> Jim has also worked in other computer roles, and also as an electrician and
a crane truck operator.  Jim has also worked in many other roles.  He's been a
graveyard dishwasher, a janitor, and a driver of school buses, taxis, pizza
delivery cars, and even did some cross-country, long-haul work.

<P> He grew up in Chicago and has lived in the inner city, the suburbs,
and on farms in the midwest.  In his early teens he lived in Oregon--
Portland, Clackamas, and the forests along
the coast (Brighton).  In his early twenties, he moved to 
the Los Angeles area "for a summer job" (working for his father, and learning
the contruction trades).  

<P> By then, Jim met his true love, Heather, at a 
science-fiction convention.  About a year later they started 
spending time together, and they've now been living together for
over a decade.  First they lived in Eugene, Oregon, for a year, but now they 
live in the Silicon Valley.

<P> Jim and Heather still go to SF cons together.

<P> Jim has continued to be hooked on USENET and technical mailing 
lists.  In 1995 he registered the <A
HREF="http://starshine.org">starshine.org</A> domain as a birthday gift to
Heather (after her nickname and favorite Runequest persona).  He's participated
in an ever changing array of lists and newsgroups.

<P> In 1999 Jim started a book-authoring project (which he completed
after attracting a couple of co-authors).  That book <I>Linux System
Administration</I> (published 2000, New Riders Associates) is not
a rehash of HOWTOs and man pages.  It's intended to give a high-level
view of systems administration, covering topics like 
Requirements Analysis, Recovery Planning, and Capacity Planning.
His book intended to build upon the works of Aeleen Frisch 
(<I>Essential Systems Administration</I>, O-Reilly & Associates) and 
Nemeth, et al (<I>Unix System Administrator's Handbook</I>, Prentice
Hall).

<P> Jim is an active member of a number of Linux and UNIX users' groups 
and has done Linux consulting and training for a number of companies
(Linuxcare) and customers (US Postal Service).  He's also presented
technical sessions at conferences (Linux World Expo, San Jose and 
New York).  

<P> A few years ago, he volunteered to help with misguided technical 
question that were e-mailed to the editorial staff at the Linux
Gazette.  He answered 13 questions the first month.  A couple 
months later, he realized that these questions and his responses had
become a regular column in the Gazette.  

<P> "Darn, that made me pay more attention to what I was saying!  But I
did decide to affect a deliberately curmudgeonly attitude; I didn't
want to sound like the corporate tech support 'weenie' that I was
so experienced at playing.  That's not what Linux was about!"
(<A HREF="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=curmudgeon">
curmudgeon</A> means a crusty, ill-tempered, and usually old man,
according to the 
<A HREF="http://www.m-w.com/">Merriam-Webster OnLine dictionary</A>.
The word hails back to 1577, origin unknown, and originally meant miser.)

<P> Eventually, Heather got involved and took over formatting the column,
and maintaining a script that translates "Jim's e-mail markup hints"
into HTML.  Since then, Jim and Heather have (finally) invited other
generous souls to join them as The Answer Gang.
