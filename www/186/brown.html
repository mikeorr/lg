<h1>Running Encyclopaedia Britannica on Linux</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/brownss.html">Silas Brown</a></b></p>


<p>Encyclopaedia Britannica is a commercial encyclopedia and is
therefore non-free, but old versions of the CDs and DVDs can
often be purchased cheaply in second-hand markets.  Of
particular interest are the 2004 editions, as its publishers
have made available an unofficial <A
HREF="http://support.britannica.com/linux/linux.htm">Linux
support script for 2004 editions of Britannica</A> (the Windows
installer does not yet work on WINE).  If you follow their
instructions, you can expect to see the basic encyclopedia
articles and images, but you might have a more difficult time
with the Webster dictionary entries and some of the
multimedia.</p>

<p>The instructions tell you to download version 1.3.1 of the
Java Runtime Environment, and the script refuses to run on any
other version.  Nowadays we're up to at least version 1.6, and
it can be difficult to find the old 1.3.1 version.  However, if
you edit their script and comment out the version check (at the
time of writing it's on line 112 of
<tt>linux-launch2.0.pl</tt>), you should find that most things
work on newer versions.</p>

<p>You also need to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable.  If
you're not sure, try setting it to <tt>/usr</tt>.  I added
<tt>$ENV{JAVA_HOME} = "/usr";</tt> to the
<tt>linux-launch2.0.pl</tt> file itself, and also deleted the
"Enter location of the Britannica Software" question and
replaced it with a hard-coded location so I can launch it more
quickly.</p>

<h2>Large print</h2>

<p>Unfortunately the preferences dialog doesn't work, and
manually editing the preferences file has limited success when
it comes to adjusting the font size.  It may seem you're stuck
with the default small-sized fonts, and you have to copy and
paste the text elsewhere if you want to read it larger. 
However, if all else fails, you can use VNC for magnification. 
To set this up:</p>

<pre>
sudo apt-get install x11vnc xtightvncviewer vnc4server
vncpasswd   # give yourself a password
cat &gt; .vnc/xstartup &lt;&lt;EOF
#!/bin/bash
x11vnc -display :1 -rfbport 5902 -forever -scale 2:nb &amp;
xsetroot -solid grey
exec $HOME/britannica/linux-launch2.0.pl
EOF
chmod +x .vnc/xstartup
</pre>

<p>and then to run it:</p>

<pre>
vncserver :1 -geometry 700x560 -depth 16  # this is about the minimum dimensions for EB
sleep 2  # allow x11vnc to start
xtightvncviewer :2 -passwd $HOME/.vnc/passwd -geometry 1275x720 # (adjust this for your desktop)
killall Xvnc4
</pre>

<p><tt>xtightvncviewer</tt> tends to have better display-update
logic than straight <tt>xvncviewer</tt>.</p>

<p>One disadvantage of this approach is that you can't copy text
from articles and paste them into other applications that are
outside of the VNC server.  This appears to be a limitation of
<tt>x11vnc</tt>.  If you want to copy text then you'll have to
run Encyclopaedia Britannica without magnification.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>There has been much debate about how Britannica compares with
Wikipedia, and I won't go into that too much.  Suffice to say
that you can't expect <b>any</b> encyclopedia to be absolutely
perfect; after all they are all <b>human</b> creations, just like
software, so you will need to keep your head about you when
using any of them.  Wikipedia tends to be more up-to-date and
covers some areas that Britannica does not, but Britannica tends
to give you more of that "finished product" feeling: you won't
spend your time sifting through work in progress, or finding
articles that look more like the fallout of a heated debate than
something that belongs in the quiet back room of a traditional
reference library.  If you sometimes get tired of the noisier
wiki atmosphere<sup>[clarification needed]</sup> then you might
want to add Britannica to your reading at times.</p>
