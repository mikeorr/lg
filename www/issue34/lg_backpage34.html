<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Steve Adler</H4>
Steve was born in Mexico City and received his education in the U. S.
He has a Ph.D. in Physics from the State University of NY. His
first job was working with a medical imaging group at the University of
Texas medical school, writing software in the development effort to
build a positron emission tomography camera.
Since 1995 he has been a
staff scientist for the physics department at Brookhaven National
Laboratory. He is currently moving out of high energy
physics into nuclear physics by joining the PHENIX experiment at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, where he'll be working on the data
acquisition system.
Besides physics and computing, he engages in roller blading, cycling,
camping and travel.

Larry lives on a small farm
in northern Missouri, where he is currently engaged in building a

<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Bill Bennet</H4>
Bill,
the ComputerHelperGuy, lives in Selkirk, Manitoba, Canada; the "Catfish
Capitol of North America" if not the world. He is on the Internet at
www.chguy.net. He tells us "I have been a PC user since 1983 when I got my start as a
Radio Shack manager. After five years in the trenches, I went into
business for myself. Now happily divorced from reality, I live next to my
Linux box and sell and support GPL distributions of all major Linux
flavours. I was a beta tester for the PC version of Playmaker Football and
I play `pentium-required' games on the i486. I want to help Linux become a
great success in the gaming world, since that will be how Linux will take
over the desktop from DOS." It is hard to believe that his five years of
university was only good for fostering creative writing skills.

Thanks to all our authors, not just the ones above, but also those who wrote
giving us their tips and tricks and making suggestions. Thanks also to our
new mirror sites. Thanks also to Ellen Dahl and Amy Kukuk for their help
with News Bytes.
<P> 
PBS has been showing a mystery series called "Jonathan Creek" that I have
been enjoying quite a bit. The show can be quite intellectually challenging
as each mystery is of the "locked door" variety. No car chases, no sirens, no
explosions -- just a dead body in a locked room with all the accompanying
questions. Quite a lot of fun, actually. 
<P> 
I've never been quite sure why the
makers of American T.V. shows feel that their audience doesn't want or know
how to use their brains.
<P> 
Another interesting difference between American and British entertainment
is the actors. The British don't require that everyone be uniformly
beautiful. It's quite refreshing to see a show where the stars look like
you and your neighbors rather than high-fashion models or movie stars.
<P> 
Have fun!
