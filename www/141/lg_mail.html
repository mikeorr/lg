Hi all

<p>
I finally installed Xen using Synaptic on a fresh installed version of
Ubuntu 7.04 (32-bit). For some reason the earlier efforts did not
succeed <img src="../gx/frown.png" alt=":("> However now I can boot to my custom Xen enabled 2.6.19

</p>

<p>
Is there a problem with the amd-64 version of XEN? Can some one confirm this?

<p>
Hello!
</p>

<p>
So, here's my question about that index problem I mentioned in the
answer to Ben's question about backups.
</p>

<p>
Imagine you have two backups servers. Server A keeps a rather recent
copy of live servers. Server B tries to archive stuff from server A in
order to keep recent backups recent and to save space on server A. Of
course this means that server B keeps accumulating files and
directories. In order to avoid this one could think of a strategy of
deleting files according to a mathematical distribution. There's a tool
called fileprune which does just that
(<a href="http://www.spinellis.gr/sw/unix/fileprune/">http://www.spinellis.gr/sw/unix/fileprune/</a>). I found it by browsing
through an old issue of ;login:. fileprune deletes data by using a
Gaussian, exponential oder Fibonacci distribution. The problem is that
fileprune needs to read the metadata of the entire tree into memory
before it can decide which files to delete. Backup storage may have
millions of files and directories.
</p>

<p>
I'd like to ask the filesystem directly "which files have an access time
of older than X" and get an answer. In the database world you have
indices for that. (Most) filesystems don't have such things (at least
not exported to userspace), so you would have to maintain one for
yourself. This could be done by the Linux kernel's Inotify API which
tells you what changes were done in a specific filesystem tree. I tried
it, it works, but I have no idea if I catch every modification when
rsync or other tools come along (I am going to test this with higher load
as soon as my load is lower).
</p>

<p>
Another way is to see whether existing filesystems have similar
functionality. I believe Reiser4 went into this direction. Yet another
way is to parse the filesystem tree seperately in order to maintain a
metadata index.
</p>

<p>
Do you have some more ideas besides writing a new filesystem?
</p>

<p>
Just being curious,
Ren&eacute;.

I have recently received a Linksys WRT54GS wireless router from a

told me he changed the firmware of the device several times, when he
originally bought it and now he doesn't remember which firmware is
installed.

So how can I figure out which one it is? I tried to connect with

As sometimes happens, shortly - or not so shortly - after we finish a
discussion in TAG, more info about the problem pops up out of nowhere,
usually as a result of a completely unrelated Google search. I
<strong>swear</strong>, if we were to have a discussion about Martian blood-drinking
weasels, next week I'd run into a "The Vampire Mustelids of Ares: A
Personal Interview" while searching for soap-scum removal info...
</p>

<p>
Anyway, Karl-Heinz: while I was fiddling about trying to come up with a
"max-spread" sorting algorithm [1], I ran across a reference to
Parallel::ForkManager on '<a href="http://perlmonks.org">http://perlmonks.org</a>'. Doing a quick lookup on
CPAN came back with this (snipped from the documentation):
</p>

<pre>
This module is intended for use in operations that can be done in
parallel where the number of processes to be forked off should be
limited.  Typical use is a downloader which will be retrieving
hundreds/thousands of files.
 
The code for a downloader would look something like this:
 
[...]
</pre>
This sounds like exactly the kind of thing you were describing. It
allows nicely fine-grained individual control of the child processes,
etc. - take a look!

There's also Parallel::ForkControl -

I was asked to look at a system that had a consistent load average around 5.3 
to 5.5. Now I know very little about how to track down load average issues, 
so I haven't been able to find much. The CPU usage is about 90% idle, so it's 
not CPU bound.
</p>

<p>
I googled for "load average", "high load average" and "diagnose load average" 
and I found very little of use. the one thing I found was that if it's 
processes stuck waiting on I/O "ps ax" should show processes in state "D". 
There are none visible on this box.
</p>

<p>
Do the gang know of any good resources for diagnosing load average issues or 
have any useful tips?

<p>
This is not surprising; a dash is not a valid character in a variable
for Bourne-derived shells.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt;    I have a function get_package_fqdn which starts as below:
&gt; 
&gt;        37  get_package_fqdn()
&gt;        38  {
&gt;        39      eval var=$`echo PKG$1`
&gt;        40      if [[ -z $var ]]; then
&gt;                [...]
&gt;        64      fi
&gt;        65  }
&gt; 
&gt;    we will notice that if $1=sgpkg-cust, var will be equal to "-cust" and the
&gt;    rest of the funcion "if[[ -z $var ]];" will not be used and nothing will
&gt;    be introduced in the PKG$packagename variable.
</pre>

<p>
This isn't shell-specific, but an excellent Perl programmer named
Mark-Jason Dominus has a writeup called "Why it's stupid to use a
variable as a variable name" (<a href="http://perl.plover.com/varvarname.html">http://perl.plover.com/varvarname.html</a>).
The above problem is explicitly cited. In short: since variable names
are restricted to a specific set of characters, and the set of
characters that could be contained in your '$1' is essentially
arbitrary, you're creating a problem when you do that. So don't do that.
</p>

<p>
In Perl, the answer is "use a hash". In Bash, well, you need to rethink
what it is that you're trying to do and use different functionality.  As
a general approach, you could try "flattening" that arbitrary character
set - be sure to do do in both populating <em>and</em> reading the strings:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
package_name=$(echo -n "PKG$1"|tr -c 'a-zA-Z0-9_' '_')
</pre>
<pre class="code">
ben@Tyr:~$ var=$(echo -n "xyzabc@$%^&amp;*()_++sadbjkfjdf" | tr -c 'a-zA-Z0-9_' '_')
ben@Tyr:~$ echo $var
xyzabc____________sadbjkfjdf
</pre>
Do note that this will <em>still</em> break if a "special" Bash character
(e.g., '!') appears in the string. Overall, you just need to rethink
your approach to this problem. MJD is right: it's a bad idea to use a
variable as a variable name.

I have very little experience with it myself, but based on what I do
know, FVWM can probably accomodate you. You would, however, need to
learn to write config files for it. I have no doubt that it has some
kind of a "DetectDesktopSwitch" function, as well as either the
capability of hiding the icons or allowing you to script such a
function.

I was interested to see the discussion in this article on passive ethernet
"hubs" etc. Other maybe interested in this passive 3 port ethernet hub
design...

I've not actually built it yet, but plan to do so soon.

Hey all,
</p>

<p>
As I am sure many of you know, I don't get on with hardware.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
Thanks to Ben's suggestion I now have a USB Sun keyboard though, and
despite people's horrific claims, <strong>I</strong> at least like it.  So thanks,
Ben.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
My next question concerns a possibe replacement for my workstation.
I've had my current PC for about three years now, kindly donated by a
friend of mine.  It's a nice system, but it needs replacing.  I've had
enough of the CPU being at 70C plus, despite cooling attempts.
</p>

<p>
So I was looking at buying a Shuttle PC.  Specifically the SD39P2
which would be a bare-bones system [1].  What I'm curious to know is
whether any of you have used one, and how they stack up against a
regular PC?  My reading suggests they can act as a pretty good desktop
replacements.  Whilst the model I'm looking at only has two PCI slots,
I only really need to add a wireless PCI card and an NVidia graphics
card, so that's perfect.
</p>

<p>
Does the model I'm listing [1] suggest any problems with running Linux
on it?  I can't see how it would at a cursive glance of what's
available.  My only real reservation is what would be the driving
force of me buying this model when I could go to Dell and spend an
equivalent amount of money and get a whole lot more.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
Kindly,
</p>

<p>
Thomas Adam

<h3>Max-spread algorithm</h3>

[ If you're not a programmer or a mathematician, you might want to hit
the 'delete' key right about now. Either that, or risk being bored to
tears. Remember, I warned you! <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> ]
</p>

<p>
As I've just mentioned in my previous post, I've been fiddling with a
"max-spread" algorithm - i.e., if I have two lists, and I want the items
in the first list to be spread as widely as possible (using the items in
the second list as the "padding"), how do I interpolate them?
</p>

<p>
This can also be stated as follows: given a barbecue, a bunch of pork
cubes, and a number of cherry tomatoes, how would you arrange the
skewers in such a way that a) there's a pork chunk at the beginning and
the end of every skewer, b) each skewer is arranged in as even a manner
as possible, and c) you use up all the pork and all the tomatoes?
</p>

<p>
I got most of the way to a solution - essentially reinventing the
Bresenham line algorithm [1] (and the wheel... and fire... sheesh. I'm a
<em>very</em> poor mathematician, and a worse statistician), but got scooped by
a fellow Perl monk from the Monastery (perlmonks.org) - really nice work
on his part. I rewrote his script to actually sort arrays rather than
strings and added some guard conditions. Sample output looks like this:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
ben@Tyr:~/devel/0$ ./skewer 2 2
pork1|tmt1|tmt2|pork2
 
 ---#00#---
 
ben@Tyr:~/devel/0$ ./skewer 3 3
pork1|tmt1|tmt2|pork2|tmt3|pork3
 
 ---#00#0#---
 
ben@Tyr:~/devel/0$ ./skewer 4 4
pork1|tmt1|tmt2|pork2|tmt3|pork3|tmt4|pork4
 
 ---#00#0#0#---
 
ben@Tyr:~/devel/0$ ./skewer 5 4
pork1|tmt1|pork2|tmt2|pork3|tmt3|pork4|tmt4|pork5
 
 ---#0#0#0#0#---
 
ben@Tyr:~/devel/0$ ./skewer 7 4
pork1|tmt1|pork2|tmt2|pork3|tmt3|pork4|tmt4|pork5|pork6|pork7
 
 ---#0#0#0#0###---
</pre>
Can you reproduce this algorithm? <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> I found it a very interesting
exercise, myself.

<h3>Backup software/strategies</h3>

All of us know - at least I hope we do - that we should all be doing
regular backups; that's a given. Chances are, though, that we've all
skipped one or two (or more) on the schedule ("heck, nothin's happened
so far; it shouldn't make too much of a difference...") - that is, if
you even have a schedule, rather than relying on some vague sense of
"it's probably about time..." I have to admit that, as much as I advise
my customers to have a solid backup plan, I'm less than stellar about
having a polished, perfect plan myself.
</p>

<p>
In part, this is because backups are much easier with a desktop than a
laptop - or even with a desktop to which you synch the laptop once in a
while. Operating purely from a laptop, as I do, means that I don't have
an always-connected tape drive (or whatever) - and doing a backup is
always a hassle, involving digging out the external HD, hooking it up,
and synchronizing. Moreover, since I do a lot of travelling, setting an
alarm doesn't seem to be very useful; it usually goes off while I'm on
the road, at which point I can only glare at it in frustration.
</p>

<p>
As with so many things, what I <strong>really</strong> need is a copy of "at" installed
in my brain... but lacking that, well, I decided to dump the problem on
you folks. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
Can anyone here think of a sensible backup plan for the situation that
I've described - laptop, external backup, arbitrary schedule - and some
way to set up a schedule that work with that? Also, does anyone have a
favorite WRT backup software? I really miss the ability to do incremental
backups; that would be awf'lly nice (I don't mind carrying a few DVDs
with me, and using the external HD for a monthly full backup.)
</p>

<p>
Good ideas in this regard - whether they competely answer the question
or not - are highly welcome.

If someone who speaks Deutsch wants to contact the owners of the first

contacted the webmaster of the second domain; hopefully, they'll take
