<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">JC Pollman</H4>
I have been playing with linux since kernel 1.0.59. I spend way too much
time at the keyboard and even let my day job - the military - interfere once in
a while. My biggest concern about linux is the lack of documentation for the
intermediate user. There is already too much beginner's stuff, and the
professional material is often beyond the new enthusiast.

<P>

<P> And now for the inaguration of the <STRONG><I>Linux Gazette</I> Spam Count
</STRONG>.  This month, the <I>Gazette</I> received 284 letters.  Of these,
79 were spam.  October's SPAM COUNT is thus 28%.  

<P> Aside from the usual get-rich-quick schemes, thigh creams, Viagra stuff,
hardware/peripheral ads in Spanish and Japanese [note: the characters all turn
into $##$% symbols in Latin-1], and investment opportunities "accidentally"
sent to the wrong person, the most hilarious piece was:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	We offer Web Hosting for the following server platform: NT 4.0 Running
	IIS4 as low as $9.95/month, paid quarterly or annually, plus a $19.95
	set-up fee.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Did they think this was the <I>NT Gazette</I>?

<P> Doesn't the fact that we already have a web page show that we don't need
web hosting services?

<P> P.S.  They do offer "FrontPage 2000 extensions FREE!!!"  (Yawn.)
