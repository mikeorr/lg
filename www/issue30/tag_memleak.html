 Dear Answer Guy,

<br><br>
 HELP!!!!!!!!!!!

<br><br>
 I really enjoy "The Answer Guy" column, and I hope you can help me with
 this one.  I'm running Linux 2.0.29.  I've been using this version for
 quite a while now.  Up until now everything's been fine.  A couple of
 days ago the problem developed.  What appears to be happening is that
 when programs are run they are not deallocating the memory they used.
 Upon first booting the system there is already almost 9 megs of RAM in
 use.  I've run free to check the memory usage, ran another command, such
 as ls, then ran free again and the free memory decreases.  I've noticed
 that if I run the same command, such as <TT>ls</TT>, again the memory
 usage stays the same.  It's only when commands that haven't been executed
 before are run that the amount of free memory decreases.  It doesn't take long
 before I'm out of memory and have to reboot.  Any suggestions you could
 give me with this problem would be greately appreciated.

<br><br>
 Thanks in advance,
 <br>Kevin Monceaux

	If you suspect a memory leak I highly recommend getting
	a log of your '<TT>free</TT>' or '<TT>vmstat</TT>' output before and
	after a few commands -- several snapshots.

<br><br>
	You can make a <TT>cron</TT> job to mail you a snapshot of this
	every hour or so.  You might want to append the output
	of a <TT>ps</TT> command to each of these e-mail snapshots.

<br><br>
	Unfortunately it isn't as easy to interpret the output of
	these commands as it should be.  It's entirely too easy
	to misinterpret the output fields from them -- since Linux
	normally uses most of the available memory for file
	cache buffers -- and large portions of the shared libraries
	and memory allocated to forked process is shared (the
	memory manager uses "copy-on-write" and other techniques
	to minimize the utilization of physical memory).  This
	makes correlating actual memory usage difficult.

<br><br>
	You can also use '<TT>top</TT>' (which is a curses process viewer).
	It can show you the current state of the system and sort by
	memory (M) or CPU utilization (P).  You want to isolate the
	specific process(es) that is(are) causing the problem.  Don't
	leave '<TT>top</TT>' running unattended, however, since it is a bit of
	a resource hog in its own right.

<br><br>
	If you do isolate this to a particular program you'll want
	to see if there are updates available for it, or for any of
	the libraries it uses.  You may also want to consider getting
	a newer kernel --- such as 2.0.33 or (if it's ready by the
	time you read this: 2.0.34).

<br><br>
	Sorry I can't be more specific --- but you'll have to
	narrow down the problem a bit before we can do more.  Incidentally
	you can start up in single user mode and manually start all of the
	daemons and processes that you normally run your multi-user
	(initdefault) mode.  Do this slowly, one command/daemon at a
	time, to see when the problem first appears.  If it happens
	right away then boot with the -b option to prevent the
	execution of any of your boot up scripts and manually load
	any kernel modules you're using one at a time.
