<h1>Booting a Linux Box via a USB Micro Drive (USB-MD)</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/sevenich.html">Dr. Richard Sevenich</A></b></p>

<h3>Problem to Solve</h3>

<p>
The situation can typically arise at an educational institution or in a
training environment where a general purpose (Linux-based or not) computer
laboratory is set up to allow student users access to a lab machines, but
not super user (root) access. The machines will typically be set up via the
BIOS to boot to the hard drive first, so that the systems cannot be
subverted by inserting a bootable CD ROM or bootable floppy. Of course, a
BIOS password is required in order to change BIOS settings. However, there
will often exist a group, e.g. an advanced operating systems class, where
Linux is required and super user access is essential. It is undesirable to
give this group super user access to the regular system or BIOS password
access.
</p> 

<p>
We would like to at least achieve a set-up where the normal users of the
computer laboratory can conduct business as before while the advanced
users can boot into a separate configuration where they have super user
privileges. We do not want the advanced users to require root access to
the the configuration for normal users, because the advanced users will
be routinely modifying and occasionally breaking the system. In
summary, the goal is that
</p>

<ul>
<li>normal users automatically get a normal system upon boot without super user privileges</li>
<li>advanced users automatically get a hackable system upon boot with super user privileges</li>
</ul>

<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>

<p>
The proposed solution is to be implemented by the system administrator, who
has super user access, knowledge of needed passwords, etc. Once the
solutions are implemented, the system administrator can once again go hide
in his/her cave.  We start by modifying the BIOS to boot the system with a
bootable CD.  For our case study, we chose Xubuntu-6.06.1 as our bootable
CD. The 6.10 version is not yet available at this writing. Xubuntu, not
using KDS or Gnome, presumably has somewhat smaller footprint than the
equivalent Ubuntu or Kubuntu versions. This could be important since our
ultimate installation target is a USB micro drive (USB-MD). It may also run
a bit faster on that hardware target than its more top heavy cousins, which
is also an issue with today's 3600 RPM USB-MD.
</p>

<p>
Our solution assumes that the machine to be used allows booting from the
MBR of the USB-MD when the BIOS is appropriately configured. In this case,
we place a master boot record (MBR) on the USB-MD. The advanced user can
then insert this USB-MD into a laboratory computer and reboot the system
into Xubuntu. A normal user has no such USB-MD and when a reboot is
attempted the system will boot first from the hard drive MBR, hence into
the normal operating system configuration.
</p>

<strong>Some Advantages:</strong>

<ul>
<li>the USB-MD is very portable (e.g. 2"x2"x0.5"), does not require a
separate power supply, and is relatively inexpensive (academic students
would find that the USB-MD price is similar to that of a textbook) </li>

<li>it can be assigned to or purchased by the user who can then use it at
home as well</li>

<li>if the USB-MD is not inserted before booting, the machine boots to the
default hard drive partition - as desired for the more general
population</li>
</ul>

<strong>Some Disadvantages:</strong>
<ul>
<li>the machines in the original computer laboratory are now less secure
because there is a new user class with root access to the machine</li>

<li>although the USB-MD could be used at home, modifications to the
installation may be needed e.g. because the graphics card may differ, the
usb discovery order may differ, etc. Such problems can be surmounted, but
require some expertise </li>
</ul>

<p>
The first disadvantage is ameliorated if the laboratory is a teaching
laboratory holding no sensitive data, essentially just information (e.g.
configuration, applications) that would be inconvenient to reconstruct from
the backup media. Further, if malice is not present, there is little
likelihood that the machines would be compromised. It is assumed, for
example, that the Xubuntu installation on the USB-MD would be configured so
that it would not automatically mount the hard drive partitions at bootup.
So the advanced user would have to overtly violate the laboratory protocol
to compromise the normal system.  The second disadvantage has various
cures. We already mentioned overt modifications such as using a different
/etc/X11/xorg.conf for different target machines. Perhaps more attractive
would be to employ a USB-MD with large enough capacity to create two
Xubuntu installations - one for the laboratory environment and the other
for home use.  Whichever one was booted should also mount the other, for
easy data transfer and backup. Alternatively, the two separate
installations could share a common /home directory in its own partition. At
this writing, for this author's purposes, a 10 GB USB-MD would appear to
fit that purpose nicely. Maybe one will appear at birthday time.
</p>

<h3>Rejected Solutions</h3>

<p>
The bootable CD with a companion USB stick for storage is also a potential
solution, but doesn't work as well for the problem space envisioned. For
example, if kernel recompilation and redeployment is an area of
investigation (e.g. investigating the implementation of new system calls)
or if changing major portions of the root file system are fair game, one
either burns a new CD to try the results or moves more and more of the
system to the USB stick. Because the USB has a more limited capacity, the
USB-MD solution rather naturally evolves.
</p>

<p>
Another possibility is just to make the laboratory machine dual/multi boot,
so it can boot into the 'normal user' Linux or the 'advanced-user' Linux.
There are several serious drawbacks. First, the advanced user cannot change
the USB-MD boot configuration for grub (or lilo) because that resides on
the hard drive and requires super user privileges. Of course, the advanced
user merely needs to boot the USB-MD and mount the hard drive to make such
changes. However, our protocol is to avoid having the advanced user mount
the hard drives, to prevent inadvertent damage. Second, the normal user can
boot into the 'advanced user' Linux. This would likely be unsuccessful, but
is still undesirable.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps yet another solution involves virtualization. This may ultimately
be viable, but the author's current understanding of one such approach, Xen
Virtualization, indicates that within the sandbox of a sub domain the user
may be given super user privileges, but such tasks as kernel recompilation
and redeployment will require super user access at the hypervisor level.
</p>

<h3>Case Study</h3>

<p>
The case study was conducted in the Computer Science department at
Malaspina University-College in Nanaimo, BC, Canada. The Linux box used was
one from a recently configured laboratory. The USB-MD was the property of
the author.
</p> 

<h4>Case Study - Equipment</h4>

<p>
The salient hardware details are these:
</p>

<pre>
Linux box vendor          -&gt;   recent Seanix purchase
BIOS vendor               -&gt;   Intel
BIOS version              -&gt;   NT94510J.86A.3813.2006.0411.1332
USB-MD vendor             -&gt;   T-one
USB-MD capacity           -&gt;   5 GB
</pre>

<h4>Case Study - Installing Xubuntu on the USB-MD</h4>

<p>
The basic steps here are
</p>
<ul>
<li>download the Xubuntu iso</li>

<li>burn the Xubuntu live CD, ensuring that it verifies correctly</li>

<li>boot the machine, where the BIOS has already been configured to boot from CD first</li>

<li>wait for the Xubuntu live CD system to boot completely</li>

<li>insert the USB-MD in a usb slot </li>

<li>wait for the icon to appear, indicating that the USB-MD has been recognized</li>

<li>click on the install icon</li>

<li>carry out installation to the USB-MD (no detailed instructions
here; it is a minor variant of a typical Xubuntu install, which is well
documented elsewhere)</li>

<li>subsequently ensure (with fdisk, menu option 'a') that the boot
flag is set for the USB-MD partition to be booted; the Xubuntu live CD
installation doesn't appear to do this automatically </li>
</ul>

<p>
[Note: Xubuntu should also provide an option to install to the hard drive, which we do not want here.]
</p>

<p>
When the USB-MD installation has completed, choose to reboot the system,
removing the CD at the appropriate time (typically, it will be ejected). At
the very start of reboot, enter the BIOS to ensure that the system will
reboot from the USB-MD first. The reboot may take several tries in order to
get the BIOS settings just right. For the Intel BIOS referenced above, the
choices in the BOOT sub menu were these. Not all are salient, but the
following choices worked:
</p>

<table align="left" width="50%" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>boot Menu Type</td>

    </tr>

      <td>USB-MD<br>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>Boot to Optical Devices</td>

      <td>Disable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>USB Boot</td>
      <td>Enable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>Zip Emulation Type</td>
      <td>Hard Disk</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>Boot USB Devices First</td>
      <td>Enable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>USB Mass Storage<br>
          Emulation Type</td>
      <td>All Fixed Disk</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br clear="all" />

<p>
Different BIOS vendors will provide different choices and wording, but the
above gives the idea.
</p>

<p>
The file /boot/grub/menu.lst installed by Xubuntu on the USB-MD for booting
the Seanix machine was as follows (except for editing of the title line):
</p>

<pre class="code">
title             Xubuntu 6.06.1 on USB_MD
root              (hd0,0)
kernel            /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.15-26-386 root=/dev/sdb1 ro quiet splash
initrd            /boot/initrd.img-2.6.15-26-386
savedefault
boot
</pre>

<p>
The Seanix hard drive (scsi) was seen as /dev/sda. It was also
recognized first in the BIOS bootup, whether or not the hard drive MBR
was chosen to boot Linux. This could then be used to boot up into the
USB-MD via the MBR on the USB-MD.
</p>

<h4>Case Study - Modifying Xubuntu on the USB-MD for a home system</h4>

<p>
The author's home machine already had a version of Kubuntu (one of
Xubuntu's heavier cousins) installed. It differs from the laboratory
Seanix machines in these important aspects:
</p>

<ul>
<li>cannot boot from the MBR of the USB-MD</li>

<li>has a different graphics card</li>

<li>first sees the USB-MD as /dev/sda1 rather than /dev/sdb1 (as seen by the Seanix)</li>
</ul>

<p>
These differences needed to be addressed and were dealt with as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>the existing /boot/grub/menu.lst on the hard drive was modified to include a boot stanza for the USB-MD </li>

<li>the /etc/X11/xorg.conf on the USB-MD was replaced with a copy of that from the home machine's /etc/X11/xorg.conf</li>

<li>the modified  /boot/grub/menu.lst on the hard drive refers to the USB-MD as (hd1,0) or, equivalently, /dev/sda1</li>
</ul>

<p>
The new stanza for the USB-MD interjected into the /boot/grub/menu.lst on the hard drive was:
</p>

<pre class="code">
title             Xubuntu 6.06.1 on USB_MD
root              (hd1,0)
kernel            /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.15-26-386 root=/dev/sda1 ro quiet splash
initrd            /boot/initrd.img-2.6.15-26-386
savedefault
boot
</pre>

<p>
With this new stanza and the proper replacement for /etc/X11/xorg.conf,
the USB-MD could be booted from the home machine. Note that this is the
dual/boot solution rejected earlier for the laboratory machines.
However, we assume that the home machine does not need to protect
different user groups from each other.
</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
The bootable USB-MD is an acceptable solution where general purpose labs
can provide convenient access to
</p>

<ul>
<li>normal users, without granting super user privileges</li>

<li>advanced users, granting super user privileges </li>
</ul>

<p>
while keeping a hardware separation between the two groups. Once the
system is implemented, it requires virtually no extra care or feeding
by the system administrator.
</p> 

<p>
The solution does compromise security somewhat, which is acceptable for
the typical general purpose teaching/training laboratory where sensitive
data are not stored and where the advanced user is trustworthy.
