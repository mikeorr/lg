Hi,
Just want to shout out that the puzzle is great!
I'd been a long time reader of linuxgazette (since 2001 I guess)
although I lost interest in linuxgazette for a while (maybe because
I'm no longer a linux newbie). Now I'm really looking for the next
issue :D
I noticed that the september's puzzle is harder than the august's. But
I won't complain just because I couldn't complete the puzzle myself. I
think puzzles are good for newbies too to examine what they learned
and find some fun of it. For that, we need easier puzzles with common
acronyms such as gnome, kde, and other common commands. So if you have
enough manpower, two puzzles in an issue would be great (one for geeks
and one for newbies).
Cheers,
<pre>--

Thanks, Duy - that's very nice to hear!

Not intentionally - although on reviewing the two, you're probably
right.

Well... at the moment, I'm the manpower. I would happily welcome any
reader submissions - in fact, if someone sends me a reasonable puzzle
layout, I'll happily come up with some twisted clues for it. I'm sure
that there are aspiring puzzle editors out there - they're more than
welcome to send them in. I can promise everlasting fame... well, at
least LG author credit, anyway. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Thanks for your note.
