<h2>News in General</h2>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Linux Foundation Updates Linux Development Study</h3>
 
<p>The Linux Foundation is publishing an update to its April 2008 study 
on Linux kernel development. The new report reveals trends in Linux 
development, and hints at topics for an upcoming LinuxCon kernel panel in 
September.</p>

<p>The new report is written by original authors and kernel developers
Jonathan Corbet and Greg Kroah-Hartman, and the Linux Foundation's Amanda
McPherson. The August 2009 Update reprises the title "Linux Kernel
Development: How Fast it is Going, Who is Doing It, What are They Doing,
and Who is Sponsoring It" and is available at  <a
href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/publications/whowriteslinux.pdf">http://www.linuxfoundation.org/publications/whowriteslinux.pdf</a>.
</p>

<p>The updated study shows a ten-percent increase in the number of 
developers contributing to each kernel release since April 2008, and 
that a net of 2.7 million lines of code have been added. This also 
means an average of 5.45 patches being accepted per hour, up over 
40 percent since the original study. Some of the accelerated pace is 
related to new demand for Linux in emerging markets, such as netbooks, 
auto, and energy, as well as the new linux-next tree for the next kernel 
cycle that scales up the development process. </p>

<p>Highlights in the report show that every Linux kernel is developed by
nearly 1,000 developers working for more than 200 different corporations;
Red Hat, Google, Novell, Intel, and IBM top the list of companies 
employing developers; an average of 10,923 lines of code are added a day, a
rate of change larger than that of any other public software project.</p>

<p>Corbet and Kroah-Hartman will participate on a panel at LinuxCon (<a
href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon/">http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon/</a>)
focused on the kernel development process, and explore some of the trends
that surfaced in the new study. Linux creator Linus Torvalds and kernel
community members James Bottomley, Arjan van de Ven, and Chris Wright will
join them on the LinuxCon keynote panel on Monday, September 21.</p>

<p>Corbet and Kroah-Hartman, also members of the Linux Foundation's 
Technical Advisory Board (TAB), reviewed the last six kernel releases, 
from 2.6.24 through 2.6.30, representing about 500 days of Linux 
development. The report goes into detail on how the Linux development 
process works, including who is contributing, how often, and why.</p>

<p>Jonathan Corbet is also the editor of Linux information source LWN.net
(<a href="http://www.lwn.net/">http://www.lwn.net/</a>), and maintains the
Linux Foundation's Linux Weather Forecast (<a
href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/lwf/">http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/lwf/</a>).</p>

<p>Greg Kroah-Hartman is a Novell Fellow, working for the SUSE Labs
division of the company. He is also the Linux kernel maintainer for the
USB, driver core, debugfs, kref, kobject, and sysfs kernel subsystems,
and leads the Linux Driver Project: <a
href="http://www.linuxdriverproject.org">http://www.linuxdriverproject.org/</a>.</p>

<p>Amanda McPherson is vice president of marketing and developer programs
at the Linux Foundation, and leads its community relations and event
activities. </p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Coalition to Promote
Benefits of Open Source Software in Government</h3>

<p>During July, a broad cross-section of more than 70 companies, academic 
institutions, community groups, and individuals joined together to 
announce the formation of Open Source for America, an organization 
that will be a unified voice for the use of open source software in 
the U.S. Federal government arena. To learn more about the coalition, 
visit <a href="http://www.opensourceforamerica.org/">http://www.opensourceforamerica.org/</a>.</p>

<p>Gartner recently estimated that, by 2011, more than 25 percent of government
vertical, domain-specific applications will either be open source, contain
open source application components, or be developed as community
source.</p>

<p>The mission of Open Source for America is to serve as an advocate and 
encourage broader U.S. Federal government participation in free and open
source software. Specifically, Open Source for America will help effect
change in policies and practices to allow the Federal government to better
use these technologies, help coordinate these communities to
collaborate with the Federal government on technology requirements, and
raise awareness and create understanding among Federal government leaders
about the values and implications of open source software.</p>

<p>The diverse Board of Advisors of Open Source for America includes 
respected leaders such as Roger Burkhardt, Rishab Ghosh, Marv 
Langston, Chris Lundburg, Dawn Meyerriecks, Eben Moglen, Arthur L. 
Money, Tim O'Reilly, Stormy Peters, Simon Phipps, Mark Shuttleworth,

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Google Announces Plan for New Linux-based Chrome OS</h3>

<p>In July, Google informed readers of its corporate blog that it was 
working on a new, light-weight operating system to support a new Web 
application platform for PCs and mid-range Internet devices.  This 
will be based on the Linux kernel, but will have a new windowing 
sub-system. Since it was designed to work with the Chrome Web browser, 
Google referred to its planned OS as the Chrome OS.</p>

<blockquote>"Google Chrome OS is an open source, lightweight operating system that 
will initially be targeted at netbooks. Later this year, we will 
open-source its code, and netbooks running Google Chrome OS will be 
available for consumers in the second half of 2010."</blockquote>

<p>The blog entry goes on to draw some distinctions with its on-going 
Android OS project for smart phones:  "Google Chrome OS is a new 
project, separate from Android. Android was designed from the 
beginning to work across a variety of devices from phones to set-top 
boxes to netbooks. Google Chrome OS is being created for people who 
spend most of their time on the Web, and is being designed to power 
computers ranging from small netbooks to full-size desktop systems."</p>

<p>The goals for the new operating systems are speed, simplicity, and 
security as well as expanding the power of Web applications.  A fast 
boot of only a few seconds is another design goal.</p>

<p>A few weeks earlier at the O'Reilly Velocity Conference, Google VP of 
Search Product and User Experience Marissa Mayer spoke at a keynote 
and announced Google initiatives to improve the performance of both 
Web pages and Web applications. These included the public release of 
new performance measuring tools such as PageSpeed and the Google 
"Speed" Web site, which will feature discussions and tech talks on 
performance issues.  See <a href="http://code.google.com/speed/">http://code.google.com/speed/</a>.</p>

<p>In her keynote, Mayer said that Google would continue to work on 
improving performance at the page design level, the browser level, and 
the server level.  Chrome OS is clearly part of that effort as well.</p>

<p>In June, Google created a Web site focused on making Web applications, 
sites, and browsers faster. The developer site supports Google's 
decision to share its best practices with tutorials, tips, and 
performance tools.  Google hopes to make the Web faster by aiding 
developers interested in Web application performance.</p>

<p>Google made the announcement at the June O'Reilly Media's Velocity 
conference in San Jose, California, an event focused on Web 
performance.  Featured in several Google-sponsored presentations, the 
Web site offers new performance tools such as Page Speed, an augmented 
version of YSlow to analyze the interaction between Web browsers and 
Web servers.</p>

<p>Back in December, Google announced its Native Client Code project, 
which aims to create a secure framework for running native code over 
the Web. The goal here is to develop "...a technology that seeks to 
give Web developers the opportunity to make safer and more dynamic 
applications that can run on any OS and any browser." One aspect of 
this is to use reliable disassembly, and a code validator to determine 
if any executable includes unsafe x86 instructions. See: 
<a href="http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2008/12/native-client-technology-for-running.html">http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2008/12/native-client-technology-for-running.html</a></p>

<p>According to Amanda McPherson, VP of Marketing and Developer Programs 
at The Linux Foundation,   "...Google's Native Application Project 
will be a key part of this OS," which will result in making "...more 
of the computing power of the device than through the normal 
app/browser paradigms of today."   She adds that this approach can 
minimize the current advantages of (Windows) native applications and 
"...should grow the stable of applications for Chrome, and every other 
Web browser who makes use of this technology."</p>

<p>She sees the Google model as providing better performance and boot 
times on devices that are cheaper to make and don't carry the 
Microsoft OS tax.  Her blog entry is available here:  
<a href="http://www.linux-foundation.org/weblogs/amanda/2009/07/09/what-is-googles-goal-with-its-chrome-os/">http://www.linux-foundation.org/weblogs/amanda/2009/07/09/what-is-googles-goal-with-its-chrome-os/</a></p>

<p>In his blog posting on the day of the announcement, Jim Zemlin, 
executive director of the Linux Foundation, wrote that this is a 
victory for Linux and its community development model: "We look 
forward to seeing Google collaborate closely with the Linux community 
and industry to enhance Linux as the foundation for this new computing 
model."</p>

In its Chrome OS FAQ, Google mentions that it is working with Acer, 
Adobe, ASUS, Freescale, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, Qualcomm, 
Texas Instruments, and Toshiba, among others.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Gartner, IDC Report PC Market Down Less than 5%</h3>

<p>The PC market fell less than expected in the last quarter, according to 
research firms Gartner and IDC.  Both firms released numbers in 
mid-July showing the global PC market fell less than the 6.3-9.8 
percent decline expected. Gartner said the market slipped 5 
percent, while IDC said the market fell only 3.1 percent.</p>

<p>In terms of market share, Hewlett-Packard grew its lead as the #1 PC 
vendor with almost 20% of the market, while Dell slipped further to 
about a 14% share. Acer was #3 with a 12.7% market share.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Sandia Labs boots one million Linux virtual machines</h3>

<p>Computer scientists at Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore, 
California, have successfully run more than a million Linux kernels as 
virtual machines.</p>

<p>The achievement will allow cyber-security researchers to model 
behavior found in malicious botnets, or networks of infected machines 
on the scale of a million nodes. </p>

<p>Sandia scientists used virtual machine (VM) technology and the power 
of its Thunderbird supercomputing cluster for the demonstration.</p>

<p>Running a high volume of VMs on one supercomputer - at a similar scale 
as a botnet - allows cyber-researchers to watch how botnets work and 
explore ways to stop them. </p>

<p>Previously, researchers had only been able to run up to 20,000 kernels 
concurrently. (A "kernel" is the central component of most computer 
operating systems.) The more kernels that can be run at once, he said, 
the more effective cyber-security professionals can be in combating 
the global botnet problem. "Eventually, we would like to be able to 
emulate the computer network of a small nation, or even one as large 
as the United States, in order to 'virtualize' and monitor a
cyber-attack," he said.</p>

<p>A related use for tens of millions of operating systems, Sandia's 
researchers suggest, is to construct high-fidelity models of parts of 
the Internet.</p>

<p>"The sheer size of the Internet makes it very difficult to understand 
in even a limited way," said Sandia computer scientist Ron Minnich.
"Many phenomena occurring on the Internet are poorly understood, because
we lack the ability to model it adequately. By running actual operating
system instances to represent nodes on the Internet, we will be able not
just to simulate the functioning of the Internet at the network level,
but to emulate Internet functionality."</p>

<p>The Sandia research, two years in the making, was funded by the 
Department of Energy's Office of Science, the National Nuclear 
Security Administration's (NNSA) Advanced Simulation and Computing 
(ASC) program and by Sandia itself.</p>

<p>To complete the project, Sandia used its Albuquerque-based 
4,480-node Dell high-performance computer cluster, known as 
Thunderbird. To arrive at the one million Linux kernel figure, 
Sandia's researchers ran 250 VMs on each of the 4,480 physical 
machines on Thunderbird. Dell and IBM both made key technical 
contributions to the experiments, as did a team at Sandia's 
Albuquerque site that maintains Thunderbird and prepared it for the 
project.</p>

<p>The capability to run a high number of operating system instances 
inside of virtual machines on a high performance computing (HPC) 
cluster can also be used to model even larger HPC machines with 
millions to tens of millions of nodes that will be developed in the 
future, said Minnich. The successful Sandia demonstration, he asserts, 
means that development of operating systems, configuration and 
management tools, and even software for scientific computation can 
begin now before the hardware technology to build such machines is 
mature.</p>

<p>"It has been estimated that we will need 100 million CPUs (central 
processing units) by 2018 in order to build a computer that will run 
at the speeds we want," said Minnich. "This approach we've 
demonstrated is a good way to get us started on finding ways to 
program a machine with that many CPUs." Continued research, he said, 
will help computer scientists to come up with ways to manage and 
control such vast quantities, "so that when we have a computer with 
100 million CPUs we can actually use it."</p>

<p>Ultra-large clusters can be used for modeling climate change, 
developing new medicines, and research into the efficient production 
of energy.  "Development of this software will take years, and the 
scientific community cannot afford to wait to begin the process until 
the hardware is ready," said Minnich. </p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Bing Trims Yahoo's Search Share, not Google's</h3>

<p>On the search front, in spite of its multi-million dollar advertising 
campaign and positive critical reviews, the new search engine "Bing" 
hardly moved the dial on search statistics. According to a report from 
comScore.com, in June Google held steady at 65% of searches. Microsoft 
sites rose from 8% to 8.4%, while Yahoo sites fell from 20.1% to 
19.6%.</p>

<p>In a related conference call, Google told the press that it sees users 
writing longer and more sophisticated search queries. That may account 
for Google's stable statistics. Google is trying to respond with new 
options and more specialized search domains.</p>

<p>Americans conducted 14 billion searches in June, down slightly from 
May. Google Sites accounted for 9.1 billion searches, followed by 
Yahoo! Sites (2.8 billion), Microsoft Sites (1.2 billion), Ask Network 
(552 million) and AOL LLC (439 million).  Facebook.com experienced the 
highest growth of the top ten expanded search properties with a 9% 
increase.</p>

<h2>Software and Product News</h2>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Canonical releases source code for Launchpad</h3>

<p>In July, Canonical, founder of the Ubuntu project, announced it had
open-sourced the code that runs Launchpad, the software development and
collaboration platform used by tens of thousands of developers. Launchpad
is used to build Ubuntu and other FOSS projects.</p>

<p>Launchpad allows developers to host and share code from many different 
sources using the Bazaar version control system, which is integrated 
into Launchpad. Translators can collaborate on translations across 
many different projects. End-users identify bugs affecting one or more 
projects so that developers can then triage and resolve those bugs. 
Contributors can write, propose, and manage software specifications. 
In addition, Launchpad enables people to support each other's efforts 
across different project hosting services, both through its Web 
interface and its APIs.</p>

<p>"Launchpad accelerates collaboration between open source projects," said
Canonical founder and CEO Mark Shuttleworth. "Collaboration is the engine
of innovation in free software development, and Launchpad supports one of
the key strengths of free software compared with the traditional
proprietary development process. Projects that are hosted on Launchpad are
immediately connected to every other project hosted there in a way that
makes it easy to collaborate on code, translations, bug fixes, and feature
design across project boundaries.  Rather than hosting individual projects,
we host a massive and connected community that collaborates together across
many projects.  Making Launchpad itself open source gives users the ability
to improve the service they use every day."</p>

<p>"Since the Drizzle project's start in April 2008, its community and 
contributors have used Launchpad as a platform for managing code and 
development tasks, and as an efficient method of communication between 
community members regarding bugs, workflow, code reviews, and more." 
said Jay Pipes, Core Developer on the Drizzle Project at Sun 
Microsystems. "Launchpad makes it easy to take all the disparate 
pieces of software development - bug reporting, source control, task 
management, and code reviews - and glue them together with an 
easy-to-use interface that emphasizes public and open community 
discourse."</p>

<p>Launchpad hosts open source projects for free, but closed source 
projects use the service for a fee. This means that projects can 
use the features that Launchpad provides but do not need to share 
code if that is not desirable. The privacy features are currently in 
beta, and will be added to the commercial service as they become 
available.</p>

<p>Technical details about the open-sourcing can be found at 
<a href="https://dev.launchpad.net/">https://dev.launchpad.net/</a>.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Penguin Computing Launches HPC in the Cloud</h3>

<p>Penguin Computing announced the availability of "Penguin on Demand" - 
or POD - a new service that delivers high performance computing (HPC) 
in the cloud. POD is targeted at researchers, scientists, and engineers 
who require surge capacity for time-critical analyses.</p>

<p>"The most popular cloud infrastructures today, such as Amazon EC2, are 
not optimized for the high performance parallel computing often 
required in the research and simulation sciences," said Charles 
Wuischpard, CEO at Penguin Computing. "POD delivers immediate access 
to high-density HPC computing, a resource that is difficult or 
impossible for many users to utilize in a timely and cost-effective 
way."</p>

<p>POD provides a computing infrastructure of highly optimized Linux 
clusters with specialized hardware interconnects.  Rather than 
using machine virtualization, as is typical in traditional cloud 
computing, POD allows users to access a server's full resources and 
I/O at one time for maximum performance and massive HPC workloads.</p>

<p>Based on high-density Xeon-based compute nodes coupled with high-speed
storage, POD provides a persistent compute environment that runs on a head
node and executes directly on compute nodes' physical cores.  Both GigE
and DDR high-performance Infiniband network fabrics are available. POD
customers also get GPU supercomputing with Nvidia Tesla processor
technology. Jobs typically run over a localized network topology to
maximize inter-process communication, to maximize bandwidth, and to
minimize latency.</p>

<p>Penguin Computing offers support and services for POD customers,
including application set-up, creation of the HPC computing environment,
ongoing maintenance, data exchange services, and application tuning. In
addition, POD includes persistent storage for local data and user-defined
compute environments. </p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">PlateSpin Migrate Supports P-to-V Migrations for Solaris</h3>

<p>In July, Novell announced the addition of physical-to-virtual migration
support for Sun's Solaris 10 operating system in the latest version of
PlateSpin Migrate, their workload management product to move workloads
anywhere to anywhere: between physical, image, virtual, and cloud
environments. </p>

<p>PlateSpin Migrate 8.1 offers workload migration product support for 
Solaris Containers, giving customers the ability to migrate workloads 
from physical to virtual environments. The latest version of PlateSpin 
Migrate significantly expands the already broad list of platforms 
supported for physical to virtual migration, by adding support for the 
recently released SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 from Novell to the existing 
support for prior versions of SUSE Linux Enterprise. PlateSpin Migrate 
8.1 also adds support for Windows 2008 and Windows Vista. </p>

<p>"We expect PlateSpin Migrate 8.1 to make it even easier for customers to
take advantage of the power and versatility of Solaris Containers," said
Jim McHugh, vice president of Data Center Software Marketing at Sun. "Using
PlateSpin Migrate 8.1 to perform physical-to-virtual migration will also
help minimize the risk of introducing errors into new configurations and
speed the completion of virtualization projects." </p>

<p>PlateSpin Migrate 8.1 makes it easy to migrate workloads between
physical servers, image archives and virtual hosts. PlateSpin Migrate also
offers performance improvements for business-critical workload migrations,
making increased use of block-based transfer technology that transfers
only the portion of the file that has changed. This innovation limits the
amount of downtime during the migration process, and improves migration
performance, especially over slower and expensive WAN connections.</p>

<p>PlateSpin Migrate 8.1 is available now. The Windows/Linux version is 
priced at $289 for a workload license. PlateSpin Migrate for UNIX is 
priced at $1,495 for a one-time license. For more information about 
this announcement, see <a href="http://www.platespin.com/products/migrate/">http://www.platespin.com/products/migrate/</a>.</p>
