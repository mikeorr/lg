<h1>Pixie Chronicles: Part 2 Bootable Linux</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/grebler.html">Henry Grebler</a></b></p>


<h3>The Story So Far</h3>

<p>
In Part 1, I said that my project was to build a server. However I
glossed over many details. In this part, I propose to examine those
details more closely. I also raised a problem, which I left hanging.
I'll get back to it a bit later.
</p>

<p>
By the end of this set of articles, you should have enough information
to perform your own PXE network install.
</p>

<p>
Now Read On ...
</p>

<h3>Gathering Information</h3>

<p>
Before I install anything, I like to get some idea of what is on the
machine. Does it have enough memory? How big is the hard drive? Will
Linux recognise all the hardware? For this task, nothing could be
better than a Linux which can run off a CD. I have a couple of
versions of Knoppix, a couple of versions of Ubuntu and a Fedora which
fit this bill quite nicely. I'm sure there are others.
</p>

<p>
My preference is for Knoppix. It has one nice capability that does not
seem to be available on Ubuntu: once the machine has booted from the
CD, it is a simple task to configure networking and then start
<tt>sshd</tt> (the SSH daemon). I can then return to my desktop,
<tt>ssh</tt> into the target machine and do everything from the
comfort of "home". "Home" has my favourite keyboard, mouse and screen.
When the target machine is rolled out, I will probably choose to run
it headless, keyboardless and mouseless. However while it is being
built, I connect the smallest, oldest screen, keyboard and mouse I
have lying around They work, but they are not comfortable.
</p>

<p>
I had been given a machine with a single NIC. I inserted a second, a
spare which I'd bought at a swap meet and which was lying around
waiting to be useful.
</p>

<p>
For the network install, I would need the <A
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address">MAC address</A> (aka
Ethernet address) of at least one NIC, preferably both. This is
exactly the sort of information that one can easily get if one first
boots a standalone system from CD.
</p>

<p>

There are other uses for bootable Linux (or Live Linux CD). Some
friends and I have developed a very powerful mechanism for cleaning
viruses from Windows machines. When a machine is infected so badly
that the viruses take control before Windows, a bootable Linux CD and
a USB drive can save the day.
</p>

<h3>Investigation</h3>

<p>
And now for the use which is the point of this part. Part 1 ended with
the discovery that I had installed Fedora 10, the target machine had
then rebooted and restarted the install. It had stopped waiting for
clarification about partitioning.
</p>

<p>
Ok, so what state was my target machine in?
</p>

<p>
I booted off the Knoppix CD to look around. What was on the hard
drive? Hmm, nothing. That's a bit disappointing. What about all the
software that I had seen it install? Actually, it was less nothing
than that. The partitioning information had disappeared!
</p>

<p>
I remembered something that had been in the kickstart file. Or thought
I remembered. I decided to check.
</p>

<p>
Here is a <i>huge</i> advantage of using kickstart as opposed to
interactive install. If there is doubt about what responses were
given at install time, with an interactive install one can only rely
on one's memory. And in some cases, only on someone else's memory. I
have oodles of proof that my memory is fallible; and also that many
people have merely human memory. Even if one is assiduous, as I often
am, and one writes down one's responses, that only makes the situation
better; it's still not perfect. But the kickstart file can always be
examined to confirm or disprove a suspicion.
</p>

<p>
I looked at the kickstart file. There was an interesting line:
</p>

<pre class="code">
	clearpart --all --initlabel
</pre>

<p>
Clearly, I hadn't been paying enough attention when I was constructing
the kickstart file. (I'll have more to say about this at another
time.) The line requests that <i>all</i> disks have their partition
tables removed and their labels reinitialised.
</p>

<p>
<i>All</i>?!
</p>

<p>
[Uneasy feeling.] Surely not <i>ALL</i>?! Surely only real hard drives.
</p>

<h3>It's Worse Than I Thought</h3>


<p>
To make my life more comfortable, when I boot off the Knoppix CD, I
usually insert my USB stick as well. Apart from the antivirus stuff,
the USB stick has my environment - my aliases, functions and scripts.
These are my equivalent of a tradesman's tools of trade. With a couple
of commands, I can recreate my personal environment. It also helps to
shield me from the variations between different Unix and Linux systems:
I have created a sort of HAL - Henry Abstraction Layer.
</p>

<p>
I examined my USB stick. All gone! The install had cleared its
partition table. On reflection, that probably occurred on the first
cycle through the install process, and was repeated on the second. A
subtle but hardly comforting distinction.
</p>

<p>
In addition to losing the install, I had lost all the information on
my USB stick!
</p>

<p>
If you've been paying attention, you might have guessed that all is
not lost. In Part 1 I said, "... it's important to be able to recover
from mistakes."
</p>

<p>
Fortunately I am a wizard of not inconsiderable power and I was able
to recreate the partition table on the USB stick.
</p>

<h3>Analysis</h3>

<p>
I was also able to restore the install on the hard drive. But that's
not where I want to go right now. I want to pick up on the last point
of Part 1.
</p>

<p>
I implied that just changing the kickstart file to not reboot at the
end of the install was short-sighted. Here's why.
</p>

<p>
Making that change certainly stops problems at the end of the install.
But what happens if I turn off the machine for whatever reason and
then turn it back on again? You might say that if I behaved like that
I would be foolish and would deserve what I got. True. But, what if I
turned off the machine and someone else turned it on? I need a robust
solution.
</p>

<p>
Ideally, there ought to be a way to perform the PXE boot just once.
I'm not aware of such a mechanism on my hardware. When one configures
a boot sequence in a BIOS, one usually sets CD before hard drive. If a
bootable CD is in the drive, the machine boots from CD. If not, it
boots from hard drive. And it's true that if there is no network, the
machine will give up on a PXE boot and try the CD and hard drive. But
that doesn't help me. I need the network there for the network
install. I would then have to remember to remove the network before
the next reboot. I have not solved the problem.
</p>

<p>
For my purposes, it would be nice if the PXE boot mechanism required
that the user press a key while the machine was booting. So, when I
first turned on the machine, I would hold the key down and the PXE
boot would take over. Once the PXE sequence had started, I would stop
pressing the key. Now if the machine reboots at the end of the
install, or it is switched on in the usual way, the PXE boot is
bypassed.
</p>

<p>
Dream on. I needed to look elsewhere. I talked to a colleague, Ian,
who pointed me in the right direction.
</p>

<p>
During the PXE boot, the machine downloads the installation
environment and a PXELINUX config file (which is very similar to a
GRUB config file). The PXELINUX config file can be set to simply
proceed; alternatively it can be set to offer the user a number of
choices for how to boot.
</p>

<p>
After some judicious editing, my PXELINUX config file now achieves a
very serviceable compromise. When invoked it presents a <tt>boot:</tt>
prompt. If the user types <strong>b2</strong> (the name of this
machine) within 10 seconds, the kickstart install process is invoked.
There are some other nice options but I'll defer discussing those.
</p>

<p>
If the user presses <tt>Enter</tt> or 10 seconds elapse with no user
input, the machine boots from local hard disk. Now it doesn't matter
how the machine is turned on: the default condition is to boot from
local hard drive. I have to be at the keyboard to start the kickstart
process, but I'm there anyway to turn on the machine. I have to wait
for perhaps a minute for the PXE boot to finish and the <tt>boot:</tt>
prompt to appear. I then enter <strong>b2</strong> to start the
kickstart install - and then I can leave. The rest of the install will
be automatic. If I've requested a reboot at the end of the install,
the machine will perform the PXE boot from the network and after 10
seconds boot off the hard drive. All boxes ticked.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, when I'm satisfied that the machine is set up how I want
it, I can get into the BIOS and turn off the PXE boot.
</p>

<h3>Lessons</h3>

<p>
Amongst its many advantages, a kickstart file provides an audit trail
and reproducibility. It also allows for convenient change management.
</p>

<p>
One can always keep track of changes using documentation, but it
requires more discipline and is more error-prone.
</p>

<p>

Look for robust solutions.
</p>

<p>

Consider many scenarios, not just the one which presented the problem.
