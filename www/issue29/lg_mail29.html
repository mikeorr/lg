I'd be tickled pink if one of your writers/Linux gurus would take a peek
at the new 3D development package called Blender and write about it.

It's still in beta, but appears to be a sharp product and will appeal to

Hi.  I recently bought a Tyan Turbo AT S1571 motherboard to run my Red
Hat Linux www server on.  The keyboard freaks out when I attempt to
install Linux.  No BIOS update is available.  Do you have any
suggestions as to what motherboard/chip set combinations work well with
Linux?  I have searched and found only generic information, I'm looking
for something a bit more specific.  Intel, ABit, Asus, DFI,
SuperMicro???  I'm planning on using a 233MHz MMX Pentium.

I have just bought a Microsoft Intellimouse, because I thought it was a
good choice if you must use Windows and can use Linux.
The Mouse is connected to the PS/2-Mouseport.
Here is my problem: I want to use the wheel-button as the middle button in
X, but in xf86config I only have the choice between IntelliMouse or
PS/2Mouse, there is no combination of both.
PS/2Mouse will enable the mouse, but the wheelbutton is not recognized,
the other way the movements of the mouse are not correctly recognized,
e.g. I cant move the pointer through the middle of the screen. Anybody got a
solution for this?

Subject: <B>definitions</B> 
<P>
    Let me introduce myself, I am Felix. I am _totally_ new to not
just Linux but computers in general. I have had a computer for the last
....two years, and in all that time was restricted to the limitations
Windows puts on me. This is because , like many users, I started with
the program that came with my setup. Windows is _great_ for someone
who knows _nothing_ of computers. It is all point and click
accessible. But like anyone who uses a computer for a while, I have
come to realize that Windows is not the be all and end all of my
possibilities. Now I want more. Since I got on the Net, I have
realized this and found Linux. I am in the process of browsing Linux
for a grounding in the unfamiliar world of Linux. It is
................most enlightening.
<P> 
    One 'problem' I have encountered is strong, complete definitions
of terms. If I post a list of terms I have heard in the new groups and ask
for explanations, I get many replies { the Linux community is
amazingly tolerant of newbies, and help most unselfishly!} but the
common thread running through them is that each explanation is
slightly different to the next. While I realize that some of the
answers I get are subject specific, some definitions seem to vary from
application to application, even from distribution to distribution.
Again, I realize that each distribution may focus on different
capabilities of applications.
<P> 
     What I want to know is this: Is there a book, magazine, net site
or whatever that lists in dictionary form properties and definitions
of Linux?
<P> 
Thank you, Felix

Subject: <B>Deception about Linux</B> 
<P>
I wonder why I find so often in many home pages about Linux that it will
run fine in a 386 with 8 MB RAM, JA!
Keep in mind that novice end users (like me) who are trying to escape
from Windows 95 by trying something else, confuse Linux with
the X Window System.
Did you try to run Linux and XFree86 in such a machine? Tell people
the truth!
Is anyone using X Windows in a 14 inch monitor? It's ugly!
Today I paid the bill to buy a 17 inch monitor, ouch!!!!
Again, tell people the truth when you talk about hardware requirements to
run Linux and X.
<P>
Of course, in some home pages they say that if you want to run the X
Window System you need a "little bit" more hardware, but what is
exactly "a little bit"? Come on!
<P>
Why am I writing this? Because I own a 486DX2 with 32MB of RAM, and I
said myself : Hey, if Linux runs fine in a 386 with 8 MB of RAM,
running Linux in my computer will feel like having a Pentium! But that
is not the true. X works good but more slowly than Windows 95,
even the Internet is slower, incredible!
<P>
So, I request one thing, tell the people (end users) on which hardware
Linux will run fast (with X Windows included); in my case, I have to buy
a new computer, at least a Pentium II 233 MHz. I thought MS Windows was the
only OS hungry resource.
<P>
Well, one more thing, any tips to improve the  speed of my Internet
Connection?
<P>
What is the difference between having the PPP support as a module or
included in the kernel? Which is more recommendable?
<P>
Anyone has successful installed ICQ for JAVA? When I download some
libraries, which one should I choose? static or dynamic? How do I know
what is the correspondent to my system?
By the way, It is Red Hat Linux 5.0. My video card is Cirrus Logic
clgd5426 with 1 MB.
<P>
Talking about e-mails, I heard about sendmail and so on, but I use
Netscape for Linux to send and receive e-mails, Which one is
better? Is sendmail only for servers?
<P>
Please, do I have to buy a new computer anyway?
<P>
cheers, Desperado

Subject: <B>Article on home networking.</B> 
<P>
There is one part of the home networking article I strongly disagree
with.
<P>
"The software and hardware for networking can be expensive."
<P>
10baseT network cards sell for about $14.00USD that work well with
Linux.. even less if you want the holy grail of a card with actual
jumpers on it!  A hub - 8 port will cost you a whole $60.00USD Buy the
cheapest you can get your hands on... this will be plenty for a home
network.
<P>
Now the software...... it comes with your Linux distribution, and win95
has it built in....  So my network at home...
<P>
4 PC's Win95, 2 servers, 1 router, Full-time Internet connection......
Less than $300.00 total to network it, including a 1000' spool of
category 5 cable and a huge bag of connectors.
and the wall plates were 1.95 each (Cat 3 I don't need 100baseT
capability)  Oh yes, one expensive part.. the connector crimper.... it
cost 29.95USD  one weekend of running wire and a week of fighting with
windows and VOILA!  home network!
<P>
Yes you can get more expensive stuff..... You can spend thousands on a
hub.. or even more on a switch (A glorified hub) especially if you want
that gleaming white box that says Cisco networking on it... but it wont
work any better than the 60 dollar blue thing that has Chinese writing
on it, not in a home environment.  No networking your house is not
expensive, it's dirt cheap!
<P>
BTW, my servers and router are all Linux machines that were built from
"junk" computers that were given to me or found in a corporate garbage
dumpster!

<P>
  I just read the article "Marketing Linux" by Jim Schweizer and
agree with his points on this subject. Being involved with
microcomputers for the last 12-14 years I've noticed that each
successful platform has at least one 'killer app' that launched
it onto people's desktops...VisiCalc -> AppleII, DTP -> Mac,
Office Suites -> Windows.
<P>
  It appears that Linux has ,at present, 2 killer apps to use
for it's launch point...Apache and Samba. Since Linux is, at
present, better poised in a server role, these 2 apps are
beginning to gain Linux it's recognition. The only thing that
will keep Linux off the desktop is the lack of a standard GUI.
Though this will change as this is dissected and dealt with
with the amazing collaboration efforts that I have witnessed
with other Linux-related issues in the past 12 months.

<P>
 To: Mr. Michael Dell, CEO, Dell Computers
 cc: T.R. Reid
 Re: Linux on Dell Hardware
<P>
 Dear Mr. Dell,
<P>
 Please forward this to members of your marketing staff.
<P>
 It is with great disappointment that I read comments by one
 of your representatives, a Mr. T. R. Reid to the effect that 
 "none of Dell's customers" use Linux (*).  
<P>
 This is patently untrue.  I have personally administered a number of
 Linux servers that were running on Dell Dimension desktops.  I have
 also often recommended them to my clients, despite the fact that your
 company offers no option to unbundle software from the system (software
 which is utterly useless for my applications).
<P>
 Obviously my advice was misguided.  I clearly have failed in my
 duty, as a consumer, to provide you with proper feedback --- and this
 as resulted in a gross display of ignorance regarding the needs and 
 preferences of your customers (at least the ones I represent).
<P>
 Forthwith I'm retracting all recommendation of your products from 
 all Starshine's customers where the intent is to use the system 
 under Linux.  I maintain a list of smaller hardware companies
 which do provide Linux, FreeBSD, and other alternatives to meet
 the needs of their customers.  
<P> 
 I'll be recommending VAResearch, PromoX, Telenet, SWT, Apache 
 Systems, Microway, and many others until you offer your customers
 a choice in the software that's bundled with your systems.  I 
 personally consider it a pity since your hardware has never required
 any special tweaks or considerations to run with any distribution 
 of Linux or FreeBSD that I've ever installed on it.
<P>
 This will be posted to a few Linux and FreeBSD venues as an open
 letter so that you can be provided with *honest* feedback from
 real customers.  Hopefully with the co-operation from other
 interested parties we can overcome this regrettable failure in
 communication.  You're comments have underscored the need for
 consumers every where to make their requirements and preferences
 known --- and we must no longer simply accept the "extra" 
 and unwanted components that our vendors foist on us. 
<P>
 It is time to just say "No!" to software that we'll simply be
 replacing.
<P>
 Thank you for your attention to this matter.  My apologies for
 not providing this feedback sooner. 
<P>
 (*) The precise quote was:

	requesting Linux"
