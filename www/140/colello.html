<h1>Custom Hobbit Monitoring Using SNMP</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/colello.html">Martin Colello</a></b></p>


<h3>Hobbit</h3>
<p>
Working as a Unix Engineer for a large manufacturing corporation puts me in
contact with many types of systems and services, and one of the tools for
system monitoring I employ is the open source application Hobbit.
Monitoring applications make excellent early-warning systems, and can help
prevent large-scale network and server problems. In many cases, they can
warn you when things are <em>about</em> to go wrong, which is much better
than getting panicked phone calls in the middle of the night. Hobbit is a
great example of such a watchdog. Hobbit is a compiled binary replacement
for Big Brother, and it offers more functionality and improved speed over
the original. While Hobbit comes with many of the most common network and
system tests right out of the box, it is also easy to extend it to monitor
things that are specific to your environment.
</p>

<p>
I will not describe the Hobbit installation procedure here, as this is well
documented at the Hobbit <a
href="http://hobbitmon.sourceforge.net">home</a> page, instead I will be
describing one of the many custom extensions I am using in production.
</p>

<h3>Extensions</h3>
<p>
Hobbit extensions can range from simple shell scripts to full-blown
compiled programs and anything in between.  As long as you have access to
the Hobbit client you can create any test you need and have the results
integrated into the Hobbit web page and alert system.  My scripting
language of choice for writing Hobbit extensions is Perl.  There is a large
repository of Hobbit/Big Brother extensions that have already been written
and contributed back to the community at <a
href="http://www.deadcat.net">http://www.deadcat.net</a>.
</p>

<h3>A Simple SNMP Monitor</h3>
<p>
Using a simple snmp command and some Perl code we can test many services
and processes that are not natively available in Hobbit.  The first step is
to determine the OID and password for the service you wish to check.  In
this article I will describe how I used this method to get the cpu
utilization from an iSeries server, which is functionality that was not
included in Hobbit out of the box.  The same principles apply to nearly
anything that can be grabbed via SNMP.  My Hobbit server runs on Solaris,
but the commands are the same for linux.  The command to get the cpu
utilization from an iseries box from the Solaris command line is "snmpget
-v1 -c password servername 1.3.6.1.4.1.2.6.4.5.1.0".  With this command in
hand, we can wrap it in a script that will report the results to the hobbit
server.
</p>

<h3>The Script</h3>
<p>
<pre class="code">
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;

# $test will be the name shown in the Hobbit web gui,
# it should be as short as possible
my $test = '400cpu';

# $bbprog is simply the name of the script
my $bbprog = '400cpu.pl';

my ($color, $line, $machine, $warn, $end, $date, $currently);
my $server='servername';

# Issue the snmp command we discussed earlier and store the
# results in $results
my $results = `/usr/local/bin/snmpget -v1 -c public wc400 1.3.6.1.4.1.2.6.4.5.1.0`;

# Split the results into an array, breaking up by spaces
my @results = split / /, $results;

# Grab just the piece we're looking for from the array, and store in $value
my $value = $results[3];
chomp($value);

# If the value comes in at 3000, that means 30 percent, so do some quick
# math on $value
$value = $value/100;
$value = int($value);

# Initially set the test color to "green", we'll turn red if needed to alert
$color = 'green';

# Set some variables to present to the Hobbit server, the first in colon format
my $percent = "\n\nPercentage : $value\n\n";
$currently = "$percent\n\nCPU ok.\n\n\n\n";

# Determine if cpu utilization is too high, if so, turn red
if ( $value &gt; 80 ) {
        $color = 'red';
        $currently = "$percent\n\nCPU Utiliaztion is high.\n\n";
                       }

# Prepare line for Hobbit server in correct format

$machine = "$server,amkor,com";

$date = `date`;
chomp($date);

$line = "status $machine.$test $color $date $currently";

system("/usr/local/hobbit/server/bin/bb hobbit_servername \"$line\"";
</pre>


<h3>Enabling the script in Hobbit</h3>
<p>
Now that we have our script ready, it's time to configure the Hobbit client
to run it once every five minutes.  Open the file clientlaunch.cfg in the
etc directory of your Hobbit home directory and add this entry:
</p>

<pre class="code">
	[400cpu.pl]<br>
	ENVFILE $HOBBITCLIENTHOME/etc/hobbitclient.cfg<br>
	CMD $HOBBITCLIENTHOME/ext/400cpu.pl<br>
	LOGFILE $HOBBITCLIENTHOME/logs/400cpu.pl<br>
	INTERVAL 5m<br><br>
</pre>

<p>
Now you can restart your Hobbit client, wait 10 or 15 minutes for data to
be collected, then check your Hobbit gui for output similiar to this:<br>

</p>

<h3>In Conclusion</h3>
<p>
In this brief article, we've managed to create a useful Hobbit test, and
have it integrated into the Hobbit gui.  Simple variations of this
technique can be used to monitor almost any metric that can be gotten to
via snmp.
