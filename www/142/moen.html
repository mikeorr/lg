<h1>Preventing Domain Expiration</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/moen.html">Rick Moen</a></b></p>

<p>If you study accounting and finance, one of the tidbits taught is
that financial fraud (via embezzlement and otherwise) is far more
pervasive than anyone's willing to admit.  It's a loss syndrome
businesses (e.g., banks) see no advantage in mentioning:  Having been
taken for a ride is pretty embarrassing, after all.</p>

<p>Internet users have an equally pervasive &mdash; and oddly similar &mdash;
problem: accidental Internet domain expiration.  Your Linux user group
or other nonprofit group (or, hey, even your company) is relying on some
vaguely defined chain of command to make sure the domain keeps getting
renewed, making the assumption everything's fine as long as no disaster
has yet happened (which tactic is called "management by exception" in
business school &mdash; usually just before they cue the ominous music).
Somebody drops the ball, the domain everyone's relying on expires when
nobody's looking, and when the dust settles you find that a domain
squatter's grabbed it.  Yes, there are companies that make domain
snatching their core business.  They do well at it, too.  Too well for
my taste.</p>

<p>Victims of such raids sometimes attempt to recover using legal
threats, usually trademark-based, and the ICANN Uniform Domain-Name
Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP) to wrestle back their domains, 
but it's more common to pay the squatter's ransom:  That
might range from hundreds to tens of thousands of US dollars, depending
on the domain and what the market will bear.</p>

<p>Equally common, though, especially for less wealthy victims, is to just
quietly concede, watch the squatter deploy a so-called "search engine"
site where your Net presence had been, and move your presence to
some entirely new domain name you use as a replacement.  Every year, I
see this happen to individuals and groups:  Suddenly, the established
domain is a squatter site, and everyone has a new e-mail address, for
reasons nobody wants to discuss.</p>

<p>But there's a better way.  It doesn't have to happen.  It can be
prevented.</p>

<p>First up, out on the Net, I found a nice little Bourne shell script by Ryan
Matteson (matty91 at gmail dot com) called "domain-check" 
(<a
href="http://prefetch.net/code/domain-check">http://prefetch.net/code/domain-check</a>),
which queries the public WHOIS data in real time to check pending domain
expiration dates, and integrates nicely with cron and optionally SMTP 
e-mail notification, in order give responsible parties advance notice
of the need to take action.  (In this article, as elsewhere, all-caps 
"WHOIS" refers to the TCP port 43 protocol defined in RFC 3912 for remote
information lookup about domain names, etc.  Not all TLDs offer that
service, as detailed below.)
</p>

<p>Ryan's script's only dependencies are awk, whois, and date, whose
executable paths must all be correctly set in the script body (and require
fixing on typical Linux systems).  Plus, you probably need to add a
line defining shell environment variable MAIL to point to a proper system
outbound mailer, if you wish to do e-mail advisories.  (On my system,
/usr/bin/mail fits nicely.)</p>

<p>Once you have that set, it's fairly self-explanatory:</p>

<pre>
$ domain-check -h
Usage: /usr/local/bin/domain-check [ -e email ] [ -x expir_days ] [ -q ]
[ -a ] [ -h ]
          {[ -d domain_namee ]} || { -f domainfile}

  -a               : Send a warning message through email 
  -d domain        : Domain to analyze (interactive mode)
  -e email address : Email address to send expiration notices
  -f domain file   : File with a list of domains
  -h               : Print this screen
  -s whois server  : Whois sever to query for information
  -q               : Don't print anything on the console
  -x days          : Domain expiration interval (eg. if domain_date &lt; days)
</pre>

<p>Example output:</p>

<pre>
$ domain-check -d linuxmafia.com

Domain                           Registrar         Status   Expires Days Left
-------------------------------- ----------------- -------- ------- ---------
linuxmafia.com                   TUCOWS INC.       Valid   17-jul-2010   1057 
</pre>

<p>Ryan's implementation of domain-check has two problems:
One is that he has inadvertently made its licence technically
proprietary (as of v. 1.4), by failing to include rights to modify or
redistribute, in his otherwise generous licence statement.  Ryan's aware
of this oversight, but hasn't yet fixed it at press time.
</p>

<p>The other:  It can parse the expiration date fields from only a few
top-level domains (TLDs), missing some really important ones such as
.ORG.  In particular, if you run it with e-mailed output (where it
really shines, generally, e.g., running as a weekly cronjob to check a
list of domains), it says nothing at all about domains within the many
TLDs it simply can't handle. 
</p>

<p>Mind you, as editor Ben Okopnik and I were testing Ryan's script, we
realised that adding to it support for additional TLDs could prove
non-trivial, and we respect Ryan's accomplishment, as far as it's gone:  
A brief survey of the 250 country-code TLDs ("ccTLDs", such as .uk and
.us) and 21 generic TLDs ("gTLDs", such as .com, .net, .org, .info, etc.) 
showed dozens of variations in the way expiration dates and registrar
names, each needing its own parsing code.
</p>

<p>Ryan might appreciate some help with that task:  Experienced shell
coders might want to send Ryan patches, especially to fill out its
currently rather thin TLD coverage.  <em>However</em>, we right away
spotted the licensing issue, on top of that &mdash; and so, for ourselves,
decided to switch tactics.
</p>

<h3>Introducing Ben's domain-check</h3>

<p>Ben Okopnik fired up his mighty Perl kung fu, and crafted a
second implementation, likewise called "domain-check", which now is 
available with GPL licensing terms at <a
href="http://linuxmafia.com/pub/linux/network/">my Web site</a>.  It
works a treat.  Here's how it goes from the command line &mdash; obviously 
fashioned after Ryan's good example:
</p>

<pre>
$ domain-check -d=linuxmafia.com
Processing linuxmafia.com... 


Host                    Registrar                           Exp.date/Days left
==============================================================================
linuxmafia.com          TUCOWS, INC.                        17-jul-2010 / 1057
</pre>

<p>And, of course, it supports the same e-mailed reporting mode that in
Ryan's script is so nicely cron-friendly &mdash; with the bonus improvement
of relying on Perl and a WHOIS client solely, and finding them via PATH
without any need to tweak the script.
</p>

<h3>The Two WHOIS Clients</h3>

<p>At present, Ben's domain-check will use, if present, the fairly
sophisticated, configurable, and cache-enabled WHOIS client "jwhois" by
default, on a hunch that "jwhois" is <em>usually, generally</em> a small
bit smarter, and its caching on disk of recently received WHOIS data is
usually an advantage, relative to the regular "whois" (/usr/bin/whois)
implementation &mdash; with automatic fallback to the latter client.
However, the WHOIS client comparison is, upon further examination, a
mixed bag.  For one thing, "jwhois's" results caching (defaulting to a
seven-day retention period) can become a problem:  Suppose it's Wednesday
today, you last checked your friend's domain example.com on Sunday, and
that domain's due to expire this coming Saturday.  You run domain-check
(and it finds "jwhois"); domain-check reports that your friend's weekend
expiration is still looming. 
</p>

<p>But maybe, he/she has (unbeknownst to you) already paid for that
renewal, and it took effect yesterday.  domain-check won't pick this
datum up (while using "jwhois" with 7-day retention), and so issues a
false alarm, because it's still using the cache-hit of Sunday's data,
now three days old (but already obsolete).
</p>

<p>You can ameliorate this situation by, say, reducing the cache period
(near the bottom of /etc/jwhois.conf) to 2 hours instead of the default
168 hours = 1 week &mdash; but the point is that "jwhois's" default reliance
on old data can be misleading.
</p>

<p>Nor is it always or unambiguously the case that "jwhois" is "a bit
smarter".  This is where things get interesting (part one, of two).  The
worldwide Internet domain system's "whois" data, showing contact
information for each domain's owners &amp; operators, which registrar
it's enrolled through, when it will expire, and at what IPs its DNS
nameservers can be found, is (like DNS itself) yet another distributed
information system, with "whois" information for each TLD (among those
that offer it) publicly accessible (if at all) either the WHOIS
protocol, or Web-based lookup methods, or both, that can query one or
more database server holding that data.
</p>

<p>Which TLDs offer meaningful information lookup via WHOIS, and at what 
WHOIS server hostnames in each case?  If you're reasonably lucky (regarding 
the six or seven TLDs you typically care about, no matter where in 
the world you are), the WHOIS client software you use (which on Linux 
will be either /usr/bin/whois or /usr/bin/jwhois) already has
this knowledge built in.  However, the various TLD operators, including
the administrators of the 250 country-code TLDs, have an unsettling tendency to 
move things around, change where their WHOIS data is, terminate WHOIS
service, start WHOIS service &mdash; without (much) notice.  They're
<em>supposed</em> to inform <a href="http://www.iana.org/">IANA</a> 
of all such changes, whereupon IANA would update its TLD information pages
(<a href="http://www.iana.org/root-whois/index.html">1</a>,
<a href="http://www.iana.org/gtld/gtld.htm">2</a>), but you will be 
"shocked, shocked!" to hear that compliance is 
spotty.  In parallel to this official process the two client programs' 
authors attempt to track TLD changes, themselves.  Sometimes, one of the
two Linux WHOIS clients will reflect (in its auto-selection of the correct
WHOIS server for a given TLD, or its claim that none exists) better
information than IANA has.  Sometimes, IANA has better data (and, if 
the system really worked, it would have the latest and best &mdash; but
doesn't).  More often than not, the best data are on relevant Wikipedia pages
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Country_code_top-level_domains ">1</a>, 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_code_top-level_domain">2</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Generic_top-level_domains">3</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_top-level_domain">4</a>).
Some of the linked subpages are <em>really</em> entertaining:  If your 
sense of humour is as warped as mine, check out the reasons why 
"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vrsn-end-of-zone-marker-dummy-record.root">.vrsn-end-of-zone-marker-dummy-record.root</a>"
is a valid TLD, and note the reasons why, in 2007, 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.arpa">.arpa</a> is still a robust
TLD with <em>six</em> active subdomains &mdash; and, by the way, a useful
WHOIS server.
</p>

<p>The biggest reason Ben and I have so far favoured the jwhois client
is that its internal knowledge about which WHOIS server to use for 
particular TLDs and subdomains is highly configurable via configuration
file /etc/jwhois.conf (but beware of the mixed blessing of results caching).
Whereas, the other WHOIS client is not.  However, in the middle with
wrestling with both clients, seeking to give domain-check the broadest
possible TLD coverage, Ben found it prudent to hack domain-check's
parsing code that handles its (optional) file listing which domains to 
check, to support an optional two-column format:  domain, and what WHOIS
server hostname to use for that domain.  To help users, I've constructed
a prototype 
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/pub/linux/network/domains-test">domains</a>
file, showing a test-case host within each supported TLD (often, the
"NIC" = network information centre that runs Internet infrastructure for
that country or other TLD authority), plus the currently correct WHOIS 
host for that TLD.  Separately, I am maintaining a separate file of
more-verbose 
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/pub/linux/network/domain-check-testdata">notes/information</a>,
but the latter is intended solely for interested humans, and isn't
readable by domain-check.
</p>

<p>Now, I figure most people who deal in domains are following this
account without major problems, but a minority of readers may be
thinking "What's this about determining expiration data via WHOIS?", 
and a smaller minority are still stuck on "What's this about domains 
<em>expiring</em>?" I should explain:
</p>

<h3>It's a Wacky World, out There</h3>  

<p>(This is part two of "Where things get interesting".)
</p>

<p>One of the reasons I really enjoy travelling to remote and diverse
parts of the world, on occasions when I have time and money for it, is
that you encounter people living their lives using, quite naturally, 
radically different basic assumptions, sometimes assumptions differing
in subtle but important ways.  In return, you're rewarded with the 
cheerful fact that you and your people will tend to strike other nations
as slightly odd and nutty, too &mdash; and may even agree.  (An American 
comedian and entertainer named Garrison Keillor and his radio programme
"A Prairie Home Companion" finally made me realise, similarly, that my
own crowd of Scandinavian-Americans are <em>extremely</em> quirky
people &mdash; manias for strong coffee and white fish, going nuts on
Midsummer Day, mocking self-deprecation, and all.)
</p>

<p>Getting back to the subject, exploring WHOIS data can earn you that
same shock of unexpected strangeness, right at home.  One of my first
test cases for the unfolding development of domain-check was .au, i.e., 
our esteemed friends in Australia.  Hmm, I thought, why not check Linux
Users of Victoria?

<p>Hullo?  Where's the expiration data?  Turns out, none of .au offers that
information via WHOIS.  Nor does the public whois information browsable 
at the indicated Web host.  What?
</p>

<p>Well, upon inquiry, I was enlightened:  It's deemed a privacy issue, 
and Australians using .au domains presumably suffer fewer domain
snatches, and similar abuses.  The same appears to be true in .de
(Germany) and some others.  Presumably, domain <em>owners</em> (as
opposed to the general public) can look up their own domains' expiration
data via their logged-in individual domain records, in addition, of
course (in theory), to getting notification of upcoming expirations.
On the downside, TLDs that conceal that data from the public prevent 
public-spirited neighbours from helping warn domain owners notice
upcoming problems, keep people from planning for <em>legitimate</em> 
opportunities to re-register domains their owners no longer want, etc.
</p>

<p>(By the way, if you are really serious about protecting your privacy
as a domain holder, .au doesn't really qualify.  <a
href="http://www.tonic.to/faq.htm?B6G53667;;;#16">.to</a> (Kingdom of
Tonga) is among the few that do.)
</p>

<p>However, it gets stranger:  There are particular country-code domains
(I won't name names) where expiration data is available, and open to the
public, but appears not to matter.  That is, you'll find what appears to
be a good test case, notice that its expiration date of record is three
years ago, and then notice that <em>the domain still works, anyway</em>.
</p>

<p>Your mileage may differ, but, for me, that was a culture shock:  In
my sadly clock-driven, Westernised existence, Internet domain expiration
is a real <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2005/03/how-to-snatch-an-expiring-domain">calamity</a>:  Your domain's DNS stops working 
within a day (if not instantly), and you may or may not even be allowed
to buy it back (re-register or renew it) at all.  If you are, it may
involve a ghastly "Sorry, you were asleep at the wheel" surcharge.
</p>

<p>Some TLDs, evidently, just aren't like that, so domain-check may
address a non-problem for domains in your national TLD.  It's up to you
to check, I suppose.
</p>

<p>My prototype setup of domain-check runs via a 
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/pub/linux/network/domain-check.cron">weekly 
cronjob</a> that runs every Sunday night, and e-mails me a notice about
which domains, among the roughly 150 I have domain-check monitor, are
now within 90 days from expiration, plus a separate one about what
domains, if any, have already expired.  You might ask, armed with that
weekly briefing, what do I do?  That brings us to:
</p>

<h3>The Difficult Part</h3>

<p>This might be you:  You own a domain you care considerably about, but
every year, like clockwork, you put off renewal until the last minute,
to "get the most for your money".  You pay for only one extra year at 
a time, not three or four, for the same reason.  Maybe you dislike your
current registrar (in TLDs like com/org/net where a choice is offered),
but never move your domain because that would require sending more
money, and you have a vague notion that, some year, you'll move
registrars right around the time of your next renewal.  Maybe you
literally wait until the final day, and panic and shout on the telephone
to your registrar if there's a hitch, until your renewal goes through.
You're now reading this article and realise I'm about to tell you you're
being foolish, but nothing's going to change your mind, let alone your
habits.
</p>

<p>Why is that foolish behaviour?  Because every bit of that attitude
greatly increases the risk of accidental expiration.  You should,
actually, consider 
<a href="http://greatdomainstoday.com/questions-to-ask-before-you-pick-your-domain-name/">moving to a better registrar</a> at any time, and not
wait, <em>because competing registrars almost all credit you for the full
time remaining at your prior registrar</em>, upon your domain's arrival.
That is, if you have 100 days remaining at Registrar A when you initiate
a transfer to Registrar B (and pay the latter for a year of service),
you start with 365 + 100 days on your domain's expiration clock.  So,
you lose nothing at all.  The bank interest you save by buying only one
year in advance instead of 3-4 is absolutely negligible compared to the
painful cost of recovering from accidental expiration (where that is
possible), not to mention the transaction cost of swooping in and
continually renewing annually to "save money" (let alone the cost of
doing that mere days or hours before expiration, as many do).
</p>

<p>I might be able to convince <em>you</em>, the reader, that the above
syndrome is unwise, but I won't convince your friends or the
organisations you care about &mdash; whose domains you might want to watch
over.  Which brings us back to the question:  Armed with the knowledge
that someone's domain expiration is imminent, what do you do about it?
</p>

<p>Several non-technical problems become evident, as one attempts to 
look after friends' domains &mdash; and I really should have realised that
the technical challenges of writing and debugging domain-check would be
the iceberg's tip, but didn't:  
</p>

<ul>
<li>The dangerous lure of last-minute renewal syndrome is widespread.
Even after reaching the right person, saying "Dude, your domain's three
days from expiration", and getting acknowledgement, the owner may not
care.  Oh well, it's his/her funeral.  At least you tried.
<li>Increasingly among registrars, there's something called "auto-renew" 
on domain registrations:  The registrar accepts credit-card data from
the owner, and then at some number of months, weeks, or days from 
expiration (sometimes, three or more scheduled attempts) tries to
charge the credit card for a year's fee, without the need for an
explicit renewal action from the owner.  Registrars like the
customer-retention effect of this setup, so it is often the default
arrangement (e.g., at Dotster).  At least one major registrar reportedly 
carries out the auto-renew attempt only on a covered domain's day of 
expiration, and never before.  Problem:  From your perspective as a 
sympathetic watcher of someone else's domain, you have no idea if an 
auto-renew is likely or not, so you cannot easily distinguish a domain 
on auto-renew from one at risk.
<li>Most perniciously, there is the syndrome of broken communication,
which I'll detail below.
<li>Last, don't forget, not all domain expirations are unintended.
</ul>

<p>Imagine a Linux user group, or a science fiction fan association that
puts on an annual convention, or some other similar group that relies on
an Internet domain.  You're trying to get their attention to an upcoming 
expiration.  Domain matters are probably delegated to someone
technical who's believed to be handling them.  The people who run the
group generally are most often other people, who may not understand
domain matters at all, and may assume, if you ask them about it, that
you must be referring to the Web site, will forward your mail to the
HTML guy / webmaster / hosting company / listadmin, and will never
realise their category error.
</p>

<p>The domain guy may be gone from e-mail for a month.  He/she might
have believed the responsibility was taken over by somebody else.
The contact e-mail addresses shown in WHOIS for the domain may be wrong
or outdated, or just unmonitored.  Your warning e-mails might be 
mistaken as spam or a sales solicitation (strangers showing 
concern seems outlandish to many), and blackholed or ignored.  Or
everyone in the group might be assuming someone else is taking care of
it.  Or maybe their mail server is misconfigured or otherwise
mishandling or misrouting some or all incoming mail about the domain.
</p>

<p>Ultimately, this isn't your problem &mdash; sufficiently hapless
organisations' negligence will cause them loss despite even heroic 
efforts to help, and that can't be helped &mdash; but it's nice to know the
most common failure modes.
</p>

<p>If you see a domain's days remaining rapidly approaching zero, and
nothing's happening, one of four explanations logically applies:
</p>

<ul>
<li>It's set to auto-renew, on or near the last day, "but thanks for
    letting us know".
<li>The owner specifically intends to let it expire, actually, "but
    thanks for caring".
<li>The owner's stuck in a deliberate, conscious case of last-minute
    syndrome.
<li>The registrar's various reminder attempts (if any) have failed 
    completely or failed to reach the right, motivated party, for 
    some reason as yet undetermined, and everyone's otherwise asleep 
    at the wheel.  (Registrars make mistakes.  Also, domain contact
    information has been known to get corrupted, changed in error, 
    hijacked / misappropriated, etc.)
</ul>

<p>As the concerned outsider, your main worry is the last scenario,
which is the classic domain-loss one &mdash; which is relevant to the current
question, of what you do with your knowledge of the impending
expiration.  The naive answer is:  "Look in WHOIS, find the listed
domain contacts, send them "Dude, you need to renew your domain" e-mail, 
check that domain off your list, and pat yourself on the back for being
a good neighbour.
</p>

<p>That's naive because, odds are, <em>that's exactly what the registrar
did, and it didn't work</em>.  Thus, you may want to be a little
creative about whom to contact, and how.  E.g., look on the Web site for
maintained information about who currently runs the group.  Bear in 
mind that he/she/they may not, initially, know what you're talking about 
(e.g., fob you off on the webmaster).  Ask politely that someone in
charge send you wording like "Thanks, we know about it", mention that you'll
cease pestering them when that happens, and keep following up at 
intervals.  
</p>

<p>Be really, really diplomatic.  Your queries may, themselves, cause a
political kerfuffle within domain-owning groups, and cause considerable
unintended irritation.  People will get bothered, often despite being
the wrong people to bother (e.g., the webmaster), and may get cranky.
A harassed domain-admin may write back and say "It's on auto-renew, 
jerk."  Don't be offended.  Stress that you didn't know, and merely want
to help them avert mishaps.  From time to time, you just might get lucky
and hear "Thank you."
</p>

<h3>Anyway...</h3>

<p>I should stress that my cronjob was the result of only a few minutes'
work, shortly before penning the initial draft of this article.  It
wouldn't be difficult to write a less-feeble shell script to do slightly
more useful notifications, e.g., tailored e-mail warning texts at the
90, 60, and 30-day marks, with each being sent to groups of people
appropriate to each domain, rather than all notifications being sent
just to one person for all domains monitored.</p>

<p>However, as is so often the case with system administration,
perfectionism is not your friend:  Waiting around to do this job right
had already caused me to delay some months from doing even this much,
while I pondered the problem &mdash; and in the meantime a volunteer group I
know (but will not name here) was obliged to spend about US $500
to ransom its domain back.  Ouch and damn.</p>

<p>Moral:  Do the 80% solution, the one that avoids disaster, today.
Don't be proud.</p>

<p>And don't be a single point of failure, either.  I'm encouraging all
my 'Nix-using (including, without prejudice, MacOS X) friends to run
this thing, and help out with redundant, overlapping checks, too.</p>

<p>How about you?  The domain you save from disaster probably won't be
your own, but it could easily be one you care about dearly, or that a
friend cherishes.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could think of this as your best shot at ruining a
domain squatter's day.  Either way, it's awfully good news for decent
folk.</p>

Rick has run freely-redistributable Unixen since 1992, having been roped
in by first 386BSD, then Linux.  Having found that either one 
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/cabal/os-suck.html">sucked less</a>, he blew
away his last non-Unix box (OS/2 Warp) in 1996.  He specialises in clue
acquisition and delivery (documentation &amp; training), system
administration, security, WAN/LAN design and administration, and
support.  He helped plan the LINC Expo (which evolved into the first
LinuxWorld Conference and Expo, in San Jose), Windows Refund Day, and
several other rabble-rousing Linux community events in the San Francisco
Bay Area.  He's written and edited for IDG/LinuxWorld, SSC, and the
USENIX Association; and spoken at LinuxWorld Conference and Expo and
numerous user groups.

<P> His first computer was his dad's slide rule, followed by visitor access
to a card-walloping IBM mainframe at Stanford (1969).  A glutton for
punishment, he then moved on (during high school, 1970s) to early HP
timeshared systems, People's Computer Company's PDP8s, and various
of those they'll-never-fly-Orville microcomputers at the storied
Homebrew Computer Club -- then more Big Blue computing horrors at
college alleviated by bits of primeval BSD during UC Berkeley summer
sessions, and so on.  He's thus better qualified than most, to know just
how much better off we are now.

<P> When not playing Silicon Valley dot-com roulette, he enjoys
long-distance bicycling, helping run science fiction conventions, and
concentrating on becoming an uncarved block.
