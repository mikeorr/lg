<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

One of the great difficulties a hobbyist programmer faces when trying
to start the development of his own OS is finding out where to
start. Many books describe in-depth theoretical OS concepts, yet noone
seems to take a hobyist programmer by the hand and bring him face to
face with these concepts. This is precisely what this article aims at
doing.
<p>
Several articles related to this topic appeared in the last few issues
of the Linux Gazette. I plan to approach it in a much less programming
oriented manner, only presenting to the reader the tools and tips he
will need to begin the development of his own OS. Once done with this
article, the interested reader should be all set to start browsing the
resources available to him and start designing and coding.
<p>
You might not be aware of it, but operating system development doesn't
start at the beginning. (!!)  Writing a solid bootloader is a whole
project in itself, and I would not advise one to begin an OS
development project by writing a bootloader. Many reliable ones are
available for free (Grub, lilo, ppcboot, etc...). If you plan on
writing your own, I suggest you delay this task to a later stage of
the project. In this article, I will be using GNU Grub, the Grand
Unified Bootloader.

<h2>2. Description of the development environment</h2>

To ease the pain that OS development will bring to you, you will need
to set up an adapted development environment which meets a certain
number of requirements:
<p>
<ul>
<li>You should get to rapidly test your newly compiled kernel
<li>You should never have to reboot your development machine
<li>You should not need to use floppies as a storage medium for your OS
</ul>
<p>
This article will present one of many possible environments which
meets these requirements. It will consist of a development machine and
a testbed machine that both lie on a common network.

<h3>2.1 The development machine</h3>

Obviously, this machine will need to be equipped with a good set of
programming tools: assembly and C compilers, a linker and a 'make'
utility are musts.
<p>
A tool I found more useful than I initially thought it would be is an
emulator. Such a tool will help debug your kernel and will allow you
to rapidly test your newly added line of code. Don't be fooled,
though. An emulator never replaces a good ol' testbed machine. 
<p>
Next, you need a TFTP server. This tool will allow your testbed machine's
tftp enabled bootloader to acquire  a kernel from the development
machine via the network connection.

<h3>2.2 The testbed machine</h3>

All this machine needs is a network card and a TFTP enabled bootloader
that supports it.

<h2>3. Setup of the development environment</h2>

<h3>3.1 The development machine</h3>

The chosen programming tools are:
<ul>
<li>gcc 2.95.4
<li>ld 2.13.90.0.10
</ul>
<p>
Bochs version 1.4.1 is the chosen x86 emulator. Special care should be
taken to compile it with debugger mode enabled. These commands should do
the job:
<pre>
	$ ./configure --enable-x86-debugger
	$ make
</pre>
In order to properly use Bochs, you need to create a disk image. This
image needs to have both a bootloader and a filesystem. This can
be done using the <a href="misc/mahoney/mkbimage">mkbimage</a>
script. If you're too lazy to do it yourself, grab <a
href="misc/mahoney/c.img.gz">this</a> gzipped 10MB disk image and add
<pre>
	diskc: file=c.img, cyl=24, heads=16, spt=63
</pre>
to your .bochrc file.
<p>
As for the TFTP server, I chose to use atftpd. It's an easy to use
linux-based TFTP server implementation.

<h3>3.2 The testbed machine</h3>

The chosen bootloader is GNU Grub version 0.92. Special care should be
taken to enable Grub's tftp client to talk to your network card. My
testbed machine has a cheap NE2000 ISA clone. Following carefully the
netboot/README.netboot instructions, I used these commands:
<pre>
	$ ./configure --enable-ne --enable-ne-scan=0x220
	$ make
</pre>
Note that a PnP PCI card would be easier to configure. Now, you can
either install the Grub images on the testbed machine's MBR or on a
floppy which your testbed machine will boot from. I prefer the latter,
since my testbed machine is also used for other purposes, and
therefore, I'd rather not play with its HD.
<pre>
	$ cat ./stage1/stage1 ./stage2/stage2 &gt; /dev/fd0
</pre>
Now just insert your floppy in your testbed machine to see if your
network card gets recognized. You can either configure it by hand or
use a dhcp server, if any.
<pre>
	grub&gt; dhcp
	Probing... [NE*000]
	NE2000 base 0x220, addr 00:C0:A8:4E:5A:76
	Address: 192.168.22.14
	Netmask: 255.255.255.0
	Server: 192.168.22.1
	Gateway: 192.168.22.1
</pre>
Note that you won't have to configure these parameters by hand each
time you boot. See the GNU Grub documentation and the 'grub-install'
script for details.
<p>
That's it! You're all set to test your setup!


<h2>4. Testing your development environment setup...</h2>

As I mentioned earlier, I will leave the core OS programming stuff to
the experts out there. So in order to test your setup, we will use the
example kernel from the GNU Grub sources located in the /docs directory. 
<p>
The kernel is built from three source files: boot.S, kernel.c and
multiboot.h. You can build the kernel by doing:
<pre>
	$ gcc -I. -c ./boot.S
	$ gcc -I. -c ./kernel.c
	$ ld ./kernel.o ./boot.o -o kernel -Ttext 100000
</pre>
Here's a quick and incomplete explanation. Multiboot is a standard
that defines a way for the bootloader to pass information to the
kernel it tries to load. boot.S accepts this information, sets up a
stack, and calls 'cmain'. This function sets up the vga display,
reads the information passed to him, prints some stuff and
leaves. Then, boot.S gets the control back, prints the string
'Halted.', and enters an infinite loop. Pretty simple stuff, right?
The reader is invited to dig into the code to get more details.

<h3>4.1 ...with Bochs</h3>

The plan is to mount your disk image via a loopback device, copy your
kernel on the filsystem of the image, unmount it, and fire off
Bochs. Of course, you have to add an offset to the start of the
filesystem. But you knew that, right?
<pre>
	# /sbin/losetup -o 32256 /dev/loop1 ./c.img
	# /bin/mount -t ext2 /dev/loop1 /mnt/osdev/
	# cp <path-to-grub>/docs/kernel /mnt/osdev
	# umount /mnt/osdev/
	# /sbin/losetup /dev/loop1 -d
	$ bochs
</pre>
Of course, that can be automated by your Makefile. Once in Grub,
simply do: 
<pre>
	grub&gt; kernel (hd0,0)/kernel
	grub&gt; boot
</pre>
<a href="misc/mahoney/bochs_screenshot.jpg">
<img alt="Bochs screenshot" src="misc/mahoney/bochs_screenshot.jpg" width="400" height="220"></a>
<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>(Click the image for the full size.)</EM></BLOCKQUOTE>


<h3>4.2 ...with your testbed machine</h3>

First, setup your TFTP server so that the client can retrieve your
kernel: 
<pre>
	# /usr/sbin/atftpd --daemon /home/bono/src/grub-0.92/docs
</pre>
Fire off your testbed machine. Configure your network connection as
shown above. Next, specify your devel machine's ip address as the TFTP
server address and the location of the kernel image. Note that this
option can be set by the dhcp server. Finally, start the boot
process.

<pre>
	(...)

	grub&gt; tftpserver 192.168.22.36
	Address: 192.168.22.14
	Netmask: 255.255.255.0
	Server: 192.168.22.36
	Gateway: 192.168.22.1

	grub&gt; kernel (nd)/kernel
	[Multiboot-elf, <0x100000:0x807:0x0>, <0x101808:0x0:0x4018>,
	shtab=0x106190, entry=0x100568]

	grub&gt; boot
</pre>

A screen similar to that of Bochs should appear on your testbed
machine's display.

<h2>5. Where to go from here</h2>

Well you're pretty much set to start the development of your
OS. Lots of good documentation resides on the web. Browse, post,
ask, think. Monolithic or micro kernel? Segmentation or paging?
<p>
If your debugging needs come to outgrow both the emulator and your
kernel's printk's, one setup you could add to your OS is a serial
debugger. This can range from some bytes thrown on the serial port, to
a gdb-compatible remote-debugging extension. This information could be
retrieved and processed by your development machine through a
null-modem serial cable. It's a handy common practice in OS
development.
