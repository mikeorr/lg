<h1>Away Mission: LinuxWorld Morphs into OpenSource World</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>

<p>
For years, August meant LinuxWorld in San Francisco.  This year would
have been the 13th annual LinuxWorld.  </p>

<p>
LinuxWorld is no more, having transmogrified into three overlapping
conferences: the brand new OpenSource World, the Next Generation Data
Center (NGDC) event which started in 2007, and a new CloudWorld
conference, all managed by IDG World Expo. These events will be held
over two days, August 12-13, 2009, in San Francisco at Moscone Center
West.  </p>

<p>
OpenSource World is the true descendant of LinuxWorld, since it focuses
on open source, open standards, and open architecture, as part of an
integrated IT infrastructure. The conference will present Linux and open
source ideas in a technical context, covered by industry experts.  </p>

<p>
CloudWorld is the hot topic addition, and will supposedly focus on
infrastructure and services to drive deployment of cloud computing in
the data center. That sounds a bit like the NGDC conference, which will
focus on complete end-to-end solutions for the 21st century data center,
and new technologies for those data centers. Separating the two topics
seems like a marketing ploy, since any complete discussion of the modern
data center includes both virtualization and cloud-based computing.
</p>

<p>
That being said, the energy that used to be channeled exclusively into
LinuxWorld has found new avenues and new venues. The new
conferences sponsored by the Linux Foundation come to mind - the Linux
Foundation Collaboration Summit and the Linux Plumbers Conference
- as well as many regional events that have grown over the years.  </p>

<h3>Review of LW/NGDC 2008</h3>

<p>
Last year was the second year LinuxWorld shared the convention center
with the so-called Next Generation Data Center conference. This offered
more sessions - but at different start times - and a broader set of
tracks.  In practice, it led to less crowding in most sessions. 
</p>

<p>
There also was an almost independent Mobile Linux track that had several
of its own keynote sessions.  On the last day, there was a good panel,
moderated by Raven Zachary, on "Keeping Mobile Linux Competitive", which
discussed the players and potential upstarts in the mobile world.  </p>

<p>
There also were a few community tracks, including an Ubuntu Day.  These
seemed to be moderately attended, and I don't see these featured for
upcoming 2009 conference.  </p>

<p>
However, there also was markedly less attendance at last year's LinuxWorld.
The keynotes were held in the smaller room 134, which could only hold
about 1000 attendees. The larger expo rooms in Moscone South were
unused, and the escalators were turned off, part of the time.  There was
lots of room on the Expo floor, and I also noticed that both Red Hat,
Inc. and Novell, Inc. weren't in the Expo for 2008.  </p>

<p>
The BoFs were also a bit odd, in 2008. They spanned two nights, but were
only a single hour long. So, they were all happening at the same time,
and some of the invitational social events also occurred that same hour.
</p>


<p>
These were some new features from 2008:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Software Central - a collection of software solution vendors in one
dedicated area of the exhibitor show floor.

<li>The AppZone - Easily find open source solutions and software running
on Linux consolidated  into their own feature area within LinuxWorld.

<li>The Linux Garage - A place to catch the latest and coolest gadgets
based on embedded Linux, including PDAs and hand-held computers, mobile
phones, home automation, audio/video entertainment devices, appliances,
and robots.

<li>The Linux Desktop Shootout - The Linux Desktop Shootout let
attendees test-drive and compare the top Linux-based desktops, score
usability tests, and have the chance to win a PC and distro at the Expo.

<li>Installfest For Schools - Untangle organized a massive installfest
on the show floor to donate open source (Ubuntu) computers to schools in
need. The hardware was supplied by the Alameda County Computer Resource
Center (ACCRC), which recycles discarded computers from businesses,
government and the general public. LinuxWorld attendees could join the
installfest by installing Ubuntu or Kubuntu, hacking older hardware, or
donating unwanted computers.
</ul>

<p>
There also was a great area on the floor demonstrating the use of open
source in the development of new voting systems.  This included trial
voting machine and a mock presidential election. (Obama won handily with
about 3/4 of about 800 votes cast.)  This was sponsored by the Open
Voting Consortium.  See more details here: <a
href="http://www.openvotingconsortium.org/blog/2008-aug-29/success_at_linuxworld/
">http://www.openvotingconsortium.org/blog/2008-aug-29/success_at_linuxworld/</a>
</p>

<p>
Jay Lyman of the 451 group referenced his firm's research report, "The
Rise of Community Linux", which cites the initial use of non-commercial
distros in the enterprise.  Lyman said he sees more use of Ubuntu,
CentOS, and Debian in the data center, and noted it is now possible to get
HP support for Debian. His <a
href="http://blogs.the451group.com/opensource/2008/08/11/the-community-linux-impact/">
blog entry</a> after LW08 summarizes many of his points. Here's a
quotation: </p>

<blockquote>
"What we found is that it can work both ways. Community Linux can very
often serve as entry into the open source OS and lead to broader, more
advanced use all the way up to commercial subscriptions.  At the same
time, community Linux versions (that is, for our purposes, a
community-developed, freely available Linux operating systems for the
server) also presents an appealing alternative to commercial Linux. It
can be a particularly good option when the code is identical and perhaps
more flexible, as is the case with CentOS for Red Hat, or when the Linux
distribution is getting easier to use and support, as is the case with
Ubuntu, and when hardware providers and other players are offering
commercial support for it."
</blockquote>

<p>
I was also fond of Kyle Rankin's talk on using Knoppix for system rescue
of both Linux and Windows boxes.  Kyle is the author of "Knoppix Hacks"
and "Knoppix Pocket Reference", and lays out how to use the forensic
utilities for recovering lost files, partitions, MBRs, etc.  See:  <a
href="http://greenfly.org/talks/knoppix/rescue.html">http://greenfly.org/talks/knoppix/rescue.html</a>
(These slides have a delay time, and it's faster to move a slide ahead
and then back.) </p>

<p>
Here's a link to the LW-08 keynotes and selected presentations:

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
The conference archive from 2008 is rather limited, and old links to
last year's program are redirected to this year's event.  That may be
marketing, but I certainly don't like it.  </p>

<p>
It seems the bulk of Linux enthusiasts are going elsewhere to hang out
with their community, and for education as well.  Perhaps the wave of
Linux adoptions has peaked.  Or perhaps a free Expo and free beer --
only on the last day, by the way -- is not enough to entice casual Linux
users to commute by car or train for a few hours of the latest and
greatest, not when petrol was hitting $4.20+ a gallon, and jobs were
tightening up.  We will have to see if the current economic contraction
diminishes attendance even more.  </p>

<p>
LinuxWorld was a venerable institution. May its memory live long!
</p>

<p>
Let's view OpenSource World as a new event, and judge it on its own
merits.</p>
