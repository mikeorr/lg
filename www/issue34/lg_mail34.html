Subject: <font color="maroon">Single IP Address & Many Servers.  Possible?</font> 
<P>
This is for the "article wanted" section of the Linux
Gazette.  Thanks!
<P>
I have a single IP address for accessing the Internet.  I
have an Intranet with several old 486-class computers which all
access the Internet via IP Masquerading.  The single machine which
is actually connected to the Internet (and does the masquerading)
is not powerful enough to run a news server, mail server, HTTP
server, etc.  I would like to split these functions up among the 
cheap low-cost computers I have lying around.  How can I force 
HTTP web pages to be serviced by the HTTP server even though it 
is not directly connected to the Internet with an IP address? 
<P>
Example Diagram below:
<PRE> 
207.123.456.789  (Single IP address to the Internet)
	|
	|
	486 DX/2-66   (IP Masquerading)
		|
		|
		486 DX-33  Mail Server    192.168.1.1
		|
		|
		K-5 133  HTTP Server   192.168.1.2
		|
		|
		486 DX-33 Leafnode News Server 192.168.1.3
		|
		|
		(Other local machines)
</PRE> 
I want anyone on the Internet who accesses my web server by
accessing 207.123.456.789 to be directed to the computer at
192.168.1.2 on the Intranet.
(obviously, the Intranet users have no problem accessing
the correct machines since they just reference the local 
192.xxx.xxx.xxx IP address.  But how can I make the same 
functionality available to the rest of the known universe?)

 I've been trying to encourage my Dad to try Linux. He has showed

Windoze. He does a lot of work on the mainframe and needs something that
can provide a "3270 terminal interface" for a "TSO session". I wondered
if there are any old school programmers out there who can recommend a
piece of software which would suit his needs.

Here's my quick and probably easy question..   On reboot (yes, I do that

defaults to starting up with Num Lock off.  How can I get it to switch
it on for me automatically?  (This is a matter of pride - I made the

then she has to discover the num lock quirk for me...)

I have to use the "TERMMSG" command instead of a "TRANSMIT". This won't 
work because the "open 0,(value)" statement has to be transmitted across

<P>
<P>
    I am a new Linux user having installed Red Hat 5.1 last month. (So 
far so good)
After installing several goodies and libraries like qt I find myself 
running out of disk space on my / directory. I have a Syquest EZ-flyer 
removeable disk drive that I didn't use at all during the install.
<P> 
   My question is can I move some of the directories that defaulted to 
the root directory like /tmp/ and /var/ to this drive without a full 
re-installation, and if so, how. Also I really couldn't figure out
how to get the thing working during install. It is a SCSI drive 
that connects to the parallel port. Red Hat lists it as a supported 
drive but was of little help when I asked them for specific 
instructions.
<P> 
    If there is some other strategy I might use to gain disk space 
without a re-installation I would like to hear it. I'm still amazed I got 
the thing going in the first place. The partitioning makes me nervous.

I can point NetScape Messenger at the localhost IMAP server and it (NS)

Provide an article about imapd - how to set up hosts.allow for security,
how to configure sendmail.cf to use it (I'm pretty sure this has to be
done), how to set up user mailboxes,
etc.

I would love to see an article like this. By the way, how can I be

Subject: <font color="maroon">Linux certification</font> 
<P>
I read your article in <I>Linux Gazette</I> 33 on a Linux Certification program
with interest.  However, I would like to point out (and I will not
be the only one), that this issue was already raised by Phil Hughes in
L.J. Nov.1997 p.10; since then, there has been a still-active discussion
in <A HREF="http://www.linuxjournal.com/HyperNews/get/certification.html">
http://www.linuxjournal.com/HyperNews/get/certification.html</A>.
Therefore, I am somewhat surprised to see this paper appear in Linux
Gazette without reference to these discussions.  Moreover, Robert Hart
of Red Hat has been actively defining a RH certification program; see
http://www.redhat.com/~hartr/ .
<P>
In principle, I sustain initiatives like these.  I strongly disagree
however, with Dan York's stress on the benefits for conference centers
and publishers.  Although I don't care if they make a lot of money out
of it, I am very much afraid of the consequences: if something like
this really catches on, only people who can afford the certification
program will be taken seriously as Linux consultants or developers.
Everyone else will be officially doomed to be an "amateur", disrespective
of competence or contributions already made to the Linux movement.
So I think we should NOT copy the expensive MSCE model, but keep Linux
certification affordable.

Many thanks for the pointers... I was not aware of the discussion
on the linuxjournal.com site and had, in fact, been quite unsuccessful
in finding such discussions on the web.  Thank you.
<P>
Thank you for pointing out Robert Hart's site... yes, others have sent
along that pointer as well. Maybe I missed it, but when I was going
through Red Hat's site, I didn't see a link to his pages on certification.
Thank you for sending the pointer... and I hope Red Hat and Caldera
can unify their efforts.  We'll see.
<P>
As far as your comments on the pricing, I understand your concerns.
The struggle is to keep it affordable while also making it objective
(which I would do through exams).  In truth, Microsoft's MCSE program
could cost only $600 (the price of the 6 exams), although in practice
people spend much more for books and/or training classes.
<P>
Thanks for your feedback - and I look forward to whatever discussions 
evolve.

<P>
Ok, I've noticed one very strong theme in every message I have ever read
about Linux and how it won't be accepted as a desktop. Every message states
in one way or another, "if they see a command prompt, they will panic".  I am
appalled at how IT professionals view users as idiots and morons. I refuse
to call myself an IT professional because I help my users and clients use
their software and don't "just fix it when they mess it up". A user can
learn the command prompt quickly, and it's easier to teach than, "click on
start,settings,controlpanel,system,bla bla bla bla...." than, "just type
setupmodem and press enter" or whatever command or script you may like. I
have started to move all my clients to Linux starting with the servers,
saving them time and money. And I have a CEO that logs in as root and adds
and removes users at one location.  Users are much smarter than everyone
gives them credit for and a command prompt doesn't affect them as if the
devil just spoke from the speakers. If the IT departments around the world
put 1/5 the effort into educating the users than complaining about them,
then it would be a non-issue. As computer professionals, we are to keep
things running and educate our users, not sit on the pillar looking down
with the look of "what do you do to it now?"
<P>
As one last question, everyone says "I'll use Linux when it has a standard
GUI"... What is a standard GUI? Windows doesn't have one, Linux is the
closest thing to a standard GUI than anything else available.

I have had several kind souls, who have taken their time and energy, to
point me in a direction that I can help myself, and that is all anyone
can ask. Some have even tried to go even further and tried to help me
with a hard drive problem that I have. I would like to see someone try
that with the Windows crowd, you would most likely come up with an empty
mail box.
I think that says a lot about the type of people that uses Linux and I

Subject: <font color="maroon">suggestion for Linux security feature</font> 
<P>
I wonder if you can point me in the right direction to make a suggestion
for a new "feature" of Linux which could further help to differentiate it
in the marketplace, and which might really give it a LOT of exposure (good)
in today's security-conscious press...
<P>
The security of computer information has been in the press a lot lately,
detectability of "deleted" files on people's hard drives, "secret" files,
cache files, cookies, etc. which are out of the purview of the typical (and
maybe even the advanced!) user. People either think they've deleted things
which they haven't really expunged, or their files are infiltrated, perhaps
by a child (accidentally, of course!).
<P>
It seems to me quite possible to structure an OS like UNIX (and Linux in
particular, since it is under development by so many gifted people) in such
a way that all such files are created in a directory under the current
user's ownership, in a knowable and findable place, so that:
<P>
A. only that user could access their own cache, cookies, pointer files,
etc. I do not know how deleted files could be safeguarded in this way,
unless it is simply to encrypt everything. Hmmm.;
<P>
B. these files - the whole lot of them - could be scrubbed, wiped,
obliterated (that's why it's important for them to be in a known and
findable place) by their owner, without impairing the function of the
applications or the system, and without disturbing similar such files for
other users.
<P>
C. it would be nice too if there were a way to prevent the copying of
certain files, and that would include copying by backup programs (for
example, I'm a Mac user and we use Retrospect to back up some of our Macs;
there's a feature to suppress the backing up of a particular directory by
having a special character (a "bullet", or optn-8) at the beginning or end
of the directory name.) But if this could be an OS-level feature, it would
be stronger.
<P>
If I'm user X, and I want to get rid of my computer, or get rid of
everything that's mine on the computer, I should just be able to delete all
of my data files (and burn them or wipe them or otherwise overwrite that
area of the disk), which I can surely do today. But in addition, I should
know where to go to do the same thing with whatever system level files
might be out there, currently unbeknownst to me, and be able to expunge
them also, without affecting anything for anyone else.
<P>
Who would work on such a thing as this? Who would I suggest this to? Of
course, it's my idea. (c) Keith Gardner 1998. :) But if something like this
could be set up, wouldn't it go a long way in the press, in corporate and
government buying mind set, etc.?
<P>
I'm writing this very quickly, the idea really just came to me while
reading the NY Times this morning with an article (in Circuits, 10/8/98)
about computer security, and I am on my way out the door. I don't have time
to give it much polish. But I hope the ideas are clear enough. Let me know
what you think.
<P>
Thanks.<BR>

Subject: <font color="maroon">Availability of information for newbies</font> 
<P>
	The October issue of <I>Linux Gazette</I> featured a number of mail
messages from individuals seeking basic information on how to start up and
run a useful Linux system.  A common complaint among these individuals was
that basic information was not readily available, leading to the rather
humorous suggestion that anyone who operates a usable Linux system was
somehow "born with this information". :)
<P> 
This isn't the case.  There are a number of locations on the Web
which offer a great deal of information about the Linux operating system.
The best starting point is probably still the Linux Documentation
Project...
<P>
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/">
http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/</A> 
<P>
	(or at least that's where I always go... I understand there are
mirrors all over)
<P> 
This site features HOWTO documents on nearly every topic you can
imagine, along with current copies of the various Guides (everything from
the Installation and Getting Started Guide thru The Linux Users' Guide
thru The Linux Network Administrators' Guide, etc.).  I suspect that this
site either has the answer to your questions or has a link to someplace
else that does.  Definitely worth looking at...

My concern is that the free software alternative is going to its grave due to
out-dated core bindings to the standard old UNIX core.
<P>
In comp.os.plan9 there are discussions like:
<P>
| Hasn't the coolness of Linux worn off?  If you want true excitement with
| how cool an OS is and the fun of pioneering again, how about cloning
| Plan 9?
<P>
Later in the same thread:
<P>
| We need a new Linus to start writing a Plan 9 kernel.  GNU's Hurd doesn't
| go as far, as a cloned Plan 9 would.
<P>
And in other comp.os.* ... more...
<P>
I urge not to start all over again - but to modify that what is market 
recognized and stable. I think, unlike many other freeware enthusiasts, 
that there is a need for software infrastructure. A weak Linux would scatter
a lot of good work and inspirations. For a new alternative it would take far
too much time to reclaim the market confidence to freeware again.
<P>
I know that what I suggest, is far in terms of development in Linux and that 
Linux holds a legacy of strong infrastructure.
But I don't know if Linux, can tackle the infrastructure requirements 
building up after the first Internet pioneering..
<P>
Users in the MS-world see ACL:s and sharing (thus only the image) 
capabilities as a condition for selecting system.
Also the development trend is that of distributing services, not only inside
corporations but also trading with services distributed via CORBA or DCOM.
Also other not so heavy standards are emerging as P3P, and do require a more
distributive approach.
<P>
If we look at sharing with supposed "advanced" like CODA and AFS 
capabilities in file systems, that is just the beginning.
And I think only a symptom, of lacking structures inside UNIX. 
(CODA _is_ advanced in may aspects not issued here)
<P>
New Internet standards make UNIX applications handle more, and more security
features not compatible with the system.
Building walls in systems by not providing infrastructure is not good for 
freeware, it's not like Internet at all, not infrastructure.
<P>
The emerging operating system would be the most flexible in distributed 
security and compatible to old standards...
And the idea to use a freeware alternative is to be ahead and in control.
<P>
Are we still?
<P>
So for the Linux Ext2fs kernel 2.3 ACL development:
Do embed [domain][gid/uid][rights] for ACL-enteries!
<P>
Don't forget that:<BR> 
Linux is like windows to the whole OS-arena but on the "open/free" OS arena.
And software is like infrastructure. - nothing but smaller differences 
are necessary to gain market.
As roads they need to be compatible with most cars, but still improve.
Now some infrastructures are gradually being implemented that set new 
standards to cars, it's a bad idea not to take advantage of these standards.

Great issue.  It will take me some time to absorb even some of the
information and good ideas presented here.
<P>
I particularly benefited from "Thoughts about Linux," by Jurgen Defurne and
"DialMon: The Linux/Windows diald Monitor," by Mike Richardson.  I have not
had time to read the rest yet.

<P> 
October 17, 1998, Smithers, B.C.<BR> 
There is a lot of criticism of Linux that goes more or less like this - "Well if it was so hot it
would cost something. Everything free is no good."
<P> 
It isn't necessarily so and it just isn't so.
<P> 
Copyright is a social vehicle for compensating creators of intellectual property. The copyright
expires eventually. Then the benefit of the intellectual work can, if it is of lasting value, be used
more widely and, in principle, at least, in perpetuity. This process and model are very familiar in
other fields of intellectual endeavor but are new to computer programming. If we look at the
body of english literature that fills our libraries and bookshelves, there is certainly no direct
correspondence between copyright and quality. All of Shakespeare, to take a favorite of mine, is
long out of copyright and is some of the best literature ever created. Or Mozart, or Dickens. You
make the list.
<P> 
The whole consumer software trip is too new for the copyright process and terms to have worked
themselves out full term. The concept of computer software as intellectual work, potentially of a
high calibre, is just too new for social understanding to be widespread. The idea that intellectual
work might be contributed and protected in such a way as to enlarge the realm of the possible in
the computer part of the public sphere certainly has a way to go in being got used to. 
<P> 
Does this mean that some of the criticism offered in superficial? To put it kindly, yes. The open
source software community is collaboratively creating a standard for computer software below
which any commercial vendor will fall at its peril. If you can have all this for free will you
actually pay to get an inferior product? Maybe by accident. But not twice. 

The growth of acceptance of Linux is a step in the spread of the idea of a body of public domain
imperative literature. Its quality is no more to be judged by its price than a Chopin waltz.
<P> 
I would be happy to discuss any of these ideas with coherent correspondents, and invite both
comment and criticism.
