JPython-1.0 Provides a Powerful Companion to Java
</H3> 
<P>
Date: Thu, 23 Jul 1998 08:59:43 -0700 (PDT)<BR> 
Reston, VA -- The Corporation for National Research Initiatives has
announced the release of JPython-1.0.  JPython is a freely available
implementation of the high-level, dynamic, object-oriented language
Python -- integrated seamlessly with the Java(TM) platform and
certified as 100% Pure Java(TM).
<P>
JPython's integration with Java draws on the strengths of the Java
platform.  JPython code can easily access any existing Java libraries
and JavaBeans.  The Java virtual machine allows JPython to statically
compile Python source code to Java bytecodes that will run anywhere
that Java does.  Through Java's support for dynamic class loading,
JPython can dynamically compile Python code to allow interactive use
while still achieving the performance of a true compiler.
<P>
Guido van Rossum created the Python language in the early 1990s, and it
has been used successfully in many interesting software projects since
then.
<P>
JPython completely implements the Python language in 100% Pure Java,
and is freely available in both source and binary form. In order to
implement Python's Perl5-compatible regular expressions, JPython
includes the outstanding OROMatcher(TM) regular expression engine
developed by Original Reusable Objects(TM) at <A
HREF="http://www.oroinc.com/">http://www.oroinc.com/</A> 
By
agreement, this regular expression engine is only distributed in binary
form. JPython can be found at <A HREF="http://www.python.org/jpython/">

       ticks and splitting a long sound file into separate tracks.

       a study project at the department of Information Technology and
       Systems (sub-department of Electrical Engineering) of the
       Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands. However,
