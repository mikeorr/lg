<p><strong>From Allen R Gunnerson on Sat, 11 Apr 1998 </strong></p>

<p><strong>I was told be several people that I can configure my loadlin so 
that my plug n play stuff in Win95 would be detected by Linux.  Right now, 
if I use dos mode, I lose all my hardware.  I have tried to configure my 
LTWin modem for Linux with no luck.......  </strong></p>

<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)" width="50" height="28"
	align="left" border="0">I 
	think you have two different issues embedded in here.
	 Plug -n- Play (hardware) is a fairly lame attempt in recent
	years to create PC hardware that autoconfigures itself.  
	When talking about ISA cards this is mostly just marketing
	fluff that fails in many configurations -- and is widely 
	called "Plug -n- Pray" by many of the support reps that 
	I know.

<br><br>
	"WinModems" are another issue.

<br><br>
	Let's start with the first issue:

<br><br>
	A typical PC has two (or three(*)) buses.  System "bus" is
	a hardware interface, with slots or connectors to multiple
	devices.  The original IBM PC (and XT) had 65 pin (8-bit)
	slots.  With the introduction of the AT IBM placed another 
	connector "end-to-end" with the original 65 pin slots
	-- which allowed many old "8-bit" cards to be used in 
	AT and even in modern systems.  These are called "16-bit
	ISA slots."  (The term ISA or "industry standard architecture"
	was coined after the fact -- near the introduction of 
	MCA (micro-channel architecture) and EISA (Extended ISA). 
	These hardware specifications have almost completely 
	disappeared).

<br><ul>
<li>(Technically a SCSI host adapter is a 
		   hardware bridge between your system bus
		   and its own SCSI bus.  This is actually a
		   subsystem -- so that doesn't really count
		   as a "system bus").

</ul><br>
	As the industry fought over MCA vs. EISA (largely resulting
	in the markets rejection of <em>both</em> of them -- due to the 
	crass attempts at exploiting proprietary designs by major
	vendors of each) the clone manufacturers -- particularly the
	motherboard and video engineers -- created a high speed
	32 bit bus called "VESA local bus" or 'VLB' for short.  
	VESA is the "video electronics standards association" although
	there were eventually a variety of disk and network controllers
	that plugged into VLB slots.

<br><br>
	These were the rule for late 386 and throughout most of the
	486 era (if a period of only 5 years can be called an "era").

<br><br>
	With the introduction of the Pentium, Intel also created a
	number of chipsets and introduced a new bus/interface called
	"PCI" (sorry I don't remember what the abbreviation stands
	for -- something like "peripheral to CPU interconnect").

<br><br>
	I don't know alot of the low level details about PCI vs. 
	VLB.  I've heard that there were very good technical reasons
	why VLB couldn't be used in Pentium systems.  I've also 
	heard that Intel rammed their spec down everyone's throats
	in a way that has resulted in their clear domination of
	the chipset market <em>as well as</em> the CPU market.

<br><br>
	Prior to this there were a number of companies selling
	chipsets (all the support circuitry that connects the CPU,
	the memory, the bus(es), and other interfaces to the motherboard
	(like the keyboard connector).  Now there are practically 
	no other companies selling chipsets.  It seems that all of the
	motherboard manufacturers have been forced to use various
	Intel chipsets (Neptune, Triton, etc).  I've heard that some
	of these have had bugs as notorious as some of their CPU's.

<br><br>
	One problem that has persisted through all of this is that
	a typical PC owner has had to manually keep track of how
	each device on the system was integrated with the others.
	Any individual card might require an IRQ (interupt request),
	some I/O port addresses, a DMA channel, and/or some 
	"reserved address space" (for memory mapped I/O between the 
	0xA0000 and the 0xFFFFF regions).  

<br><br>
	There are only a pitifully limited number of each of these 
	resources.  The original PC only had 8 IRQ lines on a 
	single PIC (programmable interrupt controller).  A modern
	PC still only has 15 -- accomplished by "cascading" one
	PIC off of the IRQ 2 of the other.  

<br><br>
	Of these the system timer, keyboard, the real-time clock 
	and the FPU (floating point unit) are already taken up -- 
	as well as two serial ports, a hard disk controller (IDE, 
	SCSI, or any other).  Usually there is also one associated
	with each LPT port and one for any bus mouse interface that 
	we have.  That leaves nine to be distributed between each of 
	our SCSI, ethernet, sound and other cards.   Sound cards often 
	take up <em>two</em> of these incredibly scarce resources.

<br><br>
	As if the scarcity weren't enough of a problem, complexity --
	the fact that every user has to keep track of these for every
	system -- was a major kicker.  This has been a major failing
	of the PC architecture.  The priority of "backward compatibility"
	as left us with a "backwards architecture."

<br><br>
	Plug and Pray was an attempt to relieve some of that complexity
	(though it does nothing to resolve the underlying problems of
	scarcity -- which are deeply ingrained design limitations).  
	It has helped somewhat -- but it requires that all of the 
	components of the systems (hardware and OS) conform to the 
	same spec.  A PnP system can work with some old ISA cards,
	some of the time.  The real problem comes when you use
	multi-boot configuration (as you're doing between DOS and
	Linux) -- since each of these may try to "tune" the 
	configuration to itself.

<br><br>
        The "universal serial bus" (USB) and the 
        "<a href="http://devworld.apple.com/dev/FireWire/">Firewire</a>" 
        specifications offer some hope of relieving the issue of scarcity.  
        Like SCSI these provide an adapter to a semi-intelligent "bus" of
        external peripherals.  In effect the adapter uses one PC IRQ and 
	I/O port range -- and negotiates/arbitrates among many devices on 
	its own bus using its own discrimination logic.

<br><br>
	However, it looks like it will take some time for practical
	devices to become widely available in USB form.  So far there
	are a few digital cameras and scanners that support it --- and
	no modems, ISDN TA's, terminals (or null modem adapters), X-10
	powerhouse, or other toys.  Ideally someone would make a 
	couple of models of parallel-USB and RS232-USB bridges so I could
	use existing devices (like parallel port Zip drives and flatbed
	scanners) with my new USB equipment.  It looks like the 
	hardware companies would much rather force us to all buy all new
	peripherals --- and to get peripherals that aren't usable on any
	platform other than a PC.  

<br><br>
	Naturally we can see that Microsoft will benefit from these and 
	any form of "WinModem" or proprietary software drivers for 
	peripherals.  I can't think of anything that will perpetuate the
	status quo of this market more effectively than that short-sighted
	attitude among hardware vendors.
