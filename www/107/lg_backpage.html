<pre>"World domination. Fast."  

"...and scantily clad females, of course. Who cares if it's below zero outside."
 -- Linus Torvalds
</pre>

<p> Linux - according to LG's motto, certainly - is fun. Let's face it;
you're sweating over that antique piece of hardware and cursing it and its
entire ancestry to smithereens (no, you can't get Cray-class performance
from your 386SX. Not even with Linux.) because it's what you actually
<em>enjoy</em> doing - at some level, anyway. Work motivated by fun is, in
fact, the most powerful kind of productive ethic; it causes programmers to
stay up into the wee hours for days on end, pounding away on the keyboard
in Deep Hack mode, and keeps you looking for solutions long after a
"sensible" person would have given up (um... if you <strong>do</strong>
manage that Cray trick, be sure to let me know.) Money alone is not and
cannot be the motivator for that level of involvement.

<p> Just as a random example, the amount of energy I personally have put
into tweaking Linux systems over the years could easily power, say, Los
Angeles for the next few centuries - even if everybody there switched to
Linux and left their machines on 24/7. Mind you, I didn't do this because
there was anything wrong; it was always due to some FAQ, HOWTO, or even an
article right here in LG written by another whirl-eyed Linux maniac: "Here,
just try a little of <strong>this</strong> - it can't hurt you, it's
<strong><em>Open Source</em></strong>!" Meanwhile, this little critter
perched on my sinister scapula (red suit, horns, etc. - if you're going to
anthropomorphize, you might as well do it <em>right</em>) would
whisper in my ear: "Come on... you know you want to... just <em>one</em>
little file in <code>/etc</code>, what could it possibly hurt?" 

<p> Riiight...

<p> After days of fixing up the latest disaster I had wrought, I would
swear on large stacks of religious books and every holy symbol known to
<code>man(1)</code> and <code>alien(1)</code> that I would never,
<strong>ever</strong>, mess with my beautifully-running system again...
while the little guy with the pitchfork hummed a little ditty:

<pre>"A little learning is a dangerous thing; 
Drink deep, or taste not the Pyrrhean spring..."
(Alexander Pope)
</pre>

<p> <em>&lt;sigh&gt;</em> My friends think I'm going bald because I'm getting older.
Linux CDs should come with a printed warning; something about "dangerous to
sanity, sleep habits, and hair retention". 

<p> Sure, there must be people somewhere out there that can just pop in a
RedHat/SuSE/Mandrake/whatever CD, run the install, and walk away. I mean,
theoretically it's possible. But... where's the fun? Where's the challenge?
Where is the <em>juice?</em> Besides, even those people, nametag-wearing
corporate drones that they must be, get caught by the Penguin Syndrome
eventually: they'll wake up one day and find themselves sitting at a
keyboard, a mile deep in "sendmail.cf", fingers cramped from hours of
typing. It is then that they'll know the secret shame of Penguin passion,
and find themselves guiltily hiding their scribbled notes on upgrading
their Apache server...

<p><img src="misc/okopnik/ride-on.jpg" alt="If you can read this, my Penguin
fell off!" title="If you can read this, my Penguin fell off!" hspace="20"
align="left">

<p> These days, we <strong>do</strong> have trivially-easy setups for Linux
- the single-user surf/email/word processor workstation that is all your
Grandma wants is, again, just a single-CD boot away (Knoppix, Morphix, and
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Debian/installers.html">many, many other
variants</a> exist.) However, if you want top performance out of one of these
powerful Linux beasts, or if you want to make your computer do things that
are considered impossible in other OSes, you have to learn a good bit of
Quantum Wrenchology - as my motorcycling friends used to say, "if you don't
wrench, you don't ride". This is effort that pays for itself, though, in
multiple ways. (A word of warning, for those starting down this path: the
mechanic's curse is The Ultimate Machine, the one that will do
unprecedented things, run faster than a speeding bullet, and do it all on
half a drop of fuel... <em>as soon as he finishes putting it together</em>.
Meanwhile, he drives a barely-running 1919 GetOut'n'Push. Beware of getting
caught in the loop.)

<p> I don't know about the rest of you, but I personally get a real charge
out of riding down Computer Highway, alternately chuckling at and pitying
the poor Micro$oft users stranded by the roadside in their forlorn
millions; cell phones glued to their ears, frantic expressions on their
faces, calling their haughty unreachable mechanics who'll charge them vast
amounts of money for work that <strong>will</strong> fail, again and
again... while we continue rolling down the road in our rapidly-growing
numbers, engines snarling with barely-restrained power.

<p> See you all out there. Keep the rubber side down.

Ben is the Editor-in-Chief for Linux Gazette and a member of The Answer Gang.

<em>
<p>
Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became interested in electricity
at the tender age of six, promptly demonstrated it by sticking a fork into
a socket and starting a fire, and has been falling down technological
mineshafts ever since. He has been working with computers since the Elder
Days, when they had to be built by soldering parts onto printed circuit
boards and programs had to fit into 4k of memory. He would gladly pay good
money to any psychologist who can cure him of the recurrent nightmares.

<p>His subsequent experiences include creating software in nearly a dozen
languages, network and database maintenance during the approach of a
hurricane, and writing articles for publications ranging from sailing
magazines to technological journals. After a seven-year Atlantic/Caribbean
cruise under sail and passages up and down the East coast of the US, he is
currently anchored in St. Augustine, Florida. He works as a technical
instructor for Sun Microsystems and a private Open Source consultant/Web
developer. His current set of hobbies includes flying, yoga, martial arts,
motorcycles, writing, and Roman history; his Palm Pilot is crammed full of
alarms, many of which contain exclamation points.

<p>He has been working with Linux since 1997, and credits it with his complete
loss of interest in waging nuclear warfare on parts of the Pacific Northwest.
