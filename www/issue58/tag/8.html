	>Free Linux ISPs in France</H3>


<p><strong>From Wilf on Sat, 2 Sep 2000  
</strong></p>

<p><em>There've been a number of requests about ISPs offering "free"
	(but paid by ads) services and accepting rather than rejecting
	Linux users.  If you're in Europe, Wilf's answer may be handy...
	and if not, his warnings are still worth regarding. -- Heather</em></p>

Hello LGs,
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Users in France may now choose quite a few ISPs which offer
1, 2, 3, ... 12 hours free of charge (that's to say connection, personnel
web space, phone costs within a local area...).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Alas, some inconveniences are:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><ol>
<li>(having to) accept extensive advertising which (once your surfing analyzed)
will be tailored accordingly (someone MUST pay, mustn't s/he ? 
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/unsmily.gif" ALT=":-{" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">.
I skip details on restrictions and services which vary from one ISP to another.

<li>most of 'em are aimed for (un)lucky Windows (Windoze?) users. Win 3.11 is
almost always left out, and Linux even more so.
</ol></BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><em>Exactly why everyone has been asking...</em></p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Having called an ISP (Free, to be precise), I received a letter and a CD in a
surprisingly short time which included necessary information (login,
password, POP, SMTP, DNS1 and DNS2, News and Email addresses and some example
scripts for Linux which I strangely did not need at all) to configure
programmes (under Linux, you've guessed it) which worked fine... after two
nights' spent on configuring kppp.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Users in France may check 
<a href="http://www.free.fr/">www.free.fr</a>
for information regarding the "<em>points
d'accès</em>" within their region of residence. They, at Free, do not 
impose such and such OS: you are free to use Windows and/or Linux or any 
other OS capable of handling Internet's protocols and some such programmes.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This leads me to furnish a piece of information users of OLITEC modems might
find to be just what they needed to get <em>at last</em> connected:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
I use (under <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> 6.0) a modem of 
Olitec, the Self Memory 56000 V90/K56Flex,
which kppp recognized straight away. However, hours and quite a couple of beers
later, the connection was still not established, raising not only the phone bill
but also resulting in a what now appears to be a somewhat bold head, until I
checked out the configuration file of kppp (under the influence of suggestions
made by a friend who cared to spend the nights in front of my compy, and not, as
you might have suspected, under the influence of the brew, honest, we weren't
blotto at all). Besides, fancy having a good look at his personnel (French)
pages he painfully created under Linux and want to learn (or indulge yourself
in reminiscences) about that famous "racing car" Gordini or R8? Check out
<a href="http://www.amicale1134.cigale.net/">www.amicale1134.cigale.net</a>, 
it is for you!
Well, on then: in kppp, the option "<tt>Periphery / End of Line</tt>" is set 
to "CR" by default, which the above named modem needs to be set to "../../LF". 
This done, the connection was immediate and I could surf (which I did, in fact) !!!
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Worthwhile noting, though: kppp runs without a problem when used under root,
other users, however, need be in a group especially created and given
the rights to use kppp! Being new to Linux, I haven't yet figured out how to
create a group and get my current "none-root user" into it. Anyone care to help,
please?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><em>There is a file called /etc/group which declares what groups exist
	and which users are members of them.  You can also be a member of
	a group if its number is your gid in the /etc/passwd file (that's
	your default group).  So add your own username to the right group
	line in /etc/group (multiple users are seperated by comma, spaces
	are not needed). -- Heather</em></p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Another information regards reducing phone bills: again, users in France should
contact France Telecom and subscribe to "Primaliste Internet" at 9,91 FRF (or
1,51 Euro) per month which gives a discount of 50% on local calls using ONE
chosen phone number and made between the (nightly) hours 22:00 and 8:00 (that's
10 p.m. to 8 a.m., if you prefer) at 0,07 cts (or 0,01 Euro) per minute (I guess
"Night time is the Right time", but not really an excuse to neglect your Missis!).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Finally, a personnel request to those writing articles or documentations for
Linux Gazette in English (be that British or American or in general): I have
taken up to translating some of them (articles, that is) and have 
<em>not often though</em> quite some difficulties when it comes to translate (or even guess) what
the author wanted to say.  Please be precise! Phrases like "I youz, but it no
working, pleaz hep!" don't mean much, particularly when translated. Never mind
spelling mistakes (even God left out where/how/why he lives...), but use nouns
or name "the things" instead. And, keep your articles coming in! (Hmmm, I hope
editors of LG aren't grumbling so much about this invitation 
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":-}" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><em>Quite the contraire, mon ami!  We love to see new translations.
	And, while encouraging our readers to clearer sentences, I'd also
	like to encourage a bit more that helps all of us help you:
<ul><li>Please state what sort of thing doesn't work
	<li>Please try to tell us what you were expecting it to do
	<li>...and what you tried already ("everything" doesn't cut it -
	it might actually help us realize what's going on, to know what 
	sort of everyday thing didn't work; or you might have missed 
	something that we, more experienced as we are, think was clear
	enough to be part of "everything" we'd try.)</ul>
Or as I used to say, "what sort of <strong>doesn't work</strong> is it 
doing, and um, which <strong>it</strong> was that anyway?" -- Heather
	</em></p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Wishing you all, at LG and 'round the globe, good continuation (and "bon
apétit <TT>/</TT> enjoy your meal" in case you're dining...) and, of course: "ETAHI, ERUA,
ETORU !!!", 
<br>Sincerely Yours, Wilf (as opposed to Howling Wolf as is ham to
bacon
