<h2>News in General</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Novell wins Final Linux Legal Battle</h3>
<p>After years of litigation, all of the SCO claims have been denied and 
it will be going into bankruptcy hearings in July - which had been 
delayed until the final judgement.</p>

<p>As noted on the Groklaw web site, Judge Ted Stewart ruled for Novell 
and against SCO. Futhermore, SCO's claims for breach of the implied 
covenant of fair dealings were also denied in the June jugement.</p>

<p>Here is the major part of Novell's statement from June 11:</p>

<p>"Yesterday, United States District Court Judge Ted Stewart issued a 
Final Judgment regarding the long standing dispute between SCO Group 
and Novell. As part of the decision, the Court reaffirmed the earlier 
jury verdict that Novell maintained ownership of important UNIX 
copyrights, which SCO had asserted to own in its attack on the Linux 
computer operating system. The Court also issued a lengthy Findings of 
Fact and Conclusions of Law wherein it determined that SCO was not 
entitled to an order requiring Novell to transfer the UNIX copyrights 
because "Novell had purposely retained those copyrights." In addition, 
the Court concluded that SCO was obligated to recognize Novell's 
waiver of SCO's claims against IBM and other companies, many of whom 
utilize Linux." </p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">One Laptop per Child and Marvell To Redefine Tablet Computing</h3>
<p>In an agreement that could provide advanced, affordable tablet 
computers to classrooms throughout the world,  One Laptop per Child 
(OLPC), a global organization helping to provide every child in the 
world access to a modern education, and Marvell, a leader in 
integrated silicon solutions, will jointly develop a family of 
next-generation OLPC XO tablet computers based on the Marvell Moby 
reference design.  This new partnership will provide designs and 
technologies to enable a range of new educational tablets, delivered 
by OLPC and other education industry leaders, aimed at schools in both 
the U.S. and developing markets. Marvell is also announcing today it 
has launched Mobylize, a campaign to improve technology adoption in 
America's classrooms. </p>
 
<p>The new family of XO tablets will incorporate elements and new 
capabilities based on feedback from the nearly 2 million children and 
families around the world who use the current XO laptop.  The XO 
tablet will require approximately one watt of power to operate 
compared to about 5 watts necessary for the current XO laptop.  The XO 
tablet will also feature a multi-lingual soft keyboard with touch 
feedback, and will also feature an application to directly access more 
than 2 million free books available across the Internet. </p>

<p>The first tablets in the line will be based closely on the Moby, <em>not</em> 
the XO-3 design, and will focus more on children in the developed world. 
These will be on display at CES 2011 in January, and available next 
year for under $100. The original XO-3 design is still planned for 
2012 and will benefit from the experience of both the XO-1.75 and the 
Moby efforts.</p>

<p>"The Moby tablet platform - and our partnership with OLPC - represents 
our joint passion and commitment to give students the power to learn, 
create, connect and collaborate in entirely new ways," said Weili Dai, 
Marvell's Co-founder and Vice President and General Manager of the 
Consumer and Computing Business Unit. "Marvell's cutting edge 
technology - including live content, high quality video (1080p full-HD 
encode and decode), high performance 3D graphics, Flash 10 Internet 
and two-way teleconferencing - will fundamentally improve the way 
students learn by giving them more efficient, relevant - even fun 
tools to use.  Education is the most pressing social and economic 
issue facing America.  I believe the Marvell Moby tablet can ignite a 
life-long passion for learning in all students everywhere." </p>

<p>Powered by a high-performance, highly scalable, and low-power Marvell 
ARMADA 610 application processor, the Moby tablet features gigahertz 
processor speed, 1080p full-HD encode and decode, intelligent power 
management, power-efficient Marvell 11n Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/FM/GPS 
connectivity, high performance 3D graphics and support for multiple 
platforms including full Adobe Flash, Android, Windows Mobile and 
Ubuntu.  The Moby platform also features a built-in camera for live 
video conferencing, multiple simultaneous viewing screens and 
Marvell's 11n Mobile Hotspot which allows Wi-Fi access that supports 
up to eight concurrent users connected to the Internet via a cellular 
broadband connection. The ultra low power mobile tablet has a very 
long battery life. </p>

<p>Moby is currently being piloted in at-risk schools in Washington, DC, 
and Marvell is investing in a Mobylize campaign to improve tech 
adoption within US classrooms. This should help OLPC in the developed 
world.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">One Laptop Per Child To Provide Laptops To High Schools</h3>
<p>In June, One Laptop per Child (OLPC) was awarded a bid by Plan Ceibal 
to provide 90,000 updated XO laptops for high school students in 
Uruguay. This is the first time the OLPC XO laptops have been 
specifically designed for high school-aged students and represents a 
major expansion in its global learning program. </p>

<p>The XO high school laptop (XO-H) is built on the XO-1.5 platform and 
based on a VIA processor. it will provide 2X the speed of the XO 1.0, 
4X DRAM memory, and 4X Flash memory. The XO-H is designed with a larger 
keyboard that is better suited to the larger hands and fingers of older 
students. It will feature the learning-focused Sugar user interface on 
top of a dual-boot Linux operating system, with Gnome Desktop 
Environment that offers office productivity tools.</p>
 
<p>The XO-H will be delivered with age-appropriate learning programs 
adapted to the scholastic needs of secondary schools. A new color 
variation for the laptop's case (light and dark blue) will be an 
option for the high school model. The XO, specially designed for 
rugged environments, is well-suited for remote classrooms and daily 
transportation between home and school. The XO uses three times less 
electricity than other laptops and is built as a sealed, dust-free 
system. </p>

<p>The government of Uruguay through Plan Ceibal has completely saturated 
primary schools with 380,000 XOs and will now begin to expand the 
highly successful One Laptop per Child learning program to its high 
schools. There are 230,000 high school students in Uruguay.</p>
 
<p>"Until now, the 1.5 million students worldwide using XO laptops had no 
comparable computer to 'grow up' to," said OLPC Association CEO 
Rodrigo Arboleda. "The XO high school edition laptop demonstrates how 
the XO and its software can easily adapt to the needs of its users."</p>

<p>One Laptop per Child (OLPC at <a href="http://www.laptop.org">http://www.laptop.org</a>) is a non-profit 
organization created by Nicholas Negroponte and others from the MIT 
Media Lab to design, manufacture and distribute laptop computers that 
are inexpensive enough to provide every child in the world access to 
knowledge and modern forms of education.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Swype Beta for Android OS</h3>
<p>Swype is offering a narrowcast Beta on its updated Android keyboard 
application.  This application interprets word choices in real time 
from a dictionary database as a user slides a finger between letters 
in a continuous motion. </p>

<p>The Swype software is very tightly written with a total memory 
footprint of under 1 MB.</p>

<p>The patented technology enables users to input words faster and easier 
than other data input methods - over 50 words per minute. The 
application is designed to work across a variety of devices such as 
phones, tablets, game consoles, kiosks, televisions, virtual screens 
and more.</p>

<p>A key advantage to Swype is that there is no need to be very accurate, 
enabling very rapid text entry. Swype has been designed to run in 
real time on relatively low-powered portable devices.</p>

<p>The beta software has built-in dictionaries for English, Spanish, and 
Italian.  The beta software supports phones with HVGA (480h x 320w), 
WVGA (800h x 480w) and WVGA854(854h x 480w) screen sizes (screen size 
is detected by the software).</p>

<p>Here are some details on the beta:<br />
* It will be open for a limited time;<br />
* Initially, only English, Spanish, and Italian - more languages to 
come;<br />
* Some key features of Swype require OEM integration;<br />
* Limited End User Support - mostly forum.</p>

<p>If your phone came pre-installed with Swype, DO NOT download this beta 
(it won't work).</p>

<p>The beta is open to all phones using Android which do not already have 
Swype pre-installed. For more information on Swype and the current 
beta test, go to: <a href="http://beta.swype.com/">http://beta.swype.com/</a>.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Novell Releases SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Service Pack 1</h3>
<p>Novell released SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Service Pack 1 (SP1) in May, 
which delivers broad virtualization capabilities, high availability 
clustering, and more flexible maintenance and support options.</p>
 
<p>SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP1 is optimized for physical, virtuali, and 
 cloud infrastructures and offers numerous advancements, including: 
Broad virtualization support, including the latest Xen 4.0 hypervisor 
with significantly improved virtual input/output performance, support 
for KVM, an emerging open source virtualization hypervisor, and Linux 
integration components in Hyper-V - an industry first. 
Best open source high-availability solution, with clustering advances 
such as support for metro area clusters, simple node recovery with 
ReaR, a source disaster recovery framework, and new administrative 
tools including a cluster simulator and web-based GUI.
First enterprise Linux distribution with an updated 2.6.32 kernel, 
which leverages the RAS features in Intel Xeon processor 7500 and 5600 
series.</p>
<p>New technology on the desktop, including improved audio and Bluetooth 
support, as well as the latest versions of Firefox, OpenOffice.org and 
Evolution, which includes MAPI enhancements for improved 
interoperability with Microsoft Exchange.</p>

<p>With SP1, Novell is implementing more flexible support options that 
will allow customers to remain on older package releases during the 
product's life cycle, and will significantly lower the hurdle to 
deploy upcoming service packs. While current releases deliver the most 
value with proactive maintenance updates and patches, for customers 
that place a premium on stability, this program delivers superior 
control and flexibility by allowing them to decide when and how to 
upgrade.</p>

<p>Long Term Service Pack Support will continue to be available for 
customers that want full technical support and fixes backported to 
earlier releases.</p>

<p>IBM and other component, system, and software vendors like AMD, 
Broadcom, Brocade, Dell, Emulex, Fujitsu, HP, Intel, LSI, Microsoft, 
nVidia, QLogic and SGI leverage Partner Linux Driver Program tools to 
support their third-party technology with SUSE Linux Enterprise. 
Novell's partners provide more than 5,000 certified applications today 
for SUSE Linux Enterprise, twice that of the next closest enterprise 
Linux distribution provider.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Apache Announces Cassandra Release 0.6 distributed data store</h3>

<p>The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) - developers, stewards, and 
incubators of 138 Open Source projects - has announced Apache 
Cassandra version 0.6, the Project's latest release  since its 
graduation from the ASF Incubator in February 2010.</p>

<p>Apache Cassandra is an advanced, second-generation "NoSQL" distributed 
data store that has a shared-nothing architecture. The Cassandra 
decentralized model provides massive scalability, and is highly 
available with no single point of failure even under the worst 
scenarios.</p>

<p>Originally developed at Facebook and submitted to the ASF Incubator in 
2009, the Project has added more than a half-dozen new committers, and 
is deployed by dozens of high-profile users such as Cisco WebEx, 
Cloudkick, Digg, Facebook, Rackspace, Reddit, and Twitter, among 
others.</p>

<p>"The services we provide to customers are only as good the systems 
they are built on," said Eric Evans, Apache Cassandra committer and 
Systems Architect at The Rackspace Cloud. "With Cassandra, we get the 
fault-tolerance and availability our customers demand, and the 
scalability we need to make things work."</p>

<p>Cassandra 0.6 features include:<br />
* Support for Apache Hadoop: this allows running analytic queries with 
the leading map/reduce framework against data in Cassandra;<br />
* Integrated row cache: this eliminates the need for a separate 
caching layer, thereby simplifying architectures;<br />
* Increased speed: this builds on Cassandra's ability to process 
thousands of writes per second, allowing applications to cope with 
increasing write loads.</p>

<p>"Apache Cassandra 0.6 is 30% faster across the board, building on our 
already-impressive speed," said Jonathan Ellis, Apache Cassandra 
Project Management Committee Chair. "It achieves scale-out without 
making the kind of design compromises that result in operations teams 
getting paged at 2 AM."</p>

<p>Twitter switched to Apache Cassandra because it can run on large 
server clusters and is capable of taking in very large amounts of data 
at a time. Storage Team Technical Lead Ryan King explained, "At 
Twitter, we're deploying Cassandra to tackle scalability, flexibility 
and operability issues in a way that's more highly available and cost 
effective than our current systems."</p>

<p>Released under the Apache Software License v2.0, Apache Cassandra 0.6 
can be downloaded at <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">http://cassandra.apache.org/</a>.</p>


<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Primal Launches Semantic Web Tools</h3>

<p>Paving the way to a Web 3.0 Internet, Primal announced its Primal 
Thought Networking platform and beta version of its newest service, 
Pages, from the 2010 Semantic Technology Conference in June. </p>
 
<p>Delivered on the  Software as a Service (SaaS) model, the Primal 
Thought Networking platform, using semantic synthesis, helps content 
producers to expand their digital footprint and improve engagement 
with their consumers, at lower cost. For consumers, the platform 
delivers a more personalized experience that is based on content 
relevant to their thoughts and ideas. Rather than sifting through page 
after page of content, the Thought Networking platform's software 
assistants automate the filtering processes, delivering more relevant 
content. </p>
 
<p>In addition to the launch of the Thought Networking platform, Primal 
also introduced the beta version of its newest offering, Pages. With 
Pages, users can now quickly generate an entire Web presence based on a 
topic relevant to their interests, which then may be explored, 
customized and shared with friends or the general public.  The Pages 
beta website generator utilizes Semantic Web technology that goes 
beyond the simple facilitation of content discovery, pulling 
information from sites like Wikipedia, Yahoo!, and Flickr, delivering 
relevant and useful content in a centralized view in real-time. </p>
 
<p>"Semantic synthesis is the ability to create in real time a semantic 
graph of what I need.  With our growing portfolio of IP and patents, 
we have spent the past several years developing an intuitive 
technology that annotates a person's thoughts and ideas," said 
Primal's Founder and Co-President Peter Sweeney, speaking live from 
the Semantic Technology Conference. "On the content manufacturing plane, 
we provide content developers with a completely new market of content 
but will also enable an entirely untapped group of people who would 
not otherwise have the technical aptitude, but have big ideas to 
share, to quickly and easily become content developers."</p>
 
<p>Using Primal's semantic synthesis technology, teachers will be able to 
seamlessly build a website of course materials for their students; 
hobbyists can create a one-stop, definitive source of information for 
their pastime; politicians can build hyper-local, targeted sites 
featuring local activities and news in support of their constituents.</p>

gigabit router, its model TEW-691GR. Designed for high performance and 
quality of service, this router uses three external antennas to 
broadcast on the 2.4GHz spectrum. </p>

<p>Three spatial streams per antenna produce a record 450Mbps theoretical 
wireless throughput. Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antenna 
technology boosts wireless coverage, signal strength, and throughput 
speed. One gigabit Wide Area Network port and four gigabit Local Area 
Network ports also offer very fast wired throughput performance.</p>

<p>Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) integrates other WPS supported wireless 
adapters at the touch of a button. Instead of entering complicated 
encryption codes, simply press the WPS button on the TEW-691GR, then 
press the WPS button on a compatible wireless adapter, confirm you 
would like to connect, and the devices automatically exchange 
information and connect. The router is compatible with IEEE 802.11n 
and backward compatible with IEEE 802.11g/b/a devices.</p>

<p>Advanced wireless encryption and a secure firewall offer protection 
for digital networks. Router setup is fast and intuitive. WMM Quality 
of Service (QoS) technology prioritizes gaming, Internet calls, and 
video streams.</p>

<p>"TRENDnet's ability to launch this ground breaking 450Mbps product 
ahead of other brands says a lot about our recent growth," stated Pei 
Huang, President and CEO of TRENDnet. "We are ecstatic to set a new 
performance threshold in the consumer wireless revolution."</p>

<p>The MSRP for the TEW-691GR is U.S. $199.00.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">TRENDnet Launches Two High Speed USB 3.0 Adapters </h3>

<p>TRENDnet in June announced the availability of PC cards that add USB 
3.0 Ports to both desktops and laptops. The adapters add two super 
speed 5Gbps USB 3.0 ports that can transfer content from USB 3.0 
storage devices, flash drives, and camcorders at 5Gbps speeds, which 
are 10 times faster than USB 2.0. </p>

<p>TRENDnet's 2-Port USB 3.0 ExpressCard Adapter, model TU3-H2EC, plugs 
into any available ExpressCard port on a laptop computer to provide 
two USB 3.0 ports. A power adapter provides full power to all 
connected USB 3.0 devices. Backward compatibility allows users to 
connect USB 2.0 devices to the USB 3.0 ports.</p>

<p>The 2-Port USB 3.0 PCI Express Adapter, model TU3-H2PIE, connects to 
an available PCI Express port on a tower computer. A 4-pin power port 
connects to an internal power supply in order to provide full power to 
all connected USB 3.0 devices. Backward compatibility allows users to 
connect USB 2.0 devices to the USB 3.0 ports. </p>

<p>"USB 3.0 is like HD television - once you experience it, you won't go 
back," stated Zak Wood, Director of Global Marketing for TRENDnet. 
"The tremendous speed advantage of USB 3.0 (5Gbps) versus USB 2.0 
(480Mbps) is driving strong consumer adoption. TRENDnet's user 
friendly adapters upgrade existing computers to high speed 5Gbps USB 
3.0."</p>

<p>TRENDnet's 2-Port USB 3.0 ExpressCard Adapter, model TU3-H2EC, will be 
available from online and retail partners shortly. The MSRP for the 
TU3-H2EC is U.S. $59.</p>

<p>TRENDnet's 2-Port USB 3.0 PCI Express Adapter, model TU3-H2PIE, will 
be available from online and retail partners shortly. The MSRP for the 
TU3-H2PIE is U.S. $49.</p>
