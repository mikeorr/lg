 <br><br>Ha!  Dream on!  I'm decloaking and posting just because I'm
 glad to meet another living dinosaur. I, too, have too much
 experience with and an irrational attachment to FoxPlus.

<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif"width="50" height="28" alt="(!)"
align="left" border="0">
	I presume Fox-Plus is an xBase product related or
	similar to FoxPro.  If so you might look at WorkGroup
	Solutions "Flagship"
	(<A HREF="http://www.wgs.com/fsad.html">http://www.wgs.com/fsad.html</A>).

<br><br>
	This is a full dBase compatible system, and xBase
	compiler.  (Actually I think it does a "compile to
	C" --- then you'd use <TT>gcc</TT> to actually produce your
	binaries.  That makes it more portable I suppose).

<br><br>
	You could also look at Christopher B. Browne's
	incredible annotated link farm of Linux business and
	productivity applications:

<blockquote><code><A HREF="http://www.hex.net/~cbbrowne/"
		>http://www.hex.net/~cbbrowne/</A>
</code></blockquote>
	... which has a page specifically one xBase dbms packages
	for Linux at: <A HREF="http://www.ntlug.org/~cbbrowne/rdbms05.html"
		><TT>http://www.ntlug.org/~cbbrowne/rdbms05.html</TT></A>

<br><br>
	Oddly enough Christopher doesn't mention
	<A HREF="http://www.versasoft.com/">Versasoft</A>'s dbMan
	(dbMan IV or dbMan 5.x).  Perhaps the product has been
	discontinued.  I couldn't find any URL for it though there
	are a number of references.  I just guessed at "versasoft.com"
	and glanced at their web site, which only mentions one
	product (VersaTOOLS; a FoxPro add-on?).  I've blind-copied
	the one e-mail address listed thereon, so that he can
	respond with any info on the fate of dbMan, if he feels so
	inclined.

<br><br>
	So in answer to your question:

<br><br>
		Yes!  Dream on!  There are dbms apps for Linux,
		and you DON'T have to use SQL.

<br><br>
	(Also, if you ever want to work with a dbms package that's
	less like "DOS" and xBase, nothing like SQL and more like Unix
	shell script programming, look at Revolutionary Software's
	package: <A HREF="http://www.rdb.com/"><TT>/rdb</TT></A> -- they have a
	Linux version.  Apparently this <TT>/rdb</TT> is related to Rand/Hobbs
	RDB -- <A HREF="http://www.ntlug.org/~cbbrowne/rdbms07.html"
	>Christopher's pages</A> talk about this a little bit.

 I made my living pushing the limits of Sco FoxPlus for five
 years, starting in 1989, making it do things it was never
 meant to do.  It is frustrating that so many people  think
 that SQL and Relational are synonyms, and that Relational
 and XBase are mutually exclusive.  Every database application
 I created with FoxPlus conformed to the Relational data
 model.  There is nothing in FoxPlus to prevent this.

<br><br>
 Please let me know if you find anything FoxPlus-esque that
 works under Linux.  I've been looking myself and have found
 nothing comparable.  If they would just release the source
 code, we could get somewhere.  Whenever I encounter a trivial
 programming task, especially ones involving tabular data, I
 always think of how much quicker and easier it would be to
 turn it out in FoxPlus than 'C', or _<EM>shudder</EM>_ PlSql (yuck!).

Jim - I have the opposite problem.  I want to lose foxpro in favour
of SQL.  I run an odd mix of dbs including Postgres, Progress and FoxPro.
The foxpro is sitting on a dos box and is need of extinction.  It is
(obviously) single user and so the person who sits on the box has to do
all of the data input and answer the phone - doing queries as requested.

<br><br>
I am moving her data onto a linux box and I want to shift the code from
foxpro to SQL.  Any converters out there?  Front end is not too important
as I will use <TT>perl</TT> (5 with DBI 0.91 and DBD-Pg 0.69).  I just need to
rework the existing queries...thanks!

	Those were all found just using the "dbf" search string
	on a local copy of the LSM (just a text file I keep around
	since I do so much Linux support work).

<br><br>
	There's are several Linux Software Map search engines
	and searchable Linux Software Database sites out on the
	web.  I don't even have a "favorite" one any more.

<br><br>
	Try:
	<dl><dt>Linux Search Database
		<dd><A HREF="http://www.egypt.pca.net/LSDB/lynx.html"
			><TT>http://www.egypt.pca.net/LSDB/lynx.html</TT></A>
	</dl>

	... which found this one:

<br><pre>
  Title: AppGEN
   Version: 0.2 alpha
   Entered Date: 11JUL96
   Description: Database application generator and 4GL for Postgres95 and
		HTTPD. DBase DBF file to SQL Convertor.
   Key Words:	Application Generator 4GL SQL Web WWW Forms Postgres95 DBF
   Author:	Andrew Whaley
   Primary Site: sunsite.unc.edu <A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/databases/postgres/">/pub/Linux/apps/databases/postgres</A>
		 appgen-0.2-alpha.tar.gz
   Alternate Site: GPL'ish End
</pre>

<br><br>
	... or try:
	<dl><dt>Linux Links (by Goob!) at:
		<dd><A HREF="http://www.croftj.net/~goob/"
		><TT>http://www.croftj.net/~goob/</TT></A>
	</dl>
	(The search engine is not too hot, but the hierarchy of
	links is <EM>great</EM>).  There is a reference there to a
	semi-free package called X2c (the portable xBase compiler).
	X2c seems to have some features for creating binary CGI
	interfaces to your DBF databases.  Which might be an alternative
	to converting it to SQL, if you aren't worried about some
	of the concurrency and integrity and business rules enforcement
	that are associated with SQL --- or even if you just need a
	quick interim solution to use while you're doing the xBase to
	SQL port.

<br><br>
	Another place to check into is:

<dl><dt>The #LinuxOS Webpage: Linux Software Search Engines and Indices
        <dd><A HREF="http://www.linuxos.org/Lsoftsearch.html"
	><TT>http://www.linuxos.org/Lsoftsearch.html</TT></A>
	</dl>

	As the name suggests that site is maintained by principals
	of the #LinuxOS IRC channel on EFNet and it contains a list
	of Linux link farms, search engines and indices (what a
	surprise!).

<br><br>
	So, I'd say there's plenty of places to look.

<br><br>
I'd just like to thank you (Jim Dennis) for your very comprehensive and
helpful responses to the XBase question.   I had no idea there were so
many database options available for Linux.  I joined this conversation
out of idle personal interest, but now I think I see some possibilities
for solutions for current needs we have at our company.
