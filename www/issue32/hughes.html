I have just returned from the Open Source Developer Day, August 21,
held by O'Reilly & Associates at the end of their Perl Conference.
The stated purpose of this conference was ``How to Set Up an Open Source
Business in the Real World''. It had a few hundred attendees. This
column is as much an editorial describing my opinions of how Open Source
businesses should be run as it is a blow-by-blow description of the OSDD
event.
<p>
OSDD was an interesting event for me. Since the day's schedule was 
set up with people explaining how to run a business using the Open Source 
model, I originally thought it would be an open forum rather than a series of
talks. I was wrong. I also expected the audience to be mostly business people.
I was wrong again. About 95% of the attendees were already
using Linux and very few had on suits.
<p>
I am glad I went, as I learned things. However, that learning came from
individual conversations and watching the ambiance rather than from actual
talk content. Others, with whom I spoke, seemed to feel the same way.
For example, I witnessed Richard Stallman kissing the hand of a marketing
person--that definitely did not happen on the speaker's platform.
<p>
I think Tim O'Reilly had a good idea but the wrong
audience. The speakers were talking to the already-converted. We don't need to tell
Linux believers that Open Source software like BIND, Sendmail and Apache
virtually run the Internet, as Tim O'Reilly did. We don't need
to tell this audience that ``Open Source software creates the broadest,
most robust software platforms'' as Michael Tiemann of Cygnus
did, or even that Open Source software creates a culture of open
discussion as John Osterhout did.
We needed an unconvinced audience who would benefit by hearing all these things
along with Bob Young's (Red Hat) ``talk about benefits, not
features'' and
James Barry's (IBM) is it a problem or an opportunity story.
Good try, Tim--next year, maybe we can get you the right audience.
<p>
I wish all software was Open Source.
It has the immediate advantage of allowing you to choose your own support
rather than having to depend on the software vendor.
This protects you if a vendor vanishes from the market, and it also
forces the vendor into a position of providing good support or losing
business to another vendor. If we believe in ``free market
capitalism''
then why not ``free and open market capitalism''?
<p>
We have seen the most popular Linux distribution change
from Yggdrasil to Slackware to Red Hat. This was certainly a less painful
sequence of events than the transition of software from IBM to Microsoft.
It has also meant that other distributions such as Caldera and S.u.S.E. can 
stay in the market, and even gives them the chance to become the new market 
leader.
<p>
That said, I don't want to go to IBM or Oracle or any other huge company
and say ``Open Source is the answer''. I believe it is, but we
don't have the ammunition to make that statement today.
Besides, we can't afford to be exclusive.
If we were, we wouldn't have Informix SE, Applixware, StarOffice or a lot of
other software applications in our camp today.
Yes, I would like to see these companies go to Open Source, but I would rather
see them do it on their own schedule and because of market conditions
rather than from being sold on the concept by fast talking.
<p>
What did I learn at the conference? At a business models panel, IBM talked
about its open involvement in Apache, and John Osterhout
talked about Tcl and his company Scriptics, which will keep the Tcl core free
but charge for various enhancements. After they finished, we again
experienced how closed Open can be. Richard Stallman went to the audience
microphone and embraced IBM's involvement in Apache and called Osterhout's
company a parasite.
<p>
Why bother? As Tim O'Reilly said in an effort to terminate this speech, the
market will determine who is right.
If we are going to be Open Source, we need to take the word Open and apply
it to other things as well--let the market decide who is right.
<p>
<h3>Monopolies</h3>
<p>
Open Source should help prevent monopolies.
I say <i>should</i> because I see a potential problem.
When Eid Eid was Chief Technical Officer for Corel
Corporation, he told me that as soon as Corel purchased WordPerfect, Microsoft
stopped releasing information to them about operating system internals and
future plans/changes.
Microsoft did this because Corel had become a competitor.
<p>
While Open Source might have helped, it still wouldn't prevent a
distribution vendor from adding a feature they shared
with their partners but not with other vendors.
Once the distribution was released everyone else could get the information,
but they would have to play catch-up.
<p>
Contracts where only one company (generally a
distribution vendor) can sell an application fragment the Linux market.
If a certain application runs only on distribution A and another application
runs only on distribution B, then the user is forced to choose between the two
applications and to run the particular distribution supporting that
application.
<p>
Even when such a contract is not in place, it is important to
encourage compatibility between Linux distributions in order for
the Linux market to expand and not become a monopoly.
More than just encouraging this, we should demand it.
<p>
One other potential monopoly scenario is the act of buying out the competition.
Look at Microsoft's history to see examples of how this works.
Microsoft bought the right to ship a product from another vendor (the C
compiler from Lattice) until their homegrown product was
ready to sell, invested in a competitor (SCO) just in case, bought a big
chunk of a new technology (Web TV), and ported their applications to
another operating system (Macintosh OS for now, expect Linux in the future).
<p>
While Open Source doesn't eliminate monopolies, it certainly makes them
harder to create.
<p>
<h3>Linux Standards</h3>
<p>
Over the past few months, three different attempts at a Linux standard
have been made--that's the bad news.
The good news is that Dan Quinlan of Linux Filesystem Standard fame has
taken over as chair of what is now a combination of the first two
standards attempts.
<p>
This effort has support from a reasonable cross section of the Linux
community and, with Dan at the helm, I expect support to grow.
You can read more about it at <A HREF="http://www.linuxbase.org/">
http://www.linuxbase.org/</A>.
<p>
For my two cents, to make the effort work there has to be a high level
of involvement from the applications vendors.
This will ensure that applications will run on all major Linux
distributions.
I think a face-to-face meeting of all participants is needed
to get this effort rolling.
