Hello,

I am Mr Alex White from Shell Petroleum, UK. I want to book for Spa
and massage therapy? for 15 guests from my Department . Our 15 guests
will come to your place? for the therapy on February 21st-25th 2011(5
days) by 1pm to 4pm each day (3 guests per day, each for a 90mins
session). Get back to me if there is availability.
</p>


<p>
I hope you do have a Credit Card machine for charges as regard
payments. Thank you and looking forward to your urgent response.
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
Alex White
</p>

<p>
---- End forward
</p>

Whaddaybet the important phrase in this message is "credit card
machine" and not "spa and massage therapy"?

I love it. Shell execs in the UK don't have email addresses with silly
domains like, say, 'shell.com'; instead, they go for those premier
luxury addresses in the cool places, like 'yahoo.co.nz'. It's the newest
trend!

Ah, those Brits. I've heard they've forgotten how to speak proper
English, and here's the proof: Mr. Alex White's verb no object. Next
thing you know, he'll be verbing nouns...

How romantic! Although, in the old days, there would have at least been
flowers and maybe a dinner invitation... I guess no one has time for
frilly stuff like that nowadays.

I'm sure it <em>is</em> important! Even if you wear your fingers to the bone
massaging all these people that are going to show up on February 21st,
Mr. White is going to give you bad marks for not having a Credit Card
machine. <strong>That'll</strong> teach you not to take serious business proposals, um,
seriously.
