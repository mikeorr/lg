hi all,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
This is my first posting.
Here I have a problem related with linux serial
programming
in C.Hope u can help me in this.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have a C program that communicates with a remote
terminal
unit via serial port.The program uses termios
structure to initialise
the port.
The program works as expected in kernel
version 2.4.2-2 on an i686 macine.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
This same program when tested on a 586 (Kernel
2.2.14-12 on an i586)
machine fails to read the port properly.
Writing to the port was working properly.
The setserial and stty commands produced the same
result on both machines.
</STRONG></P>

What does "failing to read the port properly" mean?  Do the data look
rather odd?  Does it look garbled?
</blockQuote>
<P><STRONG>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> 
Later i found that minicom(communicating with
hyperterminal in windows) also
showed the same problem while reading the port on the
486 macine.
Writing to the port was working properly.
Communication was proper when hyperterminal was used
on
both sides.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Here is the o/p of the setserial command.
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>/dev/ttyS0, Line 0, UART: 16550A, Port: 0x03f8, IRQ: 4

Baud_base: 115200, close_delay: 50, divisor: 0
closing_wait: 3000

and here is the settings on the port using stty
command while my program is
running.

Hey Sree,
Are you running both sides of the link at the same data rate?  The
parameters that you displayed give me the indication that the data rates
are not the same.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
When you type on one terminal, do you see anything displayed on the other
terminal?  If they are different, one cause could be mismatched baud rate.
Your stty parameters seem okay -- if they are not, someone else will
probably jump in and correct me.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Get back to me (at you convience of course), and let me know what you see
on the displays.

I hope that this helps,

hi chris,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I think this isn't the problem of the code
as this same code is working as expected in an
i686 machine.

I agree with you here, Sree; if "minicom", etc.  are having problems, then
your programming isn't what's at fault - it's "lower down". That could
still mean that there are problems with the baud rate, however - the "lower
down" part means anything from the serial port settings, through hardware
initialization, to actual hardware problems (the last of which you've
eliminated by trying it in Wind*ws.)
</blockQuote>
<P><STRONG>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> 
So it couldn't be the problem
of baudrate,parity etc.
Ofcourse my baudrate is 9600 and
the stty command showed that i have initialised
the port as expected.stty command showed the same
o/p for i686 and i586(not i486 ..sorry for the
mistake).
</STRONG></P>

<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

That's ok.  If you are at the same baud rate, you might expect things to
work.

Why the "of course"? I almost always set my port speed to 115200. One of
the few exceptions is when I'm reading from my Minolta Dimage V camera: it
will not work with anything past 38400.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Have you tried your program on another 586, preferably a different make and
model? It could be that the serial hardware on that specific machine is
wonky, or that it's sufficiently strange that the serial driver is having
problems. I would also urge you to study the "setserial" man page; if
indeed the driver is having problems, "setserial" gives you _tons_ of
configuration options, and you might be able to "configure the problem
away."

My problem(in an i586) is that i can't read from the
port properly.I could get the no of bytes available
on the port with an ioctl call.The program fails
to read that bytes..
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Sometimes it reads correctly a few bytes..
But most of the time the read function returns with
Zero bytes read even if bytes are available on the
port.
Writing was working properly(verifying..by the return
value of write function)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Earlier i thought it could be some problem
with my code.Later minicom also showed the same
problems.That is, whatever was typed on my keyboard
was displayed on hyperteminal on the windows machine
on the other side correctly.But when i typed something
on the
other side(in hyperterminal) it was not reaching here
properly.That is, once it displayed some ..2 or 3
characters correctly and failed to show the rest.

Hmmm... that _does_ sound like a speed problem. If the port on the other
machine was set to, say, 57600, and this machine was set to 9600, it would
"miss" most of the characters sent to it (although the classic speed
problem shows up as random garbage mixed with a few of the characters being
sent.)
</blockQuote>
<P><STRONG>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> 
When hyperteminal was used on these side also
..everything was ok. So i guess..there is no problem
with the serial port.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Could this be some problem with the serial driver in
linux.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
i think the problem is more clear now...

Wind*ws, depending on  the version, sets the serial port speed to 57600 or
115200, if I remember correctly.

Hi sree,
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
You have got an interesting problem here.  First, let me mention that I
read Ben Okopnik's response, therefore, I will attempt to provide
information that does not overlap his response.  Take his response into
consideration.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Let's pretend that your baud rates are the same on both sides.  When you
type on your Linux machine, the characters appear on the Hyperterminal
display.  So, you Linux machine can send, and your Hyperterminal machine
can receive.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Now, when you type on your Hyperterminal machine, I get the impression,
that the first few characters that you type appear on the Linux machine
(my assumption may be wrong -- correct me if I am wrong).   After that,
when you type any more characters on your Hyperterminal machine, the
Linux machine displays nothing.  My first guess would be that flow is
enabled on your Hyperterminal machine, and you are using a 3-wire
connection.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Flow control being enabled would seem like a logical cause for your
problem except for one thing.  I get the impression that if you type ten
characters on your Hyperterminal machine (excluding the enter key), that
your <TT> ioctl()</TT> returns a value of ten.  The results seem contradictory.  I
believe that you are telling me the truth -- therefore I am now
confused.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
One trick that I use to test a serial port on a computer is to test each
serial port one at a time.  Go ahead and remove the cable that connects
your two computers.  On your Hyperterminal computer, connect a serial
cable to it, but, do not connect the other end of the cable to your
Linux machine.  On the cable, connect pins 2 and 3 together.  This will
connect your transmit data line to your receive data line.  Bring up
Hyperterminal and start to type characters.  If things are working, you
should see whatever you type appear on the display.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Do the same thing on your Linux machine.  That is, connect a serial
cable to the serial port of your Linux machine, and connect pins 2 and
3, of the connector, together.  Bring up minicom, and go ahead and type
characters on your Linux machine.  If things are working, you should see
whatever you type appear on the display of your Linux machine.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
In both cases, we are performing a loopback test.  If you do not see a
proper display, you have isolated the machine for which a problem exists
on a serial port.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If you do see proper display, I would expect the following causes:
1. Mismatched baud rates between the two computers (maybe not)
2. Problems with your RS-232 drivers (voltage level problems).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If you don't see proper display on each machine, I would expect the
following causes:
1. Problems with your RS-232 drivers.
2. Flow control enabled (you could disable flow control)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Try Ben's suggestions too.  My analysis may be incomplete.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Let me know what happens, and good luck,

Hardware Flow Control is enabled in hyperterminal(That's the default..)
That is set in minicom also.I changed only the baudrate.
(I am in doubt about this cable whether it is  using 3 pins only or more)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
But the cable I use in my program uses the rts,cts pins and uses them
in data transmission since the rtu expects that.Everything is working fine
in 686 machine.

The ioctl call is used in my program that communicates with an rtu
through serial port.
I am sending some data to the port and expecting some data in return.
The ioctl call returns the no of bytes available on the port.
But the read  function fails to read them and returns zero bytes.

By using hyperterminal on both computers communication is perfect.
So that proves there is no problem with port or cable.

That is what is odd.  A serial port is not really associated with a
processor -- Ok, ok, some embedded microprocessors do have lots of
serial devices incorporated into their package.
I would think that you are using something like a 16450, 16550, 8251, or
someother UART or USART.  It is
just a device that is addressed by the Intel processor in I/O space.  I
understand what you mean, though.
When you say 586, you are referring to your particular 586 motherboard
with its oddly behaving serial interface (as far as its behavior with
Linux is concerned).

That's "ready to send" and "clear to send".  One system says it wants
to .. has data ready to go... and the other system has to give it the
thumbs up... clear, you can send now.

When you want to send, you assert rts.  Your system will monitor cts,
and it will not send the data unless cts is asserted (when I say
asserted, I mean set to an active state).  If the computer, at the other
end of the link, does not activate the cts line, your system will never
send the data byte.  It will be flow controlled.  As a quick test, you
could make a cable that jumpers rts to cts.  That would be pins 7 and 8
on your db9 connector.
</blockQuote>
<P><STRONG>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"

I am using the rts/cts pins in my program. I do it like this..
I will make the rts pin high before writing and wait for cts to become low.
Only when cts becomes low will i write to the port.
However i am not using any setting/resetting
while reading the port.
Everything is working fine in 686.
