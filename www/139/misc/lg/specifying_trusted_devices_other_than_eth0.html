Hi Everyone,
</p>

<p>
Does anyone remember how Fedora Core 4 let the user specify trusted devices (e.g. eth0, sit0,
nlv0) through the system-config-securitylevel tool?  That feature seems to have gone away with
Core 5.  I always liked that feature because it let me open up just the nlv0 device for VPN.  With
that feature gone, I have to open up a lot more it seems.
</p>

<p>
Does anyone know of a workaround?  Or did the feature just get moved somewhere else?  Thanks in
advance.  Oh, and I did find the ASCI version of the tool, system-config-securitylevel-tui - it
knows  that eth0 can be set as a trusted device, but that's it.  Even when nlv0 is up (as
confirmed by ifconfig), system-config-securitylevel-tui only lists eth0 as a device that can be
set as trusted.
</p>

I don't know anything about how Fedora did this, but the traditional way
to configure a device so that it can only be accessed by a given group
of users is via the permissions mechanism. E.g.,
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
# addgroup --system trusted
# chown root:trusted /dev/foo
# chmod 660 /dev/foo
# for n in joe jenny jim josie jack jill jeff joy
	do adduser $n trusted
done
