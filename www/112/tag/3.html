hello, perhaps you could answer a simple question for me. i have a home
network with 2 linux boxes and 2 WinXP boxes. all 4 computers are set
with the same workgroup - the linux boxes use samba. i can access the
windows boxes from the linux boxes no problem. when I try to access the
linux boxes from the windows boxes, i get prompted for a user name and
password.

You need to setup users and passwords explicitly for Samba, these are
stored and sometimes administered separately from the Unix accounts.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
$ man smbpasswd
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
for more details.

if i try the normal user name and passwords, windows resets
the dialog box and prefixes the user name with the name of the computer.
of course, this does not work. how do i access a linux box running samba
from a windows box running XP? also, i haven't figured out how to mark a
folder as "shared" in linux. thanks for any help.
regards,
jp

You need to configure directories that are shared in your systems
smb.conf. You will want to read the smb.conf files on your system, both
the running one (often found in <TT>/etc/samba/smb.conf</TT>) as well as any
example smb.conf files that are found with the Samba documentation. And
of course,
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
$ man smb.conf
</blockQuote>

As with most aspects of unix-like OS's, there is more than one way to
configure samba.  In fact samba comes with a utility called 'swat', but
I've never used it, so I can't really say much about it.  However, most
Linux distros these days do a pretty decent job of providing a template
configuration file that you can edit to add <TT>/</TT> change what you need without
too much work.  You will need to have a text editor installed, and know
how to use it.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Depending on the distro that you have, the samba configuration file will
likely be found as either <TT>/etc/smb.conf</TT> or <TT>/etc/samba/smb.conf.</TT>  "locate
smb.conf" might be of use to you, assuming that the "updatedb" utility has
been run on your system.  To run the following command(s) and edit the
samba configuration, will need to login as root.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Usually, to get samba to allow connections from the outside world, you
need to add the user and password manually, using the utility samba
provides.  To add a new user account, e.g., "john", type "smbpasswd -a
john".  The "-a" is for "add".  "man smbpasswd" for details.  You will be
prompted for the password.  If you duplicate the same username and
password as you use on the windoze side, then you won't be prompted for
a username and password when you want to access a samba share.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
You designate a folder share by entering some parameters into the
smb.conf.  For example. lets say that I have a dual-boot machine, and I
mount the 'blows partition under <TT>/dosC.</TT>  I could add a stanza to smb.conf
such as the following:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>[dosc]
    comment = W2k - vfat
    browseable = yes
    read only = Yes
    path = /dosC
    valid users = john
    guest ok = no
    printable = no
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Samba gives a fine degree of control by providing lots of parameters.  Any
parameters not specified for a share assume defaults which samba will
provide.  Usually the defaults for a share are such that you won't need to
provide more than a handful of parameters.  "man smb.conf" will give you
lots of info about them.  One thing perhaps worth noting is that many of
the parameters have one or more synonomous "twin" parameters, so there
aren't quite as many as there may seem at first, as there are "duplicates"
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
After making changes to smb.conf, it may be expedient to restart the smb
daemon.  There are actually two daemons, but they might both be handled in
just one init script.
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>/etc/init.d/smb restart
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
and
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>/etc/init.d/nmb restart
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
should suffice in any case.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
That will hopefully be enough to get you started.  There's lots of info
out there on the 'net about samba too.  Google is your friend.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
To share a folder using Samba in Linux you need to edit the smb.conf
file. On my computer it is located in the <TT>/etc/samba</TT> folder.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
You need to add the following lines to the file for each of the
directories you want to share:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>[ShareName]
         writeable = yes
         valid users = suramya
         user = suramya
         path = /home/suramya
         write list = suramya
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
The path is the directory you want to share. ShareName is the name you
want to call it. Valid users tells the system which users are allowed to
access this share. To create a readonly share remove the writable=yes tag.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Use the smbpasswd command to set the user password for samba share.
There is a way to have it sync the password with the linux password file
but I could never get that to work
