Hello,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Today I rebooted my happily working winXP/RH 7.2
system to a grub error 17. I can boot with a grub
floppy into windows  (chainloader +1), but not Linux.
When I try to mount the linux partition in rescue mode
(booting a Redhat 7.2 CD) and mount the partition it
doesn't work.

So?  Un-overlap it!
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
A flippant answer, you say?  That's what I'm known for!  But seriously,
let's think about this...
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Somehow, someway, your partition table got flaky.  Now, the overlap
occurs at the end of one parition and the beginning of another.  What
are the chances that you have Windows data residing at the end of hda1?
If there is a good chance, then you're frelled, and you have learned why
you should never put your operating system, your user data, and your
application all on one partition.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If you had, say, put <TT>/</TT> on hda2, <TT>/home</TT> on hda6 and <TT>/usr</TT> on hda7, then
in your scenario only <TT>/</TT> would be affected and that could be taken care
of with a re-install as a worse case. As it is, a re-install would end
up wiping out everything on hda2.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
However, if there is a low chance that there is data at the end of hda1,
you might/should be in good shape.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
So, I'm assuming there is no Windows data written to the end of hda1,
which means the Linux data is still on the hard drive (the partition
table is read by the computer to determine where the partitions start
and stop; there is no division done on the hard drive itself).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
So I don't see why you can't fire up fdisk, and go in and set the end of
hda1 to block 1717.  Write the changes to disk, shut down the machine,
sacrifice two chickens under a full moon (which it is tonight, so you're lucky
you don't have to wait another month) and restart the machine.  If you
sacrificed the right kind of chickens (which is left as an exercise for
the reader), it will come back up.

That actually occured to me, but I thought I could
only make things worse by manually toying with this
stuff.

<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

There's a far higher probability of making things worse by letting some
<EM>automatic</EM> process twiddle with it. 
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> I'm afraid it doesn't usually get
resolved by divine intervention, so the manual method is what's left.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<em>Uninformed</em> manual twiddling is something to be afraid of. Dynamite is not
of itself dangerous; however, it becomes a terrifying thing when handled by
the ignorant. Knowledge is the key factor that makes all the difference.
Just to throw in my $0.02, Faber has hit this particular nail on the head.
Also, note that just changing the disk parameters as he has suggested is
fairly harmless, as long as you don't write any data to those partitions;
if you write down the current numbers, you can always revert to them in the
worst case (however, you already know that they're wrong, so that's not
much help.)
</blockQuote>
<P><STRONG>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"

One question though - what command under fdisk
do I use to set the end of a partition?

<blockQuote>

'x' to get you into expert mode, 'c' to change the number of cylinders.
Again, writing down the current values is a good thing, even if it's of
marginal value in this specific case.

<blockQuote>

That makes sense.  fsck needs to read the super-block to do it's thing.
It assumes that the first super-block is at block...uh...1 *from the
beginning of the partition*.  f that super-block is frelled, you can try
the backup superblocks; the first one is located at block 32 and the
others are located Ghu knows where on your system, but I'm sure we could
devise a way to find out if you pleaded very nicely. 
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":-)"

</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
My guess is that the first super-block is located in the overlap area,
so that wouldn't help you anyway.

<blockQuote>
So try my suggestion &lt;spooky music&gt;if you dare&lt;/spooky music&gt; and let
us know how it turns out.

I'm at the end of my rope here. There is a small
amount of data on the partition I'd really like to
retrieve. I can't think of anything unusual that I've
done recently to cause this problem - certainly
nothing with my partition tables.

Hi!
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Regarding the last sentences I have an idea: might it have been
windows doing some "defragmenting"? Someone quite recently told me
that win packs the stuff it intends to move to some other place
temporarily at the end of the partition since there is most of the
time some space left. This, in conjunction with your overlapping
partitions, might have been the end of that particular linux
partition (and might also not be saved by the methods destribed by the
others since they assume that the data in the linux part is still
intact...so I'd recommend 2 chicken, 2 ox and, if handy, a virgin...)

I just wanted to say, Faber, very well done.  Few people really understand
Partitioning so well.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I spent about a year working at STAC Electronics in SQA (Software Quality
Assurance - AKA Alpha Stage Testing) and nearly had intimate relations with
HD's and their functionality.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
For those lost in this conversation, Faber answered a question concerning
HD Partitioning very well.  STAC Electronics writes a program called
Stacker (Double your disk capacity - Runtime/Real Time disk compression)
For DOS/W!n3.x-9x and OS/2.  I was the lead tester for the software as it
came downstairs from the programmers.

Well, I still haven't been able to effect any
permenant change with fdisk. If I do "fdisk <TT>/dev/hda</TT>"
the (c)hange command described before wants to change
the number of cylinders on the whole disk.

bad idea. the partition table you want to change is definitely at <TT>/dev/hda</TT>
and nowhere else.
I guess what you did change is a "partition table " at the beginning of hda1
(therefore changing the first block of hda1 which may or may not be
important, it's the Win boot sector IIRC).
</blockQuote>
<P><STRONG>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"

it seems to ask
the right question "Number of cylinders? Default: 699"
...699 being about right. You get 698 when you
subtract 1723 from 1025 (See my fdisk listing).

If there is no size change command do in fdisk (norml mode, not expert):
p for the table
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
then delete the partition 1 (d or r ?)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
and create a new one wih the same start cylinder but the correct end cylinder
number. Then it's smaller. This <EM>only</EM> changes the data in the partiton talbe
and nothing on the drive itself and is simply a resizeing of the partiton.
The deletion in the partition table will not delete anything on the partition
itself.
</blockQuote>
<P><STRONG>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

Now, when I try to set it to a lower number (692 by my
subtraction) and (w)rite to partition table it calls
 <TT>ioctl()</TT> etc. and does its thing, but the partition
table is still the same when I "fdisk -l"...Am I
missing something here?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Also, if the beginning of the ext3 partition have been
written to, are there no recovery tools to get the
data back? I know in FAT land, Norton Utilities has
saved my bacon more than once in similar situations.

Concerning the last part, I one heard that the norton clone midnight
commander has some option to undelete stuff, alternatively there is an
undeletion howto at linuxdoc.org. But I never tried either of 'em...
Concerning the fdisk part:

<blockquote><pre>sfdisk has four (main) uses: list the size of a partition,
       list the partitions on a device, check the partitions on a

You can run e2fsck and it will do what it can -- but overwritten data at the
beginning of the drive is overwritten data. The problem is that you never
know which of your files got corrupted unless you can check then one by one.
You could try to keep the inode numbers e2fsck reports somewhere (logfile
option of e2fsck?) and there is an option to ls to show the inode numbers of
files and compare, but it's tedious work -- even to write the script/program
doing the work.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
if your NTFS has written over your ext3 partition it trashed all information
in the first part of hda2 -- including inode information, data blocks,...
So e2fsck in that part does not understand it's inodes anymore, maybe
misinterprets some of them causing even more problems. On the other hand you
may be quite lucky and it's not overwritten at all or e2fsck can repair the
rest of the partition without to much problems. You don't have the original
partition table around? Do you maybe remember with what "+500M" or whatever
size parameters you made them? That would help a lot in finding the real
cylinder border between hda1 and hda2.

I used DOS fdisk to make the first partition (later
converted to NTFS by WinXP) and Disk Druid to install
the rest of it. So I don't know what parameters were
used to create the table. Also, I don't have the old
partition table. Is that something I would keep around
if I were L33T? I guess it would be easy to print out
once the system is up and running.

I don't know if I'm L33T, but I do keep printed (i.e. on paper) partiton
tables around or at least digital version on other computers.

I started with this behaviour when suddenly my partition table on a multi boot
system got messed up (NT 3.51 was told by me to install itself in a logic
partition where other logic partitions were used by Linux -- NT chose to
disregard this wish of mine.... This was evolutionary not a wise thing to
do, one NT down 
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">.  At that time fortunately I knew that I made my
partitions by giving Linux fdisk sizes in round numbers (like +500M) and
fdisk did indeed calculated the same cylinder boundaries. (Data fully
recovered, only the partition right after NT was clobbered -- which was /
and had no user data <TT>/usr</TT> and <TT>/home</TT> stayed untouched (but were gone in the
partition table)).

So how dangerous to my winXP partition is this
operation? I will, at worst, lose some data if it
happens to be at the end of the partition, right? I
<em>probably</em> won't make the NTFS partition un-bootable,
right? (I use "probably" because I know nothing is
certain in this case)

Hmm.... NT usually had all important stuff at the beginning of the drive.
Win9X always shows some block at the partition end as "system and unmovable"
but on the other hand after that Partition Magic can resize the partition
easily. So I think neither Win Fileformat has usually important thing at the
end.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
So I think you should be reasonably save from damaging the XP partiton
completely. And if XP <EM>did</EM> increase its partition over its original size
there shouldn't be anything belongig to XP anyway.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
e2fsck has some option to just check but change nothing -- that could help
testing if by this partition change you <EM>can</EM> recover the Linux partition. If
this seems to work let it write and hope for the best.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
from man e2fsck:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre> -n     Open the filesystem read-only, and assume an answer
              of `no' to all questions.  Allows e2fsck to be used
              non-interactively.  (Note: if the  -c,  -l,  or  -L
              options are specified in addition to the -n option,
              then the filesystem will be opened  read-write,  to
              permit the bad-blocks list to be updated.  However,
              no other changes will be made to the filesystem.)
