Hi there,
</p>

<p>
I'm Thai from Vietnam. I just want to introduce you
Kiosk Appliance (<a href="http://kiosk.rpath.org">http://kiosk.rpath.org</a>) which is a
distro focusing on user's security and privacy
inspired by your article "Creating a Rudimentary Kiosk
System using FVWM". Using rPath technology, I provide
3 versions of Kiosk Appliance: a VMWare image, a
LiveCD and an installable CD.  Included is just enough
rPath Linux and FVWM to run a locked down version of
Firefox. Firefox is also pre-configured to
automatically reset after each used so that personal
information is never stored permanently. The current
stable version is 0.2 which features:
</p>

<p>
1) Clear all personal data on exit;
</p>

<p>
2) Reset after a period of inactivity;
</p>

<p>
3) Disable form history;
</p>

<p>
4) Disable page caching;
</p>

<p>
...and much more, you can view more details at
<a href="http://www.rpath.org/rbuilder/project/kiosk/release?id=5096">http://www.rpath.org/rbuilder/project/kiosk/release?id=5096</a>
</p>

<p>
I've been working on Kiosk Appliance 0.3 which has
many more features such as the ability to disable
access to Firefox's internal URLs or dialogs, i.e
about:* URL, the Firefox Preferences dialog...I hope
K.A 0.3 to be released on the next few days. Many
thanks to Thomas Adam for helping me to configure
fvwm.
</p>

<p>
Any thought or suggestion? I'm really anxious to hear
from you.
</p>

<p>
Best regards,
</p>

<p>
Thai Duong.

Heh.  I must say that this is a first for me:
</p>

<p>
1.  Someone actually <em>reads</em> the crap I publish.  :P, and:
2.  Someone has actually taken something I've written and turned it into
    something useful.  
 
What an excellent idea.  I am pleased it has inspired a rather
interesting project, and the fact it works.  The original intention idea
was more as a proof-of concept; a vehicle upon which to try and
demonstrate some of FVWM's features.  I'm glad it worked.

These things are of course a form of Firefox configuration.  Are you
using any of the kiosk browser plugins that Firefox can use?  One of the
reasons why I perhaps didn't advocate them is that they only do half the
job -- and and best interfere with window management.  It could be
argued that window management isn't necessary, but I'd argue that
it is, if you want the finer control of peripheral aspects.

I ran the liveCD ISO in QMU and it worked fine.  There are one or two
things in the FVWM configuration though you might want to address:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
Style Firefox-bin  NoButton 1, NoButton 2, NoButton 4, Layer 8
</pre>
The use of "NoFoo" to negate or turn-off a style is now for the most
part considered deprecated in FVWM 2.5.18 (the unstable release of FVWM
at the time of writing you should ideally be using).  Instead, negation
works how most other languages define negation, via the bang (!) symbol,
hence:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
Style Firefox-bin  !Button 1, !Button 2, !Button 4, Layer 8
</pre>
Also, the line:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
Key Escape A A -
</pre>
Should be changed to:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
Key Escape A M -
</pre>
So that it works for the meta key.  If there's anything else you'd like
to know, just shout.

Yes I use two Firefox extensions: rKiosk and
autoreset. rKiosk helps me to simplify Firefox's
chrome and autoreset helps me to reset Firefox after
an inactivity period. I wonder whether fvwm can do
this. If it can, I'll be happy to use it instead of
Firefox extensions. I also ship a custom Firefox's
preference which is auto re-installed after each use.
</p>

<p>
Beside kiosk extension, I also intend to install some
general extensions such as AdBlock Plus, FasterFox or
some of Web 2.0 extensions...to extend and improve the
functionality of K.A. Do you have any suggestion about
which extension should I use in K.A?

It depends what you mean by "inactive".  Whilst FVWM can keep track of
things like focus, what it can't do is reliably detect other things.  So
this is best left to a plugin.

I know nothing about Firefox, to be honest.  I use ELinks as my browser
of choice, although having a quick look at those plugins suggest they
all do Cool Things (tm).

<p>
AdBlock plus is a cool toy, if you can spend time tuning it to your own 
preferences. For a kiosk I probably wouldn't choose it, as any settings 
wouldn't be saved, plus it would take a pretty savvy user to figure out how 
to override it if it blocked something he wanted to see.
</p>

<p>
For blocking ads in a kiosk, privoxy might be better. It comes with a 
substantial list of advertising sites to block and offers a "go there anyway" 
link.

I am sure that Ben would welcome an article from you if you're willing
about your kiosk implementation.  Indeed, I would be very interested to
know not so much about the implementation, but moreso the kinds of
people that are using it.  I find those sorts of things fascinating.

Yes, agreed. However, instead of just focusing on locking down web 
browsers, it would be interesting to hear about securing other commonly 
used programs. For example, I did some contract work for a company that 
wanted kiosks that only ran their database program (filepro) with specific 
permissions; the purpose was to allow clients to look at potential 
properties without the need for an agent to stand over them.

It's really only a variation upon a theme.  There is only a certain

I'm going to release K.A 0.3 today and after that I'll
try to write an article about K.A. In fact, the bank
I'm working for has backed me to work on this since
they wanna have something to replace Windows on their
teller's computer. The tellers only need a browser to
connect to our core banking web application to do
their business and you know Linux + Firefox is
probably a better choice than the current Windows +
Internet Explorer solution. Another use of K.A at our
bank is to make Internet Banking kiosk aka
self-service kiosk. I'll probably write more about
this in my article.

I would indeed. I like the idea of a "turn-key" kiosk - and the fact
that it was inspired by Thomas doesn't hurt either. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

&gt; I'm going to release K.A 0.3 today and after that I'll
&gt; try to write an article about K.A. In fact, the bank
&gt; I'm working for has backed me to work on this since
&gt; they wanna have something to replace Windows on their
&gt; teller's computer. The tellers only need a browser to
&gt; connect to our core banking web application to do
&gt; their business and you know Linux + Firefox is
&gt; probably a better choice than the current Windows +
&gt; Internet Explorer solution.

That's interesting; from what I've seen, banks here in the US mostly
appear to use some sort of a *nix-based GUI on the front end and a
mainframe in the back. In many cases, "serious" transactions (e.g.,
opening an account) are done in a virtual terminal that looks like a
1960s green-screen - and Wind0ws is only ever seen on the customers'
side of the partition, perhaps as a kiosk connected to the bank's
site. Oh, and some ATMs, of course.

&gt; Another use of K.A at our
&gt; bank is to make Internet Banking kiosk aka
&gt; self-service kiosk. I'll probably write more about
&gt; this in my article.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
I'm definitely looking forward to seeing it.

I'm still surprised that no one has stopped using their voting 
machines seeing there are more bugs in one of those...
</p>

<p>
AFAIK here in the UK its paper voting and its not likely to change.

If it was a decision based on minor, unimportant factors - such as, say,
justice, voting fairness, technical expertise, the basic rights of
citizenship - then it would have been stopped long ago, or never even
started without overwhelming evidence of benefits <strong>without</strong> detrimental
effects. However, since it's a <strong>political</strong> decision, all of that
detritus goes into the wastebasket.

Our Great Leader is elected using voting machines. This has actually
led to a decrease in electoral malpractice but at a significant cost
that may be exploited later---the design, manufacture and maintenance
of the voting machines is closed source.

There's nothing wrong with voting machines /per se/; there <em>are</em> right
ways to do it, including full tracking and accountability. Here's an
example of some excellent thinking on the subject by Ron Rivest:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://theory.csail.mit.edu/~rivest/Rivest-TheThreeBallotVotingSystem.pdf">http://theory.csail.mit.edu/~rivest/Rivest-TheThreeBallotVotingSystem.pdf</a>
</p>

<p>
The problem is a system in which there's neither tracking, nor
accountability, nor security - and the people who benefit have hidden
this behind the screen of "it's all electronical and compooters and
stuff". If they tried it with paper ballots, the voters would have hung
them on the nearest tree; since it's them dang mysterious compooters,
well, nobody understands what they do anyway...
</p>

<p>
It just <strong>really</strong> winds up my crank to see people using technology to
shove us all back into the Dark Ages.
