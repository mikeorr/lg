<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">OpenSUSE Opens Up to Questions
About the Microsoft Deal</h3>


<p>
OpenSUSE project developers held a public IRC meeting to discuss the
recently announced and highly controversial Microsoft/Novell agreements. Nat
Friedman, chief technical and strategy officer for open source at Novell,
fielded most of the questions, with assistance from Andreas Jaeger, OpenSUSE
project manager, and others.
</p>

<p>
As expected, the one-hour long session generated a lot of discussion. There
were almost 200 participants, and the questions touched on all aspects of the
deal, the validity of GPLv2 and the upcoming GPLv3, Mark Shuttleworth's
controversial letter to the community, Microsoft's covenant not to sue, and so
on. Novell talked about how Microsoft does make legal mistakes, such as in the
Lindows fiasco, and, tongue firmly in cheek, how they would "make fun of them
in public" if Microsoft did not keep its promises. 
</p>

<p>
The whole GPLv2 vs. GPLv3 issue was also mentioned by the Novell
representatives, saying that they are "interested" in seeing the wording used
in GPLv3 that will invalidate such deals.
</p>

<p>
The complete log is <a
href=http://www.linux.com/blob.pl?id=69222398f6d5c493a2de14c69155b4b7">available</a>,
while a lightly edited version can be found on <a
href="http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/11/27/2113210">linux.com.</a> More
information is available at the <a
href="http://en.opensuse.org/Meetings/Special_Meeting_2006-11-27">OpenSUSE site</a>.
</p>


<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">Richard Stallman says that the
Novell/Microsoft Deal Does Not Violate GPLv2</h3>

<p>
Richard Stallman, the leader of the FSF (Free Software Foundation), said at
the fifth international GPLv3 conference in Tokyo on Nov. 21 that the
Novell/Microsoft patent agreement is not in violation of GPL version 2.
According to a <a
href="http://fsfeurope.org/projects/gplv3/tokyo-rms-transcript">transcript</a>
published by the FSFE (FSF Europe), Stallman stated that "what has happened is,
Microsoft has not given Novell a patent license, and thus, section 7 of GPL
version 2 does not come into play. Instead, Microsoft offered a patent license
that is rather limited to Novell's customers alone."
</p>

<p>
Stallman points out that this is a good thing for several reasons,
since the new version of the GPL had not taken such an eventualty into
consideration.  However, GPLv3 is now being re-written in light of the
Novell/Microsoft deal, "It turns out that perhaps it's a good thing that
Microsoft did this now, because we discovered that the text we had
written for GPL version 3 would not have blocked this, but it's not too
late and we're going to make sure that when GPL version 3 really comes
out it will block such deals. We were already concerned about
possibilities like this, namely, the possibility that a distributor
might receive a patent license which did not explicitly impose limits on
downstream recipients but simply failed to protect them."
</p>

<p>
Stallman said that the GPLv3 will block the kind of language used in the
Novell/Microsoft agreement. Stallman explained, "We're going to say not just
that if you receive the patent license, but if you have arranged any sort of
patent licensing that is prejudicial among the downstream recipients, that
that's not allowed. That you have to make sure that the downstream recipients
fully get the freedoms that they're supposed to have. The precise words, we
have not figured out yet. That's what Eben Moglen [FSF's general counsel] is
working on now."
</p>

<p>
This statement from the original author of the GPL should remove any
lingering doubts about the validity of the Novell/Microsoft deal.
</p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">Novell Axes Support for the
Hula Project</h3>

<p>
Novell has abandoned a much-hyped open source project slated to challenge
Microsoft Outlook and Exchange by becoming the "Apache" of e-mail and
collaboration software. Engineers are "moving to other roles", according to the
<a
href="http://forge.novell.com/pipermail/hula-general/2006-November/002084.html">Hula
mailing list.</a>

<p>
Novell had announced Hula at LinuxWorld, Boston, in February 2005 by
donating 200,000 lines of code from its NetMail collaboration server to the
community. Novell wanted Hula to "become for collaboration what Apache is to
servers". This move was greeted with strong support from the Mozilla
Foundation, Open Source Applications Foundation, Open Source Development Labs,
and O'Reilly Media's father of Web 2.0 Tim O'Reilly.
</p>

<p>
The Hula server featured SMTP, IMAP, and support for the CalDAV calendar
access protocol. The future of the project is as yet uncertain, with some
developers fearing the worst, while others are confident that it will survive
the loss of Novell engineers. More information on the Hula Project is available
on the <a href="http://www.hula-project.org/Hula_Project">project Web
site</a>.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">Thailand Delivers a Double
Whammy: Cancels Open Source Policy and OLPC Project Participation</h3>


<p>
Thailand's newly appointed Information and Communications Technology
Minister slammed open source software as useless and full of bugs, "With open
source, there is no intellectual property. Anyone can use it and all your ideas
become public domain. If nobody can make money from it, there will be no
development and open source software quickly becomes outdated." This marks a
shift from the previous government's stance on open source. Critics have
pointed out that the Minister seems to have based his decision on an incomplete
understanding of the open source movement.
</p>

<p>
This was quickly followed by Thailand's new junta-appointed Education
Minister cancelling Thailand's participation in the One Laptop Per Child
project and scrapping a plan to give a 2B1 laptop to every primary school
student. He also cancelled plans to roll out computers and a broadband
connection to every school in Thailand.  He cited the lack of readiness of
teachers, and the need to focus on basic education standards, "We will not focus
too much on technology and materials. We will focus on substance." The previous
government was deposed in a bloodless coup earlier this year.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">France Announces Plan to Switch
Members of Parliament from Windows to Linux</h3>

<p>
In June 2007, PCs in French deputies' offices will be equipped with a Linux
operating system and open source productivity software. The project, backed by
MPs Richard Cazenav and Bernard Carayon of the UMP party, will see 1,154 French
parliamentary workstations running on an open source OS, with OpenOffice.org,
Firefox and an open source e-mail client.
</p>

<p>
This is the first time a French public institution has switched its OS
to an open source solution. The French government had previously tried open
source solutions, but they were either limited to servers or involved using
open source software (e.g., Firefox and OpenOffice.org) on Microsoft
Windows.
</p>

<p>
There is no news on the exact distribution or e-mail client they will
use. Mandriva Linux might be a strong contender, given its French roots, but
this is mere speculation. The French Parliament considered the results of a
study conducted by Atos Origin, an international IT services company, and
stated that, "The study showed that open source software will from now on offer
functionality adapted to the needs of MPs, and will allow us to make
substantial savings despite the associated migration and training costs."
</p>

<p>
Supporters of open source have welcomed this decision, especially following
the news of the Thai government dropping its support for open source
solutions.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">Linux 2.6.19 Released</h3>

<p>
After 2 months, 2.6.19 has been released. "It's one of those rare 'perfect'
kernels," Linus joked, "so if it doesn't happen to compile with your config (or
it does compile, but then does unspeakable acts of perversion with your pet
dachshund), you can rest easy knowing that it's all your own damn fault, and
you should just fix your evil ways." He went on to add, "you could send me and
the kernel mailing list a note about it anyway, of course. (And perhaps
pictures, if your dachshund is involved. Not that we'd be interested, of
course. No. Just so that we'd know to avoid it next time)." Besides these
essential technical details, this release includes the clustering GFS2
filesystem, Ecryptfs , the first experimental version of EXT4 (aimed at
developers), support for the Atmel AVR32 architecture, sleepable RCU,
improvements for NUMA-based systems, and much more.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">Novell Inc. Announces Novell Open Enterprise Server 2 (OES 2)
</h3>


<p>
Due to be released early in the second quarter of 2007, OES 2 has already
received support commitments from Novell's software partners. The list currently
includes backup solution vendors CA, Commvault, Symantec, and Syncsort, along
with anti-virus software vendors McAfee and Trend Micro.
</p>

<p>
OES will be based on Novell's SLES 10 (SUSE Linux Enterprise Server). It is
designed to be a drop-in replacement for Novell NetWare servers, and it will be
a direct competitor to Microsoft's Server 2003. This next version will complete
the shift to workgroup services running completely on the Linux platform. The
optional NetWare kernel included in previous versions will be removed. OES 2
hopes to make traditional NetWare workgroup services run on Linux as well or
better than they do on NetWare and Windows, and will simplify the migration of
those services to Linux. Xen virtualization capabilities in SLES will be
leveraged to offer extended hardware support for traditional NetWare
applications. Novell's ZENworks Virtual Machine Management will provide
capabilities for managing Xen virtualized environments in OES.
</p>

<p>
Novell's recent technology partnership with Microsoft should lead to
improved interoperability with Windows.
</p>

<p>
Earlier versions of OES have been well-received both by testers and by
Novell's channel partners. In this year's VARBusiness survey, OES ranked number
one in server operating systems, ahead of Novell's own SLED and Microsoft's
Server 2003.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">Novell, LPI partner to release
LPIC-3 Senior Certification</h3>

<p>
Linux Professional Institute (LPI), provider of vendor-neutral Linux
certification, announced a series of initiatives to promote Linux professional
credentials and the global adoption of open source software. In particular,
LPI cited the cooperation of Novell on the development of LPI's upcoming
enterprise-level certification program: LPIC-3.
</p>

<p>
LPIC-3 will be LPI's senior certification level for Linux professionals,
requiring candidates to hold both LPIC-1 and LPIC-2 designations. LPI will
launch the program in January 2007, holding the first North American exam lab
at Novell's BrainShare event in March 2007. Mr. Lacey praised the involvement
of Novell in the development of LPIC-3 and noted that they brought important
enterprise-level perspective to the certification program. Mr. Lacey also noted
the growing interest of LPI training partners in Novell's recent announcement
of an innovative free online "Train the Teacher" program.
</p>

<p>
"Novell has always supported LPI's dedication to the development of Linux
professionals," said Dan Veitkus, Vice-President, Novell Training Services,
"We believe in offering our customers and partners the best set of choices for
raising their Linux IQ, and we're in full support of LPIC-3 as the next step
for Novell's Linux Certified professionals. LPIC-3 specifically targets the
needs of large enterprise, IT professionals, and IT consultancies that require a
broad architect level professional credential." Mr. Veitkus added that a number
of Novell's technical trainers, engineers and developers have been engaged to
assist LPI in the development of LPIC-3.
</p>

<p>
LPI separately announced that candidates who have earned LPIC certifications
will have to re-certify every five years or alternatively earn a higher
certification. Recertification was previously required only after ten
years.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">solidDB for MySQL Sets
Performance Record</h3>

<p>
Solid Information Technology announced that solidDB for MySQL
outperformed other MySQL transactional database engines in a public TM1
benchmark test.  Benchmark results confirmed that solidDB for MySQL
meets the performance requirements of high-throughput, mission-critical
applications. Publication of the results also coincided with general
availability of solidDB for MySQL, an open source relational database
management system (RDBMS) developed in partnership with MySQL.
</p>

<p>
The TM1 Benchmark results shows that, on multi-CPU hardware, solidDB
for MySQL offers customers shorter response time and higher levels of
scalability than equivalent MySQL implementations that use Oracle's
InnoDB. Results demonstrated that solidDB for MySQL processed more than
twice the number of transactions than did Oracle InnoDB, and stayed
constant with increasing database size, while InnoDB's performance
significantly decreased as the database size increased beyond 100,000
rows.
</p>

<p>
solidDB for MySQL is designed for transactional applications, and
supports full ACID compliance with configurable transaction isolation
levels, both optimistic and pessimistic concurrency control,
Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) with non-blocking reads and
writes, row-level locking, and foreign keys and referential integrity.

<p>
Intalio  has announced that Intalio|BPMS Community Edition will be released

</p>

<p>
"There has been a need for Open Source BPM solutions in the market place,
but we haven't seen any candidates that meet the market need to date," said Jim
Sinur, vice president and analyst at Gartner. "That need is predicated on
making BPM easy for lesser skilled process developers, and our hope is that
this will evolve quickly enough to compete with the BPMS leaders."
