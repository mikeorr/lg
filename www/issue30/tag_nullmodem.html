<p><strong>From Chris Gushue on 04 Jun 1998

<BR><BR>
 I have two systems, a 486 and a K6, and I was wondering how (if) I could
 connect them using a serial (null modem) cable. One system will be running
 Windows 98, the other running Linux. I can't seem to find any info on the
 LDP or other webpages. Thanks.

	Certainly you can connect them for some purposes.

<br><br>
	I don't know anything about Win '98 but I presume it
	comes with some sort of terminal emulation package
	(like the Hyperterm that MS licensed from Hilgreave for
	Win '95, or that cheesy old "Terminal" that they used to
	ship with Windows 3.x).

<br><br>
	You could also get any of several shareware, free, or
	commercial communications packages such as Telix (Windows
	or DOS), Kermit (DOS) or K95 (Windows), etc.

<br><br>
	All of these should have a "direct" or "null modem" option
	listed among their "connection/modem" types.

<br><br>
	This will give you a basic, character modem terminal login
	to your Linux box.  This not a networking connection --- it
	is just like connecting a dumb terminal to the machine (which
	still gives you access to most of the applications and almost
	all of the utilities and programming tools on your Linux system).

<br><br>
	If you want <EM>networking</EM> between these two systems, over the
	serial line; that's a different story.  You should be able to
	establish a SLIP or PPP connection between the two.  Once you've
	done that you could run any of the TCP/IP protocols over the
	line.  However, it's much trickier to do that --- and I have
	no idea how Win '98 will handle it.

<br><br>
	(Under early revisions of Win '95 I remember complaints that
	the supplied PPP drivers and their user interface was
	configured to work with MSN (Microsoft Network --- their
	ISP) and that it required some utility from the "Plus Pack"
	to allow one to create and maintain a "chat" script --- a
	way to log in and configure/establish a PPP session with
	any other ISP.

<br><br>
	It seems that MS also added features in their NT 4.x (RAS?,
	RRAS?) that allow these systems to act as recipients of the
	stock Win '95 MS-CHAP authentication method.  I guess this was
	a bid to convince ISP's to adopt Windows NT for their work.

<br><br>
	Meanwhile Gert Doering (and others?) released the AutoPPP
	extensions or patches to '<TT>mgetty</TT>.'

<br><br>
	'<TT>mgetty</TT>' is Gert's very popular "modem getty" line that allows
	a modem line to be shared between terminal, fax, network and
	even voice (with some modems) for both incoming and outgoing
	use.  One of the features of '<TT>mgetty</TT>' is that it can be
	configured to recognize certain login strings ("user name
	patterns") as a directive to use an alternative '<TT>login</TT>' program.

<br><br>
	Thus you can configure you modem line to use ppplogin when
	given a "user" name of the form:  Pmaryjoe, and to use a
	traditional '<TT>login</TT>' when presented with others.

<br><br>
	I personally haven't set up AutoPPP.  However, a quick
	Yahoo! search on the string:  "<TT>+mgetty +autoppp</TT>" gives
	about 450 Alta Vista hits.  Most of these are from the
	Linux ISP mailing list.  I didn't spot any that covered
	AutoPPP over a null modem.

<br><br>
	Trying a search string like:
		 <CODE>+ "null modem" +mgetty +win + "95"</CODE>

<br><br>
	... didn't help either.  Though it did return a bunch of
	links to Linux Gazett mirror sites carrying issues 18,
	25, and 28 (false hits in this case)

<br><br>
	Somewhere on the Linux ISP mailing list archives
	I found a thread about "null serial" that was on target
	but not very informative.  Someone mentioned that the
	Win '95 PPP couldn't handle direct connection --- and
	suggested Trumpet Winsock (a third party TCP/IP suite for
	Windows --- and DOS --- for years before MS had ever heard
	of TCP/IP).

<br><br>
	So, it may not be easy to get networking configured over
	a null modem line so long as Win '9x is on one end of it.
	However, I bet it would be possible.  You should probabl
	create a "modem emulation" driver for Linux that would
	allow the Win '9x box to work as though it were sending
	AT commands to a modem.  The "modem emulation" driver
	could implement a small AT command subset (responding to
	every valid &lt;pause&gt;+++&lt;pause&gt;AT sequence with "<TT>OK</TT>" or
	the appropriate response).

<br><br>
	In the long run it's probably far easier to buy a couple
	of ethernet cards (less than $30 each) and a 10baseT
	"cross over" cable (necessary if you're not going through
	a hub, and sometimes necessary to cascade one hub off of
	another).  Not only is ethernet much faster than serial
	--- it is currently much easier to configure and support
	(for networking).  Another advantage is that you can
	later expand; buy a 4, 5 or 8 port ethernet hub and you
	can wire up the whole house (actually I've almost filled
	two 8 port hubs here --- but I'm a little different).

<br><br>
	Conclusion: You can easily use the serial/null modem
	for simple terminal access.  You might be able to get it
	working as a networking interface, but you might have
	quite a bit of trouble convincing Win '9x to do PPP over
	a "direct" or "null modem" connection.  So you might have
	to look for a third party PPP replacement (which may
	need to be upgraded between the Win '95 and Win '98 versions)
	--- or you might be able to write some weird "modem emulation"
	on the Linux side.  For networking it will be much easier
	to buy a couple of ethernet cards.

<p><strong>From Chris Gushue on 04 Jun 1998

<br><br>
 Thanks a lot for your thorough and quick response! It was just what I was
 looking for, just a basic login to my Linux box to play around with it until
 I get around to buying a hub and network cards. It kind of funny though,
 using my K6/233 Win98 machine as a dumb terminal to my 486/100 Linux box

	I was using that VAResearch machine that I reviewed for
	the Linux Journal ("<TT>betelgeuse</TT>": a 266Mhz PII with 64Mb of
	RAM and a 4Mb Matrox Millenium video) as a dumb terminal to
	my old 33Mhz 386 ("<TT>antares</TT>") for months.  The old 386 was
	where all my mail and news was.  It's still the network hub,
	mail and news server for the house (though now I use '<TT>fetchmail</TT>'
	everything over to "<TT>canopus</TT>" a home built P166; the wife
	mostly took over the PII).

<br><br>
	The 386 is the most stable machine in the house -- it's the
	only one on a UPS.
