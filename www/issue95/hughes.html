<title>CC: Quick and Dirty Data Extraction in AWK</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
Many years ago, probably close to 20, there was a regular point made on
the comp Usenet newsgroups about using the minimum tool to get the job
done.
That is, someone would ask for a quick and dirty way to do something
and the followups could include a C solution followed by an AWK
solution, followed by a sed solution and so on.
<p>
Today, I still try to use this philosophy when addressing a problem.
In this particular case, I picked AWK but if any of you old-timers are
reading this I expect you will come up with a sed-based solution.

<h2>The Problem: Extracting Data from E-mail Messages</h2>
<p>
I signed up for a daily summary of currency exchange rates. It's free
and you can subscribe too--just go <a
href="http://www.xe.com/cus" target="_blank">here</a>.
Most days I take a quick look at how the $ is doing against the Euro
and then save the e-mail. Some days I just save it.
I have always thought that, someday, I would write a program to show me
the trend but it has always been low priority.
<p>
Yesterday, as I was looking at a few of the save mail messages, I
realized that while writing a fancy graphing program was low-priority,
writing a quick and dirty hack would take less time than the random
sampling I was doing.
What I wanted was dates and numbers along with a minimalist graphical
display of the trend.

<p>First step was to look at the data.
Here is an extract of part of a message.

The ... lines just indicate that I tossed a lot of uninteresting lines.
<p>
There are three things I use to produce the report:
<ul>
  <li> The "Rates as of" line to get the date
  <li> The "USD" line to get the actual conversion rate
  <li> The &lt;/PRE> line to tell me to print the info and clear my variables.
       Note that I don't really have to clear them if the data is good
       but it just seemed like a good way to detect bad data. Quick
       hack yes, but not disgustingly quick hack.
</ul>

<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>
The numeric part of the solution is really easy. Just grab the date
info and the rate info. When I get the &lt;/PRE> line, print it out.
<p>
The graphical part is just done by printing a number of plus signs that
corresponds to the rate. 
To get decent resolution I would either need a very wide printout or
some sort of offset. I went for the offset assuming the Euro will not
drop below $.90 which is pretty safe considering the direction it is
going.
<p>
Finally, I wanted a heading. Using AWK's BEGIN block, I put in a couple
of print statements. Not liking to count characters, I defined the
variable <code>over</code> to be the number of spaces that needed to be
placed before the title info to align everything.
This just meant that I had to run the program, see how far I was off
and adjust the variable.
<p>
Here is the code.

<pre>

BEGIN		{
		over = "                 "
		print over, " Cost of Euros in $ by date"
		print over, ".9       1.0       1.1       1.2       1.3"
		print over, "|         |         |         |         |"
		}
/Rates as of/	{ date = $4 }
/^USD/		{ rate = $6 }
/^&lt;\/PRE>/	{
		printf "%s %6.3f ", date, rate
		rc = (rate - .895) * 100
		for (i=0; i < rc; i++) printf "+"
		printf "\n"
		date = "xxx"
		rate = 0
		}
</pre>

<p>
Just running the program with the mail file as input prints all the
result lines but the order is that of the data in the mail file.
The sort program to the rescue. The first field in the output is the
date and some careful choice of the first character of the title lines
means everything sorts just right with no options.
Thus, to run, use:
<pre>
    awk -f cc.as messages | sort 
</pre>
and you get your fancy report. Pipe the result thru <code>more</code>
if you have a lot of lines to look at.
<p>
Here is a sample of the output:
<pre>

                   Cost of Euros in $ by date
                  .9       1.0       1.1       1.2       1.3
