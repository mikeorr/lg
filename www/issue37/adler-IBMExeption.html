I want to clarify my comment about IBM being the "exception". It seems
to me that IBM has an internal struggle going on. There is Jim Russell
and David Shields who do research and development work and understand
the issues behind free software. The IBM management does not. Richard
Stallman pointed out during the Free Software panel discussion that
the license for the Jikes source is written such that at any time, IBM
can shutdown the ability for anyone to modify and distribute the
code. Thus failing to attain the term Open Source(TM). (i.e. you cannot
call Jikes Open Source because of this.) Also, there was a recent
posting to the LXNY mail list about a speaker from IBM who was going
to talk about the new mailer software which could replace
sendmail. The lawyers at IBM prevented this new mailer program from
being released under an Open Source type license. Thus the free
software battles rage inside the hallowed halls of IBM.
