<H2>Remote Compilation Using SSH and Make</H2>

  <H3>
    Problem
  </H3>

<P>
Occasionally I use my Linux machine at home to write code that I
intend to compile on a remote machine.
<P>
While maintaining open <TT>ftp</TT> and <TT>telnet</TT> connections to
the remote machine to handle the transfer and compilation steps is a
manageable solution, I decided to explore <TT><A
HREF="#ssh">ssh</A></TT> and <TT><A HREF="#make">make</A></TT> to
develop a more automated method.
<P>
The benefits of my solution:
<UL>
<LI> No need to remember which files have been modified.
<LI> Ability to use Emacs' compilation capabilities to move to errors in
   the source.  <LI> As mentioned above, no need to use <TT>ftp</TT>
and <TT>telnet</TT>, and hence no
   benefit to keep an open dialup connection when not compiling.
<LI> Automate, automate, automate. Laziness is a virtue.
</UL>

<H3>
Overview of Solution
</H3>
<P>
My first step was to set up <TT>ssh</TT> and related tools in order to
allow
secure copying of files to my remote system. While setting up a
<TT>.rhosts</TT>
file is a (barely) acceptable solution, my IP address and name is
different each time I dial in, and it would be rather awkward to
change the remote system's <TT>.rhosts</TT> file each time I dialed
in.
<P>
<TT>ssh</TT> allows me to use a much more secure form of
authentication to copy
files and execute remote commands.
<P>
Once I had <TT>ssh</TT> behaving properly, I used Emacs' <TT>info</TT> facility to
explore implicit rules in makefiles, and wrote a simple makefile to
handle the file transfers and remote compilation.
<P>
As an example of the intended effect, assume my remote machine is
called "remote" (and my local machine "local"), and I've just modified
a source file called <TT>daemon.c</TT>. I would like to execute the
following commands in an automated fashion (note that <TT>scp</TT> is
a secure copy command packaged with <TT>ssh</TT>, and that the
<TT>-C</TT> option specifies compression, useful for dialup connections):
<PRE>
scp -C daemon.c jdaily@remote:~/source-directory
ssh -C remote "cd source-directory && make"
</PRE>

<H3>
Implementation
</H3>
<P>
First, I needed <TT>sshd</TT> running on the remote system to handle my secure
connections. Fortunately, <TT>sshd</TT> was already running on the remote
system in question, but according to the man pages, it can be run as
any user, and is restricted to handling connections for that user
(which should be quite sufficient for our needs).
<P>
Then, I needed to install the <TT>ssh</TT> toolset on my local machine. Again,
ideally these would be installed in a public binary directory such as
<TT>/usr/local/bin</TT>, but any user can install them in his/her
home directory.

<P>
I also wanted a key which would allow me to authenticate myself
between systems, and which would eliminate the need to type my
password each time I tried to run one of the <TT>ssh</TT> commands. For this, I
just ran <TT>ssh-keygen</TT>, and made sure to not give a pass
phrase, so that
none would be needed to use my private key to establish the
connection.

<PRE>
[jdaily@local ~]$ ssh-keygen 
Initializing random number generator...
Generating p:  ............++ (distance 186)
Generating q:  ......................................++ (distance 498)
Computing the keys...
Testing the keys...
Key generation complete.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/jdaily/.ssh/identity): &lt;CR&gt;
Enter passphrase: &lt;CR&gt;
Enter the same passphrase again: &lt;CR&gt;
Your identification has been saved in /home/jdaily/.ssh/identity.
Your public key is:
1024 35 718535638573954[...] jdaily@local
Your public key has been saved in /home/jdaily/.ssh/identity.pub
</PRE>

<P>
Once I had a public key, I used <TT>scp</TT> to copy it to the remote machine.

<PRE>
[jdaily@local ~]$ scp -C ~/.ssh/identity.pub jdaily@remote:~/.ssh/key
jdaily's password: &lt;entered my remote password&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
Then I logged into the remote host and copied the key file into
<TT>~/.ssh/authorized_hosts</TT>. If that file already existed, I
would have
appended the key file.
<P>
Following all this, I could run <TT>ssh</TT> and <TT>scp</TT> without needing either a
password or a pass phrase to connect to <TT>remote</TT>.
<P>
Now I needed a makefile to automate my system. Ideally, the files on
the remote machine would be checked to see if they were older than the
files on my local machine, and if so, they would be copied over. To
simplify matters, I decided to keep a record of the "last transferred
date" for each file by touching a corresponding file each time I
copied a source file over.
<P>
As an example, when I transferred a newer copy of <TT>daemon.c</TT>
over, I touched <TT>daemon.ct</TT> in the same directory. Any
transfer of a <TT>.h</TT> file would be marked by the creation of a
file with a <TT>.ht</TT> suffix.
<P>
After poking around the <TT>info</TT> file for <TT>make</TT>, I came
up with the following makefile.
<PRE>
TRANSFER=scp
REXEC=ssh
SSHFLAGS=-C # Compress data
REMOTE=jdaily@remote:~/source-directory
FILES=debug.ht messages.ht client.ct daemon.ct queue.ct queue.ht

%.ht : %.h
	$(TRANSFER) $(SSHFLAGS) $&lt; $(REMOTE)
	touch $@

%.ct : %.c
	$(TRANSFER) $(SSHFLAGS) $&lt; $(REMOTE)
	touch $@

all-done: $(FILES)
	$(REXEC) $(SSHFLAGS) remote "cd source-directory && make"
	touch all-done
</PRE>
<P>
This had one limitation in particular; I was unable to specify
command-line arguments for <TT>make</TT> on the remote machine without writing
them directly into the makefile on my local system.  While this was
fine for the current application, I decided to generalize it by
creating a <TT>run-make</TT> shell script, which would handle the remote
execution of make after calling make on the local system.
<P>
Here is my <TT>run-make</TT> shell script:
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh

make
echo ssh -C remote \"cd source-directory \&\& make $*\"
ssh -C remote "cd source-directory && make $*"
</PRE>
<P>
I then removed the line from my makefile which remotely ran <TT>make</TT>.
<P>
Here's the output from a successful compilation sequence.

<PRE>
cd ~/source-directory/
./run-make
scp -C debug.h jdaily@remote:~/source-directory
touch debug.ht
scp -C messages.h jdaily@remote:~/source-directory
touch messages.ht
scp -C client.c jdaily@remote:~/source-directory
touch client.ct
scp -C daemon.c jdaily@remote:~/source-directory
touch daemon.ct
scp -C queue.c jdaily@remote:~/source-directory
touch queue.ct
scp -C queue.h jdaily@remote:~/source-directory
touch queue.ht
touch all-done
ssh -C remote "cd source-directory && make "
