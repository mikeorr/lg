<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Sean Dreilinger</H4>
Sean Dreilinger 
suffered through two years of Los Angeles smog for a Masters degree in
library/information systems at UCLA. Linux swept him off his feet in grad
school and turned into a Network Administration career for the University.
Consulting on Internet strategy and info-system design in assorted
bored-rooms followed. Today he beams-in to www.interactivate.com from a
remote mountain cabin near Cuyamaca, California and is only required to
show his face at work once a week--nice job for the outdoors-loving and
socially inept. He lives with his lover Kathy and this incredible
high-altitude silence--punctuated only by the sound of wind rustling in the
Manzanita trees, hummingbirds fighting for a perch on the feeder, and that
reassuring whir of SCSI drives dancing with Linux under the desk. More life
story with explicit photos can be found at http://www.interactivate.com/people/sean/.

<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Jesper Pedersen</a></H4>
Jesper Pedersen lives in Odense, Denmark, where he has studied computer science
at Odense University since 1990. He expects to obtain his degree in a year and
a half. He has a great job as a system manager at the
university, and also teaches computer science two hours a week. He is very 
proud of his &quot;child,&quot; The Dotfile Generator, which he wrote as part of his
job at the university. The idea for it came a year and a half ago, when he had
to learn how to configure Emacs by reading about 700 pages of the lisp manual.
It started small, but as time went by, it expanded into a huge project.
In his spare time, he does Yiu-Yitsu, listens to music, drinks beer and has fun with
his girl friend. He loves pets, and has a 200 litre aquarium and two very cute
rabbits.

<IMG ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="" SRC="../gx/rose.gif">
Seattle--always a wonderful event. Riley and I spent the morning working
in the yard, clearing out a flower bed that was overgrown with grass. It
felt like hard physical labor after sitting at a desk all week. We rewarded
ourselves by taking a spin on the motorcycle along the Sound. Even as
passenger there is something about riding on a motorcycle that puts a smile
on my face. I guess it helps that I have complete trust in Riley's driving
abilities.
<P> 
Afterward I went to the Opera House for a talk about <I>Il Trovatore</I> by
Giuseppe Verdi (or Joe Green, as Riley likes to call him). I had seen
the opera itself on Wednesday night--a silly
story as usual but, oh, such
wonderful music! I think it has to be one of my favorites. At any rate
the talk was informative and fun and made a nice end to a very wonderful
day.
<P>
Have fun!
