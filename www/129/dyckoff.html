<h1>Away Mission -- SEMTECH - The Semantic Web Technology Conference</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</A></b></p>

<p> Semantics is a new, interesting, and demanding area for web
technologists; it promotes the creation of ontologies and provides tools to
conserve meaning within the data. The use of semantics in the development
of data taxonomies is now a $2 billion per year market, and is projected to
grow to over $50 billion by the year 2010. A large part of this is driven
by 3-letter government agencies [ e.g., the NSA ] - unsurprisingly, several
of the attendees hailed from that sector.
</p>

<p> IT industry analysts have estimated that 35-65% of our 'untamable' system
integration costs are due to semantic issues [semantic discontinuities];
this is making the overlap of semantics and web technologies an issue of
critical interest to businesses on the cutting edge.
</p>

<p>
The fusion of semantics and web technologies goes back to the late 1990s
and was proposed by Tim Berners-Lee. His proposal to the WC3, <a
href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Semantic.html">"A roadmap to the
Semantic Web"</a> in 1998 inspired other contributors.
</p>

<p>
In 2004, the W3C released the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the
Ontology Web Language (OWL) as W3C Recommendations.  RDF is used to
represent information and to exchange knowledge on the Web; in this system,
the combination of Subject/Predicate/Object constitutes an RDF "Triple"
where the 'object' uses URIs to encode this information and to point to a
specific web location.
</p>

<p>
OWL is used to publish and share sets of terms called <em>ontologies</em>, which
support advanced Web searching, software agents, and knowledge management.
OWL and RDF are two of the main ingredients of today's Semantic Web. For
more information, see this <a
href="http://www.w3.org/XML/1999/XML-in-10-points">working definition of RDF</a>.
</p>

<p>
In simple terms, RDF provides a standard and unambiguous way to make
statements about resources, while OWL overlays RDF and provides the ability
to make inferences about data. OWL, in turn, is used to build complex rule
systems. Prior art for OWL comes from DAML, the so-called DARPA Agent
Markup Language.
</p>

<h3>Semantic Web Technology</h3>
<p>
The big idea here is extend the HTML web with the addition of "meaningful"
tags such that software can help us find things - and then relate those
things to other things. The Semantic Web extends the utility of the World
Wide Web through the use of standards, semantic markup languages, inference
engines and related processing tools. That may well be the stuff of Web 3.0...
</p>

<p>
A Sunday evening primer on the Semantic Web, "Semantics in Perspective,"
was given by Dave McComb, President of Semantic Arts. His presentation drew
from his 2005 tutorial, which is <a
href="http://www.semanticarts.com/data/7d1e4bb9-3912-4e66-95d9-0ccf51efdc80/files/Toronto%20DAMA%20Oct%2019%202005.pdf">available from his company web site</a>.
</p>

<p>
This is, admittedly, very dense material; after the opening keynote and a
tech session, I felt the early onset of brain fatigue. But the final
session I attended, on the challenges of classifying Disney's vast media
collection, gave me much a better sense of why and how to apply these
techniques. I also learned that semantic metadata can increase the value of
content, especially media. For instance, that animation cel in a frame is
worth more depending on 'who' painted it and 'when' and how many there
were. [See this <a
href="http://www.semantic-conference.com/2up_bw/solomon-madi.pdf">great slide pack</a> for more].
</p>

<p>
That opening keynote with Ora Lassila [co-author of the RDF standard and
Research Fellow at the Nokia Research Center] set the tone and context for
the entire conference. He shared the stage with James Hendler [Director of the
Joint Institute for Knowledge Discovery, University of Maryland], with whom
he and Tim Berners-Lee had co-authored the seminal 2001 Scientific American
paper "The Semantic Web" which discussed the concept of <a
href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?articleID=00048144-10D2-1C70-84A9809EC588EF21&amp;catID=2">Semantic Webvision</a>.
</p>

<p>
They had also independently written two of the earlier, defining articles on the
concept of the Semantic Web, setting the terminology and direction for many
of the researchers and developers to follow. We are not, however, talking about a
long history here: Ora wrote about pervasive computing in his 1999 article,
"Why your microwave oven needs to surf the WWW." Jim published his DARPA
article on "Tetherless DAML and the Mobile Semantic Web" in Oct. 2000.
</p>

<p>
In an informal and interweaving style, both Ora and Jim described a
timeline of Semantic Technology history and also gave themselves a report
card on their pronouncements. [The slides for this keynote are 
availible <a
href="http://www.semantic-conference.com/2up_bw/SemTech-Lassila-Hendler-bw.pdf">here</a>.]
</p>

<p>
The prehistory of the Semantic Web starts in 1990s, emphasizing metadata
and the second wave of AI. Much of the discussion at that time focused on
the key changes in traditional AI, its failings and its rebirth with space
probes like Mars Rover and Deep Space-1.
</p>

<p>
Ora -- "We learn from the history of AI that only embedded AI was
successful. Standalone AI did not succeed." He noted that reasoning tools
are a 'means' and not an end. "And toward any end, content is still very
important."
</p>

<p>
Ora -- [referencing the 2001 Scientific American article where he wrote
about robust agents to work on the "behalf" of people] "... Sem-Tech web
services are the 'plumbing' for these agents, and some trials are now
underway. These must be able to handle unexpected and inconsistant
data... Semantic systems will help here."
</p>

<p>
Later, Ora said, "Another thing about agents... I work for a company that
makes little mobile devices... the way we use mobile devices for browsing
is not the best possible paradigm... [there are, e.g., problems when driving].
So here is another case where you need systems that work for you."
</p>

<p>
Jim -- "...the miracle is not in a new magic box... it is when we start
linking things together." He went on to describe <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL">SPARQL</a> [an <a
title="Resource Description Framework"
href="http://www.w3.org/2001/11/13-RDF-Query-Rules/">RDF</a> Query
Language] as a doc and data exchange mechanism.  With a picture of
massively interlinked systems on screen, he added "... we have both broad
tech and deep technology -- we will use these things we all are building
but also we must link them all together..."
</p>

<p>
Ora - "...most of what we predicted is already happening, and its happening
faster than we anticipated ... the ontolgies are there but there is
little linking so far... and little progress on agents..."
</p>

<p>
The closing keynote by Mills Davis was distinctly less academic. Subtitled
"The Executive Guide to Billion Dollar Markets," it was a summary of a
market research paper prepared by Project 10X: Semantic Wave
2006, Part 1. The presentation addressed the business value of the new
semantic wave technologies and provided perspectives to help business
executives seeking to use "distributed intelligence" for strategic
advantage in global markets. [This <a

</p>

<h3>The WSDL connection</h3>
<p>
There was also much discussion about the connection between Web Services
and Semantics. During the week of the SemTech conference, the shorter name
that the organizers used frequently, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
reinforced its commitment to Web Services with continued work on SOAP, Web
Services Description Language (WSDL), and addressing specs by chartering a
new group to enhance WSDL with semantics to automate the composition and
discovery of Web Services.
</p>

<p>
WSDL is used to describe the interface of a Web service with inputs and
outputs. But WSDL alone does not provide enough information to determine
automatically whether the interfaces of two arbitrary Web services are
compatible.  Semantic descriptions can make it easier to automatically
identify services that have compatible inputs and outputs. With a
description of a service for finding books and a description of a service
for purchasing them, it becomes much easier to combine these into a useful
composite. Similarly, machine-readable semantic descriptions facilitate the
discovery of the correct Web services.
</p>

<p>
Semantic WSDL [or WSDL-S] was discussed in the context of "Large Scale
Distributed Information Systems" by Amit Sheth of the University of Georgia.
This talk focused on semantics for Web Services and SOAs, and offered
analysis of the underlying architectures. He noted that today "... a lot of
land work is required to link processes" across different business domains.
This is because different businesses and public intstitutions use different
vocabularies. There needs to be agreement on processes and on data and data
formats. Said Sheth, "...semantic description is the way to integrate
disparate services and data." He offered a semantic-aware archtitecture
that used web taxonomies to link different domains.
</p>


<h3>Semantics Enrich Web Service Descriptions</h3>
<p>
WSDL 2.0 includes the hooks to allow the specification of semantic
descriptions. The W3C has chartered the Semantic Annotations for Web
Services Description Language (SAWSDL) Working Group to develop annotations
that takes advantage of those hooks. This group will also provide a mapping
of the new properties into a form compatible with the existing RDF mapping
for WSDL.
</p>

<p>
Currently, more than 400 researchers and developers participate in the
continuing Semantic Web Services Interest Group (SWSIG), a public forum
created in 2003 to discuss the integration of the Semantic Web and Web
Services. That should go some way toward putting working semantics under
the covers of Web Services.
</p>

<p>
This is the working definition of RDF from the W3C XML (the "10 Points" doc):
</p>

<pre>
   W3C's Resource Description Framework (RDF) is an XML text format that supports
   resource description and metadata applications, such as music playlists, photo
   collections, and bibliographies. For example, RDF might let you identify
   people in a Web photo album using information from a personal contact list; then
   your mail client could automatically start a message to those people stating that
   their photos are on the Web. Just as HTML integrated documents, images, menu
   systems, and forms applications to launch the original Web, RDF provides
   tools to integrate even more, to make the Web a little bit more into a
   Semantic Web.
