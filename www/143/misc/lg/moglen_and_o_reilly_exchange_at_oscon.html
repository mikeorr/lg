Hi Rick,
</p>

<p>
Found a video of the Eben Moglen/ Tim O'Reilly exchange at OSCon. It
was titled "Licensing in the Web 2.0 Era". Unfornatley, the video
appears to be in a .mov quicktime format, but seems playable on Free
software players(w/ unFree codecs).

Funny comment about trying to get the O'Reilly OSCon copy of the video/audio:
"Regrettably, we missed the assault. Stories needed to go out, and we
assumed the chat would follow familiar, boring lines. After about ten
people later asked if we caught the spectacular show, The Register
contacted the OSCON audio staff to obtain a recording of the session.
"No problem," they said, "It will just take a couple of minutes, but
you need to get O'Reilly's permission first." O'Reilly corporate
refused to release the audio, saying it would cause a slippery slope.
(We're still trying to understand that one.) They, however, did add
that Moglen appeared to be "off his meds."

hth,

<p>
ps. What was that name of that book that you where discussing at Linux
Picnix about the Renaissance? It was a case study done about Florence
Nightingale, the father of the rugby school, and someone else. TIA.

&gt; Found a video of the Eben Moglen/ Tim O'Reilly exchange at OSCon. It
&gt; was titled "Licensing in the Web 2.0 Era". Unfornatley, the video

<p>
I'll be checking this out when I'm next at a computer with the necessary
software.  (My Xubuntu iBook will play many Quicktime .mov files, but, 
since it's a G3 PPC, the unfree codecs are out, even if I wanted them 
present, which I really don't.)
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, there have been a number of text excerpts from Moglen's
commentary.  Here's a typical one, from
<a href="http://www.linux.com/feature/118201">http://www.linux.com/feature/118201</a> :
</p>

<p>
[snipping some valid and cogent points about hosted applications 
not being new, and per Moglen not being all that important over the long
term, in any event.]
</p>

<p>
   The idea that Google and other "Web 2.0" providers are somehow making
   licenses irrelevant is wrong, says Moglen, because those companies
   are exercising freedoms that Richard M. Stallman sought to protect
   with the GPL -- namely, the right to run software for any purpose,
   and the right to make private modifications. While those rights may
   conflict with others -- namely the right to study modifications --
   Moglen says that "binary thinking" won't solve the problem. Instead
   we need diplomacy to protect and ensure the rights of all parties.
   "We've got to conclude that what Google does, they have a right to do
   in freedom. They shouldn't need permission to run programs. If you
   need permission to run programs, you can't have freedom."
</p>

<p>
This is precisely the except that stopped me cold, in my attempt to 
make sense of the badgeware issue.  To the extent that one can fairly
consider an off-the-cuff riposte from Prof. Moglen to reflect the
considered position of FSF (which might be: not much), this <em>seems</em>
to say that FSF opposes any attempt to enforce copyleft concepts
in ASP scenrios, because the modifications added to those hosted apps 
by third parties are "private modifications", and amount to merely
"running the program", for which users "shouldn't need permission".
</p>

<p>
I respect Prof. Moglen.  Regardless of whether he speaks for anyone else
when he says things, I always listen carefully.
</p>

<p>
So, I feel vaguely guilty when I find myself wondering if he's simply
missed the point.  Surely that can't be?
</p>

<p>
My understanding is that the reason conventional copyleft licences' 
reciprocal provisions are linked to distribution <em>isn't</em> because
there's anything especially crucial about distribution per se, but 
rather because the nature of copyright law makes it an obvious point of
leverage by reserving that right by default to the copyright owner:
Licensors would prefer to say "If you do something significant with this
codebase, and if outside parties are using your mods, you must give
everyone else access to the latter" -- but "outside parties using your
mods" is not something copyright owners are entitled to control,
because, as Moglen has often pointed out, usage as such requires no 
permission in the first place (absent contract restrictions).
</p>

<p>
IIRC, the remedy taken by OSL, ASPL, and Honest Public License, and
Affero is to apply a very modest contractual obligation linked to
a particular type of ASP usage.  So, per Moglen, we're supposed to think
those obligations are evil because they encumber "private" usage?
Really?
