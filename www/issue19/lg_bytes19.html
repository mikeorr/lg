SPAM Counter Attack!
</H3> 
<P> 
If you'd like to have your voice heard regarding SPAM mail, why don't you
consider writing a letter to your representative? 

<p>If you're not sure of who your representatives are, check the Congressional
websites:
<ul>
<li>House: <a href="http://www.house.gov/writerep/">http://www.house.gov/writerep/</a>
<li>Senate: <a href="http://www.senate.gov/senator/index.html">http://www.senate.gov/senator/index.html</a>
</ul>

<p>The postal addresses for your members are:

<table>
<tr>
<td>The Honorable (Senator name)</td>     <td>The Honorable (Rep. name)</td>

<td>Washington, DC 20510</td>           <td>Washington, DC  20515</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The letter doesn't have to be long... two paragraphs is as effective as 10
pages. And you don't need to write different letters, the same one can be
sent to each Member. (Just remember to change the mailing address!)

Linux-Access Web Pages
</H3> 
<P> 

The Center for Disabled Student Services at the University of 
Utah in Salt Lake City Utah, today announced it's newly re-designed
linux-access web pages.  linux-access is a mailing list hosted by   
CDSS which is used by both developers and users of the Linux operating  
system in order to aid development and integration of access related
technology into the Linux OS and available software.

<p>Both users and developers of Linux are encouraged to join the
mailing list and help Linux become more accessible to everyone.  Among
those encouraged to subscribe to the list are companies making Linux
distributions so that they can incorporate access technology into their
products as well as get valuable feedback from users.

<p>Location of the new pages is at:
<a href="http://ssv1.union.utah.edu/linux-access/">http://ssv1.union.utah.edu/linux-access/</a>.<br>

Location of the blinux FTP mirror is at
        <a href="ftp://ssv1.union.utah.edu/pub/mirrors/blinux/">ftp://ssv1.union.utah.edu/pub/mirrors/blinux/</a>.<br>

<p>An archive of the mailing list can be found on the Linux v2 Information HQ
site at:

Supreme Court Ruling
</H3> 
<P> 

The U.S. Supreme Court extended free-speech rights
to cyberspace in its recent ruling striking down a federal law
that restricted indecent pictures and words on the Internet computer
network. 

<p>The court declared the law that bans the dissemination of
sexually explicit material to anyone younger than 18 unconstitutional. 

<p>"Notwithstanding the legitimacy and importance of the congressional goal
of protecting children from harmful materials, we agree ... that the
statute abridges 'freedom of speech' protected by the First Amendment,"
Justice John Paul Stevens said for the court majority in the 40-page
opinion. 

<p>The ruling represented a major victory for the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) and groups representing libraries, publishers and the
computer on-line industry, which brought the lawsuit challenging the law.
