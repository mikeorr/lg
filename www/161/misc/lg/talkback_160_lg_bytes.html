[ Wait, wait... this is like a repeat nightmare. Isn't there a
standard story about how the Chevrolet Nova didn't sell well in Mexico
because 'no va' in Spanish means 'no go'??? Only this time, it's not
clueless American GM executives deciding on the name... -- Ben ]

<p>
Nova also means new in some spanish based languages (including portuguese)

I clearly didn't make my tongue-in-cheek attitude obvious here. I'm
quite aware of the Snopes entry (perhaps linking to it would have been
prevented misunderstandings), and that <em>is</em> what I meant by "standard
story"; that's what made it so amusing. It's not like Cuban students at
a Cuban uni creating a Cuban distribution would be unaware enough of
their own language to name their distro anything questionable or weird,
any more than Mexicans are likely to name their national distro after a
sugar cone or a nail, or Dominicans have one called "Grab me!", or
Venezuelans use "Catch your friends!" (I may have the locations wrong,
but all of the above carry... um, strong indirect meanings in Spanish
depending on the place.)
