Hello List,
</p>

<p>
 I have tried to install the gdeskcal with its dependency "python 
python-central   python-gtk2 python-numeric python-xml" in lenny and In 
return apt asking to install 170 packages with gnome gnome desktop and some 
other tools which really don't have any connection with gdeskcal !!! I did 
not see this in sarge. What is going on ?
</p>

<p>
I like to install gdeskcal with icewm. Why 170 pacakes ??
</p>

<p>
Thanks
</p>

<p>
Thanks Thomas for your response. I am worried about this because in sarge I 
used to use icewm and there I installed gdeskcal without these huge... 
dependency. but in lenny gdeskcal is asking for entire gnome plus nautilus, 
sudo etc.... which is really not required for gdeskcal !!!
That's why I am confused about apt in lenny

<strong>Frequently</strong> (usually?) the first letter being a 'g' indicates that it 
is tied in with the Gnome desktop, so I suspect that apt wants to pull 
that in with its dependencies.   The "gtk" (Gnome toolkit) reference is 
further evidence of this.  Yes, that is a lot of packages.
</p>

<p>
If you were previously using Gnome, or just had it loaded on your 
system, the python packages would be all you would need to add.  As a 
user of Ubuntu (which is derived from Debian) I end up with those 
anyway, so my download was much simpler.  I didn't even need to download 
the python stuff, since I have been known to dabble in python in idle 
moments.
</p>

<p>
You might want to try another calendar with less baggage if you don't 
want the Gnome desktop loaded onto your hard drive.

This is a bad heurisitic to go by -- use "apt-cache" the way it was intended:

<p>
Sounds like a classic case of GNOME disease.  In this case, it might be a
cascading series of dependencies from python-gtk2 -- or you might have
inadvertantly left your system, prior to that request, in a state where
it had already been trying to fetch GNOME packages for reasons unrelated
to gdeskcal and is now trying to catch up.
</p>

<p>
You might try "apt-get -f install" aka "apt-get --fix-broken install" 
first, before attempting to install gdeskcal, to see if the latter
situation applies.  If it does, and you don't want all that GNOME
baggage, you might need to find the culprit using deborphan and
debfoster.  (One or both of them is said to be officially deprecated in
favour of something-or-other in the bloated aptitude tool, but I
personally prefer deborphan and debfoster.)

<p>
The policy which has changed with lenny is that "Recommended" packages
are installed by apt unless the user specifically turns this feature
off.
</p>

<p>
So, if you want to install "gdeskcal" without the packages that the
maintainer "Recommend"s then you might want to turn off this feature.
</p>

<p>
If you feel that "gdeskcal" functions just as well without these
recommended packages (in this case "gdesklets" which pulls in other
GNOME stuff) then file a bug agains the package asking that the
"Recommends" be downgraded to a "Suggests".

Aha.  Well, that's mildly evil.  One of several reasons I've always 
preferred the apt-get tool over aptitude is that (until now) it has 
defaulted to not autoinstalling "Recommends" dependencies.

I don't know precisely what "gdeskcal" does over and above being a
calendar but I use "wyrd" which does not even require X.

Re GNOME:
I think "someone" needs to take time off and design a GUI that
emphasises the "U as in usage" aspect and ignores the "I as in
eye-candy" aspect. (The usual rule about three fingers pointing back
applies when I am pointing at "someone"!)

<p>
Connecting this with the next message you sent to the list illustrates
why:
</p>

<pre>
Dear list,
 
I don't need kdm to run as a service because most of the time I access this
linux box remotely. Only when I am at home then I need the desktop. That's
why I have disabled the kdm. 
</pre>

<p>
You're running KDE [1], and you're trying to load a GNOME applet. In
essence, you're telling Debian "I want you to replace KDE with GNOME, or
at least load all of GNOME - since that's what it takes to run the
applet - onto my system."
</p>

<p>
So the answer is, it's doing what you asked it to. I also have a strong
suspicion that few of those 170 packages are 'Recommends'; GNOME just
drags a long, long tail behind it.
</p>


<p>
[1] It's not really necessary to point out that 'kdm' can be used to
launch WMs other than KDE; in practice, one strongly implies the other.
