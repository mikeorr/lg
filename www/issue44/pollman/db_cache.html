<b>FILE db.cache</b>: This file lists the authoritative name servers
for the very top domains. It used to be a real pain to get and keep straight,
but the utilities that come with bind version 8 have a little program called
"dig" that does all the hard work. To get your db.cache file, while connected
to the internet, type:
<p>dig @e.root-servers.net . ns>/var/named/db.cache
<p>Since you need to keep this file up to date, I have not included it
here - it is so easy to get anyway. I this set on my dns server via cron
to run monthly so it stays up to date.
