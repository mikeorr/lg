Reading and correcting the incoming articles from the SVN repository.
Correcting the HTML, straightening out the grammar, checking the links,
ensuring that the LG article format (defined in
http://linuxgazette.net/faq/author.html) is followed. Requires a good
command of English; occasionally requires "translating" the idiomatic
usages of non-native English speakers.

Includes checking the final layout of the article by running
SVN_ROOT/bin/lg-pub and examining the output in
LG_WWW/<issue#>/<article_name>.
 
Time commitment:
	1-3 hours per article
