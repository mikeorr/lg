Cleanliness is important!  Wash the coffee pot every day for peak
flavor, and wash your hands before serving food and beverages.

<P> To make the cafe inviting to customers, wipe up spills from tables
or floors when there are no customers in line.

<P> Shop around at local bakeries to find the best baked goods.
If you tell them you are opening an Internet cafe, many bakeries
will bring you a free sample plate of breakfast pastries.

<P> Get plenty of change and small bills in the morning in case the first
few customers only have large bills.

You are in a maze of twisty little RFC 822 headers, mostly alike.  To the
south you see a door with the label "MX" hastily taped over what appears to
be the letter "A".  To the north is another RFC822 header.  There is a 
trophy case here.

The trophy case has clearly seen better days.  It has different sections
with small faded labels like "MIME" and "base 64 encoded".  It appears to

It's in the trophy case.

And you think everybody in "the press" knows everything?  Have you ever 
tried e-mailing a random publication in Vancouver or Halifax to see whether
they'd tell you how to get in touch with the local phone company?  

<P> Try typing "XXXXX Illinois telephone" into a search engine and see
what it says.  Many cities have a general links page maintained by some
public or private organization.  Or find the city's Chamber of Commerce
and ask them.

it does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of the
