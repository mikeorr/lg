<h1>Securing Apache Web Server with mod_security</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/pfeiffer.html">Ren&eacute; Pfeiffer</a></b></p>

<p>
The Internet has its share of packet filters and proxy servers in order to
increase the security for clients and servers alike. Filtering network
traffic is never a bad idea since it provides a basic level of protection.
When it comes down to protecting web servers your packet filter will most
probably allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic to your server application. Unless
you deploy an application proxy that inspects HTTP you can't do more.
But you can equip your Apache web server with <tt>mod_security</tt> which in
turns helps you to analyse any request thrown at it.
</p>

<h2>
Application Layer Inspection
</h2>

<p>
When you do any network traffic filtering or inspection you have to keep in mind
that usually nothing understand the things that should be inspected better than
the application in question. This is one of the reasons why proxy filters are
"better" suited for this job. They know the protocol and can normalise fancily
encoded requests. <tt>mod_security</tt> is in a very similar position. It sits
right inside the Appache <tt>httpd</tt> process and inspects the HTTP requests.
This is an important advantage over proxies since it can also see compressed or
even encrypted content without difficulties.
</p>
<p>
So, what needs to be inspected? Apache's <tt>httpd</tt> surely does inspect HTTP
requests. What do I need more? Well, there are some things <tt>mod_security</tt>
can do for you.
<ul>
<li> <strong>Better logging</strong><br>
     The module can log the content of HTTP POST requests. Apache usually doesn't log
     that. Furthermore you can log complete HTTP transactions. This makes the job
     of a potential attacker harder. In addition to that you have a very fine
     control on what and when to log.</li>
<li> <strong>Real time operation</strong><br>
     <tt>mod_security</tt> sees the requests directly and can act immediately.</li>
<li> <strong>Anomalies</strong><br>
     The security module can act on anomalies in the web server operation by
     looking at request rates, IP addresses, HTTP sessions and user account.</li>
<li> <strong>Black-/whitelisting</strong><br>
     You can use a signature-based approach and define what you want to allow and
     what you want to block.</li>
<li> <strong>Protects other web servers</strong><br>
     You can even protect other web server software by combining it with <tt>mod_proxy</tt>.
     The Apache server can act as reverse proxy thus seeing all HTTP requests and applying
     rule sets.</li>
</ul>
Sounds pretty impressive if you ask me. 
Now we only need to know how to add it to an existing Apache deployment.
</p>

<h2>
Installation
</h2>

<p>
The current released version is 2.x. It works well with Apache 2.0.x and 2.2.x. Apache 1.3.x is not
supported anymore (you should really upgrade your Apache servers, seriously). <tt>mod_security</tt>
has some more requirements.
<ul>
<li> You'll need the module <tt>mod_unique_id</tt> installed.</li>
<li> libxml2 and its development package is needed since the module can inspect XML and has to
     parse it.</li>
<li> If you use an Apache web server from your distribution, make sure the development packages
     are installed as well.</li>
<li> You'll need either the PCRE library for parsing regular expressions from your operating
     system or bundled with your Apache. <tt>mod_security</tt>'s documentation has a special
     note in case the compilation goes wrong.</li>
</ul>
<tt>mod_security</tt> doesn't use <tt>autoconf</tt>. You have to check its Makefile and
tell it where the <tt>ServerRoot</tt> directory of your Apache installation is. Then you can
try <tt>make</tt> and see if everything compiles. If you get compilation errors, make sure
your compiler environment and your development packages are complete. After the <tt>make</tt>
command finishes, stop your Apache server and issue a <tt>make install</tt>. The Makefile
will copy the module into the Apache server modules directory (usually
<tt>/usr/local/apach2/modules/</tt> for a compiled web server, your distribution may put the
modules elsewhere). Now you only need to active the module by adding the following lines to
your Apache configuration.
<pre class="code">
LoadFile /usr/lib/libxml2.so # optional
LoadModule security2_module modules/mod_security2.so
</pre>
There we go. The only thing we need is to configure the module and the rule sets.
</p>

<h2>
Configuration
</h2>

<p>
<i>One word of caution:</i> Every security measure must be applied with a specific purpose.
You can't just add filters without thinking about the consequences for applications. You or
your users may have web applications running that break when special security measures are
activated. If you are not sure about not breaking something you can use all rule sets and
actions in "audit mode". Then <tt>mod_security</tt> will only log but not block. This is a good
idea to test everything until you are sure to switch to "live mode". It also keeps your users
happy.
</p>
<p>
A very simple test is to add a single rule by using the following two lines:
<pre class="code">
SecRuleEngine On
SecRule REQUEST_URI attack
</pre>
Now send your web server a request with the word <i>attack</i> in it. You should get the
error code <i>403 Forbidden</i> and the blocked request should generate an entry in
Apache's error log file. If you set the first option to
<pre class="code">
SecRuleEngine DetectionOnly
</pre>
then the module will only detect and block nothing. We will now take a look at the classes
of different options available. Please make sure you take a look at <tt>mod_security</tt>'s
documentation and at the file in the sample core rules archive that can be downloaded.
</p>

<h3>
General Options
</h3>

<p>
<tt>mod_security</tt> has several groups of options. Here are some of the basic configuration
directives.
<pre class="code">
SecRuleEngine On
SecRequestBodyAccess On
SecResponseBodyAccess On
</pre>
The first line switches request inspection on or off. The other two lines control whether
request and response body data will be inspected by the module. Keep in mind that the data
has to be buffered. This means that it is required for inspecting HTTP POST requests, but
it has to be buffered and thus needs memory. You can reduce the amount of memory used by
this directive.
<pre class="code">
SecRequestBodyInMemoryLimit 131072
</pre>
You can also limit the size of the HTTP request body data. This is very handy for disabling
large data in HTTP POST requests.
<pre class="code">
SecRequestBodyLimit 10485760
</pre>
Every request bigger than 10485760 byte will be answered by the error code 
<i>413 Request Entity Too Large</i>. The default is 134217728 bytes (131072 KB).
</p>
<p>
Web servers typically include the MIME type of data they put into responses. You can control
the types you want to inspect. Usually you will not want to parse JPEG or PDF data.
<pre class="code">
SecResponseBodyMimeTypesClear
SecResponseBodyMimeType (null) text/plain text/html text/css text/xml
</pre>
The first statement clears the list of types to be checked. The second line sets the types
we are interested in. File uploads may be something you wish to control. You can redirect
every file upload to a seperate directory. In addition you can collect all
uploaded files to your server provided you have the disk space. This may be useful for forensic
activities after something has gone wrong.
<pre class="code">
SecUploadDir /var/spool/apache/private
SecUploadKeepFiles Off
</pre>
It is good practice not to use the usual directories for temporary files for storing uploads.
Create a directory for this purpose and set the permissions accordingly. Only Apache needs
to access this space.
</p>

<h3>
Logging
</h3>

<p>
You can enable audit logging which can help you a lot during debugging or worse situations.
You have the choice of logging everything or only events that triggered one of <tt>mod_security</tt>'s
internal checks. This includes the rule sets.
<pre class="code">
SecAuditEngine RelevantOnly
SecAuditLogRelevantStatus "^[45]"
</pre>
We want to log only relevant events and concentrate on responses that generate 4xx or 5xx
status codes. That's what the regular expression is for. You can do a full logging if you need to.
The log can be written into a single file or into a directory with one file per log event. The latter
is usually only for high volume sites. 
<pre class="code">
SecAuditLogType Serial
SecAuditLog /var/log/www/modsec_audit.log
# SecAuditLogStorageDir /var/log/www/modsec_audit
</pre>
As mentioned before the content that can be logged is extended. You can log portions of the original
HTTP request along with the response. 
<pre class="code">
SecAuditLogParts "ABEIFHZ"
</pre>
This means we want to log the audit header and trailer (options A and H), the original request (option
B), an intermediate response body (option E), the modified request body (option I), the final response 
header (option F) and the final
boundary of the log event (option Z, which is mandatory). The intermediate response body is either
the original response or the modified response by <tt>mod_security</tt>. The modified request body
is either the original request body or a shortened variant whenever <i>multipart/form-data</i>
encoding was used. The default options are "ABIFHZ".
</p>

<h3>
Rules
</h3>

<p>
The security module uses five distinct phases for processing requests to and responses from the
web server.
<ol>
<li> Parse request headers</li>
<li> Parse request body</li>
<li> Parse response headers</li>
<li> Parse response body</li>
<li> Do logging</li>
</ol>
It is important to keep this in mind when designing rule sets, almost just as in designing 
packet filters. The directive <tt>SecRule</tt> describes a rule.
<pre class="code">
SecRule VARIABLES [OPERATOR] ACTIONS
</pre>
When written in this form <tt>mod_security</tt> will
<ol>
<li> expand the variables,</li>
<li> apply the operator if present,</li>
<li> trigger once for a match in every variable,</li>
<li> and execute
     <ol>
     <li> the default action or</li>
     <li> the actions described in the rule.</li>
     </ol>
     </li>
</ol>
Remember the test rule with the string "attack". We told the module to check the variable
<tt>REQUEST_URI</tt> of the HTTP request and apply the regular expression operator consisting
of the desired string to look for. We didn't give any action, so the default action applies.
You can combine variables by using logical operators.
<pre class="code">
SecRule "REQUEST_URI|QUERY_STRING" attack
</pre>
This does the same but with two different variables. The action will be triggered if the 
string fragment is found in either variable. You can use well known operators inside rules.
Matching of regular expressions is done by the PCRE library, so you can use any constructs
PCRE understands (which is basically everything you can do in Perl's pattern matching).
Long lines can be split by using "\" just as in Bash shell scripts.
</p>
<p>
Keep in mind that the <tt>VARIABLES</tt> section contains variables. Their content changes.
If the variable is empty or not present, the rule doesn't match. This is importent and 
desired for parameter checking. Variables can be <tt>ARGS</tt>, <tt>FILES</tt>, <tt>FILES_TMPNAMES</tt>,
<tt>ENV</tt>, <tt>REMOTE_PORT</tt>, <tt>QUERY_STRING</tt>, <tt>SCRIPT_BASENAME</tt>,
<tt>AUTH_TYPE</tt>, <tt>REQUEST_COOKIES</tt>, <tt>SESSIONID</tt>, <tt>TIME</tt> and many more. 
The reference has a complete list. 
</p>

<h3>
Operators
</h3>

<p>
<tt>mod_security</tt> rules can contain operators. They are used to validate the request
or look for special anomalies. The "@" indicates that an operator follows.
<pre class="code">
SecRule ARGS "@validateUtf8Encoding"
SecRule ARGS "@validateByteRange" 10,13,32-126
</pre>
The first rule checks the request for valid UTF-8 encoding. The second example checks for
a specific range of characters in the request. If the request contains other characters
than linefeed, carriage return or the US ASCII characters then the action is triggered.
You can also invoke additional scripts.
<pre class="code">
SecRule FILES_TMPNAMES "@inspectFile /usr/local/bin/check_file.pl" 
</pre>
This redirects any uploaded files to the Perl script for further checks. The exit code
of the script tells <tt>mod_security</tt> whether to invoke the action or not. You can even
use realtime blacklists for your rules.
<pre class="code">
SecRule REMOTE_ADDR "@rbl bad.guys.and.girls.example.net"
</pre>
</p>

<h3>
Actions
</h3>

<p>
There are five general types of actions.
<ol>
<li> Disruptive actions - abort current transaction.<br>
     <ul>
     <li> deny - stops transaction and generates an error.</li>
     <li> drop - drops transaction without error.</li>
     <li> redirect - responds with a redirection (such as 301 or 302).</li>
     <li> proxy - forwards the request to another server.</li>
     <li> pause - slows down the execution of the request.</li>
     </ul>
     </li>
<li> Non-disruptive actions - change the state of the current transaction.</li>
<li> Flow actions - change the flow of the rules.<br>
     <ul>
     <li> allow - stops processing of subsequent rules.</li>
     <li> chain - combines the active rule with the next one.</li>
     <li> pass - ignores a match in the current rule; useful for commenting rules out, but leave them
          still active.</li>
     <li> skip - skip the next or more rules.</li>
     </ul>
     </li>
<li> Meta-data actions - contain meta data for rules as additional information; useful for
     logging.</li>
<li> Data actions - are placeholders for other actions.</li>
</ol>
The default action can be set with the directive <tt>SecDefaultAction</tt>. It can be changed
whenever you need it, so you can define blocks of rules with different default actions.
The actions are very similar to the ones used by the intrusion detection/prevention software
<a href="http://www.snort.org/">Snort</a>. They give you a lot of flexibility and allow for 
quite complex coverage of tests. Here's is one example from the core rules that look for
attempts to inject an email message into the request.
<pre class="code">
SecRule REQUEST_FILENAME|ARGS|ARGS_NAMES|REQUEST_HEADERS|XML:/* "[\n\r]\s*(?:to|bcc|cc)\s*:.*?\@" \
  "t:none,t:lowercase,t:urlDecode,capture,ctl:auditLogParts=+E,log,auditlog,msg:'Email Injection Attack.
  Matched signature &lt;%{TX.0}&gt;',,id:'950019',severity:'2'"&lt;/%{TX.0}&gt;
</pre>
Note that I inserted a line break for better readability. The action parameter is a single string
and tell the module to log every match to the normal log and the audit log with the message
text <i>Email Injection Attack</i> along with some parameters of the request. The core rules
have more examples for other attacks such as cross-site scripting, SQL injection, HTTP anomalies
and the like.
</p>

<h3>
Rule Management
</h3>

<p>
Make sure that you keep your rule files in good order and make sure that you document every
change. This is very important. Any kind of filter can break whole applications and protocols.
Therefore you need to now what changes caused which effects. You will also need this information
when developing your own rules. Bear in mind that custom web applications need custom rules.
Some attacks may be the same, but customised applications have their peculiarities that have
to be considered. A good place to start are the core rule sets. You can disable rules without
deleting them from the configuration. This is extremely useful in case you wish to distribute
rules to multiple servers. You can do that by splitting your rule into multiple files and have
a master configuration that enables or disables selected sets.
</p>

<h2>
Performance and Deployment
</h2>

<p>
Everything has a price and so does filtering HTTP requests. <tt>mod_security</tt> needs to holds
the request in a buffer or has to store it to a temporary file. You have to take this into account.
The parsing add a little overhead in terms of CPU cycles to the web server as well. If you install
the module on a server that already has performance issues things won't get better. That's what
the reverse proxy method is for. Hard hit sites probably won't go anywhere without additional
proxies.
</p>
<p>
One last thing to keep in mind are your own web applications. Don't just set up the core rules
and accept all defaults. Inspect the rule sets and decide for yourself if you need all the rules.
Things can break if you are not careful enough. No one knows your web apps better than you.
Use this knowledge to your advantage.

<p>
Ren&eacute; was born in the year of Atari's founding and the release of the game Pong.
Since his early youth he started taking things apart to see how they work. He
couldn't even pass construction sites without looking for electrical wires that
might seem interesting. The interest in computing began when his grandfather
bought him a 4-bit microcontroller with 256 byte RAM and a 4096 byte operating
system, forcing him to learn assembler before any other language.
</p>

<p>
After finishing school he went to university in order to study physics. He then
collected experiences with a C64, a C128, two Amigas, DEC's Ultrix, OpenVMS and
finally GNU/Linux on a PC in 1997. He is using Linux since this day and still
likes to take things apart und put them together again. Freedom of tinkering
brought him close to the Free Software movement, where he puts some effort into
the right to understand how things work. He is also involved with civil liberty
groups focusing on digital rights.
</p>

<p>
Since 1999 he is offering his skills as a freelancer. His main activities
include system/network administration, scripting and consulting. In 2001 he
started to give lectures on computer security at the Technikum Wien. Apart from
staring into computer monitors, inspecting hardware and talking to network
equipment he is fond of scuba diving, writing, or photographing with his digital
camera. He would like to have a go at storytelling and roleplaying again as soon
as he finds some more spare time on his backup devices.
