&gt; I'm a native Arabic speaker. I can go through the translated text and
&gt; check it but I'm terrible at actually typing Arabic and I'm not that
&gt; good at it anyway. I'll help with the translation as much as I can. I'll
&gt; start in a few days though because I have some exams right now.

Cheers,             The genius of you Americans is that you never make 
Rick Moen           clear-cut stupid moves, only complicated stupid moves

                    something to them that we are missing. --Gamel Abdel Nasser

Still, a little about everything. Anyway, Arabic is not a very nice
language if you ask me. People are actually proud of the fact that it is
very difficult and unnecessarily complicated! (though that's not how
they'd put it....)

I aspire to speak and write that very language.  I'm pitfully far from 
doing it, at this point, but I'd like to get there.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Latin character set (ISO-8859-1 and such) to Russian, yes.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Oh ok. I can imagine how useful that would be! No more hunting for
&gt; &gt; the Arabic letters around the keyboard. Why is it difficult to do it
&gt; &gt; with Arabic? The initial/medial/final thing is just about the shape of
&gt; &gt; the letter (handled by the font, I think) but it's the same letter (same
&gt; &gt; byte).
&gt;
&gt; To get back to this - I'd be glad to do it, given your help. Can you
&gt; come up with a reasonable 1-to-1 mapping? I.e., a parallel set of
&gt; English characters and the hex values for the Arabic ones that would (at
&gt; least mostly) make sense? I've looked at some of the existing ones, and
&gt; most of them do a mix of one- and two-character keys, like

&gt; Hopefully, that'll be useful to a lot of folks - and I'd really

<p>
Sure. I'll send you a mapfile when I make one.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Kat just mentioned that there's supposed to be a Modern Standard Arabic
&gt; &gt; &gt; (MSA) that's a bit more, well, standardized. I can only imagine that
&gt; &gt; &gt; it's greeted with a mixture of horror (from those who have to learn *yet
&gt; &gt; &gt; another* version in addition to the ones they already know) and relief
&gt; &gt; &gt; (from anyone who has to learn it from scratch.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well I haven't heard about anything like that and I don't think people will
&gt; &gt; be rushing to learn it <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

[LOL] I never knew it had a name. Yes indeed most Arabic speakers can
understand and read MSA because basically that's the written Arabic I
was talking about. It's quite strange actually how everyone knows it but
no one speaks it....

Well, maybe I'm doomed, in aspiring to knowledge of a spoken variant of
Arabic that would be OK anywhere it's spoken.  I actually should have 
known, having heard many stories of how odd Syrians sound to Egyptians,
and vice-versa -- which is particularly ironic, in their case, given
their one-time effort as what was at least hoped to be a single country.

When you consider the mutually-unintelligible varieties of English -
e.g., Brooklynese vs. Louisiana "lazy mouth", or Chicano vs. Ebonics -
it becomes less startling. Unlike the varieties of Arabic, the base
words are (mostly) the same, but watching the 300-car pileup when people
try to communicate across those divides can be horrifying and amusing.
