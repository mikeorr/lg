Linux ready for the desktop? -- <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> seems to think so.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
On 13 April I installed SuSE Linux 8.0 (2.4.18-4GB) on a notebook.
Ignoring one glitch (a pcmcia module, but notebooks are notorious
for difficult installs) and my disinclination towards gui-anything,
it was the easiest installation of an operating system I have ever
experienced -- other than Coherent and DOS.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Not having a PC available with sufficient resources for recent
releases of Linux, the now 2-year-old Toshiba Satellite 2180 CDT
became the target.  In theory all data on it was backed up to the
PC but "just in case" <TT>/home</TT> and a bit more got tar'd and copied to
the PC "for a while".  So it wasn't an update but a clean install.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Probably I installed at least 4 times.  But then 2 is normal: the
first time around suprises don't always get proper responses, the
second time is for real.  However, there was something about the
pcmcia module that hung the install as the system was coming up for
the first time.  No disk activity but the fan's coming on said the
poor AMD was sweating heavily.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Once I believed that -- and by then I had learned that the default
office install includes Star Office (which I used to like but
would rather replace since it shows its origins too much) -- I
chose the standard install without office stuff and before turning
it loose removed the pcmcia module from the list of packages to
install.  After that it was like ho, hum...
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The following is my protocol of installation, prompts indented
(if the terminology differs from what SuSE actually uses stateside,
that's due to my translation from German):
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>                boot CD 1 - menu
        Installation
                Language
        German
                menu - new/update/start
        new installation
                installation settings
        accept
                start installation?
        yes-install
                root password
        xxx,ppp
                add new user
        yyy,ppp
                monitor
        LCD
        SVGA 800x600@60HZ
                CRT settings
        graphic (settings OK)
                network interfaces and modems not detected
        next
                command line login
        root,ppp
        shutdown -h now
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
This took barely 24 minutes, most of which involved installing
software.  And I have omitted what was done to avoid installing the
troublesome pcmcia module (which wouldn't be necessary on a PC).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
What really blew me away is that under the monitor options "LCD"
was right there and as model one could choose "SVGA 800x600@60HZ"!
Yeah, I still checked with sax.  The horizontal and vertical
frequencies were right.  Afterwards I spent several hours playing
with the notebook.  It even powers off when you shutdown!
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Of course it was also neat that the partitions were recognized
correctly (yeah, I know, a "clean install", but I've <EM>always</EM> used
Partition Magic) and when all was said and done Win98 was still
there, although there would have been no tears shed.  Interesting
was what can only be described as a gui-LILO: boot and you get
about 5 or 10 seconds to make a choice on a graphics screen.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I'm not unbiased.  I've been with SuSE since their 5.1.  This was
the first time using yast2, the graphic install, since they no
longer have yast1.  I wasn't aware of any possibility of driving
yast1 with a script but would have much prefered that, to make it
easy to do an identical install on several machines.  But then my
past includes IBM sysgens with decks of cards.  What irritates me
about gui-installs is the infinity of questions that need to be
answered -- every single time.  At least until this SuSE release.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Well, on a PC with adequate resources the yast2 install should go
really slick.  And like it or not that really is the yardstick
nowadays and should go well with the desktop crowd.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Until now I have felt that even frustrated Windows users should
stick with what they know unless they are seriously interested in
how real operating systems function.  In my opinion this release
definitely is ready for prime time.
