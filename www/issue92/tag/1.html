Actually, that would be "sirs" since we more than one and you'd have to
include a...uh...a "sir-ess" for Heather.  Or is that "sir-ette"?
Someone wanna help me out here?

Your subject needs work, telling people your stuff is "important" around

Now taking on the style of the original Answer Guy, if I'm gonna turn on
the flamethrower I'm not gonna turn it back off until I've toasted you
some marshmallows to go with that scorch mark.  Asbestos clothing is
available on sale at the gift shop on your way out

Gentle Querent,
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Could you be more specific?  There are several not terribly compatible
RPM based distros.  In fact that could well be your problem, putting a
redhat RPM on a <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> box, a SuSE RPM on a Mandrake box, a conversion
from (package type here) to rpm via alien ... uh, there's just too many
variables.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
So it really does matter, exactly <EM>which</EM> RPM you are trying to install,
and which distro you are trying to install it onto.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Maybe looking into its control tidbits by running mc (midnight
commander) and looking into the RPM would reveal what distro it was
built for.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Frankly most of the sysadmins I know who feel <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A> is very <EM>important</EM>
to their setup reach for upstream sources and build their own, so they
know for sure it's up to date and which options it has been built with.
They feel it's <EM>important</EM> to know exactly what version of software they
are depending on, that it's happy with the rest of the libraries which
already exist on exactly this server.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
In fact some folk I know keep the general opinion that as soon as a
package manager gives you trouble, it's time to Use The Source, Luke.
Reach out with your feelings, know the build system around you.  All
things are connected... errr, linked, after you run <TT>./Configure</TT>, make,
(if you're paranoid) make test, make install.

<P><STRONG>

But there is a message like "error

<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

	> [Faber] 
You need to install the file libmm.so.  Where do you get the
file libmm.so?  I don't know, it's not on my system.

<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

libmm is a rather basic and popular library.  Probably you'll end up
updating many basic parts before long,  Perhaps you have an RPM for the
right distro, but a later revision of it.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I've tried upgrading a system via RPMs parts at a time like that.
There's a reason my fellow techies call it "dependency hell".
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

	> [Faber] 
So let's go to google.  Type in "libmm.so" and the very first link says:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>RPM resource libmm.so.1. Provided by. mm-1.1.3-9.i386, A shared memory
 library.
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
See that "Provided by"?  That tells you what program provides libmm. In
this case, it's the package mm (they should all be that obvious!).

	> [Faber] 
Where do you get this package?  Well, you didn't tell me which
distribution or version of Linux you're running. I would suggest either
looking on your CDs or clicking on the link from google.

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>(a correct RPM for your exact distro revision)
<br>(any supporting RPMs it also needs)
<br>rpm -Uvh (rpmname) (rpmname2) (rpmname3)

<blockQuote>
Don't type those parentheses, mind you, just the actual filenames...
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
--or--
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>ftp to get the sources
<br>follow the build instructions inside the Apache tarball
</font></code></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Don't be too surprised if you might need to make sure you have some
specific libraries present to complete your build; and the matching .h
files, often found in (some library name)-devel RPMs.

A willingness to poke around apache.org and read up about installation
might be handy too.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
You are most welcome to read past issues of the Linux Gazette online to
get familiar with general installation tricks.

Winning the TAG lotto is not guaranteed, nor is timeliness of answer,
usefulness of answer, or keeping the flamethrower lit while you're out.
We're all volunteers here.  But, if that's not ok, we could point you
toward some consulting resources.  Ask nicely, and some of the gang
who do consulting might give you their own rates.
