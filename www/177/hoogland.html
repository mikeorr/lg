<h1>Overview: Common Linux desktops</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/hoogland.html">Jeff Hoogland</a></b></p>

<p>
Something most new Linux users often struggle to understand is the concept
of desktop environments. What a desktop environment actually is, I feel,
gets further clouded when users start exploring different "spins" of a
distro (short for distribution). For example, it is very common for a new
user to think that <span style="font-weight: bold;">K</span>ubuntu or <span
style="font-weight: bold;">X</span>ubuntu is something entirely different
from the well known <span style="font-weight: bold;">U</span>buntu. Many do
not know that they can easily install any <span style="font-weight:
bold;">*</span>buntu on any other <span style="font-weight:
bold;">*</span>buntu with a single command!<a
id="hoogland.html_1_back"></a><a href="#hoogland.html_1">[1]</a>
</p>

<p>
Just as choosing the distro can be difficult, so can choosing the
"right" desktop environment. The following is an overview of some of the best
known desktop environments so you can be more informed in your decision.
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Gnome:</span> The most popular
desktop environment currently in use is Gnome - it is the desktop
environment that powers the three most popular Linux desktop distros
(Ubuntu, Fedora, and Linux Mint). Gnome is a fully developed desktop
environment that provides a fully integrated application set. It is easy to
use and provides GUI tools for making edits to all the different features
that are available within it. It is a very "user friendly" desktop
environment that is fantastic for new users.
</p>

<p>
<img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor:
pointer; width: 400px; height: 234px;" src="misc/hoogland/Gnome-screenshot2.jpg" border="0" />
Gnome's memory footprint is modest for all the features it provides. A default
Gnome install uses around 180megs (Mb) of RAM. If you like eye candy on your
computer, odds are you will want to run Compiz (desktop effects) on
your Gnome desktop. A default Gnome install with Compiz running uses
slightly more memory, right about 205megs.
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">KDE:</span> In terms of popularity,
KDE is the second most popular desktop environment. Like Gnome, it is fully
mature and provides its own full application set as well as GUI tools for
configuration. KDE also has a wide selection of "plasma widgets", which are
handy applets you can place all around your desktop for all sorts of tasks.
They range from something as practical as a calculator to ones as useless as a
display from "The Matrix".
</p>

<p>
<img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor:
pointer; width: 400px; height: 234px;" src="misc/hoogland/kde.png" border="0" />
Overall, 
KDE is much more customizable than Gnome, but this comes at a cost - a
default KDE install uses around 510megs of RAM. However, if you are looking for eye
candy, it does not cost as much to run KWin (KDE's built in desktop effects)
as it does to run Compiz: with KWin enabled, a default KDE install uses
around 520megs of RAM.
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">XFCE:</span> XFCE is designed to
be simplistic and quick. It does not provide much in the way of eye candy
(although you can run Compiz on it), but it is a decently fast/responsive
desktop environment. While XFCE does have some of its own applications,
such as its file manager Thunar and the XFCE system monitor, it does still
borrow some applications from the Gnome environment (such as the nm-applet
network manager). Don't think XFCE is an immature project though: what it
borrows from Gnome is more to save itself from reinventing the wheel than
from a lack of ability. XFCE does not have quite as many tools for making GUI
edits as Gnome or KDE, but it does have a fairly good configuration panel.
</p>

<p>
<img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor:
pointer; width: 400px; height: 234px;" src="misc/hoogland/xfce.png" border="0" />
Designed to be quick and lightweight, XFCE leaves a low memory footprint on
the system you have it running on. In its default state, XFCE uses around 140megs of
RAM.
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">LXDE:</span> LXDE is a newer
project in the world of Linux desktop environments. Similar to XFCE, LXDE's
goal is to provide a fast, lightweight desktop environment with little
resource usage. LXDE has a few of its own applications, but those
applications it still lacks it borrows from Gnome and XFCE. The age of the
LXDE project really shows when you start to look into making customizations
to things. Many adjusts have to still be made by manually editing
configuration files - not a bad thing if you know your system well (or are
willing to learn it), but this can be a giant setback for a beginner who
wants things to "just work".
</p>

<p>
<img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor:
pointer; width: 400px; height: 234px;" src="misc/hoogland/lxde.png" border="0" />
LXDE may be a much younger project than XFCE, but it does a fantastic job
of resource conservation. A fresh install of LXDE uses 100megs of RAM, the
lowest of all the desktop environments I am reviewing today.
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">E17:</span> I cannot do an
overview of Linux desktop environments without mentioning E17. E17 is
designed to be a lightweight, but elegant desktop environment. It is very
successful at both of these tasks. E17 uses all of its own libraries, that
have been built from the ground up for speed and flexibility. E17 is a
tinkerers delight, you can customize and change anything and everything.
</p>

<p>
<img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor:
pointer; width: 400px; height: 234px;" src="misc/hoogland/e17.png" border="0" />
A base install of E17 leaves a memory footprint of around 110megs of RAM. Now,
while a base install is functional, half the fun of E17 is in playing with
widgets, changing transitions, and generally toggling everything you can
just to see how shiny you can make your desktop. After I had my E17 fully
configured, its memory footprint was increased to a whopping 120megs of
RAM.
</p>

<p>
A few of you may be wondering if E17 is so lightweight, flexible, and
flashy, why don't more distros opt to use it for their desktop environment?
There are two reasons for this. First and foremost is the fact that E17 is
very much "beta" software. Compiling the latest version from source at any
given point can have piles of crashes/segfaults that can make using it a
giant headache. Second, if you do take the time to piece together a stable
E17 build (<a
href="http://jeffhoogland.blogspot.com/2010/03/elive-20-distro-review.html">check
out Elive</a> for the best E17 distro around), the desktop environment takes
some getting used to. For many, it will feel foreign whether they are
used to using another Linux desktop environment or a Windows machine.
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Thoughts:</span> All of the
various desktop environments have their advantages and their disadvantages.
Which one is right for you largely depends on your task at hand. Personally
I run LXDE on my netbook, KDE on <a
href="http://jeffhoogland.blogspot.com/2009/10/sager-notebook-powernotebookscom-review.html">my
gaming laptop</a>, and Gnome on my home media center. If you are not sure
which is best for you, try them out! It is all free software after all - get
a feel for which desktop environment you are most comfortable on and use
that one.
</p>

<p>
Is there another desktop environment that you enjoy using that I failed to
mention here? If so, let me know, I am always looking to tinker with new
things.

<p>
The commands that allow you to install one version on another are:
</p>
<pre>
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop
etc.
</pre>
<p>
You could also simply install the DE with the appropriate meta-package,
e.g.:
</p>
<pre>
sudo apt-get install kde
sudo apt-get install lxde
</pre>
