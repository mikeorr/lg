<P><STRONG>
respected sir
<br>i have a problem with linux instalation on 20Gb or
more capacity disks,i had installed on p3,20gb hd,64
mb ram.i make 2 1Gb partition as linux native &amp; one
200 mb as swap the instalation goes on smoothly but at
the end it gives error that first partition not lies
in 1024 cylinders what i can do to solve this problem
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Actually we're several guys, and one or more gals.  If you
respect us, that's nice, but not essential.
</P>
<P>
Upgrade to current LILO.  Most new distributions should
contain a LILO able to overcome the 1024 cylinder limit,
and so a newer distribution might be the easiest way
to do it.
</P>
<P>
Or, re-partition the disk so that its first partition, about 16Mb,
is mounted at <TT>/boot</TT>, second partition is swap, and the third partition
containing the remainder of the disk is mounted as <TT>/</TT>, the root
partition.  The installation scripts on the distribution will
probably give you an opportunity to specify how you want
the hard drive partitioned, and that's where you do this.
</P>
<P>
Make sure your kernel boot image (usuall vmlinuz) is located
in <TT>/boot</TT>, and is referenced from <TT>/etc/lilo.conf</TT> as such.
You may have to move things around and rerun lilo after
the installation stuff completes.
</P>
<P>
Let us know how you are doing.

<P><STRONG>
Is there a way to control in a 2.4.x kernel how large the file cache can grow?

<P><STRONG>
File cache always seems to take as much as it can and we <EM>really</EM> would
prefer to keep it low.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The main user is routinely running tasks upwards of 1.5GB at time and there
are times when the system thrashes and thrashes.

<blockquote>
<P>
Big file cache is not necessarily A Bad Thing.  As long as it
unloads fast when demand grows.
</P>
<P>
I'd look to other problems first.
</P>
<ol>
<li> Are you running 2.4.17 or something older and buggier?  If not
2.4.17, upgrade now.

<li>
Are you running an AMD Duron or Athlon + AGP video?  If so,
you'll need a kernel boot parameter to cut cache page size,
there's an interference between the way the kernel handles
DMA and the way AMD handles AGP, leading to sporadic random
cache corruption.
<li>
 You're 700M into swap.  That's never a Good Idea.  Unless what's
swapped out is more or less permanently swapped out.  If so
why are you running it?  If possible, get another gig of
memory.  The slowest memory is much faster than the fastest
hard drive.
</ol>
</blockquote>

<P><STRONG>
Hello Dan...
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks so much.  Yes, we're running an older kernel ... mostly, 2.4.6 ...
I'll fix that.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
As far as the swap, originally, we had no swap, but because the file cache
is so "hungry", I threw in swap as a brute force means because processes
were dying from lack of memory...
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
As it is, we run a computational fluid dynamics code that periodically dies
with no more than "broken pipe" as the error diagnostic, which, if I had to
make a W.A.G., I would assume a process died.  Before, it was a LOT
worse... It was ugly when something like portmap would croak.  So, lacking
any coherent solution and having unhappy users, I threw some swap in and it
seemed to help with stability tremendously.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
But most recently, with one user process running, allocating about 1.7G,
the system was apparently thrashing horribly... very unresponsive and with
a system load on the order of 10.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
As far as the swap versus file cache, it would seem to be silly to have a
file cache that's so large that swap starts coming into play.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Bye,
<br>Matt

</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
asks the question "How do I get the volume label from a data CD", and then
the three guys go on to not provide a very good answer...
</P>
<P>
If you would like to add the following, it may be useful to other readers.
</P>
<P>
There are two problems in identifying CDs -- one is identifying a data CD,
the other is identifying an audio CD.  Mr. Bray is asking specifically
about data, but it's also possible to determine a fairly unique ID for
audio CDs as well.
</P>
<P>
Data CDs are easy -- a 32-byte string is written in the ISO at offset
32808.  Some systems have a program called "volname" (part of the eject
package), which can pull this data out.  Otherwise, "dd" can be used:
</P>
<P><CODE>
dd if=/dev/cdrom bs=1 skip=32808 count=32
</CODE></P>
<P>
This is the volume label specified via the "-V" argument to "mkisofs" when
creating the CD image.
</P>
<P>
For audio CDs, it's (unfortunately) not as easy.  The CD Digital Audio
standard does not include a location for storing CD or track identification
information.  The answer for this that I've heard is that they felt it was
too hard a problem to solve initially.
</P>
<P>
While it may seem easy to add a few strings on the CD, it becomes harder
when you have to deal with an international market -- how do you make it so
that Japanese tracks can be identified, for example.  Remember, this was
back in the &lt;gasp&gt; '80s, when Unicode wasn't common.
</P>
<P>
So, the way people go about identifying audio CDs is by generating a
signature.  This signature consists of information about the length of
tracks, number of tracks, and various other information.  You can then
condense this information down into a single value.
</P>
<P>
This value can then be used to submit and request more specific data about
a disc or track.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the LinuxDoc CDROM-HOWTO for the dd command to pull this data off
the CD.
</P>
<P>

Hi,
I've just read your informative article on installing
from source in this months Linux Gazette.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
You mention that it would be good if make files has
and uninstall target and that most don't. Well, if you
have a look at Checkinstall
(<A HREF="http://asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall-en.html"
	>http://asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall-en.html</A>)
it allows you to uninstall programs built from source.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
What it does is to replace the "make install" command
with checkinstall. It makes a note of which files were
installed and allows you to uninstall the program
using the package management tools on your machine (in
my case dpkg). It also creates a .deb (or .rpm) so you
can install it on another machine.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I've played with it for a few days now and it is
extremely useful.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Regards
John
</STRONG></P>
<P>
John,
</P>
<P>
Thanks for that tip.  I'm a moderately long-time member of
The Answer Gang, and had not heard of checkinstall before.
I often build from source, and had until now resorted to
clumsy and time-consuming expedients to manage uninstalls.
</P>
<P>
"checkinstall" is just what we need here at SSC, host of
The Answer Gang's mailing list server and The Linux Gazette's
web site.
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#1F1F1F">This is pretty much the reason that I forwarded this to TAG. I've had seven
or eight e-mails telling me me about "buildpkg", "rpm", etc.; under Debian,
I'm familiar with "alien" - but none of these deal with the real issue of
"remembering" what the "make" did. They just convert the tarball (which
often cannot be done due to layout, etc.) into RPMs or DEBs, etc. This tool
- although I have not yet had the time to check it out - sounds like a very
nice possibility, and I'm going to be looking into it.
 -- Ben</font></blockquote>
<P>
Well thanks, Ben, for forwarding it.
</P>
<P>
It sounds like this tool does something like what I've been doing by hand.
After building a package, I often
</P>

<blockquote><pre>  su root
  script
  make install
  ^D
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
(that's "CTRL-D", an EOT character, to log out of script)
then edit the resulting "typescript" file to build a roster of what
was installed, which I then save in an "ssc" subdirectory of the build
directory, against a day when I wish to know what was installed.
</P>
<P>
You're absolutely right about alien et al.  They work from a tarball,
.deb, .rpm, etc.
</P>
<P>
However, most stock GNU packages don't even build an install tarball.
They just install directly, leaving a cryptic trail of what they
installed in the output from the "make install".  Without analyzing
that output you don't even get a tarball to "alien".
</P>
<P>
There are exceptions.  <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>-modified source trees build the
.deb packages directly, which can then be installed.  <A HREF="http://www.slackware.org/">Slackware</A>-modified
source trees build a tarball directly.  No doubt <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> et al has
something similar ... brainfade prevents me from saying at the moment ...
</P>
<P>
All too often I find I must go directly to the original release of
some package, rather than using the distribution's source, either
because the package is not available under the appropriate distribution,
or because the distribution's package doesn't do it for us.  Wrong
or broken version, etc etc etc.
</P>
<P>
If this checkinstall does what it looks like it might do, it solves
that problem of "what do you do if you've only the original source code".

I want to write a program that on getting some sort of
trigger will automatically connect to the internet by
dialling the ISP's telephone number. After it has
established connection it should store the IP address
assigned to it by the ISP in a file.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Two major hints that, together, should give you the solution:
</P>
<ol>
<li> Search the Net for "linux" and "dial-on-demand". The standard answer to
this used to be "Diald", but nowadays it's built into pppd, so reading the
man page may be an even better solution.

<li> Read "<TT>/etc/ppp/ip-up</TT>", paying special attention to "PPP_REMOTE".
</ol>

That's it. There's no deep science to it.

<P>
You can do the following.....
</P>
<ul>
<li> Assuming that you are using Lilo as your linux
loader, then at the prompt type:

<blockquote><pre>linux init=/bin/bash root=/dev/hdxx ro
</pre></blockquote>

where "<TT>/dev/hdaxx</TT>" is the device file which points to
the root of your Linux partition (i.e. mounted "<TT>/</TT>")
(or change "linux" to the name of the stanza within
"<TT>/etc/lilo.conf</TT>" that will load Linux).

<br>
This will then put you into a single user mode, with
all the partitions mounted as read-only.

<br>
Then at the prompt, type:

<blockquote><pre>fsck -f /
</pre></blockquote>

and this should fix any errors on the drive.

<br>
Usually, any inode data is stored within the
"<TT>/Lost+Found</TT>" directory.
</ul>
<p>
If you need any help, let me (us) know.

I have a linux box (RH 7.1) set up to serve as mail and internet server for
my two other home computers.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
It is set up to dial on demand. Therefore ifconfig shows ppp0 up and
running all the time (when it is working properly)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I would like to be able to check the status of the modem without lifting
the telephone from it's cradle.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have checked into using the lock file which can be written by pppd but
this is not very reliable when if pppd goes down unexpectantly it does not
always clean up after itself.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I haven't done anything with "diald" in a couple of years, but doesn't it
use SLIP to do its dirty work (i.e., the PPP link you request is actually
to a local VT; "diald" feeds your PPP daemon lots of baloney and sweet talk
while it actually makes the connection behind its back)? If so, then you
could always check if the 'sl0' interface is up without tripping off the
dial-up.
-- Ben
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The querent doesn't specifically mention 'diald', which does use the slip
interface as part of its mechanism.  The newer versions of pppd also
support dial on demand, and uses a different type of mechanism.
Unfortunately, I can't be too specific, as I've never set it up.  I would
guess that you could simply check to see if ppp0 (assuming only one
dial-up connection active at a time) is up, much the same way as was
suggested for diald.  Actually IIRC, in the case of diald, (which AFAIK,
is no longer actively supported) the slip interface goes away when the ppp
link gets established; so simply checking for a ppp interface would work
for diald as well.

Hi Gang!
Maybe I already told you about my little program to copy dvd's to
harddisk, called vobcopy (look on freshmeat). In the next release I
want to incorporate large file support (lfs - no, not linux from
scratch 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=";-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">. I found Jim Dennis' answer in the 67 issue and read
around various places (info libc, the suse-page, the large file summit
papers) but I am still unable to <EM>detect</EM> if the usersystem has support
for large files. We (another person joined me and did most of the lfs
stuff) found out about the -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE
-D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE (the last one being redundant if not even close
to being wrong in my opinion) and off_t. But we are not sure if this
works correctly on both systems (supporting/not supporting). I would
think its better to know if the users system has support or not and compile
accordingly.
My approach would be somthing along the lines of look whats defined in
&lt;linux/*file.h&gt; and what the file system is the file gets written
to. But kinda ugly and probably wrong. Does one of you happen to know
how to figure it out?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Check for the presence of "ftello64" (declared in &lt;stdio.h&gt
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=";)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">. From "info
libc -&gt; I/O on streams -&gt; File Positioning":
</P>

<TABLE WIDTH="95%" BORDER="1" BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC"><TR><TD>
<p align="center">...............</p>
<P>
- Function: off64_t ftello64 (FILE *STREAM)
</P>
<P>
This function is similar to `ftello' with the only difference that
the return value is of type `off64_t'.  This also requires that the
stream STREAM was opened using either `fopen64', `freopen64', or
`tmpfile64' since otherwise the underlying file operations to
position the file pointer beyond the 2^31 bytes limit might fail.
</P>
<P>
If the sources are compiled with `_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a 32
bits machine this function is available under the name `ftello'
and so transparently replaces the old interface.
</P><p align="center">...............</p>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
"ftello" is the 'fixed' version of "ftell", but can be found on systems
with or without LFS. From the above, it looks like "ftello64" would only
exist on systems with LFS, where "ftello" would be an alias for it. I've
got to hand it to the GNU folks: cute trick.

this related with redhat linux
</P>
<ol>
<li> if you have free space in your harddisk for windows 2000 partition
then

<ul>
<li>first install win2000 on your system after installation
<li>
boot your pc with redhat linux7.2 cdrom and type on prompt "linux rescue"
enter
<li>
check on which partition no. windows 2000 install you can check this by
typing
<blockquote><pre>fdisk /dev/hda
</pre></blockquote>
press enter
<br>
then type "p " press enter
<br>
now you know your windows partition no.
<li>
mount the partition by typing

<blockquote><pre>mount -t vfat /dev/hda(windows partition no.)  /hdd
</pre></blockquote>

press enter

<br>
it will mount your windows partition at <TT>/hdd</TT> directory

<li>
as you installed linux first so your linux partition must be hda1 or
check your linux partition

<br>
run command

<blockquote><pre>dd if=/dev/hda(linux partition no.) of=/hdd/bootlin bs=512 count=1
</pre></blockquote>

press enter

<br>this command show you the message

<blockquote><pre>1 record in
1 record out
</pre></blockquote>
<li>
now type "exit" press enter

<li>
now edit the boot.ini in windows partition

<br>
add one line under the heading Oprating system
</P>

<blockquote><pre>c:\bootlin=3D"Redhat Linux "
</pre></blockquote>

save it and you are done

<li>
reboot the system
</ul>

<li>
if there is no free space
<br>
use partition magic to make some free space for windows 2000 and use the
same steps

</ol>

I've just installed RH 7.2 on a sony vaio, and was quite surprised by the
ease with which it went on (Far cry from RH5.5). Anyway, I created the
suggested user so that I wouldn't be logging in as Root all the time,
however, the user I created can not create, delete, copy, etc, files in
ROOT, or USR, or even HOME.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Of course you can't!  This isn't That Other Operating System. 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I am assuming I have to login as ROOT and join
the user to the administrators group, or some such group which will allow
the user the appropriate permissions, but I am not sure. Is thre something I
am missing or something I should be doing different?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
You're missing something. 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">  In Linux (and unix in general) users
<em>don't</em> have the right to willy-nilly create files and run any old
program.  Would you like it if user jane had the rights to delete files
in you home directory?  Of course not!
</P>
<P>
Linux has rather strict rules about what you, a normal user can do.  The
root user, OTOH, can do <EM>anything</EM>.  This is a very dangerous thing if
you're not careful.  Let's say you wanted to delete all the files in
your home directory (you're allowed to do that, they're <EM>your</EM> files).
That would be done with the command
</P>
<P><CODE>
rm -rf /home/steve
</CODE></P>
<P>
If you accidentally typed it as
</P>
<P><CODE>
rm -rf / home/steve
</CODE></P>
<P>
You would get some error about not having permissions, etc.  And
depending where you were in the directory, ypou might or might not wipe
out your home directory.
</P>
<P>
However, if you were logged in as root and type the accidental line, you
would, literally, wipe out every file on the hard drive.
</P>
<P>
You might want to add the normal user to various groups, but you should
proabbly read up on Linux and permissions and all that.  Start by reading
the Dos/Windows User to Linux User HOWTO
( <A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/DOS-Win-to-Linux-HOWTO-4.html"
	>http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/DOS-Win-to-Linux-HOWTO-4.html</A> ) to get
an idea on what's going on.
</P>
<P>
Reading the HOWTOs in general is a good idea (maybe not all at once,
mind you).  You can find all of them and more at www.linuxdoc.org
</P>

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

<br>asked by Subroto Sengupta 
</P>

<P><STRONG>
Hello Sir,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I would like to know how to set up a Linux 7.1 server and configure it 
properly to be able to telnet into it from a Windows client machine.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
A reply would be greatly appreciated.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Sincerely,
<br>Subroto.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Well, that's a whole lot of questions.
</P>
<P>
There's no "Linux 7.1".  The Linux kernel's current versions
are 2.5.2 (pretty wild), 2.4.17 (conditionally stable), and
2.2.20 (quite stable).  (labels mine).
</P>
<P>
Linux is distributed by several vendors, who label their own
distribution with a version number.  You may be thinking about
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> Linux 7.1.  Don't.  Get Red Hat Linux 7.2 or 6.2.
Other vendors (<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>, Mandrake, <A HREF="http://www.slackware.org/">Slackware</A>, <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A>, <A HREF="http://www.caldera.com/">Caldera</A>,
to name just a few) each use their own numbering schemes,
which have not much to do with those of the others.
</P>
<P>
How to set up a server?  Best advice I can give is "follow
the vendor's directions, and ask questions here when you
get lost".
</P>
<P>
Telnet?  Only on a protected network, I hope!  Telnet exchanges
a password in the clear, OK if just your immediate family is
watching the 'net, not so good if the password traverses six ISPs
and a few chunks of the backbone.
</P>
<P>
That said, during install, select the telnet package.  Sometimes
that's part of some other package, sometimes not.  Consult the
vendor documentation and help.
</P>
<P>
On exposed networks, use the ssh (secure shell) package on Linux,
and get "putty" secure shell client for Windows.  It's much
better than windows telnet, and it'll even telnet, if you must.
</P>
<P>

	>http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html</A>

<P>
or search google.com for "putty.exe".

<P>
If "route" takes a long time to run because you have no route to your
nameserver, do "route -n" to skip the DNS lookup and use IP addresses
only.
</P>
<P>
This works with "netstat", "ping" and "traceroute" too.

<FONT COLOR="navy">Very important topic: keeping your "fortune" file indexed</FONT></H3>

<P>
You can keep your fortune file indexed and up-to-date on multiple
servers with make. Here's an example Makefile to handle common
fortune-related tasks:
</P>

<blockquote><pre># List all the fortune files you maintain here.  (I just have them
# all in one big file)
FORTUNES = dmarti

# For every fortune file, the datfile is the same name but with .dat
# on the end
DATFILES = $(FORTUNES:=.dat)

# Make a copy of the fortunes file to the zork.net  collection
# (http://zork.net/fortunes/)  Since it's the first target, this
# target and its dependencies will run if you just type "make"
tozork : $(DATFILES)
        scp $(FORTUNES) $(DATFILES) zork.net:/usr/local/etc/fortunes
        touch tozork

# This target makes each .dat file from the appropriate fortune
# file, if it has changed.
%.dat : %
        strfile $&lt;

# Get rid of all the .dat files (not really needed, but it's traditional
# to have "make clean" do _something_)
clean :
        rm -f $(DATFILES)

# There is no file named "clean", but always build this target.
.PHONY : clean
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
For more information, see "man strfile" and "info make". Now that you know
how to manage fortunes by editing only one file and typing make, why
not put your favorite sayings on your web site as a fortune file
others can also use? (The old fortunes that come with most
distributions have come up way too often for us.)

<FONT COLOR="navy">Limiting the files "locate" shows</FONT></H3>

<P>
"locate" is a wonderful command for quickly finding files on your system.
Unfortunately, sometimes it produces so many hits that it takes too long
to find the forest among the trees.
Distributions and programs often have lots of files, making locate
seem useless. To refine your search, type:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>loc ()   {
        locate "$1" | egrep -v 'bmp|html|whatever'
         }
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
or put it in your .bashrc, and you won't receive any entries that contain
