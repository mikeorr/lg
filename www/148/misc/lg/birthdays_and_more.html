Happy birthday! "May you love as long as you live, and live as long as
you wish".
</p>

<p>
...and because I'm feeling all eldritch and cryptic this morning (must
have been those blueberry bagels), here's a birthday holler for you.

It's raining special days; today is also my wedding anniversary (English

Happy birtday to you as well, then! Glad you enjoyed that bit of

MishkaMichaelMiguel of the many names is doing well. He started crawling
at 20 weeks, on the same day that Daddy ripped his bicep. It's been an
exciting time for the Okopniks! Michael's also big on pulling himself to
standing, jumping like a mad flea in his jumpy seat, taking a firm hold
of Mommy's hair (or Daddy's beard), and helping out with the computer.
Unsurprisingly, given his parentage, he's extremely social and
neophilic; heaven forfend that we don't offer him a new experience and
new people every day...
</p>

<p>
I've been (half) joking that we're going to wake up one morning to find
that he's on top of the mast, with a VHF radio in one hand, inciting
passing sport fishers to create a really <strong>good</strong> wake in the anchorage so
he can get a better thrill up top.

<p>
He already is. Yesterday, while propped in front of my laptop, he stared
intently at my screen while I was running an Ubuntu update; then, he
tapped-and-dragged on the keypad to select the whole screeen, pulled
down the window menu (!!!) and closed the whole thing. Oh, and drooled
all over the touchpad. Hell of a way to express an opinion, really - I
thought I raised him better than that.
</p>

<p>
[sigh] Maybe he's more of a Puppy Linux kinda guy... I just don't know.
Damn, religious wars in my own home...

You see? Evil, pure evil. I keep telling Kat, "sure, he's unbearably
cute and heart-meltingly sweet now, but the zits and the surly attitude
are just around the corner - you just wait and see!" Not that it stops
me from cuddling him for hours or blowing razzberries into his
bellybutton till he squeals and chortles, but, y'know. Gotta keep up the
dignified persona.

<p>
[rolling eyes] Kapil, we're saying that <strong>now</strong>. Just yesterday (+/- a
small error factor), he was a tiny inanimate lump of goo. Today, he
squeals and laughs and grins engagingly and crawls to the edge of the
bed so he can take a flying leap over it [1] and has a personality of
his own. And <em>stands,</em> after crawling up Daddy. All that while his
parents blink in total bewilderment, stare at each other, and try to
cope with the onslaught. Babies are just... the most amazing experience
ever, even if you fully expect it.
</p>


<p>
[1] Taking A Header has become a major goal of Michael's life,
especially while Daddy (who catches him and cuddles him) is nearby. We
weren't <strong>trying</strong> to raise an adrenaline junkie, but this kid is pretty
much fearless - even after he knows that there are consequences to a
given action.

Thanks! We had a pretty good day topped off by a wonderful dinner,

make myself write "THE EASIEST UPGRADE IS A BACKUP AND REINSTALL" 1,000
times on a blackboard one of these days...) - a true geek occasion.

Assuming, on the other paw, that we're talking about an anniversary
shared among several people who are not all married to each other

&gt; Assuming, on the other paw, that we're talking about an anniversary
&gt; shared among several people who are not all married to each other 
&gt; (or at least not concurrently), it would go like Alice saying:
&gt; 
&gt;    "Bob's, Carol's, Ted's, and my anniversary"
</pre>

<p>
Not disagreeing with you, but it still rubs me wrong. Like certain
misspellings, it just makes me twitch.

&gt; &gt; Well, it happens to be my b'day as well some hours from now and just

Give me some more ways to express possessiveness and I am almost going

I started the day after my birthday by doing greatest and boldest
thing I ever do....: to propose a girl for marriage. Result:
rejection. What a day...

<pre>
&gt; ...and because I'm feeling all eldritch and cryptic this morning (must
&gt; have been those blueberry bagels), here's a birthday holler for you.

Me, you, everybody...

Don't let it get you down. Besides, it wasn't that bad: you tried it and
you're still alive - and there are <strong>lots</strong> of other fish in the sea. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
