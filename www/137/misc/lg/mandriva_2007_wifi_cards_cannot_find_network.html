<p>
I have taken some Ethereal logs
</p>

<p>
In Mand 2007 it does repeated DHCP Discovers over and over again and gets 
nothing back.
</p>

<p>
In Mand 2006 it does a single DHCP Request and gets a DHCP ACK back with its 
inet address.
</p>

<p>
I don't know the mechanics of who sends these DHCP signals but I am guessing 
that DHCP Discover is in some way incorrect for my setup. Does anyone know 
how to get it to send DHCP Request instead ?
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
Owen

Well, a workaround really. I went back to first principles. I removed the WiFi 
configuration from DrakConf. Inserting the card produced an ath0 and a wifi0 
unconfigured interfaces. I then entered 
<pre>
iwconfig ath0 essid "xxxx" key xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xx
dhclient ath0
</pre>
and everything works, I can get onto the internet etc..
</p>

<p>
I then removed and re-inserted the card, went into "kcmshell kcmwifi" entered 
the settings and pressed Activate. The results were exactly as seen prior to 
today. I.e everything went okay but no inet address is obtained. 
Entering "dhclient ath0" makes the interface work. The same results are seen 
when using DrakConf. 
</p>

<p>
So there is a workaround. Are kcmwifi and DrakConf not calling dhclient 
correctly. MadWiFi creates two interfaces, ath0 and wifi0. Apparently wifi0 is 
a virtual i/f to allow multiple access point attachments. Is it possible 
that "dhclient wifi0" is being called instead of "dhclient ath0" ?
</p>

<p>
Hope all this helps,
Owen

Good job finding the answer! Since I don't know how Mandrake handles
this stuff "under the hood", I can't give you a specific recommendation
on how to script this - but if it was a Debian system, I'd be off to
'/etc/network/interfaces' like a shot. One stanza, and I'd be done.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
iface ath0 inet dhcp
    pre-up iwconfig ath0 essid "xxxxx" key xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx mode Managed
</pre>
You might want to look around your '/etc' directory just to see what you
can find.

Oh-oh... I feel it... I feel it comin' on... <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

&lt;rant="ON"&gt;
As is always the case with GUIs, anything (read "anything bad") is
possible - and extremely difficult to troubleshoot, unless you're
willing to download and read the source (for the GUIs, not for the thing
you're troubleshooting.) Personally, I find that a ridiculous and
unnecessary hassle.
</p>

<p>
Some people consider me old-fashioned because I steadfastly stick to
doing everything I can on the command line. The actual fact is that I
like glitzy, pretty interfaces as much as anyone; I just don't want to
<strong>rely</strong> on them for critical system operations, since I've seen the kind
of problem you describe over and over and over. When you're working with
the actual utilities that do the job, you get one of two things: either
a successful result or notification of failure. Given that you're
working at the most basic level - "going back to first principles", as
you say - it's possible to build and follow a troubleshooting tree.
When the GUI doesn't work, there are very few avenues to explore - it
just comes down to "the GUI doesn't work" - at which point, unless you
know what utilities it was invoking and in what order (and with what
arguments), you're stuck. 
&lt;/rant&gt;
</p>

<p>
If you suspect that the interface is simply being called by the wrong
name, just install 'ifrename' and modify '/etc/iftab' as described in
the 'iftab' man page. Your interface will then come up with whatever
name you prefer.

<p>
Actually, the "lateesht" solution in Debian is to use:
<pre>
 iface ath0 inet dhcp
     wireless-essid "xxxxx"
     wireless-mode Managed
     wireless-defaultkey xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
</pre>
etc.
</p>

<p>
This does mean that you depend on "someone-else" to make the correct
calls to iwconfig but has the advantage of keeping only the config
information in the config file.

<p>
There is also "nameif" and /etc/mactab...another alternative is everyone's
bugbear --- udev.

You know, I tried that back when I first started playing around with
'interfaces'. It didn't work. Since there was an alternate mechanism
(i.e., 'pre-up', etc.), I never bothered to trace it down - but it's
nice to hear that it works now.

<p>
...and you could always go back if you needed to. Not a bad setup at
all.
