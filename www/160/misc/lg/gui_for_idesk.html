Hello All,
</p>

<p>
Hope you all are well.
</p>

<p>
Is anyone of you using idesk presently ?
</p>

<p>
I have no idea about its present status. Is there any GUI available to 
configure the .lnk file and .ideskrc ? In my debian lenny apt shows only the 
idesk itself. 
</p>

<p>
I would by happy if there is any GUI ( preferably .deb ) which can configure 
idesk.
</p>

<p>
Thanks 
Kindly CC to me

There was one, but like idesk itself, it's no longer maintained.  If
you go and read the LG archives, you'll find an idesk article -- might
be useful, the config file is easy -- that way vim or some other
$EDITOR can be your GUI.  Enjoy.

This is really, really funny, for two highly appropriate reasons: 1) I
just (re)started using idesk yesterday, and 2) I wrote a very nice GUI
for configuring .lnk files. The latter is something I actually did
several years ago, but it still works quite well: the links that it
creates use the icons from the 'gnome-icon-theme' package, and have the
consistent behavior of opening the .lnk file when double-right-clicked.
More to the point - since we're <strong>very</strong>, <strong>VERY</strong> short of articles this
month, I'm going to throw together an article about this exact topic,
including installation and usage advice.
</p>

<p>
So, if you're willing to wait a couple of days - our next issue comes
out on the 1st - you'll have access to a very nice GUI for idesk. As far
as I know, there isn't one available outside of that.
