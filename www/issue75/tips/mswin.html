<h2>Do you answer Windows questions too?</h2>

<p>Some of them.</p>

<p>Answers in either the Tips or Answer Gang columns which relate to
troubleshooting hardware, might be equally valuable to Linux and Windows users.
This is however <I><STRONG>Linux</STRONG> Gazette</I>... so all the
examples are likely to describe Linux methods and tools.

<p>The Answer Guy has ranted about this many times before.  He will
gladly answer questions involving getting Linux and MS Windows systems
to interact properly;  this usually covers filesystems, use of Samba
(shares) and other networking, and discussion of how to use drivers.

<p>However, if your question only involves Windows, this is not the best 
place to ask.   The Answer Guy himself hasn't used Windows in many years, 
and in fact typically avoids the graphical user interfaces available to 
Linux as well.  That we've grown up into an Answer Gang isn't worth much 
for Windows only questions either -- only a few of us have any notable 
experience with Windows, and for those of us that do, a lot of it is quite
out of date.

<p>Maybe you should try the websites for the various Windows magazines -- many
of them offer an open forum.  You could even (gasp) use the tech support that
was offered with your commercial product.  Also, there are newsgroups for an
amazing variety of topics, including MS Windows.
