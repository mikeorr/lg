&gt;    Your Mint Card statement 2009.                                             
</pre>

<p>
Mmmm, mint. A "Mint Card" sounds yummy - is it a "scratch-and-sniff" (or
"sniff-and-lick") kind of thing? I <em>loooove</em> new and inventive products.
</p>

&gt;    Hello-We are using this time to inform you that your new mint statement    
&gt;    for 2009 open with all closed transactions for the last 2008 will be       
&gt;    online soon as we are working on our new sever,
</pre>

<p>
If your new sever is of the same quality as your grammar, then I do
asseverate that severing yourself from both would improve your servile
image severely.
</p>


<pre>
&gt;    So we want you to update    
&gt;    your account to help us recognise you as the ower of this account.
</pre>

<p>
My account is not and never has been ower. It has been unner a coupla
times, which made me feel a severe draft (is an owerdraft the same as
unnertow? Or is that latter where you always find that missing
thumbtack? And why do they call it a *thumb*tack when it always ends up
in your tow?) Maybe it'll go ower when I deposit that 50 PERCENT OF AN
ABANDONED SUM OF US$38.5 MILLION (THIRTY EIGHT MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED
THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) IN AN ACCOUNT THAT BELONGS TO ONE
OF OUR FOREIGN CUSTOMER WHO DIED ALONG WITH HIS ENTIRE FAMILY OF A WIFE
AND TWO CHILDREN IN NOVEMBER 1999 IN A PLANE CRASH that you're about to
offer me? Or did I confuse you with your cousin Idowu Amadi Jumoke Bayo
Ig?
</p>


<pre>
&gt;    Please  
&gt;    remember to always keep your receipts safe                                 
</pre>

<p>
...and wear your overshoes in rainy weather, and look both ways before
you cross the street. And be sure to save your earwax for flavoring your
ice cream (along with an ounce or two of arsenic) - but only if you're a
scammer.

&gt;    Note:If you spot a transaction that you don't recognise you can get help   
&gt;    from the link on your statement, if anything still seems wrong contact us  
&gt;    straight away.
&gt;    Update your account below                                    
&gt;                                            <a href='http://mint.co.uk/statement/update'>http://mint.co.uk/statement/update</a>

<p>
No, no - I recognize this type of transaction right away. Let's see the
underlying (with emphasis on "lying") HTML:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#333333 size=2&gt;Note:If you spot a transaction that
you don't recognise you can get help from the link on your
statement, if anything still seems wrong contact us straight
away.Update your account below&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#333333 size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD 
style="PADDING-RIGHT: 15px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 15px; PADDING-TOP: 0px" 
align=right colSpan=2&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0078cf&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;A
href="<a href='http://kirklaw11.t35.com/mints/Login.do.htm'>http://kirklaw11.t35.com/mints/Login.do.htm</a>"&gt;<a href='http://mint.co.uk/statement/update&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;'>http://mint.co.uk/statement/update&lt;/A[...]G&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;</a>
</pre>

<p>
Going to <a href='http://kirklaw11.t35.com/'>http://kirklaw11.t35.com/</a> is rather amusing (moron scammers
abound...); looking at the above link is also a hoot - the bottom bar
has ad links to "Asian Bridal Makup", "Casino Online", "Drug Rehab", and
"Freelance jobs" (a capsule review of what your life will be about if
you fall for this scam, hey?)
