<p>
I was doing some PDF to HTML conversions today, and noticed some really
ugly, borken content in the resulting files; the content had obviously
been created via some Microsoft program (probably Word):
</p>

<p>
Just say ?&lt;80&gt;&lt;98&gt;hello, world!?&lt;80&gt;&lt;99&gt;?&lt;80&gt;&lt;9d&gt; 
</p>

<p>
I had a few dozen docs to fix, and didn't have a mapping of the
characters with which I wanted to replace these ugly clumps of hex. That
is, I could <em>see</em> what I wanted, but expressing it in code would take a
bit more than that.
</p>

<p>
Then, I got hit by an idea. After I got up, rubbed the bruise, and took
an aspirin, I wrote the following:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
# Created by Ben Okopnik on Fri Jul 23 12:05:05 EDT 2010
use encoding qw/utf-8/;
 
my ($s, %seen) = do { local $/; &lt;&gt; };
# Delete all "normal" characters
$s =~ s/[\011\012\015\040-\176]//g;
print "#!/usr/bin/perl -i~ -wp\n\n";
for (split //, $s){ next if $seen{$_}++; print "s/$_//g;\n"; }
</pre>

<p>
When this script is given a list of all the text files as arguments, it
collects a unique list of the UTF-8 versions of all the "weird"
characters and outputs a <strong>second</strong> Perl script which you can now edit to
define the replacements:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
#!/usr/bin/perl -i~ -wp
 
s/\xFE\xFF//g;
s/?//g;
s/?//g;
s/?//g;
s/?//g;
s/?//g;
s/?//g;
s/?//g;
s/?//g;
</pre>

<p>
Note that the second half of each substitution is empty; that's where
you put in your replacements, like so:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
#!/usr/bin/perl -i~ -wp
 
s/\xFE\xFF//g;	# We'll get rid of the 'BOM' marker
s/?/"/g;
s/?/-/g;
s/?/'/g;
s/?/"/g;
s/?/-/g;
s/?/.../g;
s/?/'/g;
s/?/&amp;copy;/g;	# We'll make an HTML entity out of this one
</pre>

<p>
Now, just make this script executable, feed it a list of all your text
files, and live happily ever after. Note that the original versions will
be preserved with a '~' appended to their filenames, just in case.

It's a mix of things. Between client work, trying to get things done for
myself, and simple intellectual curiosity[1], I often come up against
challenges that push the limits of the available tools. At that point, I
have to create my own - and a lot of times, this involves non-linear
thinking, which I enjoy. It's like writing recursive functions: if you
don't understand the basic principle, there's a whole class of problems
that'll cause you to struggle for days or weeks or even give up because
the task is "impossible". If you do understand it, those problems get
solved in just a few moments.

# Fibonacci sequence

<p>
Love that stuff. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> Although you do have to be careful about that O[n^2]
(or worse) run time...

Hadn't heard of it, just looked it up. Yeah, I could dream up some
interesting tools and methods. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

[1] <strong>That's</strong> the bugger that gets me in more trouble than everything
else combined. I truly believe that the world is going to end not
because of some power-mad dictator pushing The Big Red Button but
because some chemistry/physics/bio/genetics/whatever geek says, "gosh, I
wonder what'll happen if I do *this?*" [shrug] Life would be boring
otherwise, I guess.

I <strong>hate</strong> that question. It's a good one, of course, and leads to 
great discoveries. 
</p>

<p>
But I also recall a grizzled vet frobbing a literal BRB and tripping a 
breaker that was on the other side of a wall that had been sealed up 
since the circuit was installed. We had to knock on the neighbor's door
and ask "may we go rummaging through your panels until we find our
breaker?"

The Southern version, of course, is "Hey, y'all - watch *this!*"

That phrase is the leading cause of death in that part of the country. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

[laugh] That has a very familiar flavor to it.
