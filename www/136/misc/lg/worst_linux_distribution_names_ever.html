&gt; I have to agree that #1 wins hands down
&gt; #3 is also an unfortunate name combination

I refuse to teach my shift key finger how to
capitalize gnewsense.  Or however they spell it.
</p>

<p>
At least Yggdrasil sounds like they're trying to
capture the prestigious Rick Moen market with obscure
Norse mythology references.

Hey, there are even reputed to be languages in which "Rijndael" has
sensible pronunciations.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.iaik.tu-graz.ac.at/research/krypto/AES/old/%7Erijmen/rijndael/">http://www.iaik.tu-graz.ac.at/research/krypto/AES/old/%7Erijmen/rijndael/</a>

   Rijndael FAQ
 
   1. How is that pronounced ?
      If you're Dutch, Flemish, Indonesian, Surinamer or South-African,
      it's pronounced like you think it should be. Otherwise, you could
      pronounce it like "Reign Dahl", "Rain Doll", "Rhine Dahl". We're not
      picky. As long as you make it sound different from "Region Deal".
 
   2. Why did you choose this name ?
      Because we were both fed up with people mutilating the
      pronunciation of the names "Daemen" and "Rijmen". (There are two
      messages in this answer.)
 
   3. Can't you give it another name ? (Propose it as a tweak !)
      Dutch is a wonderful language. Currently we are debating about the
      names "Herfstvrucht", "Angstschreeuw" and "Koeieuier". Other
      suggestions are welcome of course. Derek Brown, Toronto, Ontario,
      Canada, proposes "bob". 
</pre>
Anyway, quaint language remains in the eye of the beholder.  Grandma
Margot was a member of a British travel club because, to quote:  
"I yoost luff the vay they tawlk."
