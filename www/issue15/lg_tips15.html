Automatic Term Resizing

Heya,<BR> 
	I spend a lot of time telnetting to my ISP from various sized terms
under X and from the good ol' prompt.  Typing "stty cols x rows y" got
tedious, so I found a nice solution:  Putting "eval `resize`" in my .cshrc.
Now my remote terms automatically resize themselves to whatever convoluted
geometry I've got locally.

Hi.<BR> 
	I use fvwm2, and like to have four virtual screens,
each with a different background. However, I found myself editing
my .fvwm2rc file alot to change those backgrounds ( kept getting
bored with the selection ).  So I came up with a little tcl
script to do the work for me. Now I just have a directory ( called
.backgrounds ) filled with .xpm files that I like as backgrounds.
On login, my .login file calls randBG.tcl, an executable tcl file
thats in your path, ( if tclsh is not in /usr/bin, change the first
line ).
<PRE> 
#---CUT HERE------randBG.tcl---------------------------
#! /usr/bin/tclsh

proc randomInit {seed} {
        global rand
        set rand(ia) 9301;      #multiplier
        set rand(ic) 49297;     #Constant
        set rand(im) 233280;    #Divisor
        set rand(seed) $seed;   #Last Result
}

proc random {} {
        global rand
        set rand(seed) \
                [expr ($rand(seed)*$rand(ia) + \
                        $rand(ic)) % $rand(im)]
        return [expr $rand(seed)/double($rand(im))]
}

proc randomRange { range } {
        expr int([random]*$range)
}

randomInit [pid]
random
randomRange 100

to set desk0 prior to changing between desks. Just a little
hack I thought someone might like. Note that this only changes
desks 1-3, since I tend to keep desk0 constant ( I found a
*really* nice background ).

Changing directories, A short enhancement to previous article's idea
</H3> 
<P> 
Date: Thu, 20 Feb 1997 19:13:38 +0100 <BR> 
From: jurriaan, <A HREF="mailto:thunder7@xs4all.nl">thunder7@xs4all.nl </A>
<P> 
In an article in the October Linux Journal (or was it Gazette - I
don't know) by Marc Ewing (marc@redhat.com) a shell script was presented
to allow a user to go to any directory on the system, without getting to
all directories in between.
<P> 
Much as this script apealed to me, it didn't work as I expected:
<P> 
(A part of) my directory tree look like:
<PRE> 
/root
/root/angband
/root/angband/2796
/root/angband/2796/src
/root/angband/2796/lib
/root/angband/2796/lib/edit
/root/angband/2796/lib/data
/root/angband/myang
/root/angband/myang/src
/root/angband/myang/lib
/root/angband/myang/lib/edit
/root/angband/myang/lib/data
etc.
</PRE> 

Now when I typed cds myang, it offered me a choice between all
directories containing myang. Instead I'd much prefer if the program
decided that the one directory ending in myang would be the most logical
choice.
<P> 
I adapted this script, and the result is included below. Many comments
are added, which you may or may not like. They may not even be correct,
as I am not one of the guru-est of linux-dom, as Marc Ewing was described
:-).
<P> 
If you like it, use (ie include) it and let me know please.
<P> 
If you don't, adapt it and then include it and let me know please.
<P> 
If you really don't like it, consider this message not written.

Getting less to View gzipped Files
</H3> 
<P>

From: Michael Bain, <A HREF="mailto:michael.bain@boeing.com">

<P> 
Here's how to use less to view gzipped files.  Also, there
is a way you can use this less feature that doesn't require
temporary files and only needs one script file.
<P> 
Put lesspipe.sh in your executable path.
<P> 
lesspipe.sh:
<PRE> 
#! /bin/sh
case "$1" in
     *.Z) uncompress -c $1  2>/dev/null
     ;;
     *.gz) gunzip -c $1  2>/dev/null
     ;;
esac
</PRE> 
Set the environmental variable LESSOPEN='|lesspipe.sh %s'.
(Don't forget the pipe '|' symbol.)  
This works with less version 2.90.

Lowercased Filenames

Hello there <BR> 
We've all read all those ways to convert uppercased filenames to lowercased ones.  But why did we need it?
One reason is because when we unzip a file, all filenames are uppercase.
Well, try this (much much shorter :) )
<PRE> 
unzip -L filename.zip
</PRE> 
This extracts the files as usual, but converts the filenames to lowercase, so there's no need to run any of those other two cent tips anymore...
(and it's less to type, and faster)

I don't know if you've touched on this yet -- if so, please ignore this
message.
<P> 
With bash, you can reliably set the titlebar.  Just set the
PROMPT_COMMAND variable to be a command that sets your title bar.
<P> 
Aside: I usually use the shortened host name, with a # suffix if I'm
root.  The most portable way of testing if I'm root is [ -w / ]

A Quick and Dirty getmail Script

<P> 
Hi there!
<P> 
Here is a quick and dirty script for fetching your mail without a POP
account. It does it's thing by using telnet and ftp.
<PRE> 
--------------------------------BEGIN SCRIPT------------------------------

#!/bin/sh
# Brought to you by msalama@superfly.salama.fi
# Caveat emptor: You use this entirely at your own risk, I'm not
# responsible for any damages or loss of mail it might cause. 

# There are 3 things to remember:

# 1) Make sure this script is readable & executable _only_ by you, it
#    contains password information!

# 2) You must have a .netrc-file in your home directory containing a
#    hostname, your username and your passwd for ftp. Make sure this file
#    is readable _only_ by you, too, and check the ftp man page for
#    details.

# 3) You must, of course, edit this script to provide all the necessary
#    passwords, usernames etc. for telnet. Also, the remote system must
#    have dd installed to empty the mailbox.

(echo open your.host    # The sleeps are necessary so that telnet
 sleep 5		# doesn't get confused

 echo your.username
 sleep 5

 echo your.password	# For your eyes only...
 sleep 10		# 10 sec. break, let the motd etc. scroll by

 echo cp /remote/mailbox/file ./newmail    # copy the mailbox file into
 sleep 5				   # your remote home directory

 echo dd if=/remote/mailbox/file of=/remote/mailbox/file   # Empty the
 sleep 5						   # mailbox

 echo quit) | telnet -8E > /dev/null

(echo binary				   # Now go get the mail using
 echo get newmail			   # ftp. Handy for those folks
 echo delete newmail			   # who don't have a POP account.
 echo bye) | ftp your.host > /dev/null

 mv ./newmail /local/mailbox/file	   # Move the new mail in place...

 chmod go-rwx /local/mailbox/file	   # Just in case it's readable
				 	   # by someone else.
 # All done! Go read them.

Hi, just going through issue #14 of the linux gazzette, and I noticed the
tip on logging *.* to a file so you can read it in an rxvt in X.  I do a
similar thing here, but rather than logging to a file, I log to a pipe (ah
ha! Why didn't I think of that? :-) ).  
<P> 
Works really well.  No disk space used, and you can just use cat to view
it, and it scrolls along nicely.
<P> 
To make a named pipe (FIFO) in /var/log/message-pipe:
<PRE> 
mknod /var/log/message-pipe p
</PRE> 
and add this to your /etc/syslog.conf (note the pipe symbol there.) :
<PRE> 
*.*             |/var/log/message-pipe
</PRE> 
and finally, just type:
<PRE> 
cat /var/log/message-pipe
</PRE> 
Or of course.. you can stick it in a shells script or as the command rxvt
runs when it starts.. whatever you like.
<P> 
Hope you find it useful,
<P>

vi/ed Tricks and the .exrc File
</H3> 
<P> 
Date: Tue, 11 Feb 1997 16:28:30 -0600 (CST)<BR> 
From: Sean Murray, <A HREF="mailto:murrsea@ripco.com">
murrsea@ripco.com </A> 
<P> 
The vi editor is built on the foundations of the "ed" editor.  Whatever
applies to ed applies to vi. So if you where wondering if there was a
way to customize your vi sessions wonder no longer.
<P>
In your home directory create a file called ".exrc", every time vi
starts it will parse that file and customize it's actions.  The below 5
lines are the contents of my .exrc file.
<PRE> 
set tabstop=8
map ^N {!}sort^M
map v {^M!}fmt^M
map V 1G^M!Gfmt^M
map ^W :!ispell %^M^M:e!^M
</PRE> 
I didn't include any comments because I don't know if the .exrc file
has a comment character, I'll comment theses lines later?
<P>
Ok the "set" command allows you to set various parameters in vi; in
this case I've set the tab stop to 8 characters. So when ever I enter a
tabstop in insertion mode the cursor will move over 8 spaces (8 spaces
is what most printers will print tabs at regardless of your vi
settings).  But you can set it to what ever you like.
<P>
Sometimes when programming I manually set my tabstop to 4 spaces for
indentation.  To do this type in the following ":set tabstop=4".  The
nice thing about this is that the character is still really a tab and
not a bunch of spaces, hence you don't force other ppl to view text
with your spacing.
<P>
"map" maps a key or key combination to a sequence of commands. Note:
that only ed commands work here so see view a list of ed commands while
editing your .exrc file. It's a BAD idea to map key or key combinations
that already have other meanings. The available combinations are:
<PRE> 
	letters:        "g K k q V v"
	Control keys:   "^A ^K ^O ^T ^W ^X"
	(where "^A" means press the control key and the letter a)
	Symbols:        "_ * \ ="
</PRE> 
(These above four lines where shamelessly stolen from ORA's _Learning
the Vi Editor_; it's a must get for any vi user)
<P>
So what does "map ^W :!ispell %^M^M:e!^M" do -- well the "map" is the
keyword telling vi to map the next character to the following
commands.  (If you map a key combination like ^W then remember to enter
this by typing the control key and "v" first and then the key
combination of control key and the letter "w".) Here we are mapping ^W
to a set of commands. The first command is telling vi to execute the
external program ispell with the current file we are editing (the
variable that holds the current files name is "%"). The ^M is actually
the character that appears after you have typed ^V and then typed the
return key hence ^M denotes the instance of a carriage return. The last
command is the vi command to reload the current file; this is necessary
as the ispell program will update the file and not the vi buffer.
<P>
assuming that you have the external programs "ispell", "fmt" and "sort"
the theses mappings should work.  "map ^N {!}sort^M" will sort a
paragraph.  "map v {^M!}fmt^M" will format a paragraph.  "map V
1G^M!Gfmt^M" will format the whole document.
<P>
A final note: if you have the environment variable EXINIT set it will
take precedence over the .exrc file settings.
<P>
