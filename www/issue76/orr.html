<H2>Horror Story</H2>

By <A HREF="mailto:CraigR@servex.com.au">Craig Reeson</A>

<P> Here's a quick horror story for you.
 I was recently admin-ing one of my Linux servers. This server is the
company print server.
What had happened was a user was connected to a legacy system via a
terminal program.  Somewhere along the line there was a screwup and his
system starting dumping lots of extraneous data to the nearest printer. The
user tried to power-cycle the printer to no avail. Thankfully, they came to
me next to try and resolve the problem.

<P> Anyway, I ssh'd into the Linux box, changed to the 'spool/' directory and
did an 'ls' of the appropriate folder. After noting that there were a few
hundred print jobs waiting in the print queue I decided it was best if I
just deleted them all...

<P> Here is where the proverbial hit the spinning thing!

<P> ...I decided to 'rm -rf *' all the files. The problem is I did it from the
'spool/' directory rather than the proper printer directory. This had the
effect of deleting everything in my system spool directory!

<P> After realising my error I tried to fix it. First thing was trying "unrm".
This did not work as I could not read from the filesystem without errors.
Next I tried using a boot floppy and trying 'unrm' again. But no that would
not work because I could not get the RAID array to be recognised!!! Tried a
few other options until I gave up and decided it was time for an "upgrade".

<P> Problem solved after 3 hours    :)




<H2></H2>

By <A HREF="mailto:craigshelley@yahoo.com">Craig Shelley</A>

<P> After buying an all-on-board style PC and installing linux, I wanted to 
try out a dual-headed configuration. This was mainly because I found 
myself with a spare graphics card and monitor. I plugged in the new 
graphics card, and realised that the super complex modular BIOS system 
was automatically disabling interrupts from the on-board graphics 
system. According to the manual, it was impossible to turn off this 
'feature'. Then I had an idea!

<P> The idea was that if the new graphics card could be disabled while 
booting, the BIOS may ignore it. Then, I could re-enable the card for 
normal use.

<P> After studying the PCI bus pinout and specs, I decided to disconnect the 
reset line from the graphics card using a sharp screwdriver to destroy 
the track. I then re-connected the reset line through a switch, and then 
down to the ground connection. (Reset is Active Low)

<P> Using the switch I could disable the card, but it then became 
impossible to re-enable it because the PC could not reset it when it 
wanted to. I then decided to connect a resistor across the broken track 
so that the card could also be reset by the PC, and my switch would not 
affect anything else.

<P> The switch was neatly mounted on the metal back plate of the card, and 
can be switched when required.

<P> Using the switch, I put the card into reset mode, booted the PC, then 
turned the card back on, and found myself with two working monitors ;-) ;-)

<P> Also, have you ever wondered how to get out of the situation where X 
does not return VGA text mode? Adding one of these switches to your card 
solves this problem.
