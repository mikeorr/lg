<H2>Linus Speaks at SVLUG Meeting</H2>

When we gave the job of arranging speakers to Sam Ockman, we never doubted
his ability to bring in terrific speakers. His first speaker for our
January meeting was his personal hero, H. Peter Anvin. For February, we had
two speakers: Eric Raymond of "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" fame and Bruce
Perens of Debian. Therefore, the question became "How do you top these
Linux luminaries?" Sam's answer was our March speaker, Linus Torvalds.
<P>
Until December, the Silicon Valley Linux Users Group (of which I am the
Vice President) had met in the back dining room of the local Carl's Jr.
(local burger chain). Carl's held around 40-50 people tightly. We had been
talking about moving the meeting from this spot for some time, and some of
our members who worked at Cisco pleaded to get a room for us
for the Eric Raymond meeting in February. As expected, this meeting was standing
room only, and we knew that with Linus coming we needed a much
larger space. Again, Cisco (with Ben Woodard pushing it through) came
through for us with a room rated for 350 people in their Gateway
Conference center.
<P>
About a half hour before the meeting began, the chairs were full and
people began to sit on the floor, against the walls and all
around the room.
Approximately 500 people had come to hear Linux speak.
We were
lucky--the air conditioning was in good shape, and
the fire marshal didn't show up.
<P>
The meeting began and after the user-group formalities were complete,
Linus was presented with the VA Research Excellence in Open Source
Software Award, co-sponsored by Red Hat and O'Reilly. The prize was a
loaded dual Pentium 333 from VA Research. In fact, Linus made out very
well, receiving not only the computer just mentioned, but also a Palm Pilot
professional
from Klaus Schulz of 3Com and a six-pack of real beer from local legend Rick
Moen. It should be noted that Linus didn't know about any of these awards
before coming to the meeting.
<P>
Accompanied by thunderous applause, Linus stood before the podium and expressed
his shock at the number of people who had showed up to hear him speak. He
had been under the impression that it would be a small, intimate meeting
like the first one he had attended last year at the burger joint.
<P>
He began his speech by telling the group what he wouldn't be talking about.
He said he wouldn't be talking about user issues or MIS issues--all
he would talk about was what he was doing with the kernel.
<P>
The hour-long speech (not counting the Q&A afterward)
was a technical discussion of how he is improving SMP (symmetric
multi-processing) support in the kernel.
He talked about the challenges of moving from a single
kernel resource lock for all CPUs as in the 2.0.x kernels to
individual resource locks for the new kernels. He discussed the ways these
changes affect things internally for the kernel, and how it affects the
handling of shared memory, interrupts and I/O. Linus also spent some time
talking about how the file system is being changed internally for better
performance. The speech will be available on-line by the time this article
goes to print (see Resources below), I'd recommend that you download it
and listen to the whole thing.
<P>
In addition to videotaping the speech and taking still photos,
the meeting in its entirety was broadcast over the MBone (Internet
protocol multicast backbone). After Linus had finished speaking, all of the
door prizes were given out, and everyone left the meeting happier and smarter
than they were the day before.
Special thanks are due to Linus Torvalds for speaking and to
everyone else involved in making this meeting a success.
