<p>
When I see a post in The Answer Gang and want to try out some submitted
code, I often want to run it to see what it does - but the procedure to
do this (open another xterm, fire up 'vi', put it into "append" mode,
paste the code, etc.) is a pain. So, I've created a script that helps me
do all of this conveniently.
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
#!/bin/bash
# Created by Ben Okopnik on Sun Apr 13 11:22:45 EDT 2008
# Requires 'dialog' and 'xclip'
 
cd /tmp
label="New filename:"
while :
do
	fname=`/usr/bin/dialog --stdout --inputbox "$label" 7 40`
	# WEIRD: '-f' doesn't expand/handle '~'! We'll borrow the shell's brain.
	fname=`eval /bin/echo $fname`
 
	if [ -f "$fname" ]
	then
		label="\"$fname\" already exists. New name:"
	else
		[ "$fname" = "" ] &amp;&amp; exit
		/usr/bin/xclip -o &gt; "$fname"
		/bin/vi "$fname"
		break
	fi
done
</pre>

<p>
I also created an icon on my Window Manager toolbar that executes
"/usr/bin/xterm -e /usr/local/bin/snapedit". Now, whenever I highlight
any kind of text, I can click on the icon, enter a filename (optionally
including a path - otherwise, the file will be created in "/tmp") in the
dialog box, and get a 'vi' session with the selected content already in
the file. Ever since I created this thing, I've found more and more uses
for it. Give it a try, and you will too!

<p>
I don't know anything about dialog, but I can tell you why that fails,
and why your eval is the wrong thing to do here.
</p>

<p>
Due to the way bash parses its input, if you want "~/.foo" expand, you
<strong>mustn't</strong> quote it.  Hence:
</p>

<pre>
[n6tadam@workstation ~]$ [ -f "~/.xsession" ] &amp;&amp; echo yes
[n6tadam@workstation ~]$ [ -f ~/.xsession ] &amp;&amp; echo yes
yes
</pre>

<p>
So I would surmise that if you simply had:
</p>

<pre>
# You're using bash.  Honour $() over arcane backticks.
fname=$(/usr/bin/dialog --stdout --inputbox "$label" 7 40)
[ -f $name ] &amp;&amp; ....
</pre>

<p>
All should be OK.
</p>

<p>
Oh, it's an interesting idea, BTW.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<p>
I understand variable/token expansion quite well, thank you. Your
solution, however, fails this way:
</p>

<pre>
ben@Tyr:~$ name="foo bar"
ben@Tyr:~$ [ -f $name ] &amp;&amp; echo 'Great solution, Thomas!'
-bash: [: foo: binary operator expected
</pre>

<p>
<strong>That's</strong> why my approach is the right way to go. Previously, I did it with
</p>

<pre>
fname=`echo $name|sed "s|~|$HOME|"`
</pre>

<p>
but that seemed a little boring, so I decided to do an 'eval' for a
change. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Thanks! In my experience, it works pretty well.

Oh yes, spaces.  How could I forget that?  Duh.  (But then you get what

metacharacter used as a filename.  Yes, that's insensitive.  :P)

I would personally by-pass all this substitution "nonsense" instead
chastising the user for using "~" in the first place.  ;)

That's actually part of the portability game - I write the stuff to run
under Bourne, then execute it under a modern shell. See, some of the old
versions of 'sh' were just too damn persnickety: e.g., one
implementation would <strong>only</strong> accept '[ "$a" = 1 ]' as a numerical
equivalence test, while another would <strong>only</strong> buy '[ "$a" == 1 ]'. Bash,
KSH, etc. will handle both.

<p>
Nah, it's not insensitive - shell scripting does not depend on anyone's
feelings. You're just failing to recognize reality, that's all. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> But
since you're the programmer, you could always put in some sort of a
validation routine to enforce your view, though (see below.)

In combination with my 'vi' maps (&lt;F3&gt; for 'add a shebang and comment'
and &lt;F5&gt; for 'chmod +x and execute'), it makes for a wonderful time
saver. I'm very, very pleased with it.
