On April 7th, 1998, a select group of the most influential people in the
Open Source community gathered in Palo Alto to meet each other, consider the
implications of Netscape's browser source release, and discuss where the
Open Source movement is headed (and, especially how it can work with the market
rather than against it, for the benefit of both).
<p>
The summit was hosted by O'Reilly & Associates, a company that has been
symbiotic with the Open Source movement for many years. Linux's own Linus
Torvalds attended. The inventors of all three major scripting
languages were present: Larry Wall (Perl), John Ousterhout (Tcl) and
Guido Van Rossum (Python). Eric Allman (Sendmail) and Paul Vixie
(BIND/DNS) were present, representing their own projects and the BSD
community. Phil Zimmerman, the author of PGP, was there too, as was
John Gilmore, a co-founder of Cygnus and the Electronic Frontier
Foundation. Brian Behlendorf spoke for the maintainers of
Apache. Jamie Zawinski and Tom Paquin represented Netscape and
mozilla.org. For my semi-accidental role in motivating the Netscape
source release with ``The Cathedral and the Bazaar'', I also had the
honor to be among those invited.
<p>
We met from 8:30AM to 5PM, following up with a well-attended press
briefing. It was invigorating just to be around the amount of
intelligence and accomplishment there, and a bit sobering to realize
how absolutely critical their work has become--not just to the
hacker culture but to the world expecting the Internet
to become the vital communications medium of the next century.
<p>
One of the most important purposes of the meeting was simply to permit
everyone to meet face to face, shake hands, look in each others' eyes and
hear each others' voices. Many of us had never actually met each
other before, despite having been in e-mail conversations for
many years. Tim O'Reilly felt (correctly, I think) that Net contact
has not been quite enough as a community builder; that the
opportunities and challenges we face now require an attempt to build
more personal trust among the chieftains of the major Open Source
tribes.
<p>
In that, I think, the meeting was very successful. But it also
certainly dealt with substance as well. We discussed different
perspectives on the Open source/free software phenomenon and different
definitions of it. One of the meeting's important results was a general
agreement that, in all the variant definitions, <i>public access to
source</i> was the most important and only absolutely critical common
element.
<p>
We discussed the vexing issue of labels, considering the implications
of ``freeware'', ``sourceware'', ``open source'', and ``freed software''.
After a vote, we agreed to use ``Open Source'' as our label. The
implication of this label is that we intend to convince the corporate
world to adopt our way for economic, self-interested, non-ideological
reasons. (This is the line of attack I've been pursuing though
<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org">www.opensource.org</A> and many recent interviews with the national press.)
<p>
We talked about business models. Several people in the room are facing
questions about how to ride the interface between the market and the
hacker culture. Netscape is approaching this from one side; Scriptics
(John Ousterhout's Tcl company) and Eric Allman's commercial Sendmail
launch are approaching it from the other. No one is certain yet what will
work, but we were able to identify common problems and some possible
strategies for attacking them.
<p>
We talked about development models--the various ways in which
projects are organized, the strengths and weaknesses of each model, and
what our individual experiences have been.
There were no magic insights, but again it seemed helpful to 
recognize common problems.
<p>
We all understood this meeting could be only a beginning. Late in the
day we developed a tentative agenda for a larger follow-up conference
which O'Reilly may host later in the year. We hope to bring other
key people from the Open Source community in on that follow-up--one of
the last things Tim asked us to think about
was who should have been with us, but was not.
<p>
The day ended with a well-attended press briefing at which all of us
answered questions from Bay Area and national reporters--some got the
message, some didn't. For every one that genuinely wanted to
understand the logic of the Open Source approach, there was another
who repeated ``lets-you-and-him-fight'' questions about Microsoft.
Still, the first burst of publicity about our gathering (it is two days later
as I write) has been very positive.
<p>
We are entering a very exciting time. In the wake of the Netscape
release, the Open Source community, has achieved a visibility it never
had before. We're making friends in new places and meeting new
challenges. The larger world we're now trying to persuade to adopt
our way doesn't care about our factional differences; it wants to know
what we can do for it that is valuable enough to motivate a major
change in the ground rules of the software industry.
<p>
To do that persuading, we'll need to pull together as one community
more than we have in the past. We--not just the Linux community but
the BSD people, the Perl, Python and Tcl hackers, the
Internet infrastructure people and the Free Software
Foundation--will need to present one face and speak one language
and tell one story to that larger world.
<p>
That is, ultimately, why this meeting was so important. All of us came
away with a better sense of what that story is and how each of the
major tribes fits into it. Just the fact that we faced the reporters
(and, by extension, the rest of the world) together was a very
powerful statement. The summit was a good beginning--one to build
on in the coming months.
