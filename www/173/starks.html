<h1>Picking Fruit</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/starks.html">Ken Starks</a></b></p>

<img hspace="15" src="misc/starks/fruit_1.jpg" align="left">
<p>
Having spent a considerable amount of time as a bachelor, I've learned
survival and coping techniques necessary for the lifestyle.  I've learned
to buy my own clothes without guilt ("you're not wearing THAT, are you?")
I've conquered the laundromat, microwave, and DVR... I've even mustered the
courage to buy my own food in a supermarket. Exposing testosterone in a
female domain can be tricky, but learn I have...
</p>

<p>
Look helpless long enough and some woman will show you pity and the cereal
aisle.
</p>

<p>
But there is one mystery I have yet to unravel.
</p>

<p>
<em>Melons.</em>
</p>

<p>
There they sit in the produce section... piles of them, one on top of
another.  I have thumped, smelled, hefted, and even squeezed the damned
things.  Regardless of my efforts, the one I ultimately bring home will
have the heart of a concrete slab and taste like cardboard.
</p>

<p>
Precut and packaged melon has been my most often used option.
</p>

<p>
If only the rest of my life were so simple.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Since 2004, I have been a Linux Advocate.  As the founder of <A
HREF="http://www.heliosinitiative.org/" NAME="The HeliOS Project">The
HeliOS Project</A>, I have organized an effort that, to date, has built
three learning centers and given away approximately 1,071 computers to kids
that cannot afford them.  I mention this not to self-promote but to
indicate that I have a bit of experience with New Linux Users.
</p>

<p>
I've come to realize that picking a candidate for Linux conversion is much
like picking melons from the supermarket... you can thump and inspect to
your heart's content but in reality, not every person is ready for the Free
Software harvest.
</p>

<p>
Let's look at a couple of the most common factors as to why.  The first one
is the most obvious.
</p>

<h3>Window Glazed</h3>

<img hspace="15" src="misc/starks/glazed_2.jpg" align="left">
<p>
It's a Microsoft Windows world and I don't think anyone wants to argue that
point.  Since the advent of Microsoft's last real innovation, Windows 95,
most every computer coming off the production line has come pre-installed
with Microsoft operating systems. People have learned to use their
computers in line with the Redmond Dictate.  Let's be honest here:
philosophical arguments aside, when Windows is running well, it is a fairly
decent way to operate a computer.  I mean, sure it allows an unsuspecting
user to delete svchost.exe... it even allows a moron to do it multiple times
through multiple reinstalls... but aside from full default user control, it
works mostly well.  Mostly.
</p>

<p>
People get used to doing things one way. Facing another fact, many in the
tech teaching world might agree that about half the people operating a
computer today are not computer operators at all... they are task-set mouse
clickers. Move one icon from its place or slide a toolbar from bottom to
top and many of them will scream <blink>&quot;VIRUS&quot;</blink>! They have become
comfortable with their chosen applications and environments and are loath
to step outside of them. Even when you physically show someone another
application for the same task, they are often either hesitant or they
openly balk at change. To use another application would mean leaving their
comfort zone.  
</p>

<p>
God forbid. 
</p>

<p>
There is one factor that can change
this... occasionally.
</p>

<h3>The Pain Threshold</h3>

<img hspace="15" src="misc/starks/pain_3.jpg" align="left">
<p>
Sometimes, enough is enough.  Semi-annual reinstalls and constant losing
battles against viruses and spyware can take its toll.  However, I've sat
down at Windows computers that had 5 or 6 spyware toolbars nestled within
Internet Explorer and the owner was clueless as to why his computer was
running slow.  Many of these people insist &quot;it's the computer&quot;.
Opening the process dialog and showing them the actual software-based
reason for it most often produces glazed-over eyes or blank stares.  Seems
that seeing anything ending with a file extension can cause
discomfort... often it's best not to show them the man behind the curtain.
</p>

<p>
I know that sounds condescending but we
see it more than we'd like to.
</p>

<p>
Here's the rub...
</p>

<p>
Many of these people, even if they were willing to try something different,
do not know that they have a choice.  Even when they do, I've had first-hand
experience in guiding people to Linux only to have them tell me that a
family member or their &quot;computer friend&quot; said not to
bother... that &quot;Linux Sucks&quot;.
</p>

<p>
Door closed.
</p>

<p>
Like the rinse-lather-repeat behavior of Microsoft Windows doesn't suck?  
</p>

<p>
I don't apologize for the fact that I believe people who refuse to solve
their own problems <a
href="http://linuxlock.blogspot.com/2009/05/thin-line-between-victim-and-idiot.html"
name="Victims or idiots?">are idiots</a>.  I've been criticized often for
my lack of bedside manner.  Then again, when you have the source of most
Internet and computer security problems suggesting that the computing
public be taxed to clean up infected machines, it's no wonder they are
confused. To many computer users, 
</p>

<p>
Microsoft IS the definitive expert on their computers. <a
href="http://yro.slashdot.org/story/10/03/02/2025237/Microsoft-VP-Suggests-Net-Tax-To-Clean-Computers"
name="Microsoft suggests internet tax">This is sad.</a>  
</p>

<p>
In my experience, approximately three out of ten Windows Users in distress
will seriously consider making the switch... and I don't necessarily think
of those as dismal numbers.  In the baseball world, that's equal to batting
.300 which can command multi-million dollar annual contracts.  I'll take
three out of ten.
</p>

<h3>Peer Pressure</h3>

<img hspace="15" src="misc/starks/kids_4.jpg" align="left">
<p>
While we've had most success with this in younger people, the fact that one
harried Windows User recommends Linux to another harried Windows User has
had surprising results.  Recently, we installed a Linux computer in a
housing project in East Austin.  It was a single-parent household with two
children who needed a computer.  It wasn't two weeks until people from the
project were coming over to use that computer to check their email or look
something up on the Internet because their Windows computer was hosed.
</p>

<p>
Go figure.
</p>

<p>
We've done nine Linux installs in that project to date and they all stemmed
from that one initial install.  Once people have something to physically
compare their current Windows computer to, the job becomes easier.
</p>

<p>
Pain Threshold indeed.
</p>

<p>
Kids at school are a big factor in getting us candidates for installs.
While the computer gaming crowd isn't going to pay much attention, having a
kid brag about his &quot;new system&quot; will.  The 3D cube has a lot to
do with it, and truth be known, I rarely turn on my extra effects anymore,
but with the younger users, it most certainly is a selling point.  Add in
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_C8WJYh7IE" name="Beauty and
Function">the Atlantis or Cube Gear plugin</A> and you have an environment
that draws them in quickly.
</p>

<h3>Understanding the Difference</h3>

<img hspace="15" src="misc/starks/magnets_5.jpg" align="left">

<p>
As mentioned above, many New Linux Users are put off or confused by a
different environment. They are so used to the blue XP visuals that when
presented with a differing screen or menu, they become uncomfortable.  I've
often mentioned that the absolute worst thing we can do as advocates is to
give a new user a Live CD and walk away.  Case in point...
</p>

<p>
A stay-at-home mom was given a CD by one of our directors a couple
months back.  It was carefully explained to her how to use the CD and what
to do in order to get it to boot.  When he called her back the next day to
check up on her, she complained loudly that Linux wouldn't work for her.
</p>

<p>
&quot;I put the CD in, I opened the folder and clicked on every icon in the
box. Nothing happened.&quot;
</p>

<p>
Sigh.
</p>

<p>
The Director told her to reboot the computer with the CD in the drawer and
it would become apparent what she should do. Nope... the computer BIOS was
set to boot to hard drive first. The boot process took her straight into
Windows again. When it was further explained that she should hit F12 to
change the boot device, she refused.
</p>

<p>
&quot;If it's that much trouble to use, I don't want to use it.&quot;
</p>

<p>
This is coming from a woman who bitterly complained about the 20 minute
update and patch time she had to endure every time she booted her computer
into Windows.  
</p>

<p>
This from a woman who had 11 individual viruses or instances of spyware on
her machine.
</p>

<p>
She reported her boot time into a desktop at 6 minutes.
</p>

<p>
And yeah... sure, most people who sit down at a computer will be able to
negotiate the Live CD just fine, but I am consistently amazed at the number
of people who cannot.  I've found that once you personally sit next to them
and show them how it works, their confidence level increases greatly and
the chances of them using Linux on a consistent basis is much better.
</p>

<p>
I fully realize that many people just do not have the time, patience or
social skills to sit down and walk a new user through this process but many
of us do and that is why I am writing this. Make them comfortable in a new
environment and half the battle is won.
</p>

<p>
Forewarned is forearmed...
</p>

<p>
Next?  Destroying the mental myths of
Linux use.  Stay tooned... this will be fun.
