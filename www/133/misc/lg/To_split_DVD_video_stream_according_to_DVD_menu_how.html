Dear people,
</p>

<p>
	I have a DVD with several short films glued together into one
	big video-stream (and of course then split into 1GB VOBs).
	There is a menu on this DVD, which buttons trigger play of
	this stream from certain offsets (starts of separate shorts).
	On the ending of a short, playing continues into next one.
</p>

<p>
	My problem now is how to split this DVD structure back into
	separate mpeg/avi files, one for each short ? I.e., first, to
	read starting point data out of DVD menu buttons, next, sort
	these points in advance order, and last, extract resulting
	pieces/intervals from big DVD stream.
</p>

<p>
	I would prefer to solve this problem by using free software
	(transcode/mplayer/mencoder/mjpegtools/xine/wharever).
	I also would not mind writing a little program myself in
	C/Perl/shell if there are no existing command-line utilities to
	achieve this goal. And I would appreciate some initial
	directions from you. What is better to read and learn before
	I start ? I found out that DVD menu is plain MPEG2 file, but no
	great details about these buttons/actions. May be I should use
	libdvdnav ? What good examples to look into ?
</p>

<p>
	Thank you in advance for your reply.
</p>

I'm not an expert on DVDs/multimedia at all, but the solution seems
pretty straightforward: read up on the format in which DVD menus are
stored, write a programming structure to match that format, and extract
the offsets. Since you can read C, there's a project that you might want
to look at - <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/html2dvd/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/html2dvd/</a> - that encodes an
HTML menu to a DVD menu. Assuming that the code is actually written in
a readable manner, you should be able to see the format definition in
one of the header files.
</p>

<p>
The other approach would be to dig into the resources at mpeg.org -
e.g., '<a href="http://www.mpeg.org/MPEG/dvd.html">http://www.mpeg.org/MPEG/dvd.html</a>'. Plenty of reference material
there, including lots of off-site links to FAQs, etc.
</p>

<p>
If anyone here has more specific info on how to do the specific thing
you're asking about, great. If not, I hope these general pointers will
be useful.

That would be either titles (top level) or chapters (second level) structures.

If you don't care for a DVD with the same menu but just want to get
every sinlge short movie into a single file mencoder (part of mplayer)
can handle this easily.  At the bottom of the man page are some examples
including the following one:  
</p>

<p>
<pre>
EXAMPLES OF MENCODER USAGE
   Encode DVD title #2, only selected chapters:
       mencoder dvd://2 -chapter 10-15 -o title2.avi -oac copy -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4
</pre>
If you would prefer to keep the original mpeg2 encoding instead of
recoding into mpeg4 you might want to grab transcode and have a look at
tccat 
</p>

<p>
<pre>
tccat  -i name [ -t magic ] [ -T title[,chapter[,angle]] ] [ -L ] [ -S n ] [ -P ] [ -a ] [ -d mode ] [ -v ]
</pre>
which can extract title/chapters from the DVD stream.
