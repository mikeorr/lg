<BR>S. Manohar (<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net?cc=manohar@hclt.com">manohar from hclt.com</a>)

<P>
Hello Everybody,
</P>
<P>
I am trying to develop a x86 target which boots from Flash. I have
taken the BLOB bootloader  (taken from LART
project based on ARM processor.)  and  am modifying it for X86. So far I
am able to get the Linux kernel booted. But when it
comes to the mounting of rootfile system I am stuck. ( The blob
downloads the kernel image and initrd image  into RAM from
Flash/through serial line).
</P>
<P>
1. I am getting the compressed  kernel image  in RAM at 0x100000 through
serial line.
</P>
<P>
2. I am getting the compressed ramdisk  image(initrd)  in RAM at
0x400000 through serial line.
</P>
<P>
3. The kernel gets uncompressed and boots correctly till the point of
displaying the message
</P>
<P>
RAMDISK: Compressed image found at block 0.
and then hangs.
</P>
<P>
4. After debugging I have found that control comes till gunzip function
inlinux/lib/inflate.c  but never comes out of the function.
</P>
<P>
5. The parameters I have set at the begining of setup_arch function in
linux/arch/i386/kernel/setup.c are as follows
</P>

<blockquote><pre>         ORIG_ROOT_DEV = 0x0100
         RAMDISK_FLAGS = 0x4000
         INITRD_START = 0x400000
         INITRD_SIZE =  0xd4800    (size of compressed  ram disk image)
         LOADER_TYPE = 1
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
Has anyone faced such problem before?  If so what needs to be done?
</P>
<P>
Are the values for the  parameters mentioned above correct? Are they the
only information to be mentioned to the kernel for
locating and uncompressing the RAMDISK image and make it boot?
</P>
<P>
Is there any bootloader readily available for x86 platform for booting
from Flash also with serial downloading facility?
</P>
<P>
Please help
</P>
<P>
With Kind Regards,
<br>manohar

WinPrinter Work-around
From harmbehrens on Sat, 01 May 1999
</BLOCKQuote></EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#006633"><EM>
Hello, is there any work-around to get a gdi printer (Star Wintype 4000) to
work with Linux :-?
</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#006633"><EM>

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000066"><EM>
I presume that these are NOT what you wanted to hear. However, there is no
way that I know of to support a Winprinter without running drivers that are
native to MS Windows (and its GDI --- graphics device interface --- APIs).
</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>
What about using one of the Windows emulators like <A HREF="http://www.winehq.com/">WINE</A>
(<A HREF="http://www.winehq.org"
	>http://www.winehq.org</A>) ? -- Mike
</P>
<P>
Actually, a very few GDI- aka "winprinters" are supported - some Lexmarks.
I saw them first as debian packages but I'm pretty sure Linuxprinting.org
has more details.  The notes said that rumor has it some other GDI printers
work with those, but it's a bit of effort and luck.  Rather like winmodems...
-- Heather
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I Agree 100% about the GDI printers!  (I refer to them as Goll Damn M$
Imitators).  Unfortunately, until the recent developments on the federal
court case M$ has not been checked at all.  Some parts of what they, as
a Monopoly have done has been good for the IT commmunity, while other
things have really crapped on people WHO THINK!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thank GOD !!!!!  Linux is around to be a thorn in their side ...
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
THe other incidious thing printer manufacs have done is stop building
as many Postscript printers.  They are all using the friggin Windows
drivers to do everything ...  .  So I have begun to play the stinkin game
by mounting SMALL 468-DX266 16 Megs Linux Print Servers running SAMBA.
THe newest ver of SAMBA even does PDC correctly.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Linux has been my savior in many times of need!  I have been able to
use thos stinking 386 boat anchors as LRP routers or firewalls, the
small 90 Pent to 166 Pent are becoming LTSP Linux Xwindow Terminals.  I
still have stinking  problems from time to time, yet I DON'T HAVE TO
REBOOT EVERY 24 [&amp;^%$!#]* days PER TECHNET(M$ answer to internal
pay support) FOR NT SERVERS!  I have Linux servers with uptimes of 200 +
days IN PRODUCTION!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I'll sign off , enough rambling and ranting for one email.  I just
found your stuff through linuxdoc.org, and I thought you HIT THE NAIL ON
THE HEAD!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!
</STRONG></P>
<P>
The real question is, is it worth spending 50 bucks instead of 200 or more,
when you're going to spend a bunch of time making sure your driver is wired
up right?   I have an unfair advantage, since I live where these things are
sold readily, but I get to say no ... I can spend about 80 bucks on a color
printer which is actually listed as fully supported.
</P>
<P>
You may be able to mail order a good printer at a decent price.  On the other
hand, if exploring how these things all tie together under the hood is fun,
then you can improve the state of the art for such printers, and maybe some
fine day folks will be able to easily use "the GDI printer that came with
their MS windows" without having to fight with it like this.

The problem is, most people who ask Windows questions found the submission
address via a search engine, and have no idea the address belongs to Linux
Gazette or even know what Linux Gazette is.  Perhaps we should have used
an address like linux-questions-only, but we can't stop honoring the old
addresses since they are published in so many back issues and some are on
CD-ROMs that we can't change. -- Mike

I love reading LG every month, especially TAG, and 2cent tips.  But the new
blinking question and exclamation icons are somwhat annoying.  Any chance of
going back to the old ones? 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
thanks for all the good work!
</STRONG></P>
<P>
blinking?  They're not supposed to blink.  In fact, if they are it's been
that way for <EM>YEARS</EM> ... since I first provided .gif files with the ! and ?
in them in blue, instead of with those stupid "!" and "?" that nobody could
read.
</P>
<P>
It would mean I accidentally had layers in them.  But there's no loop command,
so even if you see that briefly it should stop.  Is that what you are seeing,
or does it continue to blink?  Did you change browsers at all recently?  If
so to which one?
</P>
<P>
We have been trying to improve browser compatability lately anyway 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)"

for bringing it up.
</P>
<P>
[ turning to my fellow editor ] Mike, did anybody run any scripts against the
graphic images recently that I need to know about?
</P>
<P>
-- Heather
</P>
<P>
No, we haven't changed those images.  I've threatened to change all .gif's
to .png or .jpg and change all the links, but haven't done it yet.  I've only
used blinking text once or twice and that wasn't in the TAG column.
</P>
<P>
Also, LG is probably the only site in the world that requires NON-ANIMATED
logo images from its sponsors.  Because I personally have a strong
intolerance for unnecessary animations.
</P>
<P>
-- Mike
</P>
<P>
The "blinking Icons" are actually three layer gifs with one backround (white
bubble) and 0ms display time and two layers (question mark and shadow) with
100ms display time in combine mode (will be overlayed over the previous one).
</P>
<P>
opera5.0/Linux displays them on a strange blue background (seems to have a
gif problem, also with other gifs not only these little ones).
</P>
<P>
If you want a scriptable tool (besides gimp) there is a program called
pngquant which can do the color (and size) reduction on png files which
convert will not do.

Everyone I know is having the same problem. Not only is the Telnet completely
outdated, but it simply does not work for people off campus in most

a better "normal telnet" client for Windows. -- Heather

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000066"><EM>
And last weekend I discovered that the public library in Halifax, Nova Scotia,
has putty as the <EM>default</EM> terminal emulator on their public Windows

putty is easy: just choose one radio button or the other.

<li> He didn't call himself The Answer Guy -- that's what Marjorie named the
column, and the title clung to him.  It's an okay title but there could
be better ones - none of which stuck long enough to be worth changing the
column title.

<li> It's a whole bunch of people now - has been for months - so it's The
Answer Gang.  Which member of the Gang are you whining about? 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)"

<br>
I'll assume Jim Dennis, for the moment.


<li>"all he knows how to be is..." - yeah, that's why he has a well paying
job in the Silicon Valley, and a published book (from a normal publishing
house, so yes, it's been spell checked), and speaking engagements at
conferenees.  Because he doesn't know anything.
</ol>
<P>
We all have our good days, and our sarcastic days, and the point of our
column is that we're real people, answering in just the same way we would
if you asked us at the mall while we were buying a box of the latest
Linux distro.
</P>
<P>
A particular thing to note is very few of us are Windows people.  Most of
us not at all - and others have had bad real-life experiences with the OS
you presently favor.  So not everyone will be cheer and light towards things
we consider to be poor sysadmin practices.  Especially things which would
be poor sysadmin practices even in an all Microsoft corporate netcenter.
</P>
<P>
At least two of us have enough WIndows experience to attempt answers in
that direction -- but this is the LINUX Gazette.  If your questions are
not about LINUX at least partially, then we really didn't want to hear
from you... so you should be glad you got any answer at all...
</P>
<P>
... and curiously enough, some Windows people have gotten real answers
for themselves in Linux documents once we point them the right way.
</P>
<P>
The practice of running an open service needs more care than just "clicking
Yes" on the NT service daemon, and some of these services only make sense
in a locked up environment.
</P>
<P>
Many but not all of The Answer Gang feel that telnet is now one such service.
By mailing us you ask our opinion, and that opinion is real, so we say it.
You do not have to like our opinions.  We don't have to like yours.  We
can still share computing power.

<P align="center">
<em>A free society is one where it is safe to be unpopular.</em>

you make yourself seem very unintelligent to me and
have you ever heard of "If you can't say anything nice.don't say it at all?"
</STRONG></P>
<P>
As if calling us a bastard is nice, yet you bothered to say <EM>that</EM>.  You know
absolutely nothing of the parentage of any member of this group unless you

<P>
... and we know that you have not because you only speak to one person.
</P>
<P>
Parentage (or lack of one) doesn't necessarily lead to being technologically
clued, but having technical or scientifically inclined parents seems to help.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Apparently not. The question Nellie asked was a valid one. Too bad she does
now all the mumbo jumbo computer jargon...maybe the next time you should self
proclaim yourself as the "Smart-ass Guy" instead.
Miriam Brown
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I believe "curmudgeon" is the term you're looking for, and yes, Jim Dennis
labels himself to be one.  Proudly.
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, a querent this month has asked where to read up on the techy
mumbo jumbo words so they can learn more about Linux and speak more freely
with their geeky friends.  Our answers to that will actually be useful to
many readers.
</P>
<P>
Poor english is tolerated to a fair degree on the querent's side.
(that is, if we can't figure out what querents are saying, it's hard to
even <EM>try</EM> to answer them).  Each Answerer's personal style is mostly
kept - so some are cheerful, some are grumpy.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
PS...Don't answer guys usually use spell check?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
It is not required to know how to use a spell checker, in order to know how
to rebuild a kernel.  You have delusions of us being some glossy print
magazine like <EM>Linux Journal</EM>.  (ps.  Our host, SSC publishes that.  It
does get spell checked and all those nice things.  Go subscribe to it if
you like.  End of cheap plug.)
</P>
<P>
Nobody here is paid a dime for working on the <EM>Gazette</EM> specifically, so
our editorial time is better spent on link checking and finding correct
answers... er, well, we try... than spellos.  We have occasionally had
people complain about this point very clearly and loudly, but there is
not room in the publishing schedule for them to squish themselves in
between and still meet deadline.  We suggested that they make their own
site carry the past issue after fixes (our copyright allows this) but
the people have then always backed down and gone away.  We'd almost
certainly merge their repairs if they made some, but nobody has taken
up on that offer yet.  Oh well.  Let us know if you want to start the
Excellent Speller's Site - we'll cheer for you.  Maybe some other docs
in the <A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">Linux Documentation Project</A> (LDP) could stand a typo scrub too.
</P>
<P>
Oddly, many people read <EM>LG</EM> religiously because it's written in 
person to
person mode and doesn't spray gloss all over the articles and columns that
way.   You will get ecstatic excitement at successes and growling at bad
ways to do things and every emotion in between.
</P>
<P>
No, many of the querents don't spell check either, but we still answer
<EM>them</EM>.
</P>
<P>
I hope you enjoyed your time flaming, but we have people asking questions
about Linux to get back to.

No, I noticed the ravings on The Back Page of issue 67, and had to send

<br>Gee, our old LaSalle ran great

But better yet, is the Simpsonized version --

<P>
For the way the BeeGees played
<br>Films that John Travolta made
<br>Guessing how much Elvis weighed

And you knew where you were then

<P>
Disco Duck and Fleetwood Mac

<P>
Hi,
</P>
<P>
First i must commend you on providing a service to all the Linux users
out there trying to get started on rolling their own kernel. I would just
like to point out a few things i found somewhat confusing about your
article.
</P>
<P>
You compiled in "math emulation" support even though you have a CPU with a
built in maths co-processor, in this case the math emulation will never be
used and essentially wastes memory. secondly, you selected SMP support for
your uniprocessor (UP) system. This on some occasion can cause problems with
specific UP motherboards causing them not to boot or certain kernel modules
not loading, in addition to being slower and taking up more memory than a
non-SMP kernel. Also as you might want to break apart your build procedure
by using double ampersands. i.e. "make dep &amp;&amp; make bzImage &amp;&amp; make modules
&amp;&amp; make modules install ....."
</P>
<P>
That aside, it's great that you're willing to share your experiences and
knowledge with the rest of the Linux community.
</P>
<P>
Regards,
<br>Zwane

<BR>Bryan Henderson (<a href="mailto:gazette@linuxgazette.net">bryanh from giraffe-data.com </a>)

<P>
I was pleased to see a letter by Benjamin D Smith that compares
learning Windows to learning Unix by drawing a mental graph of the
respective learning curves, because I thought it would set straight
a lot of people who misuse the term "steep learning curve."
</P>
<P>
But then Smith went ahead and misused the term himself, in a way
wholly inconsistent with the picture he drew.
</P>
<P>
To set the record straight, allow me to explain what a learning
curve is, and in particular what a steep one is all about.
</P>
<P>
The learning curve is a graph of productivity versus time.  As time
passes, you learn stuff and your productivity increases (except in
weird cases).
</P>
<P>
Windows has a steep learning curve.  You start out useless, but with
just a little instruction and messing around, you're already writing
and printing documents.  The curve rises quickly.
</P>
<P>
Unix has a very shallow learning curve.  You start out useless, and
after a day of study, you can still do just a little bit.  After
another day, you can do a little bit more.  It may be weeks before
you're as productive as a Windows user is after an hour.
</P>
<P>
Smith's point, to recall, was that the Windows learning curve, while
steep, reaches a saturation point and levels off.  The Unix curve,
on the other hand, keeps rising gradually almost without bound.  In
time, it overtakes the Windows curve.
</P>

<P>
I just look at your issue 41 (I know that is not really recent ...) but
in the article of Christopher Lopes which is talking about CUP, there is
a mistake...
</P>
<P>
I tested it and I see that it didn't walk correctly for all the cases. In
fact it is necessary to put a greater priority to the operator ' - ' if not,
we have 8-6+9 = -7 because your parsor realizes initially (6+9 = 15) and
after (8-15= -7). To solve this problem it is enough to create a state
between expr and factor which will represent the fact that the
operator - has priority than it +.
</P>
<P>
Cordially.

<BR>Chris Gianakopoulos (<a href="mailto:gazette@linuxgazette.net">pilolla from gateway.net</a>)

<P><STRONG>
I want to install all of the newest Linux Gazette issues on one of our
Linux machines at work.  Sounds easy enough.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Consider that I have approximately 12 month's worth of Linux Gazette
issues AND each lgbase that I download with each issue.  Is the lgbase
file cumulative?  In other words, can I install the latest and greatest
lgbase, and then install (you know -- copy them to the LDP/LG directory
tree) all of the Linux Gazette issues.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Yes.  There's only one lg-base.tar.gz, which contains shared files for all
the issues.  So you always want the latest lg-base.tar.gz.
</P>
<P>
However, once you've installed it, you don't have to download it again
every month.  Instead, you can download the much smaller lg-base-new.tar.gz,
which contains only the files that are new or changed since the previous
issue.  But if you miss a month, you'll need to download the full
lg-base.tar.gz again to get all the accumulated changes.
</P>
<P>
Always untar lg-*.tar.gz files in the same directory each month.  They will
unpack into a subdirectory lg/ with everything in the correct location.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks Mike,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
You've saved me a lot of time.  The system (<A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> 7.0 distribution) had an
up-to-date base up until March last year. Your answer saved me lots of
untarring operations.  And yes, I do put the stuff in the same directory
each month on my home system.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks for our fine magazine, and again keep up the good work (all of
you),

Hi Heather,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Sorry, just another dumb newbie question. I have recently signed up to
the tag-admin list but not the tag list. I want  to be subbed to the Tag
list and as a result I have just tried to subscribe to tag by sending
the following to <A HREF="mailto:majordomo@ssc.com"
	>majordomo@ssc.com</A>:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
subscribe tag <A HREF="mailto:hylton@global.co.za"
	>hylton@global.co.za</A>
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P>
Given the pattern for the other one, I'm guessing that sending the word
</P>
<P>
subscribe
</P>
<P>
to the address
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="mailto:tag-request@ssc.com"
	>tag-request@ssc.com</A>
...should work too.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I, as yet, haven't recd any notifications that a new Linux Gazette has
been added to the files area.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
For that, you don't want tag nor tag-admin, you want to send a note to
<A HREF="mailto:lg-announce-request@ssc.com"
	>lg-announce-request@ssc.com</A> and subscribe to lg-announce.  That doesn't
say much except that the gazette is posted.
</P>
<P>
What you will find here on tag-admin are precursor discussions;  talk about
what should or shouldn't get published, need to tweak deadlines, and some
other things that are either water-cooler talk or "infrastucture" matters.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Do the announcements of the new Linux Gazettes come out on the TAG-Admin
list or only on Tag?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Neither.
</P>
<P>
If you join the TAG list, you will be inundated with a large number of newbie
and occasional non-newbie computing questions, not all linux-related... and
a certain amount of spam that slips the filters, not all of it in English...
and a certain number of utterly dumb questions with no relation at all to
computing (apparently a side effect of the word "homework" being used so
often here).  I'd dare say most of the spam is not in English.  Since we
sometimes get linux queries in non-English languages we can't just chop
them off by character set from the list server, but they're easy to spot and
delete.
</P>
<P>
You will also see the answers flow by from members of the Gang, and efforts
to correct each other.  If you only visit the magazine once a month, you see
less answers, some of them get posted in 2c Tips, and they have been cleaned
up for readability.
</P>
<P>
So I can see reasons why someone who doesn't feel like answering questions
might want to join the TAG list and lurk, but I'm not sure which of these
you wanted.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Puzzled.

Sending huge email attachments around is an undesirable burden on our own

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000066"><EM>
I personally have made note of the ftp site but here in South Africa I
can only afford a dial-up connection the site has therefore been added
into a list to visit in the future. The problem comes in when I want to
know if there are any new tutorials on the ftp space since my last
visit. It would therefore be much more handy for me, and possibly
others, if they were allowed to request and start receiving the gazettes
via email.

visit the FTP site... or a local mirror.

Hi Heather,
</P>
<P>
OK, OK, I give up.  It was just a suggestion.
</P>
<P>
The Internet is so slow already what with video clips going via email
that I do not feel anything in using a little of it to increase my
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
I have signed up to the announcement list and will use a mirror closest
to me.

Is it possibly possible to use Linux wget feature to retrieve all the
