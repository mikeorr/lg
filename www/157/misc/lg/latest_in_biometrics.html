Identifying People By Odor As Effective As Fingerprinting
</p>

<p>
'A study has found that everybody has a unique body odor, like their
fingerprints, that could be used as an unique identifier. The study
showed that a persons unique odor stayed the same even if they varied
their diet with strong smelling foods such as garlic and spices.
"These findings indicate that biologically-based odorprints, like
fingerprints, could be a reliable way to identify individuals," said
Monell chemist Jae Kwak. I would have thought that hundreds of years
of dogs tracking people would have proved this, but it's nice to know
that science has figured it out officially now.'

Not to get too graphic, but depending on which part of the body is being
smelled... there are far more horrible body parts to lose than fingers.

Clearly I'm stuck at a mental age of 6. I'm hearing "smell my finger!"

No, because if you have the wrong smell and try to go past the
security gate the floor will drop you to the cannibals waiting for
fresh meat.

Ah. So we can use the system to get rid of people we don't like by just
surreptitiously spritzing them with someone else's body odor?
