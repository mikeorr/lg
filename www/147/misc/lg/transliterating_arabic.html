&gt; &gt; Hi, all -
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We've got somebody that just volunteered to translate bits and pieces of
&gt; &gt; LG into Arabic. Since he's working by himself, and is not a native
&gt; &gt; speaker (and since I can't read Arabic myself), does anyone here have
&gt; &gt; the ability to vet the stuff? It's at '<a href="http://arlinux.110mb.com/lgazet/">http://arlinux.110mb.com/lgazet/</a>'.
&gt; 
&gt; Hi,
&gt; I'm a native Arabic speaker. I can go through the translated text and
&gt; check it but I'm terrible at actually typing Arabic and I'm not that
&gt; good at it anyway. 
</pre>

<p>
A week or two ago, I hacked up a cute little Latin-Russian (UTF8)
converter (faking a few bits along the way, since the Russian alphabet
is longer than the English one), so I thought "heck, I'll just adjust it
so it can do Arabic - that'll give MNZ an easy way to do it." [laugh] I
knew that it was written right-to-left - I could handle that bit - but
having looked at the character set, as well as the whole
initial/medial/final/isolated thing, I've concluded that I'd be crazy to
even try.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I'll help with the translation as much as I can. I'll
&gt; start in a few days though because I have some exams right now.
</pre>

<p>
That's great - just contact the project coordinator, and let me know if
you guys need any help. Other than converters, of course. ;)
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; PS: Is anyone doing an Esperanto translation? just wondering.....
</pre>

<p>
LG's former editor, Mike Orr, is a one-man walking advert for the
language - although he's not translating LG into it, AFAIK. You could
always poke him about spreading the idea among his friends.

Do you mean transliterate from Latin to Russian?

It's a crazy language...... did you know that the written Arabic has
very little to do with spoken Arabic? Worse, spoken Arabic is
almost completely different in different countries/regions. I actually
wouldn't understand someone from the Gulf very well.

Latin character set (ISO-8859-1 and such) to Russian, yes.
</p>

<p>
Eh... I'll send this example, and hope the 8-bit stuff makes it through
the mail. Basically, it's a list of character mappings, from an English
keyboard to Russian; the script takes transliterated English text (that
is, Russian words written using those English characters) as input and
produces the "re-mapped" output. It can do this with a file that's
specified as input, or with lines typed at the console if no file is
provided. I find it very handy whenever I just need to type a quick bit
of Russian - e.g., Google searches, a quote in a text file, etc.

Wow. I've been learning a little Chinese, and while the written
ideographs ('hanzi') are the same all over (well, except for the
difference between the simplified and the original versions), the
pronunciation can vary so much that it's common for people to draw the
word they're talking with a finger, either in the air or on the palm of
their hand.

<p>
Kat just mentioned that there's supposed to be a Modern Standard Arabic
(MSA) that's a bit more, well, standardized. I can only imagine that
it's greeted with a mixture of horror (from those who have to learn *yet
another* version in addition to the ones they already know) and relief
(from anyone who has to learn it from scratch.)

Oh ok. I can imagine how useful that would be! No more hunting for
the Arabic letters around the keyboard. Why is it difficult to do it
with Arabic? The initial/medial/final thing is just about the shape of
the letter (handled by the font, I think) but it's the same letter (same
byte).

Spoken Arabic is not just different in pronunciation! The words are
different, completely! A whole set of vocab for each country/region.

<p>
To get back to this - I'd be glad to do it, given your help. Can you
come up with a reasonable 1-to-1 mapping? I.e., a parallel set of
English characters and the hex values for the Arabic ones that would (at
least mostly) make sense? I've looked at some of the existing ones, and
most of them do a mix of one- and two-character keys, like
</p>

<pre>
a/b/t/_t/j/7/.7/d/.d/r/z/s/^s/9/9./6/6./3/3./f/q/k/l/m/n/h/w/y/_a/T
</pre>
and notes about handling, e.g., Alf, Waw, and Yaa in special ways when
inside a word, and T at the end. That's a pain to program for if you
don't understand a language; character-for-character replacement just
requires a mapping.
</p>

<p>
In fact, that gives me an idea. I'm going to generalize that script so
it can be used with any language - as long you provide a map file that
looks something like this:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
# This is a mapfile for English to UTF-8 Russian.
'A' = "А"
'B' = "Б"
'V' = "В"
'G' = "Г"
'D' = "Д"
 
[etc.]
 
</pre>
The format is very flexible; a line can be anything from "Z3" to
"'Z' = '3'", and the script will happily chew it up. The documentation
is built in, and can be read with "perldoc translit".
</p>

<p>
I've just uploaded the tarball to my web server; it's available at
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://okopnik.com/temp/translit.tgz">http://okopnik.com/temp/translit.tgz</a>
</p>

<p>
and will be permanently available after we pub the upcoming issue from
</p>

<p>
<a href="../../../147/misc/tag/translit.tgz">http://linuxgazette.net/147/misc/tag/translit.tgz</a>
</p>

<p>
Hopefully, that'll be useful to a lot of folks - and I'd really
appreciate it if they sent me their mapfiles.
</p>

  Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is the literary standard across the Middle
  East and North Africa, and one of the official six languages of the
  United Nations. Most printed matter-including most books, newspapers,
  magazines, official documents, and reading primers for small children-is
  written in MSA^[citation needed].
