<h3>Load average vs CPUs</h3>

<p>
Hello Answer Gang. I was raised to believe that the load average
reported by 'uptime' and 'top' should not go above 1.0 except for
short-term transitory cases, and if it persistently goes to 2 or 3
then either you seriously need more hardware or you're trying to run
too much. But recently I heard that the target number is actually
equal to the number of CPUs. My server has 4 CPUs according to
/proc/cpuinfo, so does that mean I should let the load average go up
to 4 before being concerned?
</p>

<p>
In fact, my load average has not been that high. It was 1.5 or 1.7
when I noticed the server bogging down noticeably, and that was
probably because of a large backup rsync, and a webapp that was being
unusually memory-grubbing.  Still, my basic question remains, is 1.5
or 2 normal for a multi-CPU system?
</p>

<p>
One other issue is, I'm not sure if it really has four full CPUs. I
think it might have two of those "dual core" thingys that have two
processors but share the same I/O and cache or something. Here's a bit
of the 'dmesg' output in case it's meaningful:

A few minutes ago, I needed to count all the emails I had archived in my
~/Mail directory. A moment of thought, and:
</p>

<pre>
grep -rc '^From ' Mail/*|awk -F: '{s+=$NF}END{print s}'
</pre>

<p>
NOTES: Email headers start with a 'From ' at the beginning of the line,
so each line that starts that way identifies a single email. 'grep -r'
is recursive - i.e., also searches subdirectories. The output from
'grep' is a bunch of lines, each of which looks like 'file.txt:17',
which says that 'file.txt' has 17 matches; therefore, we use 'awk' to
split each line on colons - but since the filename itself could contain
a colon, we need to grab the very last field. In 'awk', 'NF' is the
count of fields in each line, and '$X' is the value of field X - so
'$NF' is the value of the last field. Sum them up, print them out when
it's all over, and presto - count of emails.

<h3>[2-cent Tip]: Renumbering files</h3>

<p>
This comes up occasionally: you have a numbered list of files and you
need to reorganize them, say by moving all the numbers up two places to
accomodate two more files being added to the "front of the queue", or
inserted in the middle of it. Even if you're familiar with loops, the
answers aren't quite as simple as "loop over the numbers, add 2, and
rename": doing so would overwrite the third file with the first one, the
fourth one with the second one, and so on. Ugh, what a mess!
</p>

<p>
Here's the general form of an approach that'll work well:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
start=0		# Lowest number in the list
end=10		# Highest number in the list
incr=2		# The increment
for n in $(seq $start $end|tac); do mv $n $(($n + $incr)); done
</pre>

<p>
Since piping the list through 'tac' will invert it, we will now be
renaming the files in <em>reverse</em> order - that is, 10-&gt;12, 9-&gt;11, 8-&gt;10,
and so on - which will prevent the above collisions. Renaming files that
have numbers as part of the name isn't much more difficult: given, say,
'File1xyz.txt' and so on, the loop body simply becomes
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
for n in $(seq $start $end|tac)
do
	mv File${n}xyz.txt File$(($n + $incr))xyz.txt
done
</pre>

<p>
Bonus feature: if you have a list of numbers that goes over 9 (or 99),
and you want it sorted numerically (rather than '1 10 11 12 2 3 ...'),
just use 'printf' to format the second parameter:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
for n in $(seq $start $end|tac)
do
    mv $n $(printf '%02d' $(($n + $incr)))
done
</pre>

<p>
The '02' in the above will result in numbers that are always 2 digits
long, by prefixing the single-digit ones with a zero. Obviously, this
can be extended to whatever number of digits is desired - and 'ls' will
now show a properly numerically-sorted list.
</p>

<p>
OK, sounds a bit confusing. Let's just say you are a kind of man (or
woman, of course) who thinks that typing something like:
sudo find / -xdev -type f -perm /06000 -mmin -60 | xargs ls -lt -c
will be so much comfortable if it is done inside an editor...let's
say...uhm...vim.
</p>

<p>
How to do that? simply press Ctrl-X, followed by Ctrl-E. And depending
of the content of your EDITOR environment variable, bash will fire up
that editor. Start typing, edit as neccessary, and save. And
kazaaammm, that command is executed right away.
</p>

<p>
PS: Tribute to commandlinefu.com and <a href='http://www.catonmat.net/blog'>http://www.catonmat.net/blog</a> for

<h2>News in General</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Oracle Sues Google Over Android JVM Clone</h3>

<p>In August, Oracle filed a lawsuit for copyright and patent 
infringement against Google focused on its Android operating system 
for smart phones.  Android basically a mix of Linux and a Java VM 
clone, purportedly based on the Open Source Harmony project.</p>

<p>Android is growing rapidly and is set to over take Apple's iPhone 
sales.  This also makes it a potential cash cow for Oracle which is 
seeking to realized profits from acquiring Sun last year.</p>

<p>Oracle accused Google of seven patents violations that Oracle claims 
it acquired with the M&A of Sun Microsystems. All these patents are 
part of the  Java Intellectual Property that Sun built up over the 
last 20 years:  These include:</p>

<p>- 6,125,447, "Protection domains to provide security in a computer 
system";<br />
- ,966,702, "Controlling access to a resource";<br />
- 5,966,702, "Method and apparatus for pre-processing and packaging 
class files";<br />
- 7,426,720, "System and method for dynamic preloading of classes 
through memory space cloning of a master runtime system process";<br />
-  6,910,205, "Interpreting functions utilizing a hybrid of virtual 
and native machine instructions";<br />
-  6,061,520, "Method and system for performing static 
initialization";<br />
-  And RE38,104, "Method and apparatus for resolving data references 
in generated code".</p>

<p>Martin Heller at InfoWorld blogs wrote: "...this suit is the 
equivalent of dropping a neutron bomb on the open source movement."  
This is partly because Oracle is seeking triple damages and also 
because Oracle is demanding that all copies of Android be destroyed, 
which means erasing the OS of hundreds of millions of smart phones. If 
Google were to pay fees or cross-license Google patents - which may be 
the ultimate aim of the suit - Oracle could still sue Motorola, HTC, 
and other phone manufacturers. Or it could get agreements from OEMs to 
use only official Java Mobile software in the future. That alone could 
be worth billions to Oracle.</p>

<p>As a consequence of the law suit, the Illumos project, which maintains 
an Open Solaris distro, has closed its link to the Oracle 
repositories. Effectively, Illumos Solaris is forked from Oracle 
Solaris.</p>

<h1>Video editing from the command line</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/brownss.html">Silas Brown</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>This is an article about basic video production in
MPlayer.  MPlayer has its own "edit decision list" facility,
but that is limited to deleting scenes from an already-made
movie; it cannot be used to take scenes from more than one
source file and to sequence them in a different order, as is
often needed in production.  However, by running several
MPlayer commands in succession you <em>can</em> do this on
the command line, and you don't need particularly high-spec
equipment or dexterous mouse skills or even eyesight to do it
(some eyesight is a plus but you don't need much).</p>

<H2>Previewing in MPlayer</H2>

<p>Firstly, make sure you can play each of your
source-material videos with the <tt>mplayer</tt> command
(use <tt>mplayer -framedrop</tt> if you have a slow
computer).  Installing <tt>mplayer</tt> from your package
manager may be enough, but in some cases a newer version of
<tt>mplayer</tt> and/or support for additional types of
video codecs is needed; in this case the exact setup
procedure can vary, depending on your distribution and its
version, so you may have to do some web searching to find out.</p>

<p>Once <tt>mplayer</tt> is set up correctly to play the
video format you have, in the video window you should be
able to press Space to pause and use the left and right
arrow keys to seek, and in the console window you should get
a continuously-updated one-line status report which includes
the field <tt>V:</tt> followed by the video's time counter
in seconds.  When the video is paused, you will be able to
read off the exact <tt>V:</tt> value, and you can use these
values to decide where you want to start and end your clips.
(You can fine-tune the values later by trial and error.)</p>

<H2>Taking the clips</H2>

<p>After you've decided on the order of your clips and have
made a note of their start and stop timestamp values (for
example in a text editor), you can extract each clip to a
separate file by running <tt>mencoder</tt> once for each
clip, like this:</p>

<pre>
mencoder video3.avi -ofps 25 -o clip1.avi -oac lavc -ovc lavc -vf scale=320:240 -ss 59 -endpos 15
mencoder video1.avi -ofps 25 -o clip2.avi -oac lavc -ovc lavc -vf scale=320:240 -ss 14 -endpos 3
</pre>

<p>In the above example, <tt>clip1.avi</tt> is taken from
<tt>video3.avi</tt>, starting at 59 seconds in (the <tt>-ss
59</tt>) and lasting 15 seconds (the <tt>-endpos 15</tt>).
<tt>clip2.avi</tt> is taken from <tt>video1.avi</tt>,
starting at 14 seconds and lasting 3 seconds.  We specified
a value for the output frames per second (<tt>-ofps 25</tt>)
and the pixel size of the output video (<tt>-vf
scale=320:240</tt>) to make sure that all our clips will
have the same pixel size and frame rate, which is necessary
to make sure they can be put together properly.</p>

<p>After running <tt>mencoder</tt> for each clip, it is
advisable to use <tt>mplayer</tt> to view the resulting clip
and check that its start and stop points were just right.
If not, you may have to re-run the <tt>mencoder</tt> command
with adjusted values (add a half-second here, subtract a
half-second there) until you're happy with the result.</p>

<H2>Check the framerates</H2>

<p>In some cases, in addition to <tt>-ofps</tt>, you may
also have to specify an <tt>-fps</tt> value (best put near
the beginning of the <tt>mencoder</tt> command) to make sure
that the <em>input</em> frames per second is read correctly;
for example some FLV videos need <tt>-fps 24</tt>.  If the
input frames per second is not read correctly, after a while
the picture will run ahead of the sound if the FPS is too
high, or will lag behind the sound if the FPS is too low.
Even if the clip is very short, a wrong FPS could result in
the <em>next</em> clip starting the picture before the sound
or vice versa.  So when playing each clip, check that the
sound finishes at exactly the same time as the picture
finishes.  Thankfully mplayer usually gets the input FPS
value right by itself, but it's worth knowing about this for
when it doesn't.</p>

<p>You may also want to check that the output frames per
second (<tt>-ofps</tt>) value you provide is actually being
obeyed by <tt>mencoder</tt>.  Sometimes <tt>mencoder</tt>
has to adjust it to cope with the constraints of whatever
output format you're using.  If you look at
<tt>mencoder</tt>'s textual output, toward the end there
will be a line beginning <tt>Video:</tt> which will include
the number of seconds and the number of frames in the output
video; divide the frames by the seconds to get the frame
rate.  Synchronization might work slightly better if you
then choose an approximation of this new value as your
preferred <tt>-ofps</tt> value.  (Don't pay any attention to
the "fps" values that are incrementally printed by
<tt>mencoder</tt>; these are merely telling you how fast
<tt>mencoder</tt> is doing the conversion, not the actual
running speed of the film.)</p>

<H2>Putting the clips together</H2>

<p>When you are happy with all the component clips, you need
to combine them into the final video in order.  This is done
with a final <tt>mencoder</tt> command, for example:</p>

<pre>
./mencoder clip1.avi clip2.avi clip3.avi -o result.avi -oac lavc -ovc lavc
</pre>

<p>Then check that the <tt>result.avi</tt> file plays using
<tt>mplayer</tt> and that you are happy with it.  Sometimes
(perhaps due to floating point rounding errors in
<tt>mencoder</tt>) the video will run ahead of the sound in
the final result even if all the individual clips are in
step; if the final <tt>mencoder</tt> frequently reports
<tt>Skipping frame!</tt> then this may happen.  If it does,
you can experiment with the <tt>-fps</tt> option on
<tt>mplayer</tt> to find the framerate that synchronizes
sound and video, and then run an additional <tt>ffmpeg</tt>
command to adjust the framerate to that speed, for
example:</p>

<pre>
ffmpeg -r 23 -i result.avi -sameq -ab 224k corrected-result.avi
</pre>

<p>where 23 is the framerate you found that best
synchronizes to the audio, and 224k is the audio bitrate in
use (you can change this at this stage if you
like). <tt>ffmpeg</tt> seems to be better at making this
adjustment than <tt>mencoder</tt>.  Don't be tempted just to
add the new <tt>-fps</tt> to the above final
<tt>mencoder</tt> command instead, because in some cases
doing that can result in the inclusion of extra audio from
outside your original clipping points.  Re-check the
adjusted result with <tt>mplayer</tt>, and if necessary try
repeating the <tt>ffmpeg</tt> command with a slightly
different framerate.</p>

<h3>VMworld 2010</h3>

<p>
You can still catch the end of VMworld 2010 US, which is also just weeks
ahead of VMworld Europe in October. The conference theme is "Virtual Roads,
Actual Clouds" and will feature more than 170 unique breakout sessions
which focus on reducing IT complexity and enabling IT as a Service through
virtualization and cloud computing.  If that piques your techie interest,
consider catching live and on-demand keynote presentations available via
webcast at <a href="http://www.vmware.com/go/vmworld-general-sessions">http://www.vmware.com/go/vmworld-general-sessions</a>.
</p>

<p>
VMware will host its second Technology Exchange track for developers as
part of VMworld. This three-day event is open to all developers.  With
beginner and advanced levels, these sessions provide in-depth views of
developer tools, APIs, best practices, and, of course, cloud architectures.
</p>

<p>
This is a premium conference, as the registration rates show.  Expect a
great conference bag, great grub, interesting vendors with cool swag at the
Expo, and interesting people sitting next to you.  The VMworld 2010 agenda
is available at <a href="http://www.vmworld.com/community/conferences/2010/agenda/">http://www.vmworld.com/community/conferences/2010/agenda/</a>.

</p>

<h3>Intel Developer Forum</h3>

<p>
Coming up next in mid-September is the Intel Developer Forum (IDF). This
conference features  more than 150 technical sessions presented by Intel
and industry experts. The tracks cover topics like Cloud Computing,
Eco-Technology, Extending Battery Life, and High Performance Computing
(HPC).  there are also product tracks on Intel processors, solid-state
drives, visual computing and new SuperSpeed USB (USB 3.0) standard.
</p>

<p>
Beside the informal Chalk Talks from previous IDFs with Intel experts, IDF
2010 will also have Poster Chats, informal gatherings where researchers and
developers show the directions of their latest projects giving
attendees the opportunity to hear about  technology still early in the
development stage.  This is both a hardware and a software conference, and the
sessions vary greatly in technical depth.  Some are expert-only, some are
product-oriented and may be presented by Intel parnters - look at the talk
summaries and the speaker company information.
</p>

<p>
And here is a similar link for content from IDF Beijing 2010 in April:

<a href="http://www.intel.com/idf/library/library-beijing-2010.htm">http://www.intel.com/idf/library/library-beijing-2010.htm</a>
</p>

<p>
In particular, let me point to the IDF 2009 Day 2 Keynote from Dadi
Perlmutter on the total mobile experience.  He showed the die-size
progression for mainline processors and also for the low-power (in both
senses) Atom chip family down to 15 nm.  Then he discussed the dream
criteria for mobile devices, which are all on Intels product map, natch:
</p>

<ul>
<li> built-insecurity (so thats why they bought McAfee)
<li> ease of use and networking
<li> long battery life
<li> and all in a lightweight package at a low cost...
</ul>

<p>
Didi and  Mooley Eden did a chip booster session, starting with the high
end Core i7 quad-core. Right, not exactly a chip for all-day battery use,
but he did highlight how core idling down to 2 and even 1 core (in the
newest processors) could drop power consumption significantly.
Basically, the quad-core Core i7 had similar performance at 45 watts to the
old single core Xeon chip which burned 150 watts. Thats one core to one
core.
</p>

<h3>Oracle Open World, and JavaOne</h3>

<img src="misc/dyckoff/wall.jpg" alt="Wall of Java"
align="left" style="margin-right: 50px; margin-bottom: 15px;" />


<p>
Finally, Oracle Open World (OOW)  arrives in late-September,  This year,
OOW rolls in the famous JavaOne conference to its stable of other user
conferences under the OOW umbrella.  That could mean several thousand more
developers attending an event which already has the population of a small
city, all struggling to to get to sessions at both JavaOne and Oracles own
Develop  mini-conference as well as sessions in other parts of downtown SF.
This could be interesting.  OOW is taking on the dimensions of COMDEX, but
without the noisey slot machines.
</p>

<p>
This years OOW is reported to have over 1800 sessions, including hundreds
of labs. And there could be almost 50,000 people competing with you for a
seat - just like COMDEX.
</p>

<p>
Expect some Open Source controversy over Oracles legal actions against
Google over Java patents at the 2010 Oracle Open World.  Apparently, these
concerns transcend Google's creation of its own JVM - the Dalvek VM - to
avoid licensing and certification issues.  So its "Clash of the Titans,"
San Francisco Bay Area style, and some of that may creep into the
conference sessions as well as the deluge of  Twitter posts.
</p>

<p>
In 2009, the big announcement was version 2 of the Oracle eXaData Database
Machine, based on Sun hardware.  And the hot topic was how Oracle would
shepherd - or dispose of - Sun's IP and product lines.  Oracle came out with
strong support for all of Sun's major product lines, especially Java and
MySQL. These topics will assuredly be visited again this year.
</p>

<p>
Since Oracle Open World is partly a customer appreciation event, the food
and conference bag are better than average.  Of course, the cost without
discounts is $2500.  You'd want something sensational for that.  In 2009, the
conference party included performances by AeroSmith, 3 Dog Night, and Roger
Daltry. Everybody felt like a VIP.
</p>

The 2009 OOW archive is not currently available, but the 2008 archive is.

Recently there were several OTN Virtual Developer Days (#OTNVDD) in the US,
India and China, but the presentations and labs are still available
on-line.  If you are a night owl, you can still register for the OTNVDD
scheduled on September 2nd for Russian developers.  Oracle provides over 2
GB of compressed VMDK files - this requires a machine with 2 GB of RAM and
at least 8 GB of free physical disk space. You can host all the provided
VM images with VirtualBox.
</p>

<p>
I'm sure that some of these items, or items similar to them, will be included in
OOW 2010.  Get access to the VDD materials here:<br>
<a href="http://wiki.oracle.com/page/OTN+Virtual+Developer+Day">http://wiki.oracle.com/page/OTN+Virtual+Developer+Day</a>.
</p>

<p>
Comparing the varied Virtualization strategies at these 3 events will be
interesting. VMware and Intel are partners, but so are Red Hat and Intel.
The Oracle/Sun conglomerate is also an Intel partner, but Oracle is a
proponent of Xen while Red Hat is staunchly behind KVM.  Maybe with Oracle
battling both Google and the whole Open Source community, Intel is
the one to watch.

<h1>Henry's Techno-Musings: Hotmail Change Prompts Switch to Linux</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/grebler.html">Henry Grebler</a></b></p>

<h3>Rumblings</h3>


<p>
Caller ID enabled me to answer the phone, "Hello, Home."
</p>

<p>
A short pause; then my wife's voice, "Hello, Work."
</p>

<p>
She always seems to be a little surprised by technology. And often
quite delighted. But not this time.
</p>

<p>
"I can't write emails," she continued.
</p>

<p>
I asked for more information. "Ok, I'll take a look."
</p>

<p>
Just then, Tri came into my pod, talking. I turned around. "I'm on an
important support call," I smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Tell 'em to put in a ticket."
</p>

<p>
"My customer is more important than that."
</p>

<p>
"I'll come back later."
</p>

<p>
My wife uses Hotmail for her email. I put her on speaker, and
navigated to hotmail.com.
</p>

<p>
"Hang on! This looks different! Where's my inbox? Wait a minute -
where's Hotmail!?" It was my turn to be non-plussed: I'm not good with
gratuitous change.
</p>

<p>
I ruminated, not for the first time, how users are full of
irrelevant details, but forever fail to mention the elephant
in the room. My wife is no better or worse than other users.
</p>

<p>
Typically my thinking goes something like this. I try to do
something; the behaviour I see is not as I expect. I fiddle
around a bit, just in case it is a spuron. Then I stop. When
did I do this last? Did it work ok then? Yes. What's changed?
</p>

<p>
So my mild hysteria when I got to the Hotmail page has nothing
to do with my inability to cope with change. All right, it has
<strong>everything</strong> to do with my inability to cope
with change. But 
it serves another purpose. It means that I notice that a
change has occurred. Consequently, when, soon after, I
encounter an unexpected response, I am encouraged to consider
a possible connection between the change and the unexpected
response.
</p> 

<p>
"Up the top." Our roles have changed; she has no problems with moving
the furniture around. Neither do my kids. Me - not so much.
</p>

<p>
I scanned the alien terrain. Nothing looked like a link to me - another
new fashion. Then I found it. I was taken to my inbox. I don't use my
Hotmail account all that often, but it looked unchanged.
</p>

<p>
When I clicked on <tt>New</tt>, I was presented with a screen which
looked unremarkable. I found I could enter a <strong>To:</strong> and
a <strong>Subject:</strong> - and so could my wife. However, when I
clicked on the body of the email, I got a cursor and could enter text;
she didn't, and couldn't.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to have to leave it until I get home," I told her. "I'm
sorry."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right. It can wait."
</p>

<h3>Home</h3>


<p>
When I got home that evening, things were pretty much as she'd
described them. No amount of clicking in the body of the email solved
the problem.
</p>

<p>
I tried Internet Explorer (yuk), but it also had problems. I tried
some other computers with different revs of Firefox.
</p>

<p>
When I tried Firefox 2.0.0.2, I got:
</p>

<pre class="code">
Upgrade your web browser
<br/>
We recommend that you upgrade your web browser so you can get the most
out of Windows Live Hotmail. Upgrading should only take a few minutes.
To get started, choose one of the browsers below: 
<br/>
    * Microsoft Internet Explorer
    * Mozilla Firefox
    * Google Chrome
    * Apple Safari
<br/>
If you don't want to upgrade right now you can still continue to use
Windows Live Hotmail, but some parts of it may not work and it may not
be displayed properly.
<br/>
</pre>

<p> Yet another piece of useful information my wife had omitted to
	report.
</p>

<p>

So, it looks like Hotmail knew what they were doing. Let me rephrase
that: it looks like the people at Hotmail were aware of the effects of
their changes.
</p>

<p>
When I went to the compose window, I could not enter text in the body
of the email.
</p>


<h3>Analysis</h3>


<p>
For some time I had been trying to move my wife from Windows 98 to
something else. Anything else. But she was comfortable with the
environment with which she was familiar. 
</p>

<p>
And I don't blame her one bit. It's one aspect in which we are
very much alike.
</p>

<p>
I still use <tt>olvwm</tt> as my window manager and am
prepared to go through hoops to have it on all the computers I
use. I can't always get what I want, but I do ok.
</p>

<p>
The one thing that drives me to distraction is the trend
amongst Linux distributions to pursue a Microsoft Windows look
and feel. Everything about Microsoft Windows is at odds with
what I want to do and how I want to do it. It's like trying to
get me to wear clothes intended for a creature with different
numbers of arms and legs from me: I can probably contort
myself to don the garb, but I will be so uncomfortable I won't
be able to achieve much.
</p>

<p>
But I digress.
</p>

<p>
I'm a good hubby: I try to give her what she wants. Even when it comes
to computers. So I considered how to get her back her Hotmail.
</p>

<p>
I could install the latest Firefox (version 3.something). No, I
couldn't: it does not support Windows 98.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps we could move her to Google mail. This is still an option.
</p>

<p>
I could install some form of X server on her machine, and have her run
Firefox on my machine, displayed on her machine. This is still an
option, but I have not (yet) found an X server which supports Windows
98. I am prepared to search further.
</p>

<h3>Interim Solution</h3>

<p>
While I'm navigating these options, what's she going to use for email?
Well, I'm not saying I've got the best solution, but it was fairly
straightforward for me to fire up Firefox 3 in a VNC server on my BSD
machine; and start a VNC client on her machine. Hey, presto! She can
use Hotmail.
</p>

<p>
It's all very recent. I'm dying to hear her feedback. Stay tuned.
</p>

<h3>Evil Grin</h3>

<p>
But I think I have a better idea. I think I'm detecting that this is,
for her, the last straw. I think that she is resigned to migrating to a
different platform. And if the platform is on the table, guess what
else is on the table? Yep: Linux.
</p>

<p>
Because the case is so hard to refute. First of all she knows that she
has support. She can call her Help Desk (as she did at the start of
this article) and be sure she will get great service. And she's been
around me long enough to know that I'm much better at supporting Linux
than I am at supporting Microsoft Windows. Hell, it's what I do!
</p>

<p>
So the good news is that Microsoft (owner of Hotmail) may be the
motivation for her to move to Linux. Don't you just love the irony?!
</p>

<p>
What's the opposite of "Conclusion"?
</p>


<h3>Stay Tuned</h3>

<p>
It was my intention to have this all wrapped up a couple of weeks ago.
I hoped to have moved my wife to a Linux platform and present a neatly
packaged article for all to savour.
</p>

<p>
Sadly, that hasn't happened.
</p>

<p>
Real life (the bit that intrudes into my writing time) has prevented
me from producing a happy ending. So far.
</p>

<p>
I'm scared that the relevance of the subject matter will attenuate
with the passing of time.
</p>

<p>
Here's what's happened recently. My wife is using the interim
solution. It is much less user friendly than I had expected, but
bearable. Just.
</p>

<p>
I was able to fire up Ubuntu (not the latest) off a CD on another
computer and let her try to use Firefox. Her response was extremely
encouraging, the experience very positive.
</p>

<p>
With a bit of luck, I will be able to report back next month.
</p>

<p>
Stay tuned.

It's a well-known fact: if you've just bought a sky-blue Nissan Sentra with
a spoiler, black-and-gold pinstripes, and whitewall tires, you're suddenly
going to start seeing that exact car all over the place. It's as if
everybody in the world read your mind, and shamelessly STOLE your brilliant
idea of what's in style! Although before you start ranting about Those Idiots
and using the top row of characters on your keyboard to describe them in
detail, get this: <em>It's Not Them. It's You.</em>
</p>

<p>
What I mean here is this: those cars have been there all along. The only
difference is that your attention has now been focused by your baby, the
best car you've ever bought, the coolest chick-magnet... well, you get the
point. As long as you're in your honeymoon period with your new purchase,
your brain will instantly snap-focus on all those factors in a given street
scene - something that you would normally tune out of your consciousness,
at least the parts that don't offer you a specific benefit or threat.
That's how we humans operate.
</p>

<p>
In that vein, and with a nod of recognition to our wonderfully-selective
perceptions, we present a few images that should warm the heart of any
geek. Enjoy - and if you should happen to have a few similar snapshots of
your own, please <a href="mailto:editor@linuxgazette.net">send them to

<h1>Common problems when trying to install Windows on KVM with virt-manager</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/silva.html">Anderson Silva</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>Let me start with a very basic question: why, oh why, would anybody want to run 
Windows on their Linux workstation? A web developer could argue that they need a
 way to test their applications on multiple versions of Internet Explorer. A 
system administrator could argue that they need a sandbox to test an email client
 like Outlook, or play around with integrating a Windows workstation into their 
network. In my case, I want a Windows virtual machine on my laptop because I 
want to be able to watch movies on Netflix. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)" />
</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with KVM, I would recommend that you take a look at the 
following guides before you read these tips:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If you are running Fedora: 
<a href="http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/13/html/Virtualization_Guide/">http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/13/html/Virtualization_Guide/</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    If you are running Ubuntu: 
<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The following is a set of tips and quick fixes I've collected over the last 
few months to get a Windows XP installation working under KVM being managed by 
virt-manager. Some of these tips will work for other versions of Windows, as 
well as for other Linux distributions other than Fedora 13 (my current 
distribution).</p>

<h3>Tip #1</h3>

<p>Before you even install the KVM, libvirt, and virt-manager packages, check your 
BIOS setting. Some computers, like Intel-based Lenovo Thinkpads, have a 
'Intel (R) Virtualization Technology' option turned off. You must turn that 
on for virtualization to work.</p>

<h3>Tip #2:</h3>

<p>Set selinux to permissive mode, or turn it off completely.</p>

<p>To do this:&nbsp; edit /etc/selinux/config and change the SELINUX 
parameter.</p>

<h3>Tip #3:</h3>

<p>
If you are going to install Windows from a CD/DVD (instead of an ISO file), make
 sure that the user which you are running virt-manager as, has read access to the 
optical drive device on your system. Otherwise, virt-manager may not let you 
select your drive as an install media location.</p>

<p>
<img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_92h2rkmfhm_b.jpg" style=HEIGHT:464.94px;WIDTH:648px alt="Screenshot - New VM creation">
</p>

<h3>Tip #4:</h3>

<p>During the installation of Windows XP (as far as I know it doesn't happen with 
Vista or 7), the error "A disk read error occurred" shows up during boot time, 
not allowing you to complete the installation. The problem here is that for 
whatever reason, virt-manager by default creates disk images using the raw 
format, and the Windows XP installer does not like that format. The solution is 
to convert your disk image to qcow2 format.</p>

<p>
<img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_93drjvkrfs_b.jpg" style=HEIGHT:463.32px;WIDTH:648px alt="Screenshot - A disk read error occurred">
</p>

<p>
To convert your existing image:
</p>
<pre class="code">
cd /var/lib/libvirt/images/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # or whatever other location you 
keep your images at
qemu-img xp.img -O qcow2 xp-qcow2.img
</pre>
<p><b>Note 1:</b> You may have to start the installation process again, and 
re-format the disk, after converting the image to qcow2 format.</p>
<p><b>Note 2: </b>Under Fedora 13, I've tried creating qcow2 disk images before 
starting the installation via virt-manager, but I got the same "A disk read 
error occurred" problem.</p>

<h3>Tip #5:</h3>

<p>Once Windows is installed, if you are not able to increase the screen 
resolution of your virtual machine, check the virtual video driver that your virtual 
machine is using. If it is not the 'vga' model, change it, and re-start your 
virtual machine.</p>

<p>
<img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_94dt89jnfq_b.jpg" style=HEIGHT:464.13px;WIDTH:648px alt="Screenshot - Windows Display Properties">
</p>

<h3>Tip #6:</h3>

<p>This tip, for whatever reason, was the one that took me the longest to figure out.
 It took long not because it was a hard problem, but mostly because I was 
looking at it from the wrong angle. As I said in the beginning of this article, I wanted
 a Windows virtual machine on my laptop to watch movies, and even though I did 
get Windows installed, I could not get the sound working on it.</p>

<p>One of the most frequent answers I found on the web was about exporting the 
variable QEMU_AUDIO_DRV with different parameters to get the sound working 
correctly, but none of the parameters worked for me. I also read that at least 
in Fedora, vnc doesn't support audio, which basically meant that I needed to find 
another way to view my desktop. That's when I decided to shift gears and look at
 SDL instead of vnc.</p>

<p>To do that, the following must be done:</p>

<p><img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_95g9js3hht_b.jpg" style=HEIGHT:464.13px;WIDTH:648px alt="Screenshot - Hardware Details">
</p>

<p>1. Remove the 'Display 0' property under Hardware Details, and add a new Graphic
 Device using 'Local SDL Window' instead of VNC Server.</p>

<p><img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_96dhxczpqw_b.jpg" style=HEIGHT:463.32px;WIDTH:648px alt="Screenshot - Add a new Graphics Device">
</p>

<p>2. Edit the /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf, and get qemu-kvm to run as your user:</p>
<pre class="code">
user = "ansilva"

<p>3. Restart libvirtd:</p>
<pre class="code">
service libvirtd restart
</pre>

<p>Now, if you open up virt-manager, and start up your Windows virtual Machine, it 
should show up as a separate window outside the virt-manager GUI.</p>

</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Hopefully, these six tips will be enough for you to get your Windows virtual 
machine running well enough under KVM and virt-manager, so you can do your work 
or even have your fun. I highly recommend that you also take a look at the command 
line tool virsh for managing your virtual machines, which could easily be the 
subject for an entire new article in the near future. Stay tuned.</p>

<em>
<p>
Born September 22, 1969, in Gardena, California, "Penguin" Pete Trbovich
 today resides in Iowa with his wife and children. Having worked various
 jobs in engineering-related fields, he has since "retired" from
 corporate life to start his second career. Currently he works as a
 freelance writer, graphics artist, and coder over the Internet. He
 describes this work as, "I sit at home and type, and checks mysteriously
 arrive in the mail."
</p>

<p>
He discovered Linux in 1998 - his first distro was Red Hat 5.0 - and has
 had very little time for other operating systems since. Starting out
 with his freelance business, he toyed with other blogs and websites
 until finally getting his own domain penguinpetes.com started in March
 of 2006, with a blog whose first post stated his motto: "If it isn't fun
 for me to write, it won't be fun to read."
</p>

<p>
The webcomic <em>Doomed to Obscurity</em> was launched New Year's Day,
 2009, as a "New Year's surprise". He has since rigorously stuck to a
 posting schedule of "every odd-numbered calendar day", which allows him
 to keep a steady pace without tiring. The tagline for the webcomic
 states that it "gives the geek culture just what it deserves." But is it
 skewering everybody but the geek culture, or lampooning geek culture
 itself, or doing both by turns?
