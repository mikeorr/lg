Hello everyone.
</p>

<p>
I just finished installing/configuring squid on a Ubuntu 8.10 server,
and im having the following problem:
</p>

<p>
Clients time-out when trying to access any webpage - access.log gives me:
<pre>
179383 192.168.0.1 TCP_MISS/504 2898 GET <a href='http://www.google.com/'>http://www.google.com/</a> -
DIRECT/209.85.193.104 text/html
</pre>

<p>
after reading about it, i thought adding no_cache allow localnet to my
squid.conf file would fix the problem, but it doesnt (I already have
an ACL saying localnet = 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 and an http_access
allow localnet in the same config file)
</p>

<p>
Anyone know what might be the problem?
</p>

<p>
Thanks
Deividosn

I get paid to work with Squid, alas.  It means that there wasn't an
entry for it in Squid's cache at the point squid tried to serve the
page to you.  Generally you would fix this by rebuilding Squid's
cache, as in:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
squid -z -S
</pre>

Already did that - just did it again just incase, and it said all
folders already exist (/var/spool/squid3/0X exists) - my cachedir is
configured as cache_dir ufs /var/spool/squid3 2048 16 256 btw.
</p>

<p>
Im guessing it is not forwarding the request (actually caching the
files) - how can i check for that? or thats nonsense?

<p>
Right.  In that case it's likely a firewall issue.  Squid still
listens on port 8080 by default -- is that even open?  At this point I
would want to see your squid.conf file (grep -v '^#' squid.conf first
though, please!) and your cache.log file for squid.

<p>
It worked.
</p>

<p>
Basically my proxy was configured to use another proxy (internet -&gt;
old proxy -&gt; new proxy -&gt; client) - that required authentication and
everything - looks like that wasnt working alright (not sure what was
wrong tho), but when i changed the proxy im configuring to another ip,
bypassing the old proxy (that will be retired soon), all worked fine
