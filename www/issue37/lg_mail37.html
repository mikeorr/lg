Subject: <font color="maroon">Set up Linux as server</font> 
<P>
I am planning to buy a Linux version to use for a server i am setting
up.
The main things I want to have Linux do is ask as a proxy, a mail and a
fax server.
<P>
Linux will be running on a PC together with windows 95 and handles all
the outgoing faxes, all e-mail communications (internal and external).
Also these users have to have the possibility to to on the Internet by
means of the proxy server.
<P>
Last wish I have is a graphical interface to work with as I am a novice
but I still want to set up this system and maintain it.
What Unix version is the best, easiest (red hat, Susie, or Debian)
<P>
Can you tell what I need as a basis and what additional packages I need
so that I can order it.

I have an Ensoniq AudioPCI card and have been successful in getting it

TIMIDITY.

But I can't figure out how to get TRUE MIDI rendering like I get with the
same card in Windows 95.

Is this a driver issue?  Thanks,

Subject: <font color="maroon">Advanced Linux/Java Concepts</font> 
<P>
At my university, most new programming courses are taught in Java. 
Because of that, I have become quite apt in programming for such an 
environment. However, when the time comes that I have a great idea 
for and application for Linux, I feel somewhat bad about programming 
it in Java as it is not native to the system. I feel particularly 
left out when it comes to gathering information from the system. For 
instance, I am currently working on a set of Zip disk management tools 
and I have begun coding the core of the application in Java. Since 
Java is the only language where I have any real experience 
programming a GUI, I plan on using the Swing widget set to make a 
slick GUI. Anyway, to manipulate the Zip disks, I make several calls 
to basic system functions like umount, mount, eject. While this is 
fine for simply manipulating the disk, I would also like to gather 
information about the disk... such as, is there a disk in the drive, 
is it already mounted, etc... Can you see where I'm going. Although 
Java can do quite a bit, Its platform independence seems to limit it. 
I would like to know if there is a Java package designed for use with 
Linux that can provide me information about the system. Or, if that 
does not exist, does anyone know of a simple, effective method of 
gathering information from the system? Maybe parsing output from 
other Linux utilities??
Thanks

Subject: <font color="maroon">Getting started with programming for Linux</font> 
<P>
Although I am a somewhat experienced programmer, I find myself wanting 
to know more about programming for Linux. I have a little C under my 
belt as well as C++ and a lot of Java (from university classes) and 
I'm just learning Perl. I am 
very interested in programming for Linux (specifically X), but I 
don't know where to start. I don't know enough C to begin fiddling 
around with other people's source, so I'd like a general introduction 
to programming for Linux (how to interact with the system, how to 
program a GUI using GTK, QT, etc..., and how to write Window Maker 
docklets). However, seeing as how I have only a little knowledge of 
C, if there is an introduction which provides said things along with 
intermediate C programming, that would be the best. Does something 
like this exist and would the O'Reilly X books be of any use at this 
stage in my development?
Thanks again,

<P>
I had been trying to set up a PPP connection from my Red Hat 5.2 box at
home to various ISPs.  It was so problematic, I ended up writing a
script that would begin dialing and fork an xterm with a 'tail -f
/var/log/messages' so I could watch it fail.
<P>
I ironed out all the bugs in my chat script (Linux would be no fun if
everything worked perfectly out of the box!), and pppd would connect -
but it would then bomb out.
<P>
The messages were always the same before pppd died :
<P>
pppd[xxx]: Serial connection is not 8-bit clean.
pppd[xxx]: Problem: bit 7 always 0.
<P>
So it looks like a serial problem.  But I haven't found a fix with
'setserial' or anything in my BIOS, or in the PPP setup.  My guess is
it's something incredibly simple that I'm just completely overlooking,
but no one else that I know can figure it out, either.
<P>
If anybody knows the answer to this problem, I'd really like to hear it

2) As for the articles content I have one issue I think should be
brought up when the "open-source" licenses are discussed. And that is the
fact that these licenses are a bigger threat to the free software
community than proprietary software. Most of these licenses makes it
impossible to reuse code and they undermine the success criteria that
GPL/LGPL and BSD licenses gives open source software, by enabling
anybody to modify or include code or complete software packages in their
own software. If these types of licenses are allowed to be accepted as
just as good, the best scenario we might hope for is that anybody making
free software "just" have to include 20 different licenses with the
software witch have to consist of 15 different patches.
I hope SSC through their publications takes care not to support such a
development.
<P> 
Sincerely,<BR>

Subject: <font color="maroon">Destroying the Kernel Compiling Myth</font> 
<P>
Once again we find an
article propagating the myth of kernel compiling (the one written by a guy from
India).  Problem is that since 1996 benefits of this are nearly nil in a well
designed distribution.
<P>
I think this myth is very harmful to Linux: as long as there will be people
claiming
"Thou hast to recompile thee kernel" it will be impossible to attract
non-hackers to Linux.  That means confining Linux into a _small_ programmer's
ghetto.
<P>
The MIME attachment is an <A HREF="./martinez.html">analysis</A> of the benefits of compiling a 2.0 kernel. It
is based on performance measures, simple maths and source reading. 
Quantitative analysis shows there are ways far more effective for optimizing a
Linux box.  I talk about them but that should be developed.   The text will be
part of the Independence distribution. If you think it is not acceptable
for <I>LJ</I> to
publish something that will be on a web site in a few days then publish on
<I>Linux Gazette</I>.

Subject: <font color="maroon">Make Linux Better, Yet!</font> 
<P>
I am happy with your site. I am suggesting some improvements to Linux
itself which would make it the enterprise software of the next decade.
<P>
1. Give Linux full journaling, unlimited file-size, and scalable
multiprocessor support.
Whether using ext2 with new 64-bit fs, or writing an integrated driver
for making ufs, or xfs, or ntfs, it does not matter.
<P>
2. Incorporate full IPV6 support. Incorporate complete networking
interfaces with NT, Novell, Mac, other UNIX systems. A lot of support is
already there, but I am particularly interested in Network Directory
Service type support and Domain control support with one login.
<P>
3. Fully integrated KDE desktop environment - when you install
application software, it should be on the desktop and automated for
dummies. Not everyone is a hacker. But everyone who uses computers for
the sake of interests other than the computer itself (unlike many of us
Linux geeks), should be able to download and install any application
without having to read an inordinate amount of documentation or worry
about configuration files (unless, of course, we enjoy that sort of
thing).
<P>
4. Multi configuration automation for distinct uses - e.g. an
enhancement like Red Hat's for various types of use: server, router,
desktop workstation, database server, etc.
<P>
5. Software that deliberately aims at inter-operability with file
formats generated by Microsoft, Apple, and other popular software
applications.
<P>
6. These goals can easily be achieved in the next year and make Linux
number one, with a combination of features to entice the most innovative
of hackers, and most mundane of end-users.
<P>
7. Tell me where to begin. If anyone else is interested in any one of
the above, I would like to collaborate.
<P>

Jim

Subject: <font color="maroon">Jan, 99 article Xwindows vs. w95/98/NT</font> 
<P>
first let me say that I love you :-)~ secondly in your article from Jan 199
entitled X Windows versus Windows 95/98/NT: No Contest, by  Paul Gregory Cooper.
he states that that...
<blockquote> 
	"Windows95/98/NT on the other hand is a different kettle of fish. 
	Here the OS, GUI, WM, and desktop aren't clearly
	separated (as in UNIX) but are all rolled into one. Thus you have
	whatever choice Microsoft happen to give you, i.e.
	windows themes. 
</blockquote> <blockquote> 
	For Microsoft this is an advantage - it stops people butting in and
	rewriting parts of their OS which could potentially lose
	them money. For instance they realized that with the old windows 2/3.1
	you could simply replace MS DOS with another
	compatible DOS such as DR DOS from Caldera. In an ongoing court case
	Caldera allege that MS added code to windows
	to make it seem like there was a bug in DR DOS. With 9*/NT being all
	rolled in one there is no need to resort to such tactics. "
</blockquote> 
While I agree that everything that this article states I would like to point
out that users of Windows 95/8/NT can indeed change there shell to a Afterstep
like interface called Litestep. 
<P>

I have not personally ever used but know ppl who have. And it doesn't look to
bad.

Here's a top tip: the popular X Window System is _not_ called `X
Windows'. There is no such product. Instead, the man page on X says:
<P>
       The X Consortium requests that the following names be used
       when referring to this software:
<P>
                                   X<BR> 
                            X Window System<BR>

I'd be overjoyed if we could ditch this M$-inspired mistake! ;-)

Subject: <font color="maroon">How about a cross platform section?</font> 
<P> 
    This is to the <I>Gazette</I> as well as <I>Linux Journal</I>. From what I've seen
in the industry, most businesses are using Linux in a heterogeneous
environment. They are doing this because they don't want to jump into
Linux with both feet. A lot of these are NT/Linux houses which leverage
the abilities of both platforms to get the job done. This could be
anything from a collection of tips to entire articles. I see NT/Linux
related questions and tips in almost every issue. Maybe its time they
were put in the same section. I even have an Idea for a logo or symbol,
Take a Yin Yang and put a Windows emblem in the space for the white dot
and a penguin for the black. The black background could be made to
resemble the NT workstation package with the "edge of space" graphic and
perhaps the penguin could be in an arctic scene.
<P> 
    This idea does not have to be limited to just Linux and NT, there
are connectivity issues for Apple, OS/2/Aurora, Novell and others.
<P>
Thanks for your time.

Quark Xpress was originally a Mac product.
<P>
I was unaware that it was ported to winferior systems.... Indeed it
would be very nice to have Quark under UNIX. From what I remember using
it (long time ago, old version!) it was a very nice, efficient and
powerful page design software.
