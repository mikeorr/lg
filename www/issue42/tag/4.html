I'm interested in a CHROOT option probably in pam-pwdb and I've
been unable to find it.  If it does not exist I may be willing to
implement it IF I can find the current source tree and IF I can
find out where to forward it for general use.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's an interesting question.  I presume you're talking
about implementing/re-implementing PAM support for an old
convention among SVR4 UNIX implementations where
specific accounts can be marked for special chroot
handling by giving them a '<tt>*</tt>' as the "login shell"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is described in O'Reilly &amp; Associates' 
<em><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/puis/noframes.html"
>Practical Internet and Unix Security</a></em>, p232, Garfinkel and Spafford
and most other books on UNIX security.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(For our readers that are unfamiliar with the trick: the
login program; upon seeing that the login shell for a given
account is set to '<tt>*</tt>' does a <tt>chroot()</tt> system call to the
directory that's listed as that account's "home" directory.
Therein '<tt>login</tt>' <tt>exec()</tt>'s the appropriate copy of 
'<tt>login</tt>' thereunder.  This normally would then <tt>exec()</tt> 
a normal shell, as listed in the /...(chroot top)...<tt>/etc/passwd</tt> file.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I was doing some research on a paper (that I still plan on
submitting to USENIX, one of these days) when I first
read about this convention.  My paper was on a completely
different use of <tt>chroot()</tt>, but I was doing a literature
search.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Naturally I tried this particular trick on one of my Linux
systems. It worked fine.  In fact I just tested it, as I
write this, on a new <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> 
2.1 installation that I've been playing with and it works there.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However on PAM based systems (using pluggable authentication
modules) --- notably on <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> 
4.x, 5.x and presumably the new 6.0 system as well as any where the 
admins have added Linux PAM after-the-fact --- it doesn't work.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I mentioned this in e-mail to Andrew Morgan, the maintainer
and co-ordinator of the PAM development project.  There is,
of course a listing for a pam_chroot module in the PAM
administrator's guide.  However, that doesn't do the same
sort of thing --- and there's no example of how you'd
use it to accomplish the same job.  It's also listed as
"unwritten."  I did run across a file at the following URL
that you might want to look at:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<A HREF="http://www.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/pre/forgotten/changeroot.tar.gz"
	>http://www.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/pre/forgotten/changeroot.tar.gz</A>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's from late 1997 and is only about 3K.  All it contains
is source to a simple command, a man page and a sample
configuration file.  It seems to be an alternative
implementation of the chrootuid program that Weitse Venema
wrote years ago (part of his '<tt>logdaemon</tt>' package).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This particular program (changeroot) seems to have nothing
to do with PAM.  I'd also guess (from the parent directory
name) that the code is not under active development.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Obviously, you could use something like chrootuid, or this
changeroot program or you could write a simple C program (or
even a PERL script) that would implement this procedure and
use a reference to that in lieu of the '<tt>*</tt>' that I've been
talking about.  In other words instead of an entry like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>guest:x:65533:65534:Jailed Guest:/usr/local/jail:*
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... where '<tt>login</tt>' spots the the '<tt>*</tt>', performs the 
<tt>chroot()</tt> to <TT>/usr/local/jail</TT>, and <tt>exec()</tt>'s 
the copy of <TT>/bin/login</TT> thereunder; we'd see something like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>guest:x:65533:65534:Jailed Guest:/usr/local/jail:/usr/local/sbin/jailsh
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... where <tt>jailsh</tt> is a hypothetical SUID root program that
performs these same steps.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This approach will work with any version of UNIX (so its
more portable).  Another advantage for Linux under a 2.2
kernel is that this hypothetical jailsh program could be
written to use the new "privileges" model (which are listed
in the sources under the "capabilities" misnomer --- but
let's not get into that peeve).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The disadvantage of this approach is that we have to write a
custom program (which I'm calling <tt>jailsh</tt>).  It has to run as
'root' (or with several rootly privileges, <tt>setuid()</tt>, and
<tt>chroot()</tt> at least).  I might toss together something for use
on one of my systems (I have in the past) --- but I'd be
very reluctant to publish those as solutions that anyone
else would trust.  I simply don't consider myself a
sufficiently experienced and skilled programmer to be
writing SUID root code for public consumption.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, this brings us back to your message.  <tt>chroot()</tt> jails are
not used much.  You'd expect them to see more widespread
use, but they they are a bit of a hassle to initially
configure (creating a suitable skeleton tree under the
target chroot point, getting the requisite shared libraries
and device nodes in place for your applications, etc.).  In
addition there are ongoing concerns that chroot jails are
too easy to break out of.  In cases where you want to
isolate a root/privileged program --- it's too easy for them
to chroot back out of the jail.  This concern may be
addressed by clever use of the new "privileges" features in
the 2.2 kernels.  However, since you're asking, I presume
you already have your application well considered.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It sounds like you are willing to contribute some code to
this.  So you might start with a small standalone program
(based on <tt>chrootuid</tt> or the <tt>changelog</tt> program listed above,
if their licenses are amenable to your needs).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><dl>
<dt>You can find chrootuid at:
<dd><code><A HREF="ftp://ftp.porcupine.org/pub/security/index.html"
	>ftp://ftp.porcupine.org/pub/security/index.html</A></code>
<dt>... and there's some some of GNU package called <tt>g2s</tt>

PAM pwdb is maintained by Christian Gafton.  The canonical
forum for discussions relating to PAM development is the
pam-list (<A HREF="mailto:pam-list@redhat.com"
	>pam-list@redhat.com</A>).  The canonical web site is
at:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BlockQuote><code>
<A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/pub/libs/pam"
	>http://www.kernel.org/pub/libs/pam</A>
</code></BlockQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... which is generally inaccessible (as kernel.org is the
master site for the Linux kernel --- which gets too much
traffic for a reasonable Internet connection).  So it
should be accessed through one of the mirrors.  The Linux
kernel crowd use a relatively simple and innovative
DNS trick to maintain a list of mirrors that we can use
without having to strain our memories.  Basically you can
use URLs of the form:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BlockQuote><code>
<A HREF="http://www.us.kernel.org"
	>http://www.us.kernel.org</A>
</code></BlockQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... to access a DNS round-robin collection of U.S. mirrors.
There are mirrors in many other countries and regions, from
Afghanistan (<tt><A HREF="http://www.af.kernel.org"
	>http://www.af.kernel.org</A></tt>) to Zimbabwe
(<tt><A HREF="http://www.zw.kernel.org"
	>http://www.zw.kernel.org</A></tt>).  (Yes, they just use the
ISO two letter country codes as a subdomain prefix).  Most
of these sites mirror the whole kernel.org FTP and web
trees.  If you have trouble connecting to one of the
sites, try again.  A check with '<tt>dig</tt>' lists about a dozen
U.S. mirror sites for www.us.kernel.org.  Any decent
resolver libraries will cycle through the available
addresses until one works (upon successive access attempts).
That's part of what allows the whole DNS round robin scheme to work).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
These carry sources and links to the many ongoing PAM module projects.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
But I digress. Getting back to PAM.  Personally I'm somewhat
disappointed in the Linux PAM project.  I've expressed this
to the list and I've discussed it with Christian Gafton in
person.  He and Andrew will probably be irritated to see
this published in Linux Gazette --- and they are invited to
compose and submit a rebuttal, or anything they like, to
the editors here.  (I've courtesy copied them on this e-mail).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
My principal complaint is that the PAM project seems to be
permanently stuck near version 0.6x.  It was at 0.57 about
two years ago.  The response on the mailing list (and
direction from Christian) when I raised this concern was:
"So what, it's just an arbitrary version number."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course I'm not a programmer or a distribution integrator;
I'm just a dumb user, admin and support guy <EM>and writer</EM> ---
so my opinion doesn't count for much.  However, it does get
published, so others can beat up on me when they disagree.
It seems to be that a version number of 0.x still connotes
"beta" --- not ready for production use to most people.  Red
Hat and <A HREF="http://www.caldera.com/">Caldera</A> are the 
only distributions that include integrated PAM support.  Many 
authentication dependent packages, like <tt>ssh</tt>, don't include 
PAM support "out-of-the-box" and it is non-trivial (read: "scary and
difficult") for an "average" Linux user or junior sysadmin
to install the PAM suite into an existing system.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As one example if you'd been using Debian, 
<A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">S.u.S.E.</A> or
<A HREF="http://www.slackware.org/">Slackware</A> for your application 
(with the chroot'd users) and you installed PAM, you'd probably be pretty 
distressed to find it suddenly broken.  <em>[ hint: don't log out until
you've attempted to access all your desirable services via the localhost
interface and gotten them visible again, minimally telnet or ssh.  Yes, I've
been there. -- Heather ]</em>  Granted, this whole '<tt>*</tt>' shell
chroot business is pretty obscure to the "average" user
or the "junior" sysadmin.  However, it is documented in
most books on Unix security (I reviewed about twenty books
at a couple of books stores with the words UNIX and security
in their titles --- over half of them described this
mechanism and several gave examples).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Another complaint that I have is that the existing PAM
deployment doesn't include S/Key or OPIE support, and
doesn't even include clear examples of how to add-in and
configure any form of pluggable OTP.  Given that network
password sniffing is one of the most common problems that
one might want to solve with PAM this seems like a pretty
significant omission.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The response to this on the list and in personal discussion
amounted to:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BlockQuote>
"that's crypto --- and the U.S. government black helicopters
are hovering over our heads ready to bomb Red Hat's offices
if they include anything like it."
</BlockQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(Yes, I'm paraphrasing).  Personally I think this is absurd.
Yes, the U.S. federal government's restrictions regarding
the "export" of cryptography software are an embarassment to
free people everywhere.  I'm personally ashamed of our
entire political process as a result of the ways in which
"my" government was repeatedly thwarted the popular will of
the people vis a vis cryptography.  However, S/Key and OPIE
are not cryptography.  They use hashes, fancy checksums, as
the basis for their authentication.  Specifically OPIE uses
MD5 by default.  (I guess that the spec for S/Key -- OPIE
allows for one to use alternative hash algorithms, MD2,
maybe SHA-1, etc.  I don't know the details on that).
Ironically the code for the standard UNIX password hashing
method, use your password and some "salt" as a 56-bit DES
key to "encrypt" a string of NULs, is far more easily
subverted into true cryptographic use than MD5.  Of course
both the conventional DES hashing and the MD5 code are
already in every major Linux distribution, and always have
been!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
One compromise would be to include DOCUMENTATION.  Give
us a URL that points to a script.  Have the script walk one
through the processing of fetching, installing, and
configuring pam_opie.  Granted it's not THAT difficult.  I
was able to perform the task by hand in about an hour.
However, it would probably take an "average" sysadmin about
twice that and it would probably take an "average" Linux
user about four times that.  Consequently it probably won't
happen in any significant number of sites.  So it just
doesn't get done at all.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(The argument that OPIE and other OTP, one-time-password
schemes, is an incomplete solution is also well considered.
It doesn't secure the connection so sniffing will still
reveal other confidential data, etc.  ssh IS a much better
solution.  The new <A HREF="http://www.xs4all.nl/~freeswan/">FreeS/WAN</A> 
ipsec implementation is also a much better approach.  However, 
there are enough people out there that can't or won't install 
strong cryptographic support that some stop gap is indicated.  
Providing smooth easy installation and configuration of OTP is 
one thing that PAM could do to address this problem).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
By far my biggest complaint about PAM is that it hasn't
delivered on its most important promise.  It doesn't put
Linux on par with <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</A>, and 
<A HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</A> for authentication.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
FreeBSD has supported S/Key compatible OTP "out-of-the-box"
for YEARS.  (Note: Walnut Creek, the largest distributor of
FreeBSD CDs and books and the major sponsor for FreeBSD
development hasn't been hit by the "black helicopters").
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Beyond just this discussion of OTP, FreeBSD's libraries have
provided seams shadow and MD5 password hashing for years.
Regardless of PAM I still bump into Linux applications that
fail to authenticate because they don't properly handle some
aspect of shadowing and MD5 checksums.  Just last week
one of my fellow techs at Linuxcare was fighting for a
couple of hours with that on a Yellow Dog (Linux for
PowerPC) installation at the office.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
That was the whole idea of the PAM project.  However, PAM
can't deliver on that promise until it attracts widespread
support from the application/utility writers that perform
authentication.  FreeBSD hides most of the details behind
their implemention of the standard library functions that
most programmers were already using to perform their
authentication (<tt>getpwent()</tt>, etc.).  We can't do that with
PAM and glibc --- but we need to straighten out this
mess eventually.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, I would welcome any new blood that got involved in the
PAM project.  I realize that Andrew will probably say:
"Quit your whining and turn in some code!"  That's fair
enough.  (However, as I've said before, you don't want to
see any C code from me, yet).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
PAM is an ambitious project.  It goes beyond Linux (in
an effort to implement standards that have been proposed
to the IETF by Sun and other vendors).  I realize that there
is some delay because these proposed standards are in draft
form and are still in flux (the XSSO, single-sign-on stuff
also seems to be languishing).   However, I'd still like to
see it deliver more in the near term.
