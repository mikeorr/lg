I don't know -- where can you get a Lemote desktop computer from?

And why <em>is</em> a raven like a writing desk (other than both having been
written on by Poe)?

Cheers,                      Notice:  The value of your Hofstadter's Constant 
Rick Moen                    (the average amount of time you spend each month 
rick@linuxmafia.com          thinking about Hofstadter's Constant) has just 
McQ!  (4x80)                 been adjusted upwards.

There is no answer to your riddle, even though I really want to know the
answer. What do you think the answer is? Hmmm, we had better put our thinking
hats on. More tea? Maybe that's the answer! 
</p>

<p>
Alice in Wonderland references aside, I've also heard these answers:
</p>

<p>
 - Because they both produce notes, but neither are known for their musical 
notes.
</p>

<p>
 - Because there is a B in both and a N in neither. (probably my favorite)

I don't think that "more tea" qualifies as an answer to Rick's question
in any sense. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Neither one of them is an air conditioner? Both are solid objects and
are subject to the laws of physics? Both begin and end with consonants?

Given the length of Poe's average story and the size of the average
raven, he must have been using tiny little letters... 
</p>

<p>
As to Don's original question: why not ask the Lemote-Loongson people
themselves? They're at '<a href='http://lemote.com'>http://lemote.com</a>', and they have a forum.
There's also a Dutch website called Tekmote (<a href='http://www.tekmote.nl'>http://www.tekmote.nl</a>) that
supposedly ships worldwide, but I know nothing else about them. Google
for more info, as always.
