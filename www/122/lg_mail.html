I recently set up a machine with Suse 9.2 and would like to go  online with
it. I purchased a Creative Labs Model DE-5621
Serial Modem to use with it but am in need of some kind of AOL  emulator to
be able to tie in to the AOL servers. In experimenting with the  machine, I can
hear it dial out and attempt connection but that's about it. Any
suggestions/souce for this emulation software. Thanks.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Sluggo] 
I haven't heard of any AOL client software for Linux.  If it doesn't
work with the standard 'ppp' package, you may have to try another
dialup ISP and access AOL through its website.  If you're having
trouble with your ppp configuration, post what configuration you have
and what exactly you hear from the modem.  You should hear a steady
tone from both sides, then it will go up and down in pitch, then turn
into a hissing sound.  But the speaker may be configured to shut off
at an earlier point.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I think ppp also has a debug mode that will show all the communication
with the server.  That may provide a clue where it's blocking.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Jimmy] 
I don't think AOL works with straight ppp. Heather mentioned a package that did what the querent is looking for a while back, but the closest I can find is this comment from Ben: "I have not yet run into an ISP to which I couldn't connect (AOL is neither an ISP <em>  nor  </em> anything that I want to connect to; I'd hate to wash my modem out with soap...)"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The best I can remember is that the site was mostly in French, and the name (shockingly) had something to do with penguins.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Pedro] 
Looking into the Ubuntu repositories for something related to AOL, I
have found "penggy". The
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/net/penggy">package page</a>
shows
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>connects to AOL via modem or TCP/IP

The project aims to be a full AOL client including all known access
methods like DSL, cable, TCP/IP or modem (with the modem-emulation of
linux via /dev/ttyI* ISDN, too).

Currently, only TCP/IP and modem is supported.

AOL connectivity uses PPPoE.  If you're stuck behind one with a Linux

Ethernet.

<BR>Question by The Answer Gang (tag from lists.linuxgazette.net)


<br>Answered By  Jimmy O'Regan

<P><STRONG>
Hi all. A bit of a "forgot my thinking hat" problem here....
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I recently purchased a Fostex MR8 digital recorder. I'd not try to go
into the recording business with this toy, but for playing around a home
with multitrack recording it's a fair bit of fun.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
This unit records onto compactflash cards, which I can load onto my
linux box from a card reader. No problems here.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
And, a program like audacity can read, modify and mix them. Again no
problem.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Unless the track is just a partial track with an offset. For example
(see the adl file below), I have recorded some tracks from the start of
the song. But, 2 tracks are just a little segment in the middle of the song.
</STRONG></P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/wanted/rainbow.adl.txt">rainbow.adl.txt</a></tt></p>
<P><STRONG>
I know that wav files can have offsets in them (I think), but it seems
from looking the the wav file headers that this isn't so here. And,
audacity certainly doesn't find the offset.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
So, when I load all 5 tracks into audacity tracks 1 and 2 are aligned to
the start of the song. They should really start about 40 seconds in. I
can move the tracks in the program, but I'll never get them aligned.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Jimmy] 
About 42 seconds in? Look at the end of the entries:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>00.00.42.05L0244        00.01.26.08L0254        _
      ^^^^^
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
My guess is the second time field is the length of the track.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Yes, I think that is correct. I have no idea what the stuff after the
"L" is.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Jimmy] 
Pan settings, maybe, or volume?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks for offering to look up the wav stuff. I'm thinking that if I can
get this figured out it'd be easy enuf to write a little program to
"fix" the files as they are copied from the CF card. Right now I'm
copying all the files, including some junk files. But, it'd be easy to
read the text file for the filenames, etc.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Jimmy] 
Ecasound would probably be better than Audacity for this: it's a
command-line based multitrack editor: <A HREF="http://eca.cx/ecasound"
	>http://eca.cx/ecasound</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
But, wait, the MR8 seems to keep track of stuff in a file. I think that
the data in the &lt;EVENT_LIST&gt; section is what I need to look at. But, I'm
not sure just what the different fields mean. Anyone with some
experience here?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I do know that the files MR80009.WAV, MR80003.WAV and MR80004.WAV are
recording of the complete song and MR80011.WAV and MR800012.WAV are
partials.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Guess what I'm asking is help in modifying the 2 files to push them into
the correct position.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Jimmy] 
I'll get back to you on that. I can't think of it off the top of my
head, and it's too late to look now, but I'll look at it tomorrow.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Jimmy] 
Doh! Use the time shift tool (the one that looks like this: &lt;-&gt
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=";)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> and
drag the tracks into place. IIRC, if you set a mark on the timeline
before you import the tracks it'll put them at that time.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Yes, I tried that but was unable to align the 2 to the point of making
it sound okay. One track was just a bit late or early. Maybe my mouse is
to shakey. Unfortunately there doesn't appear to be anything to "align"
to. And, even if I got this working once, I'd have to have to do a 2nd
time

<BR>Question by The Answer Gang (tag from lists.linuxgazette.net)


<br>Answered By  Thomas Adam

<P><STRONG>
Hey, I was going to send a message about how pleased I was with my
newest toy that "just worked" ...
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Got a MIDIsport UNO midi interface. This plugs into a USB port and
drives a MIDI keyboard. Got it and plugged it in and (to someone really
expecting to do a bunch of manual editing of config files) I found that
the alsa drivers found it, registered, etc.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Cool! Now I have a 2nd midi port.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Then I decided to clean up some cable runs and powered off the computer.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
When I rebooted, the new MIDI port was gone. Huh??? Checked the
cables...and listed <TT>/proc/bus/usb/devices</TT> ... yes, all there. But, ALSA
doesn't know about it.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
So, I plugged the MIDIsport in and out ... and it works again.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
So, ALSA finds it on hotplug, but not boot. What's going on?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
BTW, to this point I have not edited any config files 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Thomas] 
Order of operations, most likely.   It's likely that ALSA is loading
after hotplug has finished, which means it might not be aware of the
device.  You can restructure your init sequence, or simply recall
<TT>/etc/init.d/hotplug</TT> to rerun at the end of init, assuming this really is
the reason.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
That was my first guess. And I've done a bit of testing, etc. and have
discovered that the device is found and registered at boot. The
interesting part is that if I use alsamixer right after boot it shows
the MIDI-Uno-USB device (alsamixer is just grabbing info from
<TT>/proc/asound/cards</TT>). But, the device is NOT there to use. Trying to use
it generates an error; and 'aconnect' doesn't show it.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Thomas] 
What error?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<pre><strong>bob$ aplaymidi -p72 midifile.mid
Cannot connect to port 72:0 - Invalid argument
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
Not the most helpful 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/unsmily.gif" ALT=":(" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> But, the port isn't there, so it makes sense.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
However, plugging the unit in/out again shows it up.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I'm wondering if a modprobe to something might force a registration. I
did try 'modprobe usb-midi' but no results there.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Thomas] 
No results where?  modprobe, if it is successful won't return any
output.  It's 'lsmod' that will help you here.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
I was hoping that modprobe might reset something?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Okay, doing a lsmod before and after the little guy is working does show
up something which might point to the problem:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
Before a plugin/out (after boot) we have:
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>soundcore               7008  2 snd,usb_midi
usbcore               108348  7
         snd_usb_audio,snd_usb_lib,usb_midi,usblp,ehci_hcd,uhci_hcd
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
Afterwards, there is an additional line:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>audio                  44032  0
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
And the others have changed to:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>soundcore               7008  3 audio,snd,usb_midi
usbcore               108348  8
        audio,snd_usb_audio,snd_usb_lib,usb_midi,usblp,ehci_hcd,uhci_hcd
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
Really, just the difference in all this is that the 'audio' module has
been added.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Also, there is a file <TT>/proc/asound/cards</TT> which does not change between
no-work and work:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>cat /proc/asound/cards
0 [AudioPCI       ]: ENS1371 - Ensoniq AudioPCI
                     Ensoniq AudioPCI ENS1371 at 0xec00, irq 10
1 [Interface      ]: USB-Audio - USB Uno MIDI Interface
                     M-Audio USB Uno MIDI Interface at
   usb-0000:00:10.1-1, full speed
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
Finally, the file <TT>/proc/asound/card1/midi0</TT> has changed from being an
empty file to:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>bob$ cat midi0
USB Uno MIDI Interface

  Tx bytes     : 197

<P><STRONG>
More thoughts?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
BTW, on Mandriva 2006 there is NO <TT>/etc/init.d/hotplug</TT> 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> I have no idea
when this stuff is being done. I think there might be some clues in

It makes no sense speaking of KDE 3.5 having particular hardware
requirements, since it is a suite of software running at a level
far above the level of hardware drivers.  If you mean "What's a
reasonable minimum amount of RAM to have, so that a default
configuration of KDE on Linux will seem OK?", then the answer is
probably around 256MB, which is based on experience with earlier
releases, but with the knowledge that it doesn't seem to change a lot
between releases.

<P>
My article on scanning drew responses from a couple of readers, one,
Emil Gorter, who copied you and whose suggestion I find well-done
and certainly worth making available for those wanting to archive
scans.
</P>
<P>
And Juhan Leemet politely pointed out that XSANE does, indeed,
have the function that I really wanted for use as a copier.  He
had a problem with it that he hadn't had time to resolve and I
then had the same for which I did find a work-around.  It is
tantamount to using your brakes instead of taking your foot off
the gas, so I don't want to suggest it to anyone.
</P>
<P>
But the bottom line is that using XSANE to copy directly from scanner
to printer can work quite nicely.

Hi Edgar,
</P>
<P>
I read your article <A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/121/howell.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/121/howell.html</A> and it
reminded me of a problem I had faced.  For my work I had to figure
out a way to scan and store contracts digitally.
The file-size issue was quite interesting with ++6000 pages to go 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</P>
<P>
I found that creating PDFs is quite easy, and gives very good
results.  Nice quality, great reduction in size.  Example:
</P>

<blockquote><pre> $ tiff2ps -2 -a Scan0001.tif | ps2pdf -sPAPERSIZE=a4 - &gt; Scan0001.pdf
 $ ls -1 --size -h Scan0001.*
 1.1M Scan0001.pdf
  25M Scan0001.tif
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
By the way, for practical reasons the scans were made with a Windows
machine..  Still have to try SANE myself someday.

<P>
I hope this helps!

<BR>Question by  ()

<P>
First of all, I would like to offer my most sincere apologies for the
negative way I portrayed the WinLibre installer projects. What I took to
be a duplication of effort was in fact three separate parts of a larger
system. Thanks to Noemi Tojzan for providing this corrected project list:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>     Finished projects:
         - installer (2 students)
         - updater (1 student)
         - control centre (1 student)
         - MacLibre (1 student)
         - 3 -original- games (3 students, 1 per game)
         - Final Touch (or Image Manipulation Tool) (1 student)

     Failed projects:
         - CDRoast GUI (1 student)
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
There were also inaccuracies in my list of Wine's projects. Thanks to
Kai Blin for providing a corrected list:
</P>

<blockQuote><ul>
<LI>Mozilla integration (that was correct)

<LI>Theming support (correct, too)

<LI>Force feedback support for dinput (this is more precise)

<LI>Single sign-on authentication using NTLM and other SSPI protocols
(NT-style authentication isn't quite this. Samba does that, not wine)

<LI>wire-compatible DCOM (no code, correct)

<LI>Active Server Pages (dropped, correct)
</ul></blockQuote>
<P>
Thanks to Patrick Walton for a list of LiveJournal projects:

Thanks to Meredith Patterson for pointing out that I had (originally)
listed Charun mistakenly instead of QBE
(<A HREF="http://pgfoundry.org/projects/qbe"
	>http://pgfoundry.org/projects/qbe</A>), to Ivan Beschastnikh for providing
the correct title to the Internet2 project I had listed as "User-space
transport": FB-FR-CCCP (<A HREF="http://fb-fr-cccp.sourceforge.net"
	>http://fb-fr-cccp.sourceforge.net</A>), to Jimmy
Cerra for pointing out two Semedia projects: SWAPI
(<A HREF="http://swapi.ourproject.org"
	>http://swapi.ourproject.org</A>) and SPARQL for various RDF databases
(<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sparql"
	>http://sourceforge.net/projects/sparql</A>), and to Anil Ramnanan for
pointing out an <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A> project: an Eclipse plugin for Apache Forrest.

I owe a rather sheepish apology to Oleg Paraschenko, one of the
Google-mentored students: I <EM>had</EM> found XSieve, but lost the details

<BR>Question by The Answer Gang (tag from lists.linuxgazette.net)

<P>
Hi I'm working on my Laptop again after a long while during which
it was just sitting in the corner. I found something in the old draft
folder -- And I've no idea if that ever got sent. So here you go....
</P>
<P>
Oh and a happy new year to everybody.
</P>

<blockquote><pre>&gt; Right at the moment, we've got a TAG discussion going on where I've
&gt; asked for input from everybody on the above topic. To restate it,
&gt; I'm looking at ways to bring LG onto a parallel course with Linux
&gt; itself: the OS is booming, but we're lagging. From my own perspective,
&gt; I see a need to modernize a bit; to consider the types of people now
&gt; entering the world of Linux (corporate and business users) and to
&gt; address their needs. "Amateur Linux user" does not, these days, mean
&gt; "amateur computer user".
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
lets start with history: I started out in TAG when many questions came
it on general install questions like partition setup, lilo tricks to
make it work, lost root passwords. As TAG is no newsgroups with expiring
articles after some time we had perfect in depth solutions to everything
in this category of FAQ. The level of discussion in TAG was slowly
moving up in complexity and/or detail of a particular problem. I got the
feeling even before the com-&gt;net switch that there is a little
stagnation in worthwhile topics and things I/we <EM>can</EM> answer. At the
beginning there were questions e.g. on network setup on a level I could
join in at least answering in part. It's quite a while that I've seen a
question I had any chance answering.
</P>
<P>
Others have suggested finding out wher new and current Linux users and
LG readers are and pick them up at their level and target their
interests. Pretty good idea, but I rarely use a GUI so I can not speak
of first hand experience. I just installed the brand new <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> 9.1 which
came along with a collection of spiffy K* applications from Mind mapper
to notes keeping and e.g. GTKtalog to catalog  CD contents.  Important
to me right now as I've a growing CD collection in CD storage bags and I
spend more and more time searching for a particular one. Well -- I read
in a bunch of CD's, program crashed twice so I pressed the save button
frequently. GUI interface is nice, pop in CD press a button, CD content
is archived. Next CD. A few days later I tried to open the archive --
program segfaults. I've still the XML export of the data.... rather
unreadable without a conversion program/frontend. My next try will
certainly be a bunch of "ls -R" files which I can grep. But it seems
this kind of solution is nothing we can sale to "the new TAG reader" as
they want "aesthetic solutions" as sombeody put it.
</P>
<P>
I agree  with that analysis BTW: from talking to people either having a
Linux on some second partition to considering installing one, they want
the perfect solution, GUI, everything away only a few mouse  clicks. And
they want pretty looking neat applications for everything.
</P>
<P>
My problem with that is: I don't have the answers, as the "nice neat
applictions" might not be there or at least I don't know of them. There
might be a need of new TAG/article writers for a new type of readers.
</P>
<P>
So the task at hand might be to attract new members to LG writing for
these new readers.
</P>
<P>
Many topics I was concerned with lately (Wlan, AMD64) are highly
specific, involve kernel patches and or/special distributions which are
not suitable for new comers to Linux.
</P>
<P><CODE>
Which leads me to a little question anyway: Is LG to be for newbies?
</CODE></P>
<P>
An idea anyway: By talking to people (here in Germany that is) more and
more are <EM>annoyed</EM> about the spam flood. It might hit here slightly
delayed compared to US, or maybe not. Well I was searching a bit for Win
solutions as all of them run WinXX. No luck with freeware or even open
source (portable, cygwin) solutions. So my standard answer is getting
"well, since you won't consider Linux pay up for a commercial spam
filter".
</P>
<P>
An article on how to use a Pentium classic PC from the attic and turn it
into a Spamfilter-firewall in a recipe (starting out at the point where
you insert a knoppix or install CD) might be interesting to some people.
