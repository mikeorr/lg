<p>
Good afternoon
</p>

<p>
I've been trying to get multihead to work for 2 months now. I saw
several different solutions for the problem but no that meet my needs.
I'm trying to run a two seat gaming station. I proved that it is
actually possible since i could run a dual head with xinerama and one
game in each screen ( but only one keyboard controlling both screens
). I'm running on two nvidia video cards, with nvidia drivers :
<pre>
00:09.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV18 [GeForce4 MX 4000 AGP 8x] (rev c1)
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV34 [GeForce FX 5200] (rev a1)
</pre>
Thanks to the at nvclock i could do some tweaking to get reasonable
speed. My problem is altough i could run it with xinerama, when i try
to separate the seats- put one keyboard, one mouse, one video card for
each seat - the system does not show the second screen. I tried with
both gdm and kdm to get the thing to work.
When i try to start each head individually i can, but i cannot
separate each mouse and keyboard: they work as if they were the same.
</p>

<p>
That problem has keep me up several nights. My xorg.conf follows so
you would point up were i screwd up or if i didn't :

Hello, Clement!
</p>

<p>
Sorry for the late reply, but our office got redecorated with Gigabit
wiring and our backup mail servers ate some mails.

<pre>
&gt; Nice article, Rene.
</pre>

<p>
Thank you!
</p>


<pre>
&gt;     I also saw apache_mod_proxy can do the reverse-proxy function. How
&gt;     is the performance  comparing  to squid proxy?  any  benchmarking
&gt;     on  this proxy  performance between these two?
</pre>

<p>
To be honest I didn't do any benchmarking in order to compare both
proxies. I usually stick to Squid because I use it for many years now
and it has a very rich configuration file with options that can do
(almost) anything you want. In my personal opinion Squid does a better
job handling memory and disk cache than Apache's mod_proxy. You can tune
the amount of memory it uses, define maximum object sizes, configure
fetching of aborted requests and the like. This is often more important
than having an extra couple of hits per second.
</p>

<p>
Best regards,
Ren&eacute;.

<p>
Hi,
</p>

<p>
Is there any common way to communicate with USB devices which aren't
mass storage - like Motorola mobile phones, some Canon photo cameras and
so on?
</p>

<p>
thanks,
Vitaly

<p>
Sorry the initial question never got copied to me, I realised that after
reading the talkback some time later. I hope that the below clarifies.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Any particular reason for not just using a tool, which already exists
&gt; - such as Unison (<a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/">http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/</a>) which is
&gt; cross platform/OS ?
</pre>

<p>
Unison synchronises between directories - this means if you intend to use
it in combination with a USB stick then your USB stick carries an identical
copy of all the directories which you intend to synchronise. 
</p>

<p>
But this is not what the article is about.
</p>

<p>
If you intend to have an identical copy of some of the computer's directories
then there are two other alternatives:
</p>

<p>
 (a) mount the USB stick (or USB hard drive) underneath such working directories
     as you intend to use at home and at work (bind/rbind/move options to mount)
     In this case you neither need the solution in the article, nor unison.
</p>

<p>
 (b) carry a synchronised version of some work directories on your USB stick.
     ==&gt; Again you don't need the solution in the article. And you don't even
         need unison. For this purpose, rsync is useful, has been tested by
	 thousands and is much better than plain cp since it only copies the
	 updates:	 rsync -a --delete source destination
</p>

<p>
The solution in the article works and is designed for when you have
neither (a) or (b): the former is expensive in terms of hardware, the
latter is expensive in terms of space.
</p>

<p>
Unison or rsync are not sufficient for this purpose.
</p>

<p>
With regard to solution (b), it may be interesting to see whether there is anything
which unison can do that rsync can not.
</p>

<pre>
&gt; One thing to bear in mind is that I had to use Apache 2 instead of 
&gt; Apache 1.3.x as there is no WebDAV patch for Apache 1.3.x
</pre>


<p>
WebDAV does exists for Apache 1.3.x
Perhaps the quota patch is missing?

<p>
I was reading the article about the USB subsystem yesterday and the posts
at the end reminded me that I wanted to change the label on my USB key.
</p>

<p>
Unless I mistaken, the proposed commands (mkdosfs and mke2fs) are also
going to reformat the partition. I wonder how many users are going to wipe
out their partition while trying to change their label.

Comments in a Shell
 
In shell scripting, all lines beginning with # are comments.
 
# This is a comment line.
# This is another comment line.
 
You can also have comments that span multiple lines by using a colon and single quotes:
 
:' This is a comment line.
 
Again, this is a comment line.
 
My God, this is yet another comment line.'
   -------------------------------------------------
 
   -------------------------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/zsh

:' Good grief.  After all this time, I learn that a colon
   followed by a single tick produces a block comment in
   *nix shel.
 
   That even includes blank lines!

#   calc '2 + 7'
