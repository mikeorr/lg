Well, this adds another one to the TAG "non-English posts" collection. I
don't think we've ever had Turkish here before - and as far as I know,
we don't have anyone here who can help translate it. Although Rick may
surprise me. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
Umit: the Linux Gazette has a world-wide distribution [1], but we don't
have a staff of translators that can handle any language. If you could
rephrase your (obviously Linux-related) question in English, we might be
able to help you.
</p>



<p>
[1] Last year, I got very curious about who's reading us and where
they're coming from, and did some serious parsing on the LG Web server
log files. Millions of readers, from literally every country (figured by
source IP) I could think of. Nifty fun.

That was me, actually. I just figured: you spent, what, a couple of days

revised the government, made the streets safer, and raised the standard
of living by some large factor[1], natch) seems like the obvious next

You know, the original post <em>looks</em> Turkish, and it's the most

<p>
I've heard Chuvash spoken a couple of times - that was about 40 years
ago. That's as close as I can get. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> Never even heard of the Dolgans,
even though Wikipedia tells me they're in geographical proximity -
that's not surprising, though, since there are only 5000 speakers of it
(Wikipedia again.) But those folks would have used (modified) Cyrillic
rather than the Latin alphabet.

Ooh... that question demonstrates at least one major problem in
machine translation[1]: missing diacritics[2] -- at Apertium, we're
trying to get involved in GSoC, and diacritic restoration is one of
the projects we want someone to work on.
</p>

<p>
Also, there's at least one word ('Linuxgazettde") that's not spelled
correctly[3], and (as a named entity) not likely to be recognised -
which means nothing in the sentence is likely to be correctly
translated.
</p>

<p>
A Turkish to English translator is a pretty ambitious thing to try to
make, given the distance between the languages, even when dealing with
text that's well written.
</p>


<p>
[1] There are lots...
</p>

<p>
[2] Assuming it <strong>is</strong> Turkish.
</p>

<p>
[2] the 'de' is the locative case suffix, according to Wikipedia; but
I'm referring to the fact that 'Linux Gazette' is two words.

That would be pretty tough for Russian. Even in as short of a span as
the last 30 years or so, I've seen the '?' ('yo') almost completely
elided in favor of the 'e' ('ye') in written Russian, at least in any
writing that is not explicitly formal. Even magazines and newspapers,
for the most part, have done so. Mind you, the pronunciation of the
words has remained exactly the same - a pain in the ass when you're
learning Russian, as Kat is doing nowadays (I have to point out every
instance where this applies as she reads; amazingly enough, she seems to
be making some kind of sense out of that mess.)
</p>

<p>
I don't even know if you could do it as a dictionary lookup, either.
I can't think of an example off the top of my head, but I'm sure there
are words that you can spell with either one and produce a real word in
both cases - but with different meanings.

<p>
Actually, Russian is much easier in this regard than most languages,
because it's just one character <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
(And let me sympathise with Kat, because my Russian is still at the
'reading like a five-year-old stage <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
In Apertium, we use mini paradigms to handle that (for example, my
English-Polish dictionary uses British English internally, but the
English morphological dictionary has a 'compile time option'[1] to
generate American forms).
</p>

&gt;  I can't think of an example off the top of my head, but I'm sure there

&gt;  both cases - but with different meanings.
&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Well, the same thing happens in most languages; our part of speech
disambiguation module is primarily rule-based (if we encounter "I'd",
it'll select 'I would' if the next word is 'go', and 'I had' if the
next word is 'gone', because those sequences are enforced, for
example), but it also supports statistical modelling, so it attempts
to pick the correct word in ambiguous cases based on collocations and
frequency, given a bilingual corpus.
</p>

<p>
Of course, a few of us don't like that particular method of working:
we're hoping to get a GSoC student to extend it so we can manually
specify collocations etc. Statistical translation is great for
language pairs that have huge corpora available, but most don't[2];
and better for people like Google[3] who have access to massive
corpora.
</p>

<p>
But ambiguity problems are unavoidable. Oh heck, let me just throw one
word at you - 
стул[4]. Or the sentence 'I read'.
</p>

<p>
[1] It's really an XSLT stylesheet that chooses one of the modes, but
for want of a better term...
</p>

<p>
[2] Also, the available corpora may not be particularly representative
of normal language; the largest English-Polish (-pretty much any other
EU language) corpus is the JRC Acquis, which is based on EU legal
proceedings, which means anything trained using it is going to
translate with it will come out as legalese :/
</p>

<p>
[3] There are also a few inherent problems in statistical translation
that can't be helped: 
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/35q5wo">http://www.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fel[...]</a>will say 'The English edition of the Encyclopaedia currently includes
32,538 articles.' for '
Η ελληνική έκδοση της εγκυκλοπαίδειας
περιλαμβάνει αυτή τη στιγμή 32.537 άρθρα.' (That should, of course, be
'the Greek edition...') You can use their 'Suggest a better
translation' feature, but you'd have to do it a few hundred (if not
thousand) times for it to have any effect.
</p>

[4] means 'chair' or 'stool' (as in 'stool sample'); different plural
forms, identical singular forms.

&gt; &gt;  I can't think of an example off the top of my head, but I'm sure there

&gt; &gt;  both cases - but with different meanings.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, the same thing happens in most languages; our part of speech
&gt; disambiguation module is primarily rule-based (if we encounter "I'd",
&gt; it'll select 'I would' if the next word is 'go', and 'I had' if the
&gt; next word is 'gone', because those sequences are enforced, for
&gt; example), but it also supports statistical modelling, so it attempts
&gt; to pick the correct word in ambiguous cases based on collocations and
&gt; frequency, given a bilingual corpus.

<p>
Oh - nice. I hadn't realized that it was that sophisticated.

&gt; Of course, a few of us don't like that particular method of working:

&gt; and better for people like Google[3] who have access to massive

&gt; 
&gt; But ambiguity problems are unavoidable. Oh heck, let me just throw one

Oh, heck - the classic "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is
weak"/"The vodka is good but the meat is rotten" problem is going to be

<p>
Eh... it's still not too bad. In Polish, verbs ending in -ować take
the endings -uję for first person and -uje for third person in the
present tense - that's roughly 5000 verbs in my morphological
analyser. That would be ok if the personal pronoun was there to
disambiguate, but in Polish it tends not to be.

Heh. True. Put me in the class with the average five year olds <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> I
can follow things fairly well, but reading aloud is... a bit beyond
me. It got a lot easier after I started to spend more time around some
native and near-native speakers. In my last few weeks, one of the
Latvian girls took to telling me things in Russian before she told me
what it was in English.

&gt; Oh - nice. I hadn't realized that it was that sophisticated.
&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Well, partly <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> We don't have a real parser: our transfer rules are
basically converted into regexes, which sucks from one point of view -
that any rule that has to take into account adjectives or adverbs has
to exist N times for N possible amounts[1], but it's bloody fast,
and... well, full parse systems I've seen have some oddities, like
taking words from within parentheses and placing them outside(???).
</p>

<p>
The same tools can also guess the likely part of speech of an unknown
word once trained; it's not integrated (and I'd prefer if it did stem
checking: knowing about the ending -ing in the sentence 'he is
qrbvzing' to trigger the rule for a verb rather than an adjective, for
example) but it could really make a difference.
</p>

<p>
We also have the capability to use statistical phrase alignment tools
like Giza++ to generate transfer rules from a corpus; the advantage is
that not only can we fine tune them afterwards, but we can also take a
small set of sentences that have been manually disambiguated, and
generate the rules from them.
</p>

<p>
But... I can't deny that Statistical MT is cool. There's a great open
source system called Moses (<a href="http://www.statmt.org/moses/);">http://www.statmt.org/moses/);</a> if anyone
ever finds the need for, say, a Maltese to Greek translator, and can
spare the 16 odd hours of processing time, they can get a decent
enough translation without needing the extras.
</p>

&gt;
&gt;  &gt; Of course, a few of us don't like that particular method of working:

<p>
<img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> I was talking to a professional translator last week, who had a
whole list of those. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses#Horned_Moses">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses#Horned_Moses</a>
was one) The best one he gave was of an American president (Carter,
maybe) who visited Poland with a translator who was not a native
speaker, and mistranslated his opening sentence from 'Yesterday, when
I left America' to something equivalent to 'Yesterday, when I defected
from America'.

<p>
In the unambiguous cases, having a spell checker in the UI can
probably help; in the ambiguous cases, it can be a hindrance: given
that the usual users of machine translators are translating from an
unfamiliar language, they may just pick the wrong gloss, whereas the
machine translator at least has a chance of getting the correct
meaning if the sentence is long enough to provide disambiguation.
</p>

<p>
One of the enhancements I hope to get around to making to our gui
(apt-get install apertium-tolk <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> is a version of the DicLookUp
feature (<a href="http://xixona.dlsi.ua.es/apertium-www/?id=lookup">http://xixona.dlsi.ua.es/apertium-www/?id=lookup</a>) on the
apertium site, which will pop up a list of possible glosses when you
click on a word.

talking about our former boss[1] 'I have him in my ass'.

Then I translated it back to Polish in my head: 'mam go w dupie' -&gt; 'I
don't give a shit about him'.

Ah.

Particular combinations of words aren't really a problem. Take it from
someone who makes bilingual dictionaries ;) They are tedious, though.

Eh... Standards help, sometimes. Sometimes they don't. There are
something like 20 standard ways of transliterating Russian Cyrillic to
latin (and that's just for an English audience) - and transliterating
unknown words is necessary (hopefully, it'll be a person's name <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> (My
solution - when I have time to work on Russian - will be to provide a
set of transliterators for the major standards and allow the user to
choose, but the current ISO scheme is my personal favourite, so
that'll be default <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

based on low edit distances (though our system also applies standard
transliterations between languages, so regular differences between
languages don't factor into it. In April, I'm going to take two
250,000-ish word lists (Polish and Upper Sorbian -- extremely closely
related languages) and see how it works out. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
