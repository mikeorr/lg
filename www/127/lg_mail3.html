    good enough attention in class. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>[Neil] - The entire functioning of the web browser is way too big a topic. 
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>To address more narrowly the topic of how the browser knows to use the PPP 
    link, the short answer is that it doesn't. It communicates via the sockets 
    library, which is an interface to the kernel's TCP/IP stack. It just calls 
    a library function, which requests a communication channel (socket) to a given 
    IP address (I've skipped DNS lookups here). The kernel then has the job of 
    routing the message. The kernel looks up, which link to use in it's routing 
    table. At some point before this the PPP script should have added an entry 
    to the routing table, indicating that connections to the internet can be made 
    via the PPP connection that has been established.</p>
  <p>It's a bit more complicated than that, but I'm no expert on routing tables. 
    I dare say googling for linux routing tables will come up with all the information 
    you need and more.</p>
  <p>I believe the command &quot;ip route&quot; is used to examine and manipulate 
    routing tables in modern linux distributions.</p>
  <p>&gt; 2&gt; If apart from the above mentioned PPP link my system is<br />
    &gt; also connected to the ethernet which in turn is connected<br />
    &gt; to the internet then which link would the web browser use<br />
    &gt; to get connected to internet - the PPP or the ethernet ?</p>
  <p>I guess that would depend on what's in the routing table.</p>

  <p>Hi, Prashant -</p>
  <p>First, I *strongly* suggest that you read a list etiquette FAQ before posting 
    to any more lists; your cross-posting is a violation of basic etiquette, and 
    is going to offend a lot of people. I'm sure that you did it because you don't 
    know any better, but if you're going to participate in forums on the Internet, 
    you definitely need to learn some basic protocol. Here's ours, with a number 
    of links to good resources elsewhere:</p>
  <p><a href="../tag/ask-the-gang.html">http://linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html</a> 
  </p>
  <p>Incidentally, I suggest that you revise your estimate of Thomas Adams' reply 
    to you; he was actually being quite kind and helpful. You'll know what I mean 
    if you get responses from any other lists, which generally tend to come down 
    with great big heavy boots on people who violate protocol.</p>

  <p>The simple answer is that it doesn't. A web browser, just like most other 
    network applications, connects to a _socket_ - a virtual connection that consists 
    of port and an IP. This kind of modularization (i.e., applications don't need 
    to &quot;know&quot; anything about the underlying network protocols, while 
    the network doesn't &quot;care&quot; about applications) is one of the main 
    features of networking that makes it so robust.</p>
  <p>I'd suggest that you take a look at, study, and understand in depth the basic 
    four-layer TCP/IP stack (search for it at, e.g., Google.) This will give you 
    a better understanding of this type of separation.</p>
  <p>&gt; Could you explain to me the entire functioning of the<br />
    &gt; web browser and the corressponding system files involved.</p>
  <p>Well, no. If this is what you _really_ want - and I think that you've mistaken 
    the critical path for understanding the solution to your problem - then you 
    need to download the sources for your favorite browser and start reading. 
    However, I suspect that once you understand the networking end, you'll see 
    that it's unnecessary in the first place.</p>
  <p>&gt; 2&gt; If apart from the above mentioned PPP link my system is<br />
    &gt; also connected to the ethernet which in turn is connected<br />
    &gt; to the internet then which link would the web browser use<br />
    &gt; to get connected to internet - the PPP or the ethernet ?</p>
  <p>It all depends on your routing table, which is (usually) configured at connection 
    time. For example, if I have an Ethernet connection up, then make a PPP connection, 
    and have PPP configured with &quot;defaultroute&quot; and &quot;replacedefaultroute&quot;, 
    then the PPP route will replace the previous one. I'm sure that you can imagine 
    some of the possibilities for the above scenario based on the information 
    I just gave you.</p>
  <p>&gt; I'll be really grateful to you if you could help me out with<br />
    &gt; the same. Looking forward to your quick reply,</p>
  <p>Erm... this is another one of those things you want to avoid doing on a list. 
    &quot;Quick reply&quot; implies a degree of arrogance on the part of the person 
    requesting it - unless they're willing to pay for such &quot;service&quot;.</p>

    you directly, as that would be consultancy, and I don't (yet (thankfully) 
    charge for that). If you fail to reply to tag at lists.linuxgazette.net, I 
    shan't answer you.</p>
  <p>&gt; I recieved your mail and realised that I have to give you a complete<br />
    &gt; description of what I know and what my problem is. Well to begin</p>
  <p>Excellent. :)</p>
  <p>&gt; with, I've set up PPP dial-up internet connection (on my linux<br />
    &gt; installed machine) by writing a script. As a part of this script<br />
    &gt; writing I had to modify a few system files and create a few of them.<br />
    &gt; To give you a precise idea I'm sending in a list of the files as an<br />
    &gt; attachment.</p>
  <p>That really wasn't necessary, but thank you for doing so.</p>
  <p>&gt; A stepwise description of what I understand is the procedure is as<br />
    &gt; follows : <br />
    &gt;<br />
    &gt; 1&gt; I dial into the ISP's(BSNL) host/router via modem.<br />
    &gt; 2&gt; I get authenticated for username and password as a physical<br />
    &gt; connection is established between me and the ISP's host. <br />
    &gt; 3&gt; This link is then disconnected ensuring that the modem is not reset 
    and<br />
    &gt; then the PPP is been started at the ISP's server end. </p>
  <p>The modem isn't &quot;reset&quot; as such -- it still provides the mechanism 
    of modulating and demodulating the signals.</p>
  <p>&gt; 4&gt; Then the PPP is being initiated at my end and a PPP link is been 
    setup. <br />
    &gt; 5&gt; Via the (-defaultroute) option and the gateways of the ISP I can 
    now<br />
    &gt; get connected to the internet. <br />
    &gt; 6&gt; In this entire process primary and the secondary nameservers (specified 
    in /etc/resolv.conf) of the ISP have got special significance as they help 
    in ]<br />
    &gt; host-name-address resolution.<br />
    &gt;<br />
    &gt; The very fact that I've been connected to the 'net can be confirmed<br />
    &gt; by pinging any site say www.google.com or directly opening it in the<br />
    &gt; web browser (say mozilla). Also the exchange of LCP packets can be<br />
    &gt; observed.</p>
  <p>Well, pinging a site and trying to view a site's webpage are two different 
    processes in effect. Ping sends out a certain data packet -- an ICMP request. 
    When you look at a web browser, you're reliant on various ports to connect 
    and talk to processes listening on it, etc. This might not always be possible, 
    despite the fact you can still ping the domain.</p>
  <p>&gt; Now my Question is that how does the web browser get to know that<br />
    &gt; it has to follow the PPP link set up by us to get the URL request<br />
    &gt; satisfied for the user ? (if what I'm thinking is correct). There</p>
  <p>Because your routing table (see 'man route') details how to connect everything 
    together. I'll refer you back to the linuxgazette in this instance. Google 
    for &quot;subnetting and routing 101&quot;. That explains all of that side 
    of things in more detail than I care to remember.</p>
  <p>&gt; obviously has to be certain O.S assistance or system settings that<br />
    &gt; direct the web browser in that direction. </p>
  <p>No, not at all. OS has nothing to do with it -- you might connect to an ISS 
    server or Apache, but what difference does that make to you? What happens 
    is that your browser (when you click on a link) has to translate the http:// 
    URI from a domain name to an IP address. Connections (or routes as we like 
    to think of them) at the transmission level use numbers to talk to one another 
    -- DNS provides a convenience service to translate IP to hostname, and vice 
    versa. Typically, your ISP will have DNS so you don't have to worry. </p>
  <p>Of course, as I mentioned in my previous email to you (you did read it, I 
    assume?) you're rarely going to go from A --&gt; B directly. Instead you'll 
    connect to a series of computers to reach B. And you can see for yourself 
    how this is achieved:</p>
  <pre class="code">   traceroute google.com</pre>
  <p>... for instance will tell you how many hops it took to reach google.com</p>
  <p>Once the connection has been reached, Apache, at the other end on the remote 
    server will send back a request detailing whatever content it needs to, to 
    satisfy the URL you clicked on. Note that computer &quot;B&quot; undergoes 
    the same process in terms of DNS, etc., to reach your computer.</p>
  <p>&gt; So what is entire stepwise<br />
    &gt; procedure that takes place and what all system files help the web<br />
    &gt; browser to get on to the PPP link. (I hope I'm being a bit more<br />
    &gt; clear in my doubts now.)</p>
  <p>Well, it depends how deep you want to go. I suggest you read up on &quot;Bind 
    and DNS&quot; by O'Reilly.</p>
  <p>&gt; Now I have one more doubt. Suppose apart from the above mentioned<br />
    &gt; connection I'm also connected to an ethernet which in turn has got<br />
    &gt; internet access. so the web browser has got two different ways of<br />
    &gt; handling the URL request. Either by the dial-up PPP connection or<br />
    &gt; by the ethernet link to the internet. So which one would it use and<br />
    &gt; why?</p>
  <p>Both are used implicitly. Look at your routing table -- you'll probably find 
    you have a non-public routable IP address that your ethernet card (or modem, 
    or router, or what have you) is being a gateway for -- hence you have NAT.</p>
  <p>&gt; Kindly try to help me by sending in your views about whether I'm<br />
    &gt; thinking on the right lines or not and if I am then what is the<br />
    &gt; solution to the above mentioned problem.</p>
  <p>&quot;Solution&quot;? I don't see a problem, other than wanting to have a 
    concept explained. You'll notice I have been deliberately vague in some areas. 
    What you're asking is for a book to be sent for you essentially -- the subject 
    area is _vast_. I hope though that you have sufficient information.</p>

<p>PRASHANT BADALA (prashant_badala at yahoo.co.in)<br />
  Mon Mar 20 09:36:00 PST 2006
<p> <strong>Hi everyone,<br />
  I'm Prashant Badala, a final year Computer Engineering student. I'm trying to 
  study and program the D-BUS as a part of my project. Hence I was going through 
  a book that says -</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>===========================================================<br />
    The D-BUS C API<br />
    Using D-BUS starts with including its header:<br />
    #include &lt;dbus/dbus.h&gt;<br />
    <br />
    The first thing you probably want to do is connect to <br />
    an existing bus. Recall from our initial D-BUS discussion <br />
    that D-BUS provides two buses, the session and the <br />
    system bus. Let's connect to the system bus:<br />
    DBusError error;<br />
    DBusConnection *conn;<br />
    dbus_error_init (&amp;error);<br />
    conn = dbus_bus_get (DBUS_BUS_SYSTEM, &amp;error);<br />
    if (!conn) {<br />
    fprintf (stderr, &quot;%s: %s\n&quot;, <br />
    err.name, err.message);<br />
    return 1;<br />
    }<br />
    <br />
    Connecting to the system bus is a nice first step, but we <br />
    want to be able to send messages from a well-known address.<br />
    Let's acquire a service:<br />
    dbus_bus_acquire_service (conn, &quot;org.pirate.parrot&quot;,<br />
    0, &amp;err);<br />
    if (dbus_error_is_set (&amp;err)) {<br />
    fprintf (stderr, &quot;%s: %s\n&quot;,<br />
    err.name, err.message);<br />
    dbus_connection_disconnect (conn);<br />
    return;<br />
    }<br />
    <br />
    Now that we are on the system bus and have acquired <br />
    the org.pirate.parrot service, we can send messages <br />
    originating from that address. Let's send a signal:<br />
    =========================================================== </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong> Now in this particular text I'm not quite able to understand the concept 
  of a &quot;service&quot; and the &quot;address&quot;. What service does &quot;org.pirate.parrot&quot; 
  specify ? What is the meaning of a message originating from it's address ? Could 
  you also explain what is the differnce between &quot;org.pirate.parrot.attr&quot; 
  and &quot;org/pirate/parrot/attr&quot;<br />
  when been specified indivisually in the function &quot;dbus_message_new_signal&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong> Basically I'm trying to write two programs that could send text to 
  each other (over d-bus) when executed on the same system. For this purpose do 
  I need to be<br />
  connected to the 'net at the time of executing the above mentioned programs. 
  (Might sound stupid... but somehow taking a look at the given program prompts 
  me to ask this...). Can you give me some advise regarding this ?</strong></p>
<p><strong> I'd be really thankful to you if you could explain to me these concepts 
  as I'm not able to find a good referece for this. Prior to this also I've sent 
  queries to you guys and the response has been really good and helpful. Kindly 
  help.</strong></p>
<p><strong> Thanking you,</strong></p>
<p><strong> Prashant Badala.</strong></p>
<p><br />
  [Ben] - I'd say that you have to look at the code or the documentation of the 
  API to figure out what &quot;dbus_bus_get&quot; and &quot;dbus_bus_acquire_service&quot; 
  do; since these are (presumably) defined somewhere before this part of the book, 
  you'll need to go back and set a mental bookmark for those functions. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&gt; Could you also explain what is the differnce between<br />
    &gt; &quot;org.pirate.parrot.attr&quot; and &quot;org/pirate/parrot/attr&quot;<br />
    &gt; when been specified indivisually in the function<br />
    &gt; &quot;dbus_message_new_signal&quot;.</p>
  <p>No idea - for the same exact reason as above. It all depends on what the 
    function does.</p>
  <p>&gt; Basically I'm trying to write two programs that could<br />
    &gt; send text to each other (over d-bus) when executed<br />
    &gt; on the same system. For this purpose do I need to be<br />

    &gt; a look at the given program prompts me to ask this...). Can<br />
    &gt; you give me some advise regarding this ?</p>
  <p>Well, local communications usually take place via a unix(7) socket, which 
    certainly does not require a network connection; however, I suspect from the 
    content of what you've sent us that the author is using some kind of a specialized 
    protocol/method of sending the data. It _shouldn't_ need anything like that 
    - it would be like requiring someone to drive a car as a part of moving a 
    piece of furniture from one room to another within a house - but anything 
    is possible.</p>
  <p>It all comes back to Reading The Fine Manual.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Jimmy] - Um... it's pretty clear English: the service is what you want to 
  use, the address is where it lives. Think of the service as something like &quot;http 
  server&quot;, and address as something like &quot;port 80&quot;.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&quot;org.pirate.parrot&quot; is the name of the service provided by the 
    example program; a message originating from its address means that when that 
    service talks to another program using D-BUS, it first identifies itself as 
    coming from &quot;org.pirate.parrot&quot;.</p>
  <p>&gt; Could you also explain what is the differnce between<br />
    &gt; &quot;org.pirate.parrot.attr&quot; and &quot;org/pirate/parrot/attr&quot;<br />
    &gt; when been specified indivisually in the function<br />
    &gt; &quot;dbus_message_new_signal&quot;.</p>
  <p>Just a slightly different naming scheme. &quot;org.foo.bar&quot; refers to 
    a service, but &quot;/org/foo/bar/some/object&quot; is used when you want 
    to access an object provided by that service. I think the naming scheme is 
    different so you will know by sight what you are accessing: the service name 
    is more like a (backwards) domain name, the object(s) provided like a file 
    path.</p>
  <p>For example: &quot;net.linuxgazette&quot; would be the address for a viewer 
    program for LG issues; &quot;/net/linuxgazette/124/&quot; would provide an 
    object that provides a list of articles from that issue, &quot;/net/linuxgazette/124/lg_bytes.html&quot; 
    could provide a file, etc.</p>
  <p>&gt; Basically I'm trying to write two programs that could<br />
    &gt; send text to each other (over d-bus) when executed<br />
    &gt; on the same system. For this purpose do I need to be<br />

<p>[Thomas] - I'm formally putting in a request for there to be a new email alias:</p>
<blockquote>

  <p>It would be really cool. I promise. :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[Ben]] - I generally like to distinguish between somebody coming to us and 
  saying &quot;I'm having this Linux-related problem at school, I've tried to 
  figure it out but can't, can you help?&quot; and &quot;Answer these questions: 
  1. What is an inode? 2. How does Linux boot? 3. What is the weight of a coconut-laden 
  African sparrow?&quot; In the first case, the person (at least in my opinion) 
  has followed the net.help procedures and is asking for assistance; in the second, 
  they're being a lazy ass who wants to have their work done for them.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I don't know about anyone else, but the fact that a problem is associated 
    with schoolwork does not faze me or influence my willingness to answer one 
    way or the other; there are plenty of valid problems, and of people trying 
    to solve them, in many different venues. On the other hand, freeloading lazy 
    bums who are unwilling to make an effort - no matter what the context - cause 
    my fingers to twitch toward my flamethrower, or (more commonly) exert about 
    the same amount of effort that they have toward solving the problem (i.e., 
    none.)</p>
  <p>IMO, Prashant fits the first case far more than the second. I may be wrong, 
    but that's my best estimate.</p>

<p>Thomas Adam (thomas at edulinux.homeunix.org)<br />
  Tue Mar 21 13:25:19 PST 2006</p>
<p> <strong>Dear all,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Whilst this is slightly OT (and most likely hardware related), I thought 
  I'd ask here anyway, since it's an odd issue to say the least.</strong></p>
<p><strong>To put it simply, my DVD-ROM drive no longer wants to read _any_ DVD 
  I give it, yet it manages to read data CDs and audio CDs just fine. For some 
  reason, my DVD drive was working fine one day, and the next it has trouble in 
  reading any DVD you feed it -- even the same DVD that was known working and 
  being read by the same DVD drive a day before.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I can't even say that the issue is a read one, since as soon as I put 
  a DVD into the DVD drive, the drive just starts to splutter, spin up and slow 
  down, and will remain like that for at least thirty minutes, until such time 
  that the DVD drive will stop, or I eject the disc. Trying to use MPlayer on 
  the drive fails in that MPlayer sees nothing. There's not even any suspect { 
  SeekReadComplete } type of errors in /var/log/messages. In fact, nothing is 
  printed to that file in any way to suggest there's a problem with the drive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I did (on a hunch) shove a CD-cleaner CD into the drive in the hopes 
  that might help, alas, it didn't. DVDs are still not being read.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I also tried to bugger about with hdparm and toggling DMA and I/O support 
  which didn't help either.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Can anyone shed some light onto what I do next? Is the drive kaput?</strong></p>
<p>[Ben] - I've seen CD-ROM drives get into a state which could only be &quot;cured&quot; 
  by shutting down the machine and leaving it off for a minute or so. Try that, 
  boot using a different version of Linux (I've usually got a CD with BBC-Linux 
  on it close at hand, these days), and if it still doesn't work, I'd call it 
  cooked.</p>

<p> 
  <strong>My laptop compaq presario x1000 has this problem:<br />
  suddenly the sreeen have desappeared and now after two days of on &amp; off 
  I can not use it anymore. The laptop in itself is working but there is not the 
  screen.</strong></p>
<p><strong> Someone told me that maybe the inverter cable connection between display 
  and screen... in this case I am not skilled enough to find and replace the peace 
  by my self. Do you have a tip?</strong></p>

<p>[Thomas] - Sure -- take it back to where you bought it and get it mended. Seriously, 
  fixing that sort of thing by yourself (if it even *is* the inverter cable) is 
  going to be awkward. </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>So get someone who knows what they're doing, to do it for you.</p>
  <p>Oh, by the way, a subject line of &quot;help&quot; really is annoying, and 
    doesn't help me in knowing what your email is about. You could have tried: 
    &quot;Laptop screen blank? Inverter Cable?&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
<p class="editorial">Ramon changed the subject line shortly after, and I've changed the title 
  to reflect this. --Ed.</p>
<p>[Ramon] - Attach an external monitor to the laptop and use that to copy all 
  your crucial data onto some external storage (network drive / other computer 
  / usb-harddisk / whatever) Take the laptop to a certified repair shop or return 
  it under warranty.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Tried fixing this stuff myself before and have hardly ever been succesfull 
    :-(</p>
  <p>Good luck.</p>
  <p>P.S&gt; It helps if you use a more relevant subject instead of help!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Ben] - This has nothing to do with Linux, but - yeah, inverters die a lot. 
  I've replaced a couple of them myself within the last couple of years, including 
  the one on the laptop that I'm using right now. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>First, figure out what the correct inverter is for your LCD display. The 
    only way to do this is to actually take the plastic casing off the and look 
    at the back of the display, since every manufacturer uses several different 
    displays in any given model. Buy the appropriate inverter - I've found eBay 
    to be an excellent source for them. The inverter is usually located just below 
    the LCD display (i.e., just above the hinge); disassembling the case (you 
    only need to open the top part - the body of the laptop is usually not involved, 
    although you'll most likely need to remove the hinge cover) requires removing 
    the screws and *carefully* unlatching the very thin plastic clamshell around 
    it.</p>
  <p>Reassemble everything - you *did* take pictures as you went through disassembly, 
    right? :) - and enjoy your nice bright screen.</p>

    &gt; dear sir &quot;Benjamin A. Okopnik&quot;</p>
  <p>Heh. I was never an officer, so &quot;sir&quot; is perhaps a bit excessive.</p>
  <p>&gt; thanks a lot for helping me.</p>
  <p>You're welcome; however, I must point out yet another point of etiquette 
    you've violated (I grant you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you 
    did it unknowingly.)</p>
  <p>When you ask for help on a list, you *must* keep the list CC'd on subsequent 
    replies unless you've received a specific request to do otherwise: not doing 
    so is tantamount to stealing from the community that is served by that list. 
    As an example, I charge $150/hr for private consultation. I participate in 
    TAG - i.e., contribute my time at $150/hr - because it helps the Linux community. 
    Taking the conversation off the list without making financial arrangements 
    with me means that I do not get paid, and the community does not get the benefit. 
    Given the lack of both of those, why would you expect me to keep helping you?</p>
  <p>Again, I'm assuming that you've done it as an innocent mistake, so I'm CCing 
    TAG on my reply. I also _strongly_ suggest that you read some documentation 
    on netiquette - e.g., &quot;Asking Questions of The Answer Gang&quot; at <a href="../tag/ask-the-gang.html">http://linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html</a> 
    - before posting to any more lists, since many people are NOT going to treat 
    this kind of violations with any degree of tolerance.</p>
  <p>&gt; though i still need ur help but as u said this was unplesant for u to 
    have that<br />
    &gt; kind of demand so i m not goin to ask.</p>
  <p>I don't have any problem with you asking for help; that's what this list 
    is for. The problem was in your violation of basic list protocol, not the 
    technical request.</p>
  <p>&gt; but i really thank you for your prompt n apt reply.</p>
  <p>You're welcome; glad I could help.</p>
  <p>&gt; (but sir if u can suggest me some place from where i can ask my queries 
    onC<br />
    &gt; and UNIX-system programming, then it will be a gr8 help to me.)</p>
  <p>Hmm, tough question. USENET is usually a good source of that kind of information 
    - e.g., news:comp.lang.c is reputedly very good, and has been around for a 
    long time. Take a look at their FAQ - <a href="http://www.eskimo.com/%7Escs/c-faq.com/">http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/c-faq.com/</a></p>
  <p>There's news:comp.lang.c.moderated as well. Do note, however, that USENET 
    folks tend to be very touchy about net protocol - and the standard netiquette 
    recommendation (quoted from RFC1855, &quot;Netiquette Guidelines&quot;)<br />
    is</p>
  <p> - Read both mailing lists and newsgroups for one to two months before you 
    post anything. This helps you to get an understanding of the culture of the 
    group.</p>
  <p> Or you can ask here. Just do it politely - which includes Netiquette manners, 
    although we don't apply the requirement just cited. We're always willing to 
    help, particularly when the question relates directly to Linux. Programming 
    questions are a somewhat marginal topic, and you may or may not get an answer 
    - but you're always welcome to ask.</p></blockquote>
