Just I recommended using GMail instead of sendmail (because I read that
GMAIL was secure).
</p>

<p>
The only problem is that I used my real name... ooops

I agree with qmails dumbness
there is a patch tho that sorts this, chkusr, its used on my  plesk 
systems i understand, its used by a few i know in normal qmail ops. 
the patch should be mandatory
</p>

<p>
Qmail in my opinion only has its worth in dealing with major hosting 
and virt domains, nothing but nothing comes close to qmail and 
vpopmail that just go together without effort
</p>

<p>
else Sendmail all the way :P
</p>

<p>
( I refuse to use postfix, Sendmail is superior if you know what you 
are doing, AND the facthat weitsies patsies spam every known list 
trying to trash the crap down our throats, just like those irritatng 
adds on tele, if t shits me off, i wont go near the product

Hi, Noel, and thanks for your comments.
</p>

<p>
Yes, there are patches to qmail for practically all conceivable
purposes, and they're testimony to the ingenuity of the surrounding
community in extending the MTA's functionality despite the licence.
There is even a coherent set of the most-desired patches called
'netqmail', published by the redoubtable Russ Nelson and others, but
sadly not well maintained in quite a while:  netqmail, if it <em>were</em> 
to be maintained, would go a long way towards addressing one of the 
big problems of the "There's a patch for [qmail problem foo]" approach:
In general, few of the innumerable patches get regression tested against
each other, resulting in a situation where each patch may be an...
adventure.
</p>

<p>
The virtual domain support in qmail, via the dot-qmail structures and
vpopmail is indeed pretty scaleable, once you get your mind around the
concepts.  I didn't need to deal with that at $FIRM where I was a qmail
administrator professionally, but I could see how it worked.  That
having been said, the Postfix implementation has excellent
documentation, and is said to likewise work well, and is how I'd do it
if such became necessary.  E.g.: <a href="http://www.postfix.org/VIRTUAL_README.html">http://www.postfix.org/VIRTUAL_README.html</a>
