<p>
I've got some video recorded on DVD-RAM and I've spent much of today trying to 
figure out how to get from DVD-RAM to a regular DVD, playable in a DVD 
player. I started out thinking this was going to be simple. Just a case of 
copying from one DVD to another. 
</p>

<p>
It's become clear that it's far from simple. The format used for recording to 
DVD-RAM is not the same as the format used for regular DVDs. I could shell 
out $100+ for Windows software that might (or might not) do what I need, but 
I'm not happy with that concept. 
</p>

<p>
I have spent a lot of the afternoon on Google and come up with next to nothing 
of use. Do the gang have any pointers to information, software (preferably 
Linux software) and other resources that will help me get video from DVD -RAM 
to DVD.

If your dvd-drive supports dvd-ram, it should be as simple as mounting 
it as removable drive, which is how Linux recognizes/handles DVD-RAM, iiirc.

Read in the files from the camcorder disc:
 
      Method 1. Use mplayer to read the DVD-RAM disc, and save the
audio and video streams separately. The dumpvideo and dumpaudio
switches make mplayer save the streams to a file named "stream.dump".
Rename this file to "audio" or "video", as appropriate:
 
          mplayer -dumpvideo /dev/hdd; mv stream.dump video; mplayer
-dumpaudio /dev/hdd; mv stream.dump audio;
 
      Method 2. Mount the DVD-RAM disc, copy the VRO file to the hard
disk, and split up the audio and video streams. The dumpvideo and
dumpaudio switches make mplayer save the streams to a file named
"stream.dump". Rename this file to "audio" or "video", as appropriate:
 
          mount /dev/hdd /mnt/cdrom
          cp /mnt/cdrom/DVD_RTAV/VR_MOVIE.VRO input.mpg
          mplayer -dumpvideo input.mpg; mv stream.dump video; mplayer
-dumpaudio input.mpg; mv stream.dump audio;
 
Re-combine the audio and video streams using mplex. The "-f 8" switch
specifies a DVD-compatible output format. The "-o sidea-%02d.mpg" file
pattern means that each chapter will be saved to a separate file, with
a two-digit number in the file name (i.e., sidea-01.mpg, sidea-02.mpg,
etc.).
 
    mplex -f 8 audio video -o sidea-%02d.mpg

Wow. That looks much more useful than anything I found with Google. 
</p>

<p>
I'll have a play soon and let you know how I get on.

I'll have a poke around cdfreaks. Mounting the DVD-ROM is easy enough, it's 
converting the format from .VRO (video recordable or some such) to .VOB 
(video objects) and making sure all the associated files are right. Jimmy 
O'Regan has pointed me to a page that seems to cover that bit.

I followed the instructions on that page and it worked. It hasn't retained any 
metadata, such as recording dates, but it has produced playable DVDs.

<p>
Thanks Jimmy. That was very useful.
