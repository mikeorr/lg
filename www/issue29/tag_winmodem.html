	--- Just Say &quot;No!&quot;</H3>

<p><strong>From Richard Storey on 15 May 1998

<br><br>
I am in the process of gearing up to install Linux and so forth on a new
HD.  I read a few days ago that Win modems, which I have in the form of a
US Robotics 56k X2 voice modem, bla, bla, leave off some of the on-board
chips which normally carry on some functions of the modem.  The article
said that the modem drivers take over these functions and pass the load
over to the CPU.  That's not good, but my thoughts are that if this is true
and Windows is supposed to be running for these drivers will this keep me
from being able to run the modem while in Linux?

</strong></p>
<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" width="50" height="28" alt="(!)"
align="left" border="0">
	I'm afraid you're stuck.  Last I heard these companies 
	won't release the specs.  Don't buy any more of these modems
	and printers.

<br><br>
	My fear is that a certain software company (no names but the
	initials are "Microsoft") will see the WinModems and WinPrinters
	as the amazing boon and raging success that they are (for
	MS OS') and encourage the development of more lobotomized,
	cut rate peripherals, components and whole systems.

<br><br>
	Reading between the lines about Microsoft/Intel's PC98
	"recommendations" (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/pc98.htm"
	>http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/pc98.htm</a>)
	I see plenty of opportunity for proprietary, non-disclosed
	software drivers to be <strong>required</strong> for system operation.

<br><br>
	If I was a "mad scientist" and I wanted to control the PC
	marketplace and keep it safe from free software (open source
	or otherwise) I'd run the scam like this:

<br><ul>
	<li>Produce a complex spec that looks attractive to
		  the average consumer, and to the busy reporter
		  (or other trade press editor, writer, et al).

	<li>Sneak in a number of compliance requirements that
		  entail a fair amount of software/firmware support.

	<li>Contract a team of HW engineers to design a number
		  of ASIC's (Application Specific Integrated Circuits)
		  that would be key components of this new architecture.

	<li>Have my team of crack coders write up all the drivers
		  that would be required for key products.  These 
		  drivers would be interfaces between my chipsets and
		  ASIC's and my OS(es).

	<li>Offer these drivers freely to all of the hardware
		  manufacturers under NDA.  Carefully leave room
		  for product differentiation in each category ---
		  and make sure that all support for these forms
		  of differentiation have to be built on my designs
		  and integrated into my driver/libraries.

	<li>Quietly apply pressure on them to refuse to disclose
		  the details of their own hardware designs (by hinting
		  that support for "non-compliant" devices will be a 
		  very low priority in your OS development efforts and
		  "may not be possible or feasible").

		<br><br>
			(Note: I wouldn't be so crass as to outright
			threaten to close out access to my market
			for any rogue manufacturers --- I'd just 
			make a show of engaging in lucrative cross-
			licensing and "stategic partnerships" with
			that vendors competitors).

	<li>I'd keep my "crack team" of programmers on hand to
		  provide free or low-cost "migration support" to 
		  "eligible and compliant" manufacturers.  It would 
		  only cost their signature on the NDA line to get free
		  programming help for their designs.

	<li>I'd also build in plenty of "security" features for
		  "anti-piracy" and "copy protection" (a la DVD 
		  encryption) and make those specs NDA and patented
		  wherever possible.

	<li>While I was at it I'd also patent everything in sight
		  and I'd put plenty of political pressure on the U.S.
		  Congress to support trade secrets and intellectual
		  property legislation that would make it a felony for
		  anyone to engage in open disclosure reverse engineering
		  and security research (decryption efforts) on any 
		  commercial software products.
</ul><br>

	Not that any of this is happening.... or is it?

	Call USR and give them a piece of your mind.  Let them know that
	you might be willing to let your CPU take the load 
	<strong>IF</strong> you had some choice in what OS your system was 
	running.

<br><br>
	However, there is nothing in the hardware market today that is
	quite so odious has having no choice about the software that
	drives your peripherals.  This is especially true of modems
	and printers which had been pretty reasonably standardized for 
	almost 20 years (before the PC was even marketed by IBM we 
	at Hayes AT command set for modems and printers that could take
	simple parallel text output).

[Sorry for sending the whole thing back to you but I figured you must get
ton of mail and don't always know who's is what!]

	Yes, I do.  However, a small excerpt is usually sufficient

Thanks for the essay.  I never expected such a thoughtful and extensive
response.  This choir says Amen!  The Winmodem was in small print, but I
still, at that time didn't know that some of the functions were dumped off
to the software.

<br><br>
The funny thing is that IBM wrote the drivers for it and they are not
working properly.  I updated the modem's firmware to V.90 and now the
comm/port gets hung up, requiring a reboot to reinstall on a regular basis.
I spent 6 hours on the phone today with IBM tech support doing brain
surgery on my system solve it to no avail.  My next strategy is to get them
to take it back.

	Hmm.  Typical.  The firmware upgade probably doesn't work
	with the software drives.

<br><br>
	Obviously you should do your best to get them to take it 
	back.  It isn't fullfulling your requirements.  When enough
	of us as consumers can communicate our needs to enough
	vendors --- they will meet them, or other, new vendors will
	take over the niche.

Anyway, my next step is to plan out my software uses, make a full effort to
dump windoze entirely, and start a support group for former windows users
(the abused) and those who would like to get out of abusive relationships
with PC operating systems.   <img src="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" alt=";-)"

	There are some excellent Linux Users Groups forming
	across the world.  There are also at least three actively
	maintained lists of LUGS:

<dl>
	<dt>LUGR (LUG Registry)
	   <dd><a href="http://www.linux.org/users/index.html"
	      >http://www.linux.org/users/index.html</a>
	<dt>GLUE (Groups of Linux Users Everywhere)
	   <dd><a href="http://www.linuxresources.com/glue/"
	      >http://www.linuxresources.com/glue/</a>
	<dt>LUG List
	   <dd><a href="http://www.nllgg.nl/lugww/"
	      >http://www.nllgg.nl/lugww/</a>

</dl>
	There are also HOW-TO's on forming users groups
(<a href="http://www.linuxresources.com/LDP/HOWTO/User-Group-HOWTO.html"
	>http://www.linuxresources.com/LDP/HOWTO/User-Group-HOWTO.html</a>)
	and on "Advocacy" 
(<a href="http://www.linuxresources.com/LDP/HOWTO/mini/Advocacy.html"
>http://www.linuxresources.com/LDP/HOWTO/mini/Advocacy.html</a>).
	Finally there is a fairly new and
	relatively quiet mailing list for LUG organizers at:
	lug_support@ntlug.org  (subscribe with an appropriate 
	message to majordomo@ntlug.org and read the North Texas
	Linux Users Group web pages, <a href="http://www.ntlug.org/"
	>http://www.ntlug.org/</a> for details).
