I recently bought a new IDE disk drive and installed it as <TT>/dev/hdb</TT> in my
server.
While leaving my current [<A HREF="http://www.slackware.org/">Slackware</A>] distribution on <TT>/dev/hda</TT>, I wish to
install the <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> distribution on <TT>/dev/hdb.</TT>
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
After completing the basic Debian install, I edited the lilo.conf file to
include a second image. The original file was:
</STRONG></P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="../misc/tag/rich-price.slack.lilo-conf.txt">rich-price.slack.lilo-conf.txt</a></tt></p>
<P><STRONG>
The newly modified file is:
</STRONG></P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="../misc/tag/rich-price.slack-debian.lilo-conf.txt">rich-price.slack-debian.lilo-conf.txt</a></tt></p>
<P><STRONG>
when I tested this config file i got:
</STRONG></P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="../misc/tag/rich-price.slack-debian.lilo-complains.txt">rich-price.slack-debian.lilo-complains.txt</a></tt></p>
<P><STRONG>
<TT>/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.20-idepci</TT> does exist on <TT>/dev/hdb1</TT> but not of course on
/dev/hda1.
Is this the problem?  If so, how do I access an image on a different hard
drive?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I downloaded the "LILO User's Guide" and read about the alternate image
format:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>   image=/dev/hdb1
      range=sss-eee
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
where sss-eee is the starting and ending sector range of the image, but I
don't know
how to find out what to use for sss-eee.

Just mount the corresponding partition and use this path then, e.g.
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>image = /mnt/newdebianroot/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.20-idepci
root = /dev/hdb1
label = Debian
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
A different option is to separate boot and root partitions and mount the
<TT>/boot</TT> partition in both Slackware and Debian while also keeping
<TT>/etc/lilo.conf</TT> in sync, so that you can easily use the
<TT>/boot/vmlinuz-debian-2.a.b</TT> and <TT>/boot/vmlinuz-slackware.2.x.y</TT> kernel images
and use the <TT>/boot</TT> path. An easy way would be to symlink <TT>/etc/lilo.conf</TT> to
<TT>/boot/lilo.conf</TT> in both installations and you can happily run lilo from
Debian and Slackware.

I'd personally avoid the esoterica of any "alternate image format"
(if possible) and simply put the desired kernel and any required
initrd (compressed initial RAMdisk) images unto the <TT>/boot</TT> partition
(or into the <TT>/boot</TT> directory of any rootfilesystem) back on <TT>/dev/hda.</TT>
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
There is no problem sharing one <TT>/boot</TT> directory among multiple
Linux distributions --- and it's the easiest way to do it.

I have sidesteped the problem for now by booting off of a floppy.
But I think Jim's suggestion will make a better long term solution.

Jim's method is the easiest and most convenient.  However, there's no reason
the other kernel has to be in <TT>/boot</TT> as long as it's mounted somewhere when
"lilo" is run.  Older Linux distributions used to put the kernel in <TT>/</TT> by
default.

I am not a programmer [any more] but I think that an enhansement
to LILO which would allow the use of different file systems for
different boot images would be good.  Something like this:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>image = /boot/vmlinuz-2.2.20-idepci
root = /dev/hdb1
imagefs=/dev/hdb1
label = Debian
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
Where imagefs is a new parameter used to specify the file system
that contains the boot image file.
</STRONG></P>

Unfortunately this suggestion exhibits a fundamental misunderstanding
of how LILO works.  The "image" files are access as regular files,
and thus they must reside on some locally mounted filesystem when you
run <TT>/sbin/lilo.</TT>  <TT>/sbin/lilo</TT> then issues ioctl()s to get the low-level
block address information about where the image file's parts are
located.  Those raw device/block addresses are written into the map
file (usually found in <TT>/boot</TT>).  The address of the map file is written
into the boot block (usually in the MBR of the hard drive).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Your hypothetical imagefs= would require that <TT>/sbin/lilo</TT> either
incorporate all the code to directly access the device/partition as
a filesystem (which is infeasible for a large number of filesystem and
is just bad engineering --- code duplication for even a single type),
or it would have to do something like: make a temporary mount point,
mount the imagefs, use this temp mount as a relative chroot
point?, then proceed as before.  It's VASTLY easier for you to
mount the fs up yourself and simply manually refer the appropriate
entries in your <TT>/etc/lilo.conf</TT> to the kernel image (and initrd images,
etc) before running <TT>/sbin/lilo.</TT>
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
In my MANY discussions about LILO I find it convenient to distinguish
between LILO (the whole package) and <TT>/sbin/lilo</TT> (the utility that reads
the <TT>/etc/lilo</TT> file and various command line options and produces/writes
a map file and a bootloader (into the MBR, unto a floppy or into a
filesystem superblock or "logical boot record).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Run strace on <TT>/sbin/lilo</TT> some time and you may find enlightenment.

I've found that running "strace" <em> _often</em> precedes enlightenment. Also,
like reading the dictionary (who the heck can stop at just one entry?),
it's usually enlightenment on topics far beyond the original one.

What would the information be useful for?  "lilo" uses the image= path to
determine the kernel's physical location, the boostrapper uses the physical
location, and at no time is <TT>/boot</TT> required to be mounted (except when running
"lilo").
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
However, a few programs use <TT>/boot/System.map</TT> (or <TT>/boot/System.map-VERSION</TT>), and
these may behave funny if it's not accessible or is out of sync with the
running kernel.  Currently I see that klogd (the kernel logging daemon) has it
open while it's running.  But stopping klogd, unmounting <TT>/boot</TT> and restarting
klogd does not cause any errors, although it does generate a log message of:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>Jan 10 14:55:28 rock kernel: Cannot find map file.
Jan 10 14:55:28 rock kernel: No module symbols loaded.
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
"man klogd" says it uses System.map to translate the numeric traceback of a
kernel error to a list of functions that were active at the time, which makes
it easier for kernel developers to track down what caused the problem.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Dan says modprobe also uses System.map.  "strings <TT>/sbin/modprobe</TT> | grep
System.map" shows that word exists in the code, although the manpage doesn't
mention it.  So you may need <TT>/boot</TT> mounted when loading modules.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Is there anything else that likes to have System.map around?

Oddly enough, <EM>Netscape</EM>. I remember doing some complicated messing
around with multiple kernels, way back when, where I'd hosed System.map
in some way or another. It didn't seem to affect too many things, but
the annoying error message I got every time I fired up Netscape finally
got me to straighten it all out. I was a young Linux cub then...

For a time I used to unmount the <TT>/boot</TT> partition in the init scripts to
avoid risking corruption of the ext2fs there during normal operation.
Then I noticed the above errors (didn't seem to affect loading modules
though), and switched to remounting as ro instead, which rid me of the
error, and avoids the problem of having it mounted rw.  Alternatively I
suppose that one might be able to change the fstab entry to mount it ro.
Not sure if there is a requirement to have it rw in the early boot
process.

I have had <TT>/boot</TT> mounted read-only for years and have had no problem.

On my multi-distro setup, I also mount <TT>/boot</TT> read-only;  depmod tries to
run during every boot, and complains that it cannot write.  As long as
I deliberately run depmod while my <TT>/boot</TT> is read-write whenever I'm
adding modules or new kernels, then this is an ignorable warning because
I already did that.  When running depmod by hand on a kernel which you
do not yet have booted, you definitely need a copy of its System.map on
hand, for use with the -F parameter.  If I fail to do this, the distro
that wants this is a very unhappy camper, because with no depmod
information at all, it cannot load any modules.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I occasionally build monolithic kernels deliberately, but that's barely
viable with today's huge list of kernel features.

This information makes LILO much more understandable to me.
It enables me to see why my suggestion doesn't make any sense.
It also makes the light bulb go on about Matthias's original answer
which I admit I didn't understand until now.  This is great!
I now have two ways to solve my problem and enough understanding
about what I am doing to finally be dangerous ;-}&gt;
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I think that adding something similar to your comments to the LILO
User's Guide would be helpful to part time LINUX hackers like me.
Perhaps in section 3.3.1 a second paragraph could be added saying:

will then issue ioctl()s to get the low-level  block address information

This file system does not have to be on the same physical drive as the
root file system."

I've touched it up a bit --- their maintainers would, undoubtedly
tweak it more to their likely if they choose to incorporate it.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Please feel free to send this to John Coffman and to the maintainers of
the appropriate HOWTOs (as referenced in my earlier post).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I'd also <EM>highly</EM> recommend pointing them at the years of Linuz Gazette
Answer Guy/Gang material on this topic --- so they can understand how
frequently these questions come up and glean some ideas for how we
people in the "support trenches" have been trying to dispel the
confusion that plagues so many LILO users.  (Did I mix too many
metaphors there?)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
In particular if they explain LILO as analogous to programming:
<TT>/etc/lilo.conf</TT> is the "program source", <TT>/sbin/lilo</TT> is the compiler and
the bootloader and map files are "objects" --- then a large number of
people will "get it."  Even people with the barest modicum of
(compiler) programming experience understand why changing the source
code doesn't change the program until it's recompiled.
