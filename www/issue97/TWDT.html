<P>
Hi.
</P>
<P>
Ben came up with the right fix to the "unresolved symbols in
<TT>/lib/modules/`uname</TT> -r`/foo.o" error; however, his reason is flawed.
</P>
<P>
If the distro kernel uses a module to enable foo and the rebuilt kernel
omits foo, or puts it inside the kernel, there is no place for depmod to
insert the kernel module and it'll complain about the unresolved
symbols.  (If the required module is not available, the error will be
something like "Device not found".  It's been several years since I
puzzled this one out, and I don't remember the specific error.)  The fix,
as Ben said, is to either rename or delete <TT>/lib/modules/`uname</TT> -r`/ before
running "make modules_install".  Or build a kernel of a different version,
but I don't think that's within the scope of the OP's question.
</P>
<P>

<BR>Question by James A. Hess (jah from ipsg.com)

<P><STRONG>
Ben, et al,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thank you for continuing and resurrecting the Linux Gazette.  I clicked on
my old link to LG this morning and was depressed by what I saw.  The format
is terrible, the "articles" were of dubious quality and my favorite
features were missing.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Fortunately, it wasn't too hard to find you again.  Keep up the good work.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Thanks, James! We certainly plan on it; being able to create without
censorship and interference was one of our main motivations in making
this move. Good to see that you and many other folks recognize this move
as a positive one; we certainly think it is, and look forward to
bringing the best content we can produce to our readers.
</P>
<P>
Best wishes,
Ben Okopnik

<P>
A small suggestion from someone who has enjoyed your magazine for some
time.  In the page describing why you have moved to a new domain, not
everyone (including  me) will know what "CMS" means.
</P>
<P>
Take the editorial suggestion, or not.  Do accept my thanks for your
<BR>work in creating the magazine.
</P>
<P>
PS. I've been using Unix since '79 or so, including scanning most of the
source code to V6, installing Berkely 2.1 on a PDP 11/34, and thinking that
our new VAX 11/750 was a powerhouse.  To me CMS means "Cambridge Monitor
System", a terminal based front end to the IBM mainframes, and the only OS
I've used on a screen that was worse than using punch cards.

<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">Good point.  Sometimes we underestimate the variety of backgrounds our
readers come from.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">CMS means "content management system".  Generically it means any
systematized workflow for producing and maintaining documents.  Every
system needs some way for the author to write the document and submit it,
and for the editorial staff to approve/deny it, make corrections, set
meta-information like the title and bio, publish it, and maintain it
after publication.  In that sense, Linux Gazette has always had a content
management system of some sort or another.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">However, in the context of web services, CMS means a certain kind of
software for handling the workflow, one that is web based.  That's what we
mean by "linuxgazette.com has a CMS".  Most CMS' in this sense handle at
least the editorial steps through the web via HTML forms.  Some also expose
this interface to the authors for the initial submission.  A few also allow
editing the article text through the web, although others handle this in the
traditional way (the staff puts the file directly in a certain directory
without using the web interface).  Since many <EM>LG</EM> articles have images and
supplemental files, the interface has to either handle these too, or else
get out of the way so the staff can install these manually.  Various CMS'
include Plone (a Zope system), PHP Nuke (Linux Journal uses a heavily
customized version of this), Drupal (used by Linux Ghoulzette, as we 
affectionately call that other zine -- well, it <EM>was</EM> Halloween when
they unveiled it) 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
, Slashcode (used by Slashdot), wikis,
blogging tools, etc.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">Many people think <EM>Linux Gazette</EM> left linuxgazette.com because of the
CMS, but that's only partially true.  For me personally, the CMS was
only a minor problem - one that I feared the worst of, but that I was
willing to allow a good try.  The main reason I left was the lack of editorial
oversight, which was significantly affecting the quality of LG content.  Nobody
at SSC is giving the authors feedback to help them improve their content or to
generate article ideas.  Many authors had stopped contributing to LG because of
this, but indicated they would return to LG if it reverted to its traditional
self.  
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">The arguments against a web CMS are that HTML forms are cumbersome and
inconvenient, you can't use your existing favorite software tools, it
would take a lot of work to graft in the features <EM>LG</EM> already enjoys, and
why fix something that ain't broke.  The "lot of work" part can be seen
at linuxgazette.com, where they are trying to integrate a text-friendly
format (for blind readers), an all-in-one-page format ("TWDT"), better author
attribution, a system for managing images, etc -- features we already
have had for years.  Most off-the-shelf CMS software does not have these
features, and grafting them in often requires kludging around the program's
design.

demonstrates some rather poor techniques for compilation. Firstly, LeeAnne
suggest that one compiles their programs as 'root' -- ERRM, bad idea.
Secondly the use of "-" as a prefix for tar's options is not needed and
can even lead to some ambiguity.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Any chance the author can be made aware of this?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
It was published by Jeff, and he didn't put her e-mail address on her
author page.  I don't know whether she asked him not to, or that was his
policy, or what.  But we don't have her address.  Maybe she'll see your

<P> As you can see, LG has a new look.  Rob Tougher responded to our
longstanding request for somebody to make a stylesheet for LG, and it looks
great!  He also helped me extensively to update the templates and Python
scripts that generate LG, to implement the new look.  

<P> We've tried hard to make it reasonable for both graphical and text
browsers.  Let us know if anything blows up or you have any suggestions.
The biggest problem we've seen is the menu being vertical instead of 
horizontal in Netscape 4.  If anybody is still using Netscaoe 4.

The only problem is that most readers are unaware of that, not having
heard of the switchover to  <A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net"

formats include (aside from TWDT.html) a new PalmDoc version, suitable
for reading on PDAs.

<P>
Also, if you know sites running Linux Gazette mirrors, please let their
admins know.  We've contacted the official mirrors, but there are lots
we aren't even aware of, who are probably wondering why they aren't
getting a November issue.  (They need to redirect their mirroring
scripts.)

<blockquote><font color="#000066">At the time this was drafted, Phil Hughes was still swearing off the

one anyway, thus many automated mirrors actually did get a November
issue, albeit a drastically different and underpowered, barely edited,
edition.  If you see the old content on a site <EM>please</EM> advise their
webmaster of the existence of both sites and our move to linuxgazette.net.
If they'd like to come up to date with us, we'll gladly help with
mirroring scripts.  If they want to mirror both, we're fine with that

<P>
Ok.  Here's how it works.  And TIA for the chance to clarify any points
in our "FAQ" documents that really do need clearing up;  after a while
it gets a little more fuzzy, and that make it hard for us to truly look

can answer it.  Even if one of them can't alone, they might be able to,
ahem, gang up on it.
</P>
<P>
Even rather new people might have tricks up their sleeve; anyone
interested in watching the ebb and flow of questions, and possibly
answering a few here and there, is invited to join the "tag" list -
effectively becoming a member of The Answer Gang, too.  It's all
volunteer, so if you can't answer anything, you're welcome not to
say much, and just lurk.  You might surprise yourself and answer a few
anyway.  If this happens a lot you'll be offered a chance to raid the
TAG fridge for some muchies and your beverage of choice.
</P>
<P>
We pride ourselves on possibly curmudgeonly and very human replies,
because we're real people, not worrying so much about the clean white
polish of a paper-white magazine.  I have, however, occasionally warned
people not to be too mean in their answers as things stray off topic.
As I said then, the mantra of the overall magazine is "Maiking Linux
Just A Little More Fun!" not "making the Borg kids cry."  Various topics
are considered bad, like people sending in their homework assignments
without even poking around in some URLs and researching in search engines
a little.  We've tried to provide some help for folks who are about to ask
- querents can read our "ask-the-gang" document - but generally we try to
have some fun with Linux and get people going so they can have fun here too.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Anyway, my apologies.
Tom Brown.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Please, take a look throughout the site, and let us know what you think
about any of it that you like.  Or especially any parts that confuse and
annoy... so we can improve ourselves.

Sun, 2 Nov 2003 21:33:50 -0800
<BR>Sluggo (<a href="mailto:gazette@lists.linuxgazette.net?subject=%20Re%3A%20%5BLG%2097%5D%20gazette%20matters%20%232"><em>Linux Gazette</em> Editor</a>)

</P>
<P>
Phil Hughes (the publisher of linuxgazette.com) claims that a main reason for
eliminating the Editor was that readers were complaining we were too
selective about what we publish, so they either felt they could not be authors
or were too intimidated to ask.  I was surprised to hear that because I never
felt we were heavy-handed, but that's what he says.
</P>
<P>
For the record, I receive some three hundred articles every year, and
publish all but three or four of them.  The only ones I've rejected were
advertisements disguised as articles, mindless Microsoft bashing (which
belongs in comp.os.linux.advocacy), material we've covered extensively
before, advocacy pieces that said nothing more than "Linux is good, try
it" (you're preaching to the choir), and articles whose English was so
bad that readers wouldn't understand significant points.
</P>
<P>
In every case I try to work with the author.  Advertisements I send to
News Bytes, or have the marketer get some employee to write a "balanced"
article from a user's perspective.  If it's an overpublished topic, I
ask the author to elaborate on certain portions -- what we're looking for
is new information -- or I notice areas in the author's expertise and
ask them if they're willing to write an article about that.  That's
actually one of the fun parts of being an editor: giving article ideas
to people based on things they've said.  Articles with bad English I
either proofread myself, find a translator or proofreader, or ask the
author to find a proofreader.  In most cases, the article either
becomes acceptable or the author writes a different article for us.
And sometimes the author goes on to write better articles later and
becomes a regular contributor.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some articles had incorrect technical advice that, if
followed, would make newbies shoot themselves in the foot.  You don't
mess around when talking about boot sectors, backups, security or
corrupting data: you make sure that at least those parts are right.
In every case I was able to tell the author myself how to fix the
article, or sent it to The Answer Gang for technical review, and the
article was published.
</P>
<P>
This all is what goes into the process of "editing", and it seems to
be what linuxgazette.com is objecting to in their attempt to have
an editorless zine.  As of November 2, they added one paragraph to
the author FAQ I wrote, saying in part, "There is no editor as such and
we're relying on authors to be self-editing....  Additionaly, assume
that your article is publishable, at most we'll take a cursory glance at
it, spell-checking and grammar are the author's responsibility."
(<A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/faq/author.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/faq/author.html</A>, question 1, paragraph 2) My
position is the everybody needs a little help sometimes, and it's the
editor's job to be that help.
</P>
<P>
As for reader complaints that we're too strict, I have not heard that
even once from readers during my four years editing LG.  Instead, in
<A HREF="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</A> comments and in other places, I
see the opposite: readers wish we were <EM>more</EM> selective.  Only a very
few readers express an opinion either way, but that's the direction of all the
opinions I've heard.
</P>
<P>
If you think LG is too strict -- or not strict enough -- in its article
selection, please let us know.
</P>

I can pretty much guarantee that you're seeing, there, just the
operating of an automated mirroring script, pulling down files from the
former LG.com site without supervision.  It'll get straightened out
eventually, with time.  Maybe they'll decide to mirror both.  ;-&gt;
</P>
<P>
Pity about the name confusion, but with luck the two periodicals
will diverge over time (if both persist).
</P>
<P>
(We at LG.net's staff had no idea the former site would produce more
issues:  They'd lead us to believe they were moving entirely away
from monthly issues, and adopting entirely dynamic CMS-based content.
The staff considered that format incompatible with publishing a
magazine, and failed to reach agreement on that with Phil Hughes over
many months.  That was one of the reasons we took Linux Gazette
elsewhere -- so it wouldn't cease to exist.  Therefore, LG.com's
subsequent "issue #96" came as a complete surprise.)
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Heather] 
I'd like to note for the record that the actual inquiry I first made
that led to the hosting we now have, was prompted by wondering whether
SSC would continue to host us when none of our staff worked there
anymore, NOT anything about stylesheets, layout, or automation.  We
didn't even know all those months ago who'd press enter on the Python
command that sets the ball rolling for release.  I just asked and T.R. was
kind enough to say whatever we needed to do, he'd support.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When, a couple months later, SSC claimed that changing the site was
being looked into so they could reduce personnel involvement - the
word "costs" was used several time - I noted that we could reduce their
cost to zero by moving away.  We asked why fix what isn't broken.  The
claim was made - and I still haven't seen any real RFC822 messages to
support - that readers claimed it was hard to submit.  This potential
about moving was shushed with "no, of course we'll support LG" and our
"technical advice" was solicited for the new plans.  Then the evil CMS
buzzword was brought up, we debated about it ... um, vigorously.   In
the spirit of actually having our opinions sought.  "Evil" I say because
it had come up and either failed even basic marketing or been hoist by
its own petard a couple of times before. (See the timeline if you care.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As it is I regret now (in 20/20 hindsight) taking as long to support
a move away as I did.  I regret taking the flack that I did when I
simply commented - in verbose answergang fashion - on the technical
failings that cause "content managed" sites to fail to be magazines by
nature.  But I don't own a TARDiS.  All I can do is move forward.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Mike Orr, aka Sluggo] 
Yes, although these aren't the only reasons we switched.  Ppl keep on
dwelling on monthly issues and CMS, but the latter played only a minor
role in my choice to participate, and the former played even less.  I
came back because:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Heather] 
As of release time, the staff of The Linux Documentation Project are
discussing what to do about the split project, and which to carry or
point to.  This really got into discussion mid November, and they
probably want consensus; Jimmy O'Regan said they're pretty confused.
I can't blame them, since my efforts to support even a college-try at
CMS by announcing the preparation and the imbalanced opinions of it
among the <EM>LG</EM> staff far enough ahead to get readership response in
either direction were squished too.

[Sluggo]  The most ironic thing is, Heather had had the linuxgazette.org
domain registered for years.  But when Phil promised her early this year that
he wouldn't change LG, she let it expire.  Then when he did change it and we
wanted linuxgazette.org back, it was too late, a cybersquatter had snapped it
up.  That's why we're linuxgazette.net instead of linuxgazette.org.

<FONT COLOR="green">Diebold
</FONT>
</H3> 
<P>
Two contentious issues: electronic voting and the DMCA, have been at the
centre of a recent story regarding the Diebold company.  
<a href="http://www.diebold.com/">Diebold</a> specialises in ATMs,
electronic voting systems and similar products.  However, their voting
products have not been without their problems, the extent of which was
starkly highlighted in emails leaked from the company.  
<P>
Once the emails started to circulate on the internet, 
Diebold sought to lock down this embarrassing material by invoking the
dreaded DMCA.  Happily for the American electorate, the Online Policy
Group, backed by the EFF, 
<a href="http://www.eff.org/Legal/ISP_liability/OPG_v_Diebold/">
brought legal action against Diebold</a>
and forced the company 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/34286.html">
to back down</a>.
<P>
This is an important win, as the integrity of the voting system (and
people's ability to verify it) is fundamental to the functioning of
any democracy.  As Scott Granneman has pointed out, 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/34051.html">
e-voting has had a chequered history</a>, and it is imperative that it
be properly exposed to public and expert scrutiny.  This is not just an
American issue, as electronic voting machines are being installed in
countries around the world.  Some, such as those in Australia, use
<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61045,00.html">
open-source software and operating systems</a>, but many (for example
<a href="http://www.p45blogs.net/blog_snorkeller/archives/000308.html">
the system being deployed in the Republic of Ireland</a>) leave a lot to
be desired in terms of transparency and openness.

mentioned below</a>, several Debian project machines were recently
compromised by an attacker who took advantage of an exploitable flaw in
the 2.4 series of kernels.  Though this integer overflow in the brk
system call was not initially thought to have serious security
implications, now that an exploit is loose in the wild it is very
important that sysadmins patch their systems.  The problem has been

<h1>Windows Defectors: Why Linux Is Worth Migrating To, Sometimes</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/roberts.html">James Roberts</A></b></p>

<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>
	[James has agreed to coordinate the "Windows Defectors" series
	long 
	<A
	HREF="../issue95/lg_mail.html#mailbag.1">requested</A>
	in the Mailbag.  This series is for those new to Linux who come from a
	Windows background.  In spite of the series title, it's not just for
	those who have stopped using Windows completely.  People who still like
	Windows, use Windows grudgingly, or deal with Linux-Windows integration
	in LANs will also find the information useful.  Unlike LG's other
	series, this one will be written by multiple authors, since there is
	such an interest on writing on this subject.  The next article in
	this issue (by Tom Brown) is also a Window Defectors
	article.  
	
	<P> We're considering changing the series title to something less
	negative (e.g., "Linux For Your Mom", "Leaning Towards Linux", "Windows
	Immigrants Help Box", "c:\&gt;, Drive-In for Windows Users", "At
	Liberty Under the Hood", "Linux Incognito" -- all suggested by Petar
	Marinov), but we're leaving it as "Windows Defectors" initially 
	because that's what it has been known in the Mailbag.  -Sluggo.]
	</EM></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><TT>"Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it."</TT>
<CITE>-George Santayana</CITE></P>

<P>Have you heard that quote before?  I expect so - and that's part of the
point of the quote. This is the first article in a series aimed at the
many people who are interested in Linux, but currently use Windows. It aims
to ask, and perhaps answer, questions such as:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Why should anyone defect - or migrate - from Windows to Linux?</LI>
  <LI>What should be migrated?</LI>
  <LI>What are the benefits, if any?</LI>
  <LI>What are the problems?</LI>
  <LI>Are there work-rounds for the problems?</LI>
  <LI>Who should consider this option?</LI>
  <LI>Who should avoid it?</LI>
</UL>

<H2>What's the context?
</H2>
<P>All such discussions have a context, and the context I intend here is
that of the Small and Medium Enterprise, or SME. I'm not addressing the
issues for the single desktop, or for the large multinational corporation.
In fact, for both these extremes the issues are arguably simpler: at one end
it's just personal choice of platform, at the other the resources are
available to implement customised solutions as needed. But it is the SME
area that has in the current, somewhat-recessive economic circumstances,
consistently been identified by the IT industry as the last largely untapped
potential growth area. I'm referring here to small installations of between
two and a hundred desktops and servers. This SME area is price-sensitive,
hasn't upgraded for years, has no IT management: it's where Linux can make a
difference, and it's where I reckon it's hardest for Linux to enter - for
reasons that I will describe later. If the problems can be solved here, then
Linux will become 'sticky' at this level of the 'ordinary' user.</P>


<P>In this first article I'd like to set the scene, and this is why I
started with the Santayana quote. I've noticed that people with a UNIX
background often have had little contact with those who have been weaned on
DOS - and vice versa. The target business that I'd like us to keep in mind
is a small office - say eight or ten users altogether - and if this small
office has a history in computing, it will generally have been in DOS and
Windows.</P>

<P>So let's review where this typical office is now, and how it got here.
It's a long and somewhat sad story, but in the end, you'll maybe see why,
once, Windows NT was better for our clients than XENIX/SUN, and why now
Linux may be better than NT.</P>

<H3>Anti-flame note
</H3><P>Before we start, let me state that I am convinced that GNU/Linux is
a masterly piece of work on the whole, and an astonishing achievement. Since
it's made by humans however, it's not perfect, and inevitably it's the
imperfections that I'll have to emphasise. The alternative options are also
imperfect, that's why we're looking at Linux. But in some areas the
alternatives may have strengths that GNU/Linux lacks. Please take the
comments in the appropriate light. I also have to say that all trademarks
are acknowledged.</P>

<H2>Blast from Past
</H2>
<P>I'd like us to think back ten years or so - at which time (by mere
coincidence)   I'd just  joined a small UK SME VAR as hardware tech. Within
about ten days of starting I'd been bumped up into a systems and end-user
support role as well. The VAR was then primarily a Novell reseller and
customiser, and I quickly got to know the advantages and disadvantages of
Novell 3.1. At that time most of the clients were solicitors (lawyers), and
their systems typically were running a Novell server on a i386 or i486 with
SCSI drives, with up to twenty-five diskless net-booted i386 workstations,
running WordPerfect.</P>

<P>Overall the server/diskless workstation was a very good fit for the
clients' needs; it was reliable, fast (the 10 Mbps network was faster than
contemporary IDE drives) and easy to maintain (all the configuration files
were in one place).</P>

<P>It was also abstruse, non-intuitive (indeed, counter-intuitive at times)
and completely non-user-friendly. Any minor configuration error was often
fatal. But it did work, and did the job well.</P>

<H2>Enter the Band-wagon
</H2><P>Then Windows for Workgroups came along. We could put a network of
twenty-five peer-to-peer workstations into a site for much less than we
could do a Novell installation. Not only that, all the hardware was readily
available and used standard parts (the diskless workstations needed specific
types of PSU and weren't easily upgradeable). Moreover, with the Windows
system, the clients had the illusion of a familiar system - most of the
decision-makers who wanted to introduce networked systems already had
Windows boxes at home. Also the clients could install their own extra
software packages without invoking our aid (and paying for it).</P>

<P>Pretty soon we were installing a lot more Windows for Workgroups than
Novell. Of course, it didn't take long for the downside to be apparent - no
central installation of applications, no central control of rights, no user
controls whatsoever, big problems with workstation backup, insecure
peer-to-peer networking. So our recommended system included a Novell server,
which solved some (but not all) of these problems.</P>

<P>Then Windows NT came out - and it was cheaper than Novell, both for the
server and for the client access licences. And for the client, again it gave
the illusion of familiarity - it looked like Windows. And for me, it came
from the architect of Digital VMS - it was written by someone who did know
what they were doing.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, Novell had changed their OS completely to version 4, which no
one I knew found easy to use. They had introduced large-scale management
tools, which merely muddied the waters for our typical installs of 5 to 10
clients, and it cost more than version 3.x.</P>

<P>Pretty soon we were selling networks made up of Windows for Workgroups
workstations with a Windows NT 3.51 server, for a much lower overall cost
than the previous Novell-plus-diskless workstations solution, and with
pretty reasonable reliability and performance. Of course, building all the
workstations took time, so I developed a custom cloning system that could
build ten identical workstations in about fifteen minutes each.</P>

<H2>Nixing XENIX
</H2><P>By then (and we are getting to 1995 or so), we had become pretty
well-known and had  a good reputation for looking after clients, so more
than one solicitor came to us to replace their 286/386 XENIX-based system,
which was by then getting pretty long in the tooth (like me now!). I never
installed any RS232 terminals, but I removed a lot. They'd done a good job
for their owners, but the replacement - with Windows 95 on the desktop and
Windows NT 3.51 on the server - was like jumping forward a whole epoch,
compared with the 9600 baud green-screen serial terminals in previous use.
Was Windows actually as reliable? Well, yes, given the age of the systems
being replaced, it was in fact more reliable.</P>

<P>So things went on, and as they went on the problems of this Windows
computing paradigm - which had always been apparent in contrast to the
Novell/diskless paradigm - became more and more cogent.</P>

<P>Windows 95 was effective - it's a masterpiece of forward and backward
compatibility in my view - but it was not stable. It crashed easily. It was
not secure. It was big, and the interactions within the systems were
unpredictable. Add third-party software (and a different mix of such
software on every box) and problems would arise that no-one reliably could
solve. We got used to reformatting and reinstalling.</P>

<P>Windows 98 was better, and more reliable, but much bigger again, for no
very good reason. It still crashed unpredictably, and took even longer to
fault-find or reinstall. Windows NT server was pretty darn stable (after a
few service packs), and so we all looked forward to Windows NT 4 coming in
1996, with the back-end stability of NT and the new interface of 98.</P>

<P>I adopted NT4 workstation as my personal desktop as soon as it was
released, but I had to dual-boot with 98 because NT4 did not run games
well - and I like games. However, NT workstation was too expensive to sell
into our clients in general, so our standard install was Windows 98 on the
desktop and Windows NT 4 server on the back end, and this worked pretty
well.</P>

<H2>Setting Sun
</H2><P>In 1996/7 we sold this system into various sites that were running
Sun Solaris/SPARC. It was interesting how this came about. Why ever would
someone using Sun SPARC workstations want Windows? Well, for freedom, odd as
this may seem given the current context. </P>

<P>At the particular sites in question, 'the Sun' was under the exclusive
control of 'The System Administrator' - who would install only what they
wanted to install, after triplicate written requests, passed back up to
company HQ and triple signed off by company IT. Maybe. Meanwhile the workers
and researchers, who just wanted to get things done, were bringing in their
own Windows machines and running SPSS or MathCAD or some custom sample
analysis software on them just to get the work done, and meanwhile the new
spectrometers in the lab came with Windows-based software that had to be
copied BY HAND to the UNIX system! Yes, Windows and Windows networking at
that time actually represented more 'Freedom' for these people, and
eventually the lab Sun systems were retired and sold off.</P>

<P>Do I feel shame? No! I remember two issues. One was concerning a video
lead for a monitor. The video lead - which if I remember correctly was
standard apart from the blanking off of one pin - was $150, about, from Sun.
I could source the same lead (apart from the blanked hole) for $7. And the
price of a network card? Don't ask. Meanwhile, it took twenty minutes to
link the lab pc talking to the machinery into the network - something that
had been on request for a year. Any company that exploits a monopoly in this
way develops users who detest it. Yes, any company.</P>

<H2>Back in the future
</H2><P>So we get up to 1999 and Windows 2000 Pro. Windows 2000 is as good
as Windows has got. It was pretty solid, pretty easy to use, fast,
adequately tuned, and a good desktop system. But Windows 2000 Pro had a
deliberately broken networking model, presumably to force a contrast with
Windows 2000 server. Windows 2000 Workstation would only handle ten clients;
this was reminiscent of the Intel tricks  with the 486 series. The Outlook
mail/groupware client was also broken, in that core functionality had been
moved to Exchange server, and as far as I could see for one reason only: to
make clients buy Exchange server. I didn't like this. But Windows 2K was
still a good bet for our clients, although it was getting really overblown
in size and slower and slower every issue.</P>

<H2>The Plague years
</H2><P>Then the viruses started to really hit.</P>

<P>Then Windows XP came out.</P>

<P>We don't sell XP, if we can help it.</P>

<P>We have a few problems with it. We don't like the licence (it's a
potential problem for most solicitors/lawyers and anyone else with a duty of
confidentiality), we don't like the desktop (it's an insult), we don't like
the vulnerabilities, or the slow performance, or the sheer undocumented mass
of it all. But that's not the <em>real</em> problem. The <em>real</em>
problem we have is that soon we won't be able to get Windows 2000 any
more.</P>

<P>There's a problem in another area too. Many of our clients are running
Windows NT 4 server. It's very solid. It works. It does the job. But there
will soon be no more security updates or support for this version, and we
will have to migrate clients to something else. Windows 2000 server, 2000 AS
or especially Windows Server 2003 are a ridiculous overkill for an office
with six client machines, as well as being much more expensive and needing
huge hardware resources to run. So what else can we install to replace
NT4?</P>

<H2>Enter the Penguin
</H2><P>Now, back in 1993 I had ran into Slackware, presented as a cover
disk with Personal Computer World UK. I installed it and played with it, but
it didn't do anything I needed. Nonetheless, I kept an eye on GNU/Linux and
installed most builds of Slack, then Red Hat. We bought in a pre-configured
GNU/Linux Slackware box in about 1996 to run as our mail server, initially
on dial-up and then ISDN, and over 5 years it never crashed. The PSU failed
one day, and I managed to migrate the system to a different box and a bigger
hard drive and get it all working again (I never was sure how). Many people
say that Windows is unstable. With the NT series and all relevant patches on
supported hardware - I just don't think that's true. I've had Win NT 4 boxes
stay up for years. But that GNU/Linux could so easily match or exceed this
performance impressed me.</P>

<P>Moreover, GNU/Linux has over the last few years transformed its graphical
desktop capacity. Not only are there lots of interestingly geeky X-desktops
available, but two mainstream competitors for Windows 2k/XP, with generally
enhanced capabilities.</P>

<P>Two years ago, with the launch of XP and the developments in Samba, I
decided to seriously evaluate the potential of Linux for replacing Windows
NT 4 on the backend with a GNU/Linux box running Samba. I installed every
mainstream distro I could get, on every box I could test it on. I played
with it, broke it, fixed it (sometimes) and did my sums. Then we put some
test boxes into clients, mostly as mail servers/file servers with AV
integrated, and they have on the whole been working flawlessly ever
since.</P>

<P>But all is not sweetness and light. There are some problems to overcome
in retro-fitting GNU/Linux into a Windows network, and now I've given the
history I've just laid out, I hope you'll see them a little differently.</P>

<P> Next month I'll start discussing what sorts of problems
we've encountered and how we've tried to work with them.</P>

<h1>Windows Defectors: I Don't Think We're In Redmond Anymore, Toto</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/brown.html">Tom Brown</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<P>Before I begin, I want to warn you. I'm a very opinionated person. I expect
things to work well. I expect computers to work my way, not the other way
'round. When I get new software, I expect to be able to put the manual in a
drawer, then use the software's basic functionality with few hassles. I'm also
a control freak, which is why I like C/C++ over something like Visual Basic.
Ease of use gets you only so far. As I said, I expect things to work well,
which is why I decided to give Linux a try.

<P>I've programmed on a lot of different operating systems in the last 20
years, starting with the venerable Commodore 64 in the early 80's. In that
time, I've discovered that, despite the venting of various zealots, each
operating system has its appropriate place in the digital universe. Amigas
focused on multimedia (TV shows like Babylon 5 and Seaquest used it to generate
3d scenes), Macs focus on the printed page (most ad agencies and print shops
depend on it), and Windows focuses on taking over the world (sorry, cheap
shot). Diversity is a good thing.

<P>My introduction (!) to the world of Unix came quite a while ago, when my
boss gave me a month to benchmark the same database on SCO, HP/UX, and Solaris
(sort of a "let's see if he can breathe underwater" exercise). I liked the
flexibility and stability of Unix, but wondered what joker came up with the
cryptic commands (ls to read a directory? Rename a file by moving it? Huh?). My
favorite was the somewhat recursive SCO user manual of the time, where you had
to know what a command did before you could look it up to see what it did. 

<P>It wasn't until Mandrake 8.2 came along that I seriously considered using
Linux. Having experienced Unix through remote terminal connections, I didn't
expect too many surprises. Ha! I'd like to share with you my introduction to
Linux  from my own rather unique perspective.

<P><H2>Off to see the Wizard</H2>

<P>The target machine for the installation was a 2.53GHZ Pentium 4, with 512MB
of memory, two 80GB IDE hard drives set in a Raid 0 configuration (which means
that a file is written by sending sectors to alternating drives, giving you
faster reads and writes) using a Promise Raid controller built into the Intel
motherboard, and a standard 60GB IDE drive. I wanted to put Linux on the Raid
drive, but ran into my first problem. The installer didn't recognize the
Promise controller. Instead, it saw the two Raid drives as separate volumes.
That's where I had my XP installation at the time, so I absolutely wasn't going
to risk mucking it up. I decided to use the non-Raid IDE drive for Linux.

<P>The voice of experience: Before you start a Linux installation, have a list
ready of the hardware in your machine, including brand names and model numbers.
If you already have Windows on the machine, this info is easy to get. Mandrake
is pretty good these days auto-detecting hardware, but there's always that one
last bit it fails to identify. If the installer doesn't recognize your monitor,
you may have to enter its max resolution by hand, so keep the monitor manual
handy.

<P>Mandrake, as with the latest Red Hat distro, supplies a wizard to walk you
through the installation process. Once you know where you want to put things,
it's smooth sailing. You can use the installer to partition your hard drive,
but I recommend having a copy of Partition Magic handy to divvy the drive up
beforehand. That lets you resize an existing partition without wiping
out existing data. It comes in handy if you need to tweak things later. 

<P>Another tip: Don't accept the default installation packages. Make sure you
have enough disk space, and install everything. It's easier to do it now than
later. If you think you'll never need the programming packages and kernel
source, for example, you'd be surprised!

<P>Many how-to books give you a simple method to boot a Linux partition from
Windows, and this generally works.

<P>Except in my case. Booting Windows with the Raid volume as the first drive
meant that the Linux partition was on the second drive. But when Linux was
installed, it thought it was on the first drive. It was trying to boot "hdb1"
as "hda1". Hmmm. You can't get there from here. Of course, since Linux didn't
recognize my Raid controller, it couldn't boot Windows. It seems you can't get
here from there, either. I ended up setting Linux to boot Windows using an
invalid drive spec. This fails, of course, but when it does, you simply hit a
key, and Windows starts up. Say what? This only works if you have only one
regular IDE drive. If you have a second, the boot-up  fails, because it tries
to boot the second IDE drive instead of the Raid volume. The real solution, of
course, is to move Windows off the Raid volume. I think I'll leave that to my
yearly Windows reinstall (What? You don't reinstall Windows every year? Didn't
you get Bill's memo?).

<P><H2>If I Only Had a Brain</H2>

<P>Sometimes, I can be really stupid. I can't leave well enough alone. A few
weeks after the successful install, with everything working fine, I decided to
upgrade the computer's memory from 512MB to 1GB. I burn some home movies to
DVD, and keep my CD audio collection on the computer, so the extra memory would
come in handy.

<P>Only, Mandrake won't boot with the extra 512MB! The scroll lock and caps
lock LED's on the keyboard started flashing, but nothing appeared on the
screen. For those of you in the Windows world, this flashing indicates what is
called a "kernel panic". This is just what it sounds like. The Linux kernel
(the core logic of the OS) gets to a point where it doesn't know what to do
next, and it freaks out. One web site suggested I reduce the amount of memory
used by Linux. It worked, for Mandrake 8.2. But not, as it turned out later,
when I upgraded to Mandrake 9.0!

<P>You know that part in the Wizard of Oz, where Dorothy starts down the Yellow
Brick Road, and it's going in tiny circles? That was me. As much as I really
wanted to use Mandrake, I wasn't about to give up on the extra memory. So, I
wiped Mandrake from the computer, and started all over with Red Hat 8. Other
than a different look to the wizard, it was Deja Vu All Over Again. Same Pew,
Different Church. You get the picture. Red Hat installed easily, and it was
finally time to get to know Linux. I promised myself I wouldn't change anything
else (for a while).

<H2>There's No Place Like /home</H2>

<P>In Windows, each user has an entry in the Documents and Settings directory
on the "C" drive. The  Linux equivalent is the user's "home" directory,
which bears the user's login name, and is located in the path "/home"
(reminder: Linux separates directories with a slash, not a backslash as in
Windows and DOS). Everything in there defaults to being private to that
particular user. A user can structure their "home" directory any way they
want, and their changes don't affect anyone else. Once you leave "/home",
however, Linux directories can be confusing to a Windows user.

<P>Here's a short list of the important Linux directories, and what goes in
them:

<P><B>/home:</B> This contains all the user directories in the system, except
for root.

<P><B>/root:</B>	This is root's home directory. Never login as root (the
Linux equivalent of the Administrator in Windows)!  Always login as yourself
and use the "su" command to give yourself root privileges for specific
commands. The reason is that programs and scripts can do a lot of damage when
run as root. The damage can be due to a hostile program, or just your own
(ahem!) stupidity (been there, done that, got the t-shirt).  

<P><B>/bin:</B> 	Programs and scripts essential to boot and/or repair
the system.  Some of these are used by other programs.

<P><B>/sbin:</B>	Programs and scripts used by system itself, and by
users to administer the system.

<P><B>/boot:</B>	Programs and scripts used to start Linux.

<P><B>/etc:</B>	Configuration files. You may well find yourself editing some of
these, but do be careful, and backup the file before you make a mess of it
(voice of experience #2).

<P><B>/lib:</B>	Routines that are shared between programs. Sort of like DLL's
(I hear some choking from the Answer Gang at that analogy).

<P><B>/tmp:</B>	A place to store temporary files.

<P><B>/usr:</B>	This directory contains contains all programs (/usr/bin) and
libraries (/usr/lib) that aren't essential for the system to boot and undergo
emergency repairs.  /usr takes up 90% of the disk space on many systems, so
many sysadmins keep it on a separate read-only partition.  Any information that
is host-specific or varies with time is stored elsewhere.  

<P><B>/var:</B>	Contains variable data files. For example, you'll find logs
here. This directory allows /usr to be read-only, since anything that is
written to during system operation is in /var.

<P><B>/opt:</B>	This directory is reserved for the installation of add-on
application software. For example, Oracle uses this to contain its binaries,
and the files they use. This directory is a standard used on some Unix systems.
Its use on Linux systems has been controversial.
 
<P>There are in addition, directories that only look like directories. They are
special, and have a specific purpose:

<P><B>/dev:</B>	Each "file" inside this directory represents a hardware
device on the computer.  

<P><B>/mnt:</B>	This directory (or one of its its subdirectories) is
conventionally used as a location to mount temporary filesystems like floppies.
Once mounted, the floppy's contents appear to be physically located in the path
"/mnt/floppy". Think of it as assigning a drive letter to a network drive in
Windows. However, other Linux distributions mount floppies onto /floppy
instead.

<P><B>/proc:</B>	The "files" that appear in this directory aren't
really files at all, but represent the programs currently running, information
from the Linux kernel.  You can write to certain "files" to modify the
kernel's behavior, but the changes last only until reboot.

<P>Additional information on these directories can be found by referencing the
<a HREF="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/2.2">Filesystem Heirarchy Standard</a>.

<P><H2>Pay No Attention to the Man Behind the Curtain</H2>

<P>One of the biggest concerns I had moving from Windows to Linux is support
for the various devices in the machine. You're more likely to find hardware
supported on an older machine than one that's state of the art. A good example
of that is my Promise Raid controller. I can work around it by using another
drive, but it means I'll continue to use Windows to access that 160GB of space.

<P>Another example is my nVidia graphics card. I have a Gforce 4 ti4200, and
only relatively recently has nVidia supplied a driver for it. Now, if you're
used to the nice way Windows installs device drivers, you're in for a real
"treat". The installation of the driver (in Red Hat 9, my current flavor of
Linux) was as follows:

<P>1. Reboot Linux in command-line mode (not in GUI mode).

<P>2. Run the nVidia installer. If the kernel isn't one it expects, it builds
one for you (remember, I warned you to have programmer tools and kernel source
installed).

<P>3. Make config file changes, per the instructions that came with the
installer.

<P>4. Reboot Linux into GUI mode.

<P>Now, if you update the kernel, you need to do this all over again, so the
nVidia installer can re-build the kernel. Not exactly as simple as running
"setup.exe", is it? Personally, I think it should be that easy, but that's an
argument for another time.

<P>That having been said, most of my hardware was recognized and used properly.
I can burn CD's on my DVD burner. I can watch home movies on DVD. My Creative
sound card works well (it didn't work at all in earlier versions of Linux). The
latest version of Red Hat (version 9) works even better on my laptop than it
does on my desktop, because the laptop is slightly older (a Compaq Presario
1800T).

<P>DVD Note: If you want to play movies (the kind from Hollywood) in Linux, you
need a library of routines that can defeat the DVD copy protection. Yes, this
is illegal, and a violation of the DMCA. I  use Windows to play DVD's for now.
Not wanting the MPAA to knock on my door, I can't identify the software needed
to play them in Linux, but you can probably google for it. You may have to
learn Norwegian, though.

<H2>Flying Monkeys</H2>

<P>Another concern I had with moving to Linux is losing familiar applications.
While Red Hat comes with a version of Open Office, I was tempted by Ximian,
which promised better integration, through a customized Open Office, and other
additions. I was particularly interested in Ximian's implementation of a
"Network Neighborhood", which used an Open Source program called Samba to
access shared Windows directories from Linux. While Samba can be installed
separately, you have to configure it yourself. Ximian claimed to do it for you.

<P>Ximian installs from the web, rather than downloading a tarball or a zip
file. This can be a problem if you're installing to a machine that doesn't have
a fast Internet connection.  (I wouldn't suggest you do this over a dialup
connection). It installed to my laptop easily, and works as advertised. Its
implementation of "Network Neighborhood" was nice. It saw all printers and
shared directories on my home network, without any tweaks or configuration.
Sweet.

<P>Well, now that you're suitably impressed, I'll disillusion you.

<P>The problem came when I next used the Red Hat Network up2date program (sort
of like Windows Update) to apply the latest patches. No go. It seems that
Ximian replaces parts of the OS with its own customized bits, causing
dependency errors during the update process. As a result, I could no longer
apply all the patches. I couldn't even add some packages from the install CD
because of this (I said this before: install everything).

<P>I hope Ximian solves the conflict problem, because I'd really like to use
it.

<H2>And Your Little Dog, Too</H2>

<P>As with anything else, Linux has its annoyances. At least, from a Windows
perspective. 

<P>Both Red Hat and Ximian default to using the Gnome desktop, but I prefer
using the KDE desktop. KDE is an optional install, another reason to just
install everything the first time around.

<P>RPM package dependencies. This is more than annoying if you haven't a clue
how to fix it. You just want something installed. If the computer knows what's
wrong, it should just fix it, or tell you clearly what's missing. Tip: Run
"rpm" from the command line instead of double-clicking on the package icon,
using the verbose option to see what went wrong.

<P>Another annoyance involves modems. Most of them these days are what's called
"winmodems", which mean they depend on Windows to work. They're useless in
Linux, and ones that do work aren't always easy to find. 

<P>At the risk of offending everybody, vi.  It's the most commonly used text
editor in both Unix and Linux, and was originally designed to be used over a
slow modem connection on an 80-character-by-25-row screen. How slow? Try 300
baud. Today there are lots of alternatives, such as Emacs (in both command
line and X-Windows versions), as well as various programming IDE's that do
syntax highlighting, but if all you're doing is editing config files now and
then, these may be overkill. If what you really want is something like Notepad,
then you have a choice of using Kedit (KDE desktop) or Gedit (Gnome desktop).
Voice of experience #3: Keep a printed copy of the vi command keys somewhere
handy. You'll need it when you have to edit a config file or shell script and
X-Windows isn't running (or won't run because you accidently trashed it). Don't
say I didn't warn you.

<P>The installation of programs and device drivers is an unholy pain in the
boot sector. Some vendors, such as Borland with their Kylix and J Builder
tools, make program installation a whole lot easier, but even they have some
room for improvement. And I've already said my two cents worth about installing
device drivers.

<P>Disk partitions don't always automount. Mandrake scans your drives, and sets
up icons for any FAT partitions it finds, but in Red Hat, you have to crack
open the manual and do it yourself. It's not hard, but it's a pain. Reading the
manual, after all, is the option of last resort.

<P>You can't just eject the CD-ROM as you do in Windows. You have to unmount it
first. I know it's just a mouse click (or a CLI command) away, but, hey, I'm
lazy!

<P>Help is a little too scattered for my taste. You have two places to find
manual pages, as well as separate GUI help files. I'd like to have everything
available and cross-referenced in one place, preferably available from the GUI.
Some systems have a command "xman", which is a GUI version of the "man"
command, but I haven't seen it in Red Hat. On the plus side of Linux, there is
a ton of HOWTO guides out there, covering a wealth of topics, so I guess it
balances.

<P>The Open and Save dialog box isn't as elegant as the one in Windows, and is
a bit jarring if you go back and forth between operating systems as I do.
Rather a small nit to pick, but there you go.

<H2>Ding-Dong the Witch is Dead</H2>

<P>Linux has some outstanding positives going for it. Here are favorites from
my rather twisted point of view (your mileage may vary): 

<P>In my opinion, Linux in general, and the KDE desktop in particular, has one
of the best, most flexible GUI environments around. Sometimes, I wish I could
replace the Windows desktop with KDE. Then again, sometimes I wish Windows
itself was just a shell on top of Linux (dream on, fool).

<P>Another great feature of Linux is the ability to copy-and-paste almost
anywhere using the 3rd mouse button. Just highlight the source text, and click
the middle mouse button to paste into the current cursor position. Simple, and
oh-so-elegant. This is the sort of job one does repeatedly, and with Linux I
don't have to remove my hand from the mouse to do so. This must sound strange
to most Linux folk, who hate taking their hand from the keyboard to use the
mouse. So, I'm a little strange. Be nice, I've been a prisoner of Windows.

<P>The security available for files is so much better than in Windows. Linux
gives you a much finer control over what you can do with a file. For one thing,
consider that a Linux file needs execute permission before it can be run.
Windows, on the other hand, will let you run just about anything. Once you get
used to it, you'll want this level of security in Windows, too (but you can't
have it: nah..nah...nah..nah..nah).

<P>Command Line Interfaces can color-code the directory listings (and the
"dir" command works without having to create a shell alias or shell script
for it), which is a feature I had in my DOS days using a program called 4DOS. 

<P>Any command that needs "root" (think of it as the Windows
"administrator") privileges to work will prompt for the root password before
it proceeds. Good grief, Toto, does this mean that administrative jobs can't be
run behind my back from my login id? I had always known that both Unix and
Linux had better security options than Windows, but this is great. In Windows,
I had to give myself Administrator privileges, or log in as Administrator, to
perform certain tasks. In Linux, I can be an ordinary user, and still have the
power to get things done.

<P>Linux also has a powerful alternative to the "fast user switch" in XP for
logging in as root.. It's called the "su" command. Type it into a command
line by itself, and it prompts you for the root password. From that point on,
only that command line, and the programs it starts, are run with root
privileges. The rest of your screen stays as you.  

<P>Yes, their commands are strange, and a bit cryptic, but shell scripts in
Linux make DOS batch files look like something out of the early 80's (oh,
wait...). A shell script is something like a batch file, but with enough power
to replace most "C" programs in daily use. There are two main flavors of
shells: cshell and bash. Of the two, bash is more commonly used in Linux.
Microsoft is going to add a new command line interface to its Longhorn release,
and it sounds a lot like a Linux shell (probably proprietary and incompatible,
of course). That should give you a hint how powerful Shells and Shell Scripting
are.

<P>Mozilla! Goodbye Internet Explorer! Goodbye Outlook and Outlook Express!
I've been using Mozilla Firebird for my browsing, and Mozilla Thunderbird for
email for a while now, and have begun using both in Windows as well.
Thunderbird does a wonderful job killing spam.

<P>Open Office 1.1! Everything I normally do in Microsoft Office I can do here,
including save documents in MS formats. I use this too in both Linux and
Windows.

<P>The Gimp! I had no need of an expensive graphics editor, just to clean up
pictures from my digital camera, but I needed something better than MS Paint. I
tried Gimp simply because it was free (yes, I admit to being a cheapskate), but
was shocked to discover how good this program is. It's not quite as easy to use
as MS Paint (that's because MS Paint doesn't do a whole lot), but when you need
something that's more powerful, you've gotta check it out. Now, I do have a nit
or two to pick with the program (like, give me the option to put all those
separate windows on a MDI form, so I can find everything), but on the whole,
this is the image editor I use in both Linux and Windows. I may even read the
manual for once!

<P>I could go on, but you can see the trend here. If a program is so good it
gets me to use it in both Linux and Windows, you start wondering why use
Windows at all. In fact, I use Windows mostly for gaming these days, and little
else.

<P>I may just throw away my ruby slippers, Toto. Linux has a ways to go to
satisfy Mr. Picky here, but I think I'm already home.

</b>
</p>


<p>
<P> Casting our minds back to early on October 28, 2003:  The entire Linux
Gazette staff (unanimously) decided to take the magazine to new hosting
for the first time since time-strapped founder John M. Fisk gratefully 
turned over guardianship of the publication to SSC, Inc. and publisher
Phil Hughes in 1996.

<P> There were a number of reasons for this; one of the two biggest was
SSC's covert deletion of material (including entire articles) from back
issues, and, repeatedly, totally ignoring our questions about those
removals, after we found out.  We tried one last time on October 26:
After 48 hours of no SSC reply to those inquiries, we decided upon
departure.

<P> So, early that Tuesday the 28th, we wrote a very polite letter to 
Hughes, thanking him for seven years of assistance and asking his
assistance in our transition.  We also asked him to fix SSC's (assumed
inadvertant) violation of past authors' copyrights in its recent
republications of old articles.  As of December, those violations are
<em>still ongoing,</em> e.g., replacement of the authors' copyright
notices with SSC corporate copyright notices (falsely claiming them to
be SSC property) on these two articles:

<P> 
http://www.linuxgazette.com/node/view/58<BR>
http://www.linuxgazette.com/node/view/61

<P> Our October 28 letter notifying Mr. Hughes of the staff's departure can be
read here, and is recommended:

<P> <A HREF="http://lwn.net/Articles/57161/">http://lwn.net/Articles/57161/</A>

<P> The above was approximately the state of affairs when we went to press
for the November (#96) issue, as reflected in that issue's 
<A HREF="../issue96/moen.html">Brief History of Linux Gazette</A> article.
<em>This</em> article aims to update LG readers on developments since then.

<P> 
The first and most crucial involves the <em>other</em> chief reason Linux
Gazette left its longtime home at SSC:  Mr. Hughes and his webmaster had
been consistently giving us staffers the very clear message that they
intended to change LG to have only dynamic Web content, with no more
monthly issues and no editors.  In effect, there would be no magazine,
and the http://www.linuxgazette.com/ site was slated to become another
Slashdot-style news/discussion site.

<P> In essence, this would have meant the end of Linux Gazette in all
meaningful senses.  LG was already starting to erode since the summer, because
several authors had stopped contributing articles in protest over the editor's
elimination, and the quality of the remaining articles was going significantly
downhill.  The staff's options were thus to either let this continue to happen,
or to move the magazine.

<P> Many have commented that they felt SSC has a moral right to run the
Gazette, because of founding editor John Fisk's 1996 hand-off to Mr.
Hughes and his company.  <STRONG>However, on October 28, the question we faced
was <em>not</em> whether SSC had the right to run it, but rather whether
it had the right to kill it, over the staff's objections.</STRONG>

<P> The foregoing is an important point to realise, because the situation
was then changed on us a second time, immediately after the November issue
went to press:   After we announced on October 28 that the magazine
would be continuing elsewhere, SSC apparently reversed policy and
decided to resume publishing magazine issues &mdash; using uncredited paid
SSC employees to assemble material.  We knew nothing of this until we
noticed the unheralded, surprise appearance of a <em>second</em> Linux Gazette
magazine (at linuxgazette.com).

<P> Accordingly, although the staff regret the confusion resulting
from this situation, it was not our idea, and it resulted from a sudden
SSC policy change outside our knowledge or control.  We're doing
everything we can to alleviate the confusion.  We also note that even though
SSC has reinstated monthly editions, they have not said one word about
reinstating an editor.

<P> We are likewise doing everything we can to avoid conflict with SSC in
this matter, and to discourage intemperate actions and commentary.
Unfortunately, this attitude has not been reciprocated:

<P> 1.  The very same day it received our notice of the magazine's
departure, SSC, Inc. suddenly filed a US $300 fee and trademark
application #78319880 with the USA Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO),
requesting registration of the name "Linux Gazette" as a service mark
(explained below).  On that form, SSC certified that it had used the
mark in commerce starting August 1, 1996.  

<P> 2.  SSC retroactively started adding the symbol "TM" to its instances of
our magazine name on its site.  "TM" is an unregulated symbol used to 
assert existence of a commercial brand identity for goods offered for
sale.  The same concept applied to commercial services is technically
called a service mark, and can be publicly asserted with an "SM" symbol
(not "TM").

<P> 3.  On December 3, 2003, we received a letter from Phil Hughes at SSC,
Cc'd to our DNS domain registrar, claiming "Linux Gazette" is an SSC
trademark and that our possession and use of the linuxgazette.net domain
violates SSC's commercial rights.  SSC's main intent appears to be
seizure of our domain name via invocation of ICANN's Uniform Domain-Name
Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP), without any need to prove their
entitlement in court.

<P> Our attempt to assess and respond to this attack on our Internet
presence &mdash; sprung on us right at our publication deadline &mdash;
is part of the reason for this issue being delayed, for which we
apologise.  (The other reason was our desire to change the logo and layout,
and this required updating several templates and scripts.)

<P> Here is is a brief explanation of the relevant portion of trademark law.
(I'm not an attorney, so people needing to make business decisions
should consult appropriate legal experts, rather than my analysis.)

<P> Trademark law, in essence, recognises your stake in any commercial
"brand" you establish in the market.  Contrary to popular misconception,
you as a trademark owner cannot prevent others from using your brand
identity in the general sense &mdash; but you <em>are</em> entitled to
stop others from offering competing commerical goods or services (within
the same trade or industry) using your brand to mislead your customers
into thinking you produced or endorsed them.

<P> For example, in hanging out my shingle as "Viking Network
Consulting[SM]", I'd be establishing a brand identity within my
profession:  In legal terms, my firm's name would be recognised as a
service mark.  I would thus be entitled to bring civil suit to suppress
sales of "Viking Firewall Installation" services by competitors, on
grounds of likelihood of my customers thinking I'd produced or endorsed
those.

<P> Notice that the reach of a trade or service mark, if valid and
legitimately owned by you, extends solely to (1) uses by others in
commerce, (2) within your trade or industry, and (3) in the same
geographical area.  I would not be able to enjoin a different Viking
Network Consulting from operating in Trondheim, nor Viking Senior
Computer Volunteers from giving non-profit help to retirees.  

<P> Broader geographical coverage applies if you pay US $300 every ten years
to USPTO, certifying you used the mark in commerce, within your field of
business, before any other applicants.  This is what SSC claimed, in its
application to USPTO.  If granted by trademark examiners, such
registration entitles the owner to put "&reg;" (a legally regulated symbol)
next to the mark, rather than just the toothless "TM" or "SM" insignia.

<P> This gets us neatly back to the question of who "owns" Linux Gazette.
It's a fair question.  The copyright question is clear:  All material
remains the property of each individual contributor and is issued under 
an open-source licence (OPL 1.0) &mdash; an arrangement LG
instituted early on because LG was always an explicitly free magazine. 
To quote founding editor John Fisk in issue #8 (Aug. 1996), who wished
to explain his vouchsafing of LG (a free magazine) to SSC, a commercial
company:

<P> <blockquote>
So, after chatting at some length with Phil Hughes about this, I've
decided to turn the Linux Gazette over to the Linux Journal. I think
that the Gazette has demonstrated the "proof of concept" &mdash; that a
freely available and open-to-all online publication is a great means for
sharing information and ideas. There are a number of great things that
could be done with this and I'm excited about the Gazette continuing on
in this tradition.

<P> Also, please know that the Linux Gazette has been, is, and will continue
to be an absolutely free publication. I can't stress this enough: I know
that many folks feel passionately about keeping Linux from any
commercialization whatsoever. I happen to disagree with this as it's my
feeling that a free and a commercial side can peacefully coexist and
actually encourage and support each other. That said, I've really
enjoyed knowing that the Gazette has been freely available to all and
that it will continue to be so. 
</blockquote>

<P> We agree that SSC had a well-established moral claim to LG leadership
from John M. Fisk, and maintained that custodianship well for seven
years.  Our view changed during the year 2003, with SSC's announced
plans to (in effect) kill the magazine as such, and with its refusal to
account for its surreptitious deletions from the linuxgazette.com
back-issues archives and their mirrors.  

<P> Consider, for comparison's sake, a hypothetical situation in which Linus
Torvalds announces his intent to shut down the Linux kernel project.  
The situation is closely parallel:  You have a collective effort
headed by one party, but in which copyright is retained by each
individual contributor, and material is issued under an open-source
licence.  We'd be sorry to see Linus go, but I doubt we'd dally more
than about a minute before forking the kernel and moving it elsewhere.
If he later changed his mind and resumed work on his fork, things would
be awkward (just as they are now with two Linux Gazettes), but we would
not say ours had suddenly became an imposter kernel.

<P> Moving on from moral claims, there are legal ones:

<P> SSC's recent legal claim to hegemony over the name "Linux Gazette"
strikes us as outrageously unmerited, and cheeky:  (1) We see no
indication that Fisk assigned SSC commercial rights over Linux Gazette.
If anything, Fisk made the opposite intention crystal-clear.  (2)
Separately and in addition, SSC's claim to have used the name in commerce
starting August 1996 seems, to our knowledge, materially false.  We can
find no offering of commercial services under that name by SSC or anyone
else.  And last (also separately and in addition), (3) the attempt to
use commercial trademark law as a ploy to strong-arm us &mdash; a 100%
non-commercial, volunteer-staffed community project &mdash; is
monumentally outrageous:  It's inherent in the nature of trademark
law that non-commercial uses simply cannot infringe trademark.  Period.

<P> A study of the Gazette's eight years of history suggests there's no
way in Hades it can be reasonably claimed to have been ever a service
offered in commerce, not in 1996 and not today.  As we hope to point out
in our draft response to SSC's attempted ICANN UDRP domain-snatching, 
SSC's acceptance of financial underwriting for LG from other Linux firms
(cited by Hughes as justifying his alleged trademark) doesn't make it a
service offering in commerce; it makes it a charity.  We think that can
be shown to anyone's satisfaction, including a judge.

<P> We'd like to stress that we still have no intention to undermine or
attack SSC.  In fact, we worked out on November 5 one of numerous ways
the two Gazette initiatives could work in harmony.  (This is transcribed
from an IRC discussion:)

<P> <pre>
Frank: anyone feeling sorry for Phil yet, btw? *G*
JimD: Frank, actually yes.  I have been for several days.
Frank: yes, me too...
       I feel sad that he feels to need to be like this... 
       but I do not feel sorry enough not to call him on this situation...
JimD: I won't let my sympathy for him deter me, either.
Rick: jimd:  Second your comments, and it reminds me of a related point:
      When you've embarrassed someone, it's advantageous if you can offer
      him a way out, rather than putting his back up against the wall.
      I've been guilty of doing the latter, in disputes with people.
JimD: I can't see a good way for us to offer Phil *another* way out of all
      this.  We've offered several.
Rick: It's a point.
      I had a half-baked notion, which I'm trying to recall right now.
      Supposing LG.com operated its CMS, and generated content on there. 
      They can do Web-things with it as desired.  The Web contributions
      then are one of the diverse sources of candidate material for the LG
      newsletter (per OPL) that is published monthly by the LG.net editors,
      canonical location LG.net, but then mirrored to lots of other places
      including LG.com.
      If Phil objected to particular content in any issue, he would have
      the option of not mirroring that entire issue.
      Other mirrors of course also inherently have that right.
      Advantages:  Saves face, doesn't require any domain transfers.  Phil
      gets Web toys, we get a monthly magazine, of which there then is 
      only one.
      Nobody has to rename.  Nobody gets censored.
      Also, the editors get editorial control over the magazine, SSC gets
      editorial control over the Web stuff (other than the magazine).
      SSC remains free to disclaim its links to the magazine mirror with
      "SSC, Inc. does not necessarily endorse blah blah."
      SSC can continue to claim that it's asserting trademark over the name,
      but not try to register it.  The editors can disregard the trademark
      claim in knowledge that successful assertion of trademark allows you
      ONLY to bar competing use of the mark in <em>commerce</em> that falsely
      tends to convince customers that those competing goods are endorsed 
      or produced by the trademark owner.
      (See:  Lanham Act, US Code &mdash; easily googleable).
JimD: I don't think Phil is in the frame of mind to take such an option
Rick: A point, too.  Maybe in time.
JimD: Yep.
</pre>

<P> At present, indeed, SSC appears in absolutely no mood to work with us,
but only to work <em>on</em> us, e.g., by launching surprise attacks on
our Internet presence.  However, the door remains open on our end, and
we continue to regard SSC as our natural friends and allies in the long
term.  We hope they'll eventually remember, despite injury to their
pride (but nowhere to their commercial interests), that they caused an entire
Linux-community institution to walk out en masse.

<P> Readers should rest assured that we are acting to prevent seizure of our
Internet domain, and will take other measures as required to protect our
name.  We <em>are</em> Linux Gazette and will continue to do our best at
being that.  Our readers deserve no less.

<h1>Using the HTML::Template module</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/okopnik.html">Ben Okopnik</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<p>
Recently, I needed to generate a Web page - the Linux Gazette's <a
href="http://linuxgazette.net/mirrors.html">"Mirrors and Translations"</a>
page, actually - based on the contents of a database. Perl is famous for
its ability to connect to almost any database via a common interface, given
its <code>DBD::DBI</code> module kit; however, the challenge in this case
came from the front end, the HTML generation. Sure, I could use the CGI
module to output whatever I needed - but in this case, I already had the
static page that I wanted to create, and saw no reason to rewrite all the
static content in CGI. Also, the final product was not to be a CGI file but
a generated HTML page. In fact, everything in this case hinted at
<b>templating</b>, a process in which I would use the static HTML with a
few special tags and a script which would then apply processing based on
those tags. This made especially good sense since it drew a clean
separating line between writing HTML and creating code, very different
tasks and ones for which I have different mental states (layout designer
vs. programmer.)

<p>
As with anything in Perl, <a
href="http://okopnik.freeshell.org/acronyms.cgi?string=TMTOWTDI&type=acronym">TMTOWTDI</a>
- there was a number of modules available on <a href="http://cpan.org">CPAN</a>
(the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) that could do the job. However, I
had used the <code>HTML::Template</code> module in the past, and the job
wasn't particularly complicated (although <code>HTML::Template</code> can
handle some very complex jobs indeed), so that's what I settled on. My
first task was to hunt through the HTML, removing the dozens of repetitive
stanzas and replacing them with the appropriate tag framework that the
module would utilize later. We had also made the decision not to display
the maintainers email addresses, even in the <a
href="../issue86/okopnik.html">munged form</a> that I use to deter
spammers; those of you who use our mirrors and want to thank these fine
folks for making LG available should be able to find an address link on the
mirror site without much trouble.

&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
</BODY></HTML>
...
<hr></pre>

Now, the challenge had shifted away from generating the HTML to just
dealing with code. What I needed to do was sort the data into groups and
subgroups - that is, there would some number of "country" headings, some
number of "mirror" headings under each of those, and either one or two
(WWW, FTP, or both) hosts plus a maintainer under each "mirror" heading. In
programmatic terms, these are known as "nested loops", and are not that
difficult to code. However, translating that into HTML terms could be an
exercise in kind of language abilities of which your mother would not
approve... if it wasn't for <code>HTML::Template</code>.

<p> 
<b>Note:</b> Using <code>HTML::Template</code> is normally very simple; in
fact, learning the basics of using it usually takes only a minute or two
(see the example at the top of "perldoc HTML::Template".) However, in this
instance, we're creating <i>nested lists</i> - a rather more complex issue
than simple variable/tag replacement - and thus, the coding issues get a bit
deeper. However, this isn't due to <code>HTML::Template</code>; if you
think about the issues inherent in modeling what is already a complex data
structure and then transferring that structure into a "passive" layout
language... truth to tell, I'm somewhat surprised that it can be done at
all. Kudos and my hat's off to Sam Tregar (author of the module) and Jesse
Erlbaum (the man responsible for TMPL_LOOP.)

<p>
<h3>References</h3>

The area that seems to strike fear into the heart of neophyte programmers,
more so than anything else, is the topic of <i>references</i>. Particularly
in Perl, where everything is supposed to be warm, fuzzy, and easy to
understand. However, understanding references and objects - in my opinion -
are the very things that take one from being a Perl user to a Perl
programmer. I'm going to simply show how references work with a bit of an
explanation, but the real comprehensive reference for references :) is
included with the standard Perl documentation. Simply type "perldoc
perlreftut" at your command line for a good introduction, and be sure to
take a look at "perldoc perlref" for the complete documentation.

<p>
First, in order to understand how the data structure must be laid out to
create the pattern that we need, let's take a look at that pattern.
Fortunately, in Perl it's easy to lay out the data structures to match what
they represent (whitespace is arbitrary, so you can follow your preferences
- but see "perldoc perlstyle".) What we'll want to do here is build the
structure that contains all the values we want to assign within the loop as
well as the names which are associated with those values. Those of you with
a little Perl experience are nodding and smiling already: the word
"associated" points very clearly to the type of variable we need - a hash!
Taking a single "row" (per-country entry) - Austria, as a random example -
here is how it looks:

<pre><hr>
%row = (
	tld	=&gt; AT,
	fqdn	=&gt; Austria,
	sites	=&gt; [
			{ 
			  http	=&gt;  "http://www.luchs.at/linuxgazette/",
			  maint =&gt;  "Rene Pfeiffer"
			},

			{ 
			  http  =&gt;  "http://info.ccone.at/lg/",
			  maint =&gt;  "Gerhard Beck"
			},

			{
			  http	=&gt;  "http://linuxgazette.tuwien.ac.at/",
			  ftp	=&gt;  "ftp://linuxgazette.tuwien.ac.at/pub/linuxgazette/",
			  maint	=&gt;  "Tony Sprinzl"
			}
		   ]
);
<hr></pre>

The above hash, <code>%row</code>, matches our requirements exactly: its
keys will be used to match (case-insensitively) the tag names in the HTML,
and the values associated with those keys will be used to replace those
tags. That is, every instance of <code>&lt;TMPL_VAR NAME=FQDN&gt;</code>
in the template will be replaced by "Austria" while this entry is being
processed.  Here are some of the less-obvious points of the above
structure:

<p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>anonymous hash constructor</i>, defined by the curly braces
surrounding each group, stores all the data in an <font
color="red"><b>anonymous hash</b></font> and returns a reference to it.
<li>In turn, the <i>anonymous array constructor</i>, defined by the square
braces surrounding the list of groups, stores all of the above references
in an <font color="green"><b>anonymous array</b></font> and returns a reference to it.
<li>The <code><b>sites</b></code> key points to (is associated with) the
reference to the above <font color="green"><b>anonymous array</b></font>,
and is the name of the loop that we'll use within the HTML to iterate
through all of the above data.
</ul>

As we create a "row" for each country, we will need to store all of them in
a list. Each entry in this list must, of course, contain a reference to
each row that we have built:

<pre><hr>
# Add the hashref to the end of the array
push @mirrors, \%row;
<hr></pre>

Note the '\' preceding the <code>%row</code>; this stores a reference to
<code>%row</code> rather than the hash itself (stuffing a hash into an
array would result in a generally unusable mess - key/value pairs in
effectively random order as array elements.) This is a standard mechanism
for creating multidimensional arrays, lists-of-hashes, etc. in Perl.

<p>
And - one more time, <b><i>with gusto</i></b> - HTML::Template's
<code>param()</code> subroutine, as most other subroutines in Perl and many
other languages, expects a reference to the array rather than the array
itself:

<pre><hr>
# Create a new HTML::Template object
my $t = HTML::Template -&gt; new( filename =&gt; "mirrors.tmpl" );

# Pass the listref to param()
$t -&gt; param( MIRR =&gt; \@mirrors );
<hr></pre>

"<b>And</b>", as Austin Powers would say, "<b>Oi'm <i>spent.</i></b>" Those of you scared
of the Big Bad References may come out from under the bed now. :)

<p>
Looking at it from the other end, the matching part of the template for
this loop looks like this:

<pre><hr>
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;TMPL_LOOP NAME=MIRR&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="maroon"&gt;
&lt;a name="&lt;TMPL_VAR NAME=TLD&gt;"&gt;
&lt;img src="gx/flags/&lt;TMPL_VAR NAME=TLD&gt;.jpg" border="1"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;TMPL_VAR FQDN&gt; [&lt;TMPL_VAR NAME=TLD&gt;]
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;

&lt;TMPL_LOOP NAME=SITES&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;TMPL_IF NAME="HTTP"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;tt&gt;[WWW]&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&lt;TMPL_VAR HTTP&gt;&gt;
&lt;TMPL_VAR HTTP&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/TMPL_IF&gt;

&lt;TMPL_IF NAME="FTP"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;tt&gt;[FTP]&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&lt;TMPL_VAR NAME=FTP&gt;&gt;
&lt;TMPL_VAR NAME=FTP&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/TMPL_IF&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
Maintainer:
&lt;TMPL_VAR NAME=MAINT&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;/TMPL_LOOP&gt;
&lt;/TMPL_LOOP&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;
</BODY></HTML>
<hr></pre>

To recap what we're looking at, there are two loops defined in the above
template, one inside the other: <code>&lt;TMPL_LOOP NAME=MIRR&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;TMPL_LOOP NAME=SITES&gt;</code>. Note that the outside loop corresponds
to the name of the parameter key that we assigned when passing the data
construct to <code>param()</code>, and the name of the inside loop is the
same as the key associated with the groups inside the hash we created.

<p><br></p>

However, fine as the above may be for static data that we can simply type
into those anonymous hashes in the 'groups' listref, static data isn't
often what we get in the real world. Databases are updated, file contents
change - and we obviously need to reflect this in our HTML. So, let's take
a look at a code fragment that does this:

<pre><hr>
for $tld ( @tlds ){
	# Set some temporary (per-loop) variables
	my @sites;
	my %row;
	my %line;

	# Here's the inner loop!
	for ( grep /^$tld/, @mirr ){
		# Parse the CSV into fields
		my @rec;
		my %site;
		s/\\,/&amp;comma;/g;
		@rec = split /,/;
		s/&amp;comma;/,/g for @rec;

		# Mirror listings don't require much data
		$site{ http  } = $rec[2];
		$site{ ftp   } = $rec[3];
		$site{ maint } = $rec[4];
		# Load it up!
		push @sites, \%site;
	}
	
	# Outer loop vars
	$row{ tld } = $tld;
	$row{ country } = $country{ $tld };
	# Ref to the inner loop, attached
	$row{ sites } = \@sites;
	
	# ...and load up the total into the array to be passed to param()
	push @mirrs, \%row;
}

# Feed the data to the hungry HTML::Template object
$t -&gt; param( MIRR =&gt; \@mirrs );
<hr></pre>

By the way, the data we're reading in looks like this:

<pre><hr>
AT,,http://www.luchs.at/linuxgazette/,,Rene Pfeiffer,nospam@here.please,
AT,,http://info.ccone.at/lg/,,Gerhard Beck,nospam@here.please,
BE,,http://linuxgazette.linuxbe.org/,,Cedric Gavage,nospam@here.please,
CA,,http://blue7green.crosswinds.net/hobbies/lg/,,Jim Pierce,nospam@here.please,
<hr></pre>

Now we have a highly dynamic chunk of code that will process the data that
we give it, generate the necessary data structure on the fly, and feed it
out to the template. <i>Voila!</i>

<h1>Songs in the Key of Tux: Songwrite</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/oregan.html">Jimmy O'Regan</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Songs in the Key of Tux. Over the next few issues I hope to introduce some of the many packages 
available under Linux for musicians. The topics I intend to cover include guitar tablature (this article), music 
typesetting, sound recording with home studio software such as Ardour and Ecasound, and creating electronic music 
with some of the various synthesisers around.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to e-mail me, but please bear in mind that I use a dial-up 
connection, and pay by the minute - so please don't send me sound files without clearing it with me first. If you think 
I haven't covered something in enough detail, I'll be happy to go over it again - everything in this series is open to 
suggestion, including the name (I was going to go with Tux#, but that might have confused Mono/.Net fans).</p>

<h2>Songwrite</h2>

<p>As well as a being a computer fanatic, I'm also a guitarist. In a recent lull between bands, I decided to start 
learning music theory; or at least, enough to create my own tablature. A friend introduced me to GuitarPro on Windows, 
which I still need to use for Internet access (Winmodem), and using it I eventually managed to learn enough of the 
basics to create my own tablature.</p>

<p>I wasn't satisfied with this however, and searched in vain for a suitable Linux-based program. At first I tried 
KGuitar, but it wouldn't compile for me, and the only binaries I found lacked MIDI support; I'm still learning, so I need 
to hear a playback of almost everything I enter to make sure it's right.</p>

<img src="misc/oregan/songwrite-screen.png" alt="[Songwrite screenshot]" height="325" width="567">

<p>I saw Songwrite mentioned a few times, but was put off using it by the screen shots available on the program's website; 
Songwrite is based on GTablature, but the author didn't appreciate the API changes of GNOME 2, and rewrote GTablature 
using Tk, and renamed it Songwrite. I find Tk intolerably ugly, and try to avoid it whenever possible, but I was tempted 
into giving Songwrite a try after seeing how far the program has come in the past year.</p>

<h2>Guitar Tablature</h2>

<p>Guitar tablature is the lingua franca of rock guitarists; many are self-taught, or received only basic instruction, 
and do not read music. Tablature shows the fingering layout of a song, and is therefore easier for guitarists to 
understand. Most of the tablature available on the Internet shows just the fingering for a song, in ASCII text. For 
example, an E minor arpeggio looks like this:</p>

<pre>
e|-----------------0--------|
B|--------------0-----0-----|
G|-----------0-----------0--|
D|--------2-----------------|
A|-----2--------------------|
E|--0-----------------------|
</pre>

<p>However, in the past few years, several programs have become available which allow guitarists with some knowledge of 
music theory to have their songs played back to them on the computer, removing the ambiguities of plain text, and the 
need for guitarists who can't read sheet music to own the CD. It was only a matter of time before Linux guitarists would 
feel the need themselves, and create software of their own.</p>

<img src="misc/oregan/songwrite-screen2.png" alt="[E-minor arpeggio]" height="325" width="567">

<p>Songwrite is one of the few tablature programs available for Linux, and despite its' early version (I'm using version 
0.12), it is quite capable. Among its features are:</p>

<ul>
<li> MIDI import/export
<li> Printing (using Lilypond)
<li> GuitarPro 3/4 Import
<li> Multiple tracks
<li> ASCII import/export
<li> XML file format
<li> Songbook support
</ul>

<p>Songwrite does have its limitations though; for example it can only support x/4 and x/8 rhythms (though in practise 
this isn't much of a problem), it has no support for harmonics, and though it supports string bends, it doesn't support 
releasing the bend, or whammy bar type bends. Songwrite is under active development though, and important new features 
are being added with each release, so it will hopefully only be a matter of time before it matches the software for 
Windows; perhaps even beat them - none of those programs can handle non-standard harmonics; but Songwrite's interface 
means it won't have to undergo any major overhaul to add this support.</p>

<img src="misc/oregan/songwrite-screen4.png" alt="[Note properties]" height="325" width="567">

<h2>GuitarPro support</h2>

<p>GuitarPro is the most popular of the Windows-based tablature programs, and several sites, such as MySongBook.com, have 
been set up so that people can share their favourite tabs with one another, and other Windows programs support the format. 
Supporting GuitarPro's format is therefore very important to anyone who wishes to make the transition from Windows, or to 
gain access to the thousands of pre-made tabs available in this format.</p>

<p>Having previously tried a pre-release version of KGuitar, I didn't have high hopes for Songwrite's GuitarPro import. 
There are several problems; it can't handle non-standard note durations (though it does support triplets), its recognition 
of repeated bars and linked notes is hit and miss, it doesn't recognise tempo changes and it has difficulty importing 
complicated tabs. Some of the features it lacks are not a problem when it comes to GuitarPro import, however; though it 
has limited support for non standard time signatures, it still manages to play back simple files without a problem.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>When you first run Songwrite, you are faced with a blank screen. Entering notes is as simple as with other programs: 
you click the line representing the string you wish to enter upon, and type in the number of the fret. To play it back, 
simply hit the space bar.</p>

<p>Entering chords is just as easy; and as a bonus over other programs, Songwrite can copy and paste any combination of 
notes and chords, rather than just individual bars. You simply select the area of music you wish to copy, and middle-click 
to paste. This also allows you to place chord fragments on other string groups.</p>

<p>Another feature unique to Songwrite is the ability to enter notes at any point in a bar; in other tablature programs 
you would have to enter rests before the next note. This is useful if you are transcribing music and aren't sure which 
chord or note is being played, or if the music starts late in the bar - lead fills and vocal harmonies can be entered 
much more quickly with this feature.</p>

<img src="misc/oregan/songwrite-screen3.png" alt="[Selecting an area of music]" height="325" width="567">

<h2>Things to watch out for</h2>

<p>When pasting, click on the highest string used in the chord. For example, if you wish to paste a G5 chord as a C5 chord,
then you should click on the G string. If you click lower, Songwrite will add extra strings to your fret layout.</p>

<pre>
e|-----------|
B|-----------|
G|--------5--|
D|--5-----5--|
A|--5-----3--|
E|--3--------|
    G5    C5
</pre>

<p>If you try to do something Songwrite doesn't support, it may end up as part of your file. I've had it add strange 
rhythms to files, thinking that the change had simply rejected. If you get an error message, use the Undo function, and 
check to see if anything noticable has changed.</p>

<h2>The competition</h2>

<p>Songwrite has only two main competitors at the moment (though there are several programs to help with the preparation 
of simple ASCII tabs) - KGuitar and Gnometab. KGuitar is possibly the best option for guitarists new to music theory; the 
most recent version added the ability to click the rhythm of a riff with the mouse button - KGuitar then attempts to 
figure out the note durations and time signature. I can't comment on how well this feature works, however, as I still 
can't get it to compile. From the version I have tried, however, I can say that the chord tool is wonderful.</p>

<p>I haven't tried out Gnometab, so I can't comment on it; though I can say that it has the best looking interface of any 
of the tablature programs I've seen.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>For the more adventurous types who may be interested in using songwrite, I'm attaching a tarball of GuitarPro files. A
lot of them don't import, but I have confidence in the development of Songwrite, so I'm including them to "future-proof"
this article. For the time being, however, I've also included midi files, so you'll know what they should sound like in
the meantime. [<a href="misc/oregan/examples.tar.gz">examples.tar.gz</a>]</p>

<h1>Using DCOP from the command line</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/oregan.html">Jimmy O'Regan</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>DCOP is KDE's IPC/RPC mechanism. If you understood that sentence, please feel free to skip the next paragraph.</p>

<p>DCOP stands for Desktop COmmunications Protocol, IPC stands for Inter-Process Communication; RPC stands for Remote 
Procedure Call. In essence, they are means by which two programs can communicate, whether on the same machine or across 
a network. In this regard, DCOP is similar to Microsoft's OLE Automation: it provides a simple way for developers to 
provide access to the functions available in an application.</p>

<p>KDE was originally attempting to build a CORBA-based component system (the GNOME project originally started as this 
project, but became a desktop project in a disagreement over the license the Qt widget set was using), but it was decided 
that CORBA was too complicated, and two simpler systems were introduced; KParts, for embedded components; and DCOP.</p>

<p>A DCOP enabled application registers at launch time with the DCOP daemon, and registers its functions. When queried, 
the dcop daemon provides a list of running processes and the functions they provide. This enables a range of applications, 
such as the DCOP browser, or the DCOP to XMLRPC daemon; but the one I'm going to look at is 'dcop', which allows shell 
access to DCOP.</p>

<p>Unlike other systems, such as GNOME's Bonobo or Microsoft's Automation, DCOP does not provide an activation system;
only running processes are listed by DCOP. Activating the application is left up to the user.</p>

<p>This article is about using DCOP to control KDE applications from the command line; links are provided at the end of the
page to developer information for those who wish to delve deeper into this technology.</p>

<h2>Using DCOP from the command line</h2>

<p>The 'dcop' program provides command line access to the DCOP system. The syntax is:</p> 
<pre>dcop [application] [object] [function] [arguments ...]</pre>

<p>To see which applications are available, enter 'dcop' with no arguments</p>

<pre>
$ dcop
khelpcenter
kwin
kicker
kword-4354
kded
knotify
kio_uiserver
kalarmd
kcookiejar
konsole-4300
korgac
klauncher
kdesktop
klipper
ksmserver
</pre>

<p>Let's have a look at klipper, the KDE clipboard service:</p>
<pre>
$ dcop klipper
qt
klipper
</pre>

<p>We can assume that klipper is the object we're looking for here; the default object (i.e., the one you want, to control
the application) is normally given the same name as the application, with or without "IFace" appended, or is marked as
"default":</p>
<pre>
$dcop klipper klipper
QCStringList interfaces()
QCStringList functions()
QString getClipboardContents()
void setClipboardContents(QString s)
void clearClipboardContents()
int newInstance()
void quitProcess()
</pre>

<p>Now, I think the most interesting functions here are setClipboardContents and getClipboardContents. In fact, I've been 
using setClipboardContents in a konsole window to add the shell output above:</p>
<pre>dcop klipper klipper setClipboardContents "$(dcop klipper klipper)"</pre>

<p>Now, to be honest, this isn't the best example, as it's a lot quicker to use the mouse than to type that, but it can 
become a lot more useful if set as an alias, e.g.</p>
<pre>alias klip="dcop klipper klipper setClipboardContents"</pre>

<p>I've always thought it would be useful to have post-it notes available from the shell - DCOP makes that possible.</p>

<pre>
$dcop knotes KNotesIface
QCStringList interfaces()
QCStringList functions()
int newNote(QString name,QString text)
int newNoteFromClipboard(QString name)
ASYNC showNote(int noteId)
ASYNC hideNote(int noteId)
ASYNC killNote(int noteId)
QMap<int,QString> notes()
ASYNC setName(int noteId,QString newName)
ASYNC setText(int noteId,QString newText)
QString text(int noteId)
ASYNC sync(QString app)
bool isNew(QString app,int noteId)
bool isModified(QString app,int noteId)
</pre>

<p>So let's add a note:</p>
<pre>dcop knotes KNotesIface newNote "A note" "Stuff I want to keep track of"</pre>

<p>Sure enough, a bright yellow note pops up. </p>

<p>Let's see what notes are available:</p>

<pre>
$dcop knotes KNotesIface notes
1->A note
</pre>

<p>After adding a few more nonsense notes, maybe I want to have them in a text file, so I wrote a silly script to go 
with a silly idea:</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
n=$(dcop knotes KNotesIface notes|awk -F- '{print $1}'|tail -1)
dcop knotes KNotesIface notes &gt; $1
echo &gt;&gt; $1
for ((i=1;i<=$n;i++));do echo -n "$i: "; dcop knotes KNotesIface text $i;echo;done &gt;&gt; $1
</pre>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>DCOP is a powerful means to control KDE applications. As more and more developers recognise its usefulness, we get 
closer to a nice blend of desktop eye candy and scriptability.</p>

<h1>A simple Pulse Width Modulation trick with Linux/RTAI</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/pramode.html">Pramode C.E.</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<p>
In an <a href="../issue95/pramode.html">
earlier article</a>, I had discussed the basics of realtime programming
with <a href="http://aero.polimi.it/projects/rtai/">Linux/RTAI</a>.
This article demonstrates a nice trick which you can do on your 
home machine, provided you are willing to hook up a simple circuit
to your parallel port (and, of course, run an RTAI patched kernel). I
also demonstrate elementary use of:
<ul>
<li>Inter-task messages
<li>Mail boxes
</ul>
<p>
Be careful when you play with PC hardware - don't come looking for
me if you burn up something! 


<h2>The Trick</h2>
<p>

You want to make an LED light up, slowly. It gets brighter,
brighter, brighter.... It should then
go off - again, little by little. This should keep on repeating.
By controlling the current flowing through it, we can control
the brightness of the LED - but trouble is, our PC parallel
port gives us only two voltage levels - low (0V) and high (around
5V). As this can't be varied, we will only be able to bring the LED
on and make it go off - instantaneously - which is not what we
would like to do.

<h2>Pulse Width Modulation</h2>
<p>

Imagine that you are cycling along a road, in a rather
peculiar way. You pedal hard for 3 seconds, then you sit
idle for 7 seconds - again, you pedal hard for 3 seconds
and sit idle for 7 seconds. If you keep on doing this, you
will cover the distance between two points in a certain amount
of time - by dividing the distance by time, you get an `average'
speed. What happens to this average speed if you increase the
amount of time pedalling? It surely goes up, and if you decrease
the  pedalling time, it goes down. In a similar way, instead
of applying a constant DC voltage on the LED, we apply a signal
of a fixed frequency (say 1KHz, period of 1ms). The LED will burn
brightly if out of the total 1ms period, the signal stays high for
say .8ms and low for only .2ms. By varying the duty cycle of the
signal (keeping the frequency fixed), we will be able to deliver
variable levels of power to the circuit, making it brighter and
dimmer. We are now able to do analog control in a purely digital
manner!

<P>
<img alt="[waveforms]" src="misc/pramode/pwm.png" width="247" height="159">
</P>

<h2>The Hardware</h2>
<p>

You won't need anything more than an LED (preferably a bright one)
and a 1K resistor. The resistor and the LED should be connected
in series between pin number 2 (an output pin) and pin number 25
(ground) of the parallel port. The 8 output pins (2 to 9) of the
parallel port can be accessed via IO port 0x378. Writing a 1 to
0x378 will result in only pin number 2 going high; writing 0xff will
result in all pins going high - you write some other pattern and
you can control the logic level at any of the pins.
</p>

<P>
<img alt="[LED schematic]" src="misc/pramode/led.png" width="160" height="78">
</P>

<p>
The resistor is to limit the current flowing through the
circuit to a few milli amps. The trouble is that the LED
will burn only feebly when you limit the current through it.
A solution is to use a transistor as a switch.

<h2>The Software</h2>
<p>

The basic idea is simple - we write a real-time task
which will turn on the LED, sleep for some time, turn
it off, and again sleep for some time. The total 
on plus off time is 1ms. Initially, the on time would be
0 and off time, 1ms. In the next iteration, the on time
would become 1*1microsecond and off time would become
(1ms - on time). In the next iteration, the on time would
be 2*1microsecond, and so on. In the 1000th iteration 
on time would be 1000*1microsecond, ie 1ms and off time would
be (1ms - on time), which would be 0. Once we reach here,
we start bringing down the on time so that it ultimately
becomes 0 and off time becomes 1ms. This process is repeated.
So, in 1 seconds time (each iteration takes 1ms, and
we have 1000 iterations), the LED will go from off to the brightest
possible level and in the next 1 second, it comes down to its
off state slowly.

<p>
Here is the code which implements this idea:

<pre>

#include &lt;linux/kernel.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/module.h&gt;
#include &lt;rtai.h&gt;
#include &lt;rtai_sched.h&gt;

#define STACK_SIZE 4096

#define MIN_ON_PERIOD 0 
#define TOTAL_PERIOD 1000000 /* 1ms */
#define NSTEPS 1000
#define STEP_PERIOD 1000

#define LPT1 0x378


static RTIME on_time, off_time, total_period;
static RT_TASK my_task;

enum direction {DOWN, UP};

static void pwm_task(int n)
{
	int step = 0;
	static int dir = UP;
	
	while(1) {
		outb(0xff, LPT1);
		rt_sleep(on_time);
		outb(0x0, LPT1);
		rt_sleep(off_time);
		if(step == NSTEPS) {
			dir = !dir;
			step = 0;
		}
		step++;
		if(dir == UP) on_time =  nano2count(step*STEP_PERIOD);
		else if(dir == DOWN) on_time = total_period - nano2count(step*STEP_PERIOD);
		off_time = total_period - on_time;
	}
}

int init_module(void)
{
	RTIME now;
	
	rt_set_oneshot_mode();
	rt_task_init(&amp;my_task, pwm_task, 0, STACK_SIZE, 0, 0, 0);
	start_rt_timer(0);
	
	on_time = nano2count(MIN_ON_PERIOD);
	off_time = nano2count(TOTAL_PERIOD);
	total_period = nano2count(TOTAL_PERIOD);
	
	now = rt_get_time() + total_period;
	rt_task_make_periodic(&amp;my_task, now, total_period);
	
	return 0;
}


void cleanup_module(void)
{
	stop_rt_timer();
	rt_busy_sleep(10000000);
	rt_task_delete(&amp;my_task);
}

</pre>

The pwm_task's code should be easy to understand.
<p>
Because RTAI ensures us that realtime tasks would always 
meet their deadlines, penalizing only non-realtime tasks,
we see that the PWM generation process continues smoothly
even when the system is heavily loaded. The time `step' of
1 microsecond in our code will be difficult for RTAI to 
achieve, but we won't be getting any visual indications
regarding it (unless we use an oscilloscope to watch the
waveform). Also, ours is just a `fun' program!

<h2>Sending Messages</h2>
<p>
Tasks can send messages to each other - a message is a simple integer value. 
Here is a small program which demonstrates message passing:

<pre>

#include &lt;linux/module.h&gt;
#include &lt;rtai.h&gt;
#include &lt;rtai_sched.h&gt;

#define LPT1_BASE 0x378
#define STACK_SIZE 4096
#define TIMERTICKS 1000000000 

static RT_TASK tasks[2];

static void task_sender(int t)
{
	int msg = 0xab;
	RT_TASK *r;
	r = rt_send(&amp;tasks[1], msg);
	rt_printk("sender: r = %x\n", r);
}

static void task_receiver(int t)
{
	int msg;
	RT_TASK *r;

	r = rt_receive(&amp;tasks[0], &amp;msg);
	rt_printk("receiver: msg = %x\n", msg);
	rt_printk("receiver: r = %x\n", r);
}


int init_module(void)
{
	RTIME tick_period, now;

	rt_set_periodic_mode();
	rt_task_init(&amp;tasks[0], task_sender, 0, STACK_SIZE, 0, 0, 0);
	rt_task_init(&amp;tasks[1], task_receiver, 0, STACK_SIZE, 0, 0, 0);

	rt_printk("sender = %x\n", &amp;tasks[0]);
	rt_printk("recevier = %x\n", &amp;tasks[1]);
	tick_period = start_rt_timer(nano2count(TIMERTICKS));
	now = rt_get_time();
	rt_task_make_periodic(&amp;tasks[1], now + tick_period, tick_period);
	rt_task_make_periodic(&amp;tasks[0], now + 2*tick_period, tick_period);
	return 0;
}

void cleanup_module(void)
{
	stop_rt_timer();
	rt_busy_sleep(10000000);
	rt_task_delete(&amp;tasks[0]);
	rt_task_delete(&amp;tasks[1]);
}
 
 </pre>
 The recevier task starts executing at the next timer tick. It immediately
 inovkes rt_receive. The first argument is address of the RT_TASK object
 corresponding to the sender task. Because the sender is not yet active,
 task_receive blocks. At the next timer tick, task_sender becomes active
 and sends the `message' 0xab to task_receiver. The receiver task comes out
 of the block and prints the received message as well as the address of the
 RT_TASK object corresponding to the sender task.

<h2>Using Mailboxes</h2>
<p>
A mailbox is a convenient mechanism using which multiple tasks
can communicate with each other. Let's look at a small program:

<pre>

#include &lt;linux/module.h&gt;
#include &lt;rtai.h&gt;
#include &lt;rtai_sched.h&gt;

#define LPT1_BASE 0x378
#define STACK_SIZE 4096
#define TIMERTICKS 1000000000 

static RT_TASK tasks[2];
static MBX my_mbx;

static void task_sender(int t)
{
	int msg = 0x12cd, r;
	r = rt_mbx_send(&amp;my_mbx, &amp;msg, sizeof(msg));
	rt_printk("sender: r = %d\n", r);
}

static void task_receiver(int t)
{
	int msg, r;
	r = rt_mbx_receive(&amp;my_mbx, &amp;msg, sizeof(msg));
	rt_printk("receiver: msg = %x\n", msg);
	rt_printk("receiver: r = %d\n", r);
}


int init_module(void)
{
	RTIME tick_period, now;

	rt_set_periodic_mode();
	rt_task_init(&amp;tasks[0], task_sender, 0, STACK_SIZE, 0, 0, 0);
	rt_task_init(&amp;tasks[1], task_receiver, 0, STACK_SIZE, 0, 0, 0);

	rt_mbx_init(&amp;my_mbx, 4*sizeof(int));
	tick_period = start_rt_timer(nano2count(TIMERTICKS));
	now = rt_get_time();
	rt_task_make_periodic(&amp;tasks[1], now + tick_period, tick_period);
	rt_task_make_periodic(&amp;tasks[0], now + 2*tick_period, tick_period);
	return 0;
}

void cleanup_module(void)
{
	stop_rt_timer();
	rt_busy_sleep(10000000);
	rt_mbx_delete(&amp;my_mbx);
	rt_task_delete(&amp;tasks[0]);
	rt_task_delete(&amp;tasks[1]);
	
}

</pre>
<p>
A mailbox is represented by a static variable of type MBX. We create a new
mailbox by calling rt_mbx_init. The second argument is the size of the mailbox.
The sender task calls rt_mbx_send and stores a message `msg' of size
`sizeof(msg)' in the mailbox. The receiver task receives the message by
calling rt_mbx_receive. The receiver will block until all the bytes of the
message have been received (or until some error occurs).

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
I started exploring Linux/RTAI out of curiosity, but I am being tempted to
learn more. I hope my excitement becomes contagious and more readers start
tinkering on their own. Just don't forget to tell us about your experiments!

<h1>Let There Be Music</h1>

<p>
<p>
Linux multimedia has been a field buzzing with activity. Many open minds have now contributed to make Linux a decent multimedia platform. Today many projects exist that make a large number of multimedia activities possible under Linux. If you need a good introduction to various sound utilities under Linux, you should read an excellent previous article on Linux Gazette found <a href="../issue47/ayers.html">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to include sound in one of the apps I was writing and began googling the web. I learnt that there are many libraries that make it possible to decode common compressed sound file formats like Ogg Vorbis or MP3. Playing sound on to your speakers is no big deal either. In this article, we'll see how to decode Ogg Vorbis and MP3 files by writing simple programs. This article has been written with beginners in mind, so Linux gurus, sorry for too much explanation of the simple stuff.
</p>

<h3>
Programming the Sound Card
</h3>
<p>
Before we actually get into the details of programming the sound card, it would be actually helpful to know how sound data is recorded, stored and played back on our computers.
</p>
<h4>
Sampling
</h4>
<p>
When sound is to be recorded, we ought to choose the quality at which we want to do it. One main criterion that determines sound quality is the sampling rate. Take for example music, it is just frequency that varies over time. If we want to record sound digitally, we note down the frequency of the sound at a fixed rate. This is known as the sampling rate. The higher the sampling rate, the better the quality of the music. For example, CD quality audio has a sampling rate of 44100 per second or 44100 Hz. This technique is used by devices called ADCs or Analogue to Digital Converters and is called Pulse Code Modulation or PCM.
</p>

<h4>
Bits and Channels
</h4>
<p>
When sound is sampled, fixed number of bits are used per sample and there are one are more channels. The number of bits at which the data is sampled is known as the resolution of the sampling. The most common form is a 8 bit unsigned byte or 16 bits. Data for different channels is maintained separately. For example, CD audio has two channels, Left and Right (Stereo). If you make a simple calculation, to record CD quality audio at a resolution of 8 bits, for 1 second it would take:
<p>

<pre>
		2 x 44100 = 88200 bytes

	(Number of channels x sampling rate)
</pre>
<p>
Now that we have enough information on the theory lets get started with the actual programming. There are actually a few ways to program the sound card. In the early Linux days, when drivers were being written, two separate groups were formed. Open Sound System or OSS was a group that wrote many device drivers and even included binary modules from sound card manufacturers who were reluctant to provide hardware specifications, or provided specs, but not without the driver developer signing an non-disclusure agreement. Since the hardware guys were reluctant to give out specs to individuals, OSS went on to create 4Front Technologies, a company. One more group ALSA, or Advanced Linux Sound Architecture wrote drivers only for those sound cards whose manufacturers were ready to give out specifications. ALSA drivers are now very popular. They have been included in the 2.6-test kernel too.
</p>
<p>
Note that ALSA provides an OSS emulation layer, so if you program for OSS your program might work on systems with OSS or ALSA. In this article, I'll try and explain OSS programming since it's simple and is present in majority of the systems.
</p>
<p>
Remember that under UNIX/Linux, all the device drivers have a file system interface, usually under the /dev directory. Most of the file related sytem calls like open,read,write,lseek,close work on these devices. The device files may be considered hooks in the file system from where the device drivers keep listening for requests. As an example, the file /dev/hda1 is the file that represents the interface for the first partition on the primary master IDE hard disk. If you open it using the open system call, you would be returned a file handle like in all file operations. If you now try and read from it, you would actually read data from the first sector of this partition! Similarly, a forward lseek will move the file pointer forward. To skip a sector, you'd lseek forward the size of a sector. Please don't fiddle around with your hard disk device file, its rather dangerous. Writing rubbish on to the partition will render it unuseable. You'll mostly have direct access to hardware devices only as root.
</p>
<p>
Having said that, lets move on to some code. This code should run as non-root without issues. In case there are problems accessing the device file, su as root and chmod and grant access. Ofcourse you should have a sound card thats known to work under Linux. Save typing by getting the source from <a href=misc/shuveb/oss.c.txt>here</a>. Don't forget to download the <a href=misc/shuveb/demo.pcm>demo.pcm</a> file.

<p>
The program listed above plays a raw PCM, 22 KHz, Stereo data file for 5 seconds. The program does three simple things:
<br><br>
a. Opens the sound device<br>
b. Sets the playback parameters<br>
c. Writes the data to the device

<p>
The open()/write()/close() system calls are the same ones used for normal files. To set the device playback parameters, we use the ioctl() (Input/Output Control) system call. The ioctl() system call is used to communicate with I/O devices and set their parameters. It might also be seen as a trick to decrease the number of invidual system calls. Its known as the programmer's swiss army knife. The signature of the ioctl() sytem calls is :<br><br>

	int ioctl(int fd, int command, ...)

</p>	
<p>
The first parameter is the file descriptor of the device, the second parameter is the request/command passed to the device and the rest of the parameters are command specific [See man ioctl_list for a list of commands]. Examine this:<br><br>

	ioctl(handle, SNDCTL_DSP_SPEED,&amp;rate)

</p>
<p>
This ioctl() call sets the DSP playback rate, the third parameter is the actual rate passed to the device driver.
</p>

<p>
There are three main ioctl() calls used in the example program. The first one sets the number of channels to be used for playback, the second one sets PCM format and the third, the rate. Since this is all the device needs to know, we next write the PCM data right on to the device file and the device plays it for us. We then flush the device with the final ioctl() and release the memory allocated for the PCM data. Thats it, we are done.
</p>

<h4>
Music storage formats
</h4>
<p>
	Man, just to play 5 seconds of 22KHz sound data in the previous example, 220 KB of raw PCM data was needed.
<pre>	
	22,000 x 5 x 2 = 220,000
	(sample x seconds x channels)
	
	So to play 1 minute of CD Quality audio, one would need:

	44,100 x 60 x 2 = 5292000 bytes or roughly 5 MB!
</pre>
<p>
Audio CDs store raw PCM data, but to store music efficiently in computers, and to stream or share it over the Internet, music is compressed to reduce file size and decompressed on the fly during playback. If you can see, the sampling rate is fixed, no matter what the nature of the music being played. Imagine silence being sampled for a few seconds, it would still consume the same amount of space as a loud rock number would for the same given time. Raw audio files don't compress well since there is very little data repetition which is important for good compression. Different audio formats use different techniques to reduce the size of the resulting file. The most common technique is to remove sound that the human ear doesn't care about, or to compress the audio stream depending on the music being played. The most popular format for music lovers is unargueably MP3. Since MP3 is now shrouded in patent issues, Ogg Vorbis is now welcome among members of the open source community. Both formats achieve the same reduction in size and are able to maintain audio quality with minimal loss.
</p>
<p>
Lets see how to play Ogg Vorbis files on our system, since we know how to tell the sound card to play raw audio data. For us to play Ogg Vorbis format files, we first need to decode it or in other words, convert it to raw PCM data. This will be done by libvorbisfile. This library presents decoding at much a higher level than libvorbis, which is quite low level, but allows relatively more fine grained control. Its really simple from here: We provide the library with the input data from a Ogg Vorbis file and the library provides us with the decoded raw PCM format data which we feed right into to sound card.

To compile this program use the following command

<pre>
gcc oggplay.c -oggplay -lvorbisfile -I/path/to/vorbis/header/files -L/path/to/vorbis/lib/files
</pre>

<p align=justify>
If the library file or the header files are in the usual locations like /usr/lib and /usr/include, then you can skip the -I and -L command line switches. All major distibutions ship with the vorbisfile lbrary, if your system doesn't seem to have it installed, you can always download it from <a href=http://www.vorbis.com/download_unix.psp>here</a>. You can also visit the Ogg Vorbis site <a href=http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/>here</a>. You need the development header files if you need to compile the program.
</p>

<p align=justify>
The setup_dsp function opens the dsp device, sets the three main parameters, channels, format and rate. You need to remember that these are the three most important parameters to set for audio playback. In the main function, other than the error checking, we have only two main things going on. The Ogg Vorbis file supplied as shell arguement is opened and user comments and information about it is printed. The sampling rate and channel information is extracted from the information structure filled up by the ov_open() library function and passed on to the setup_dsp function. The program then enters a loop where bytes decoded from the Ogg Vorbis file stream and placed into a buffer. This raw PCM data contained in the buffer is then played by writing to the dsp device which has already been setup. This loop continues until end-of-file is reached, finally things are cleaned up and exit happens. That wasn't difficult or was it? Thanks to libvorbisfile, decoding is so easy and straightforward.
</p>

<p align=justify>
To decode Ogg Vorbis files, the obvious choice is libvorbisfile, but if you want to decode and play MP3 files, there are a lot of libraries that can do the job. One library thats popular is the <a href=http://www.lokigames.com/development/smpeg.php3>smpeg</a> library which is capable of decoding both video and audio streams. One more library I came across is <a href=http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/>libmad</a>. We'll select smpeg and use its audio decoding capabilities alone. You can further explore its MPEG video decoding capabilities if you are interested. A sample application plaympeg is also provided that demonstrates the useage of the library. For Video playback, smpeg uses <a href=http://libsdl.org>SDL</a>, which is a very simple to use yet a very capable graphics prgramming library. There are many many more libraries around, but smpeg is provided by many Linux distributions and that made me choose it. The popular gtv MPEG video player is a part of the smpeg package.
</p>

<p align=justify>
Here is an example program that plays MP3 files. Please note that smpeg library plays the decoded MP3 stream directly on the sound card. We don't get to handle any PCM stuff. Also available <a href=misc/shuveb/playmp3.c.txt>here</a>

		SMPEG_play(mpeg);
        
		while(SMPEG_status(mpeg)==SMPEG_PLAYING);
        	SMPEG_delete(mpeg); //release the struct
	}
	return(0);
}
</pre>

<p align=justify>
You need to compile this program after you install smpeg which can be found <a href=http://www.lokigames.com/development/smpeg.php3>here</a>. Please note that smpeg needs SDL to be installed as a pre-requisite. To complie, you need to provide the paths to include files and library files. To make this process easy, the smpeg package provides a simple utility named smpeg-config. Compile the program with the following command:
</p>

<pre>
gcc playmp3.c `smpeg-config --cflags --libs` -I/usr/include/SDL
</pre>

<p>
Please note that its not the single quote character that encloses the smpeg-config command, its the character thats present along with the tilde (~) character in US layout keyboards, sometimes called a backquote. This character instructs the shell to inject the output of the enclosed command into the actual command line. If you run the smpeg-config command separately, you'll know what I am talking about. Replace the -I/usr/include/SDL command option with -I &lt; your SDL path &gt;. Even though we don't use any of the SDL functions, we need to provide gcc with the SDL header file path because smpeg.h uses it internally. RPM users should install both the smpeg and the smpeg-devel packages for the program to compile.
</p>

<p>
The library function SMPEG_new allocates a new internal object, while filling up an SMPEG_info structure which contains information about the MP3 file. In the program this information is printed and playback begins by calling SMPEG_play. Thing is this call returns immediately which is really good when you're dealing with MP3s in an application program because it lets you do other things. Since we have nothing else to do in the program, we wait until the file has finished playing. SMPEG_delete then releases memory previously allocated by the library and we are done.

<h1>A Look At Jython</h1>

<p>
This article discusses Jython, a software project that aims to provide seamless integration 
between Java and Python. This article requires a basic understanding of both
languages.
</p>
</div>

<h2>
Introduction
</h2>

<p>
There are many different programming languages. 
<a href="http://people.ku.edu/~nkinners/LangList/Extras/langlist.htm">The Language List</a>, a comprehensive
database of computer languages, puts the number at around 2500.
Having different languages is advantageous to developers - 
each language has features that are well-suited to
certain classes of problems. For example, when I'm transforming XML, XSLT
is my tool of choice (this is a popular method of rendering HTML for dynamic web sites). When 
coding server-based applications, I prefer languages such as 
Java, C++ and Python. I think the general advice for programmers is to "use the right tool
for the job".
</p>

<p>
One noticeable drawback in this abundance of languages is the inability (or extreme difficulty) 
in reusing code written in one language from another
language. For example, say you had written a database library in Java, and wanted to
reuse that library in Python. You could write a glue layer, using a technology
like COM, CORBA, sockets, or SOAP,
but that layer would take time to write. It would be nice if this glue layer already existed, 
ready to be consumed with little or no effort expended.
</p>

<p>
Enter <a href="http://www.jython.org">Jython</a>. The goal of the Jython project is to provide 
seamless integration between Java and Python. The project contains two main tools:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://www.jython.org/docs/interpreter.html">jython</a></b> - a Python interpreter 
written in 100% pure Java. This interpreter allows you to use Java classes in your Python programs.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.jython.org/docs/jythonc.html">jythonc</a></b> - a Python compiler that 
compiles Python source code into Java bytecode. The
resulting Java bytecode can be interpreted by any standard Java Virtual Machine.</li>
</ul>


<p>
This article provides a basic introduction to Jython. First I'll 
describe installation, next I'll talk about the jython interpreter, and I'll finish up
with a discussion of the jythonc compiler. I'll use the following naming conventions when 
referring to the different interpreters, compilers, and projects:
</p>


<ul>
<li><b>jython</b> - with a lowercase j, refers to the <a href="http://www.jython.org/docs/interpreter.html">jython
 interpreter</a></li>
<li><b>jythonc</b> - refers to the <a href="http://www.jython.org/docs/jythonc.html">jythonc compiler</a></li>
<li><b>Jython</b> - with a capital J, refers to the entire <a href="http://www.jython.org">Jython project</a>. 
This project includes the jython interpreter and the jythonc compiler.</li>
<li><b>CPython</b> - refers to the <a href="http://www.python.org">C implementation</a> of Python. This
is the implementation that most people are familiar with.</li>
<li>
<b>Python</b> - refers to the language itself. I'll use this term when discussing implementation-independent
Python concepts.
</li>
</ul>


<h2>
Installation
</h2>


<p>
To use Jython on your system you need two pieces of software: the Java SDK, and the
Jython distribution.
</p>

<p>
You can get Sun's latest Java SDK for Linux (1.4.2) at the <a href="http://www.javasoft.com">main Java site</a>. 
Sun distributes the SDK as a single binary file that you can download and run on
your Linux machine. After the install completes, the remaining step is to create an environment variable named
JAVA_HOME, and set its value to the root directory of the Java installation. I set this variable as part of
my ~/.bashrc file:
</p>

<pre class="code">
#
# For the 1.4.2 sdk
#

export JAVA_HOME=~/apps/j2sdk1.4.2_01
export PATH=~/apps/j2sdk1.4.2_01/bin:$PATH
</pre>

<p>
Notice that I set the PATH environment variable also - I do this so that I can access the Java command 
line tools (java, javac, jar, etc) from any directory.
</p>

<p>
The latest release of Jython (2.1) is distributed from the <a href="http://www.jython.org">main Jython site</a>. The
Jython project provides a graphical installer written in Java and packaged as a single Java
*.class file. When you run the installer you are presented 
with a graphical setup wizard, which asks you to specify the installation type, agree to the license
terms,  and specify the target directory for installation. When the install completes, you are ready to
use Jython on your machine. It is useful to update your PATH and CLASSPATH variables
to point at the newly installed Jython distribution. I do this in my ~/.bashrc file:
</p>

<pre class="code">
#
# For Jython
#

export JYTHON_HOME=~/jython-2.1/
export PATH=$JYTHON_HOME:$PATH
export CLASSPATH=$JYTHON_HOME/jython.jar:$CLASSPATH
</pre>


<p>
To check that your installation succeeded, type "jython" at the command prompt:
</p>

<pre class="code">
<b>prompt$</b> jython
Jython 2.1 on java1.4.2_01 (JIT: null)
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
</pre>

<p>
If you see the above, you've successfully installed Jython.
</p>



<h2>
Using The Jython Interpreter
</h2>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.jython.org/docs/interpreter.html">jython interpreter</a> is a Python interpreter
implemented in 100% Java. It allows you to write Python code that accesses Java classes.
</p>


<p>
The latest stable version of jython, released in December of 2001, implements features of
Python 2.1. Python, however, has already reached version 2.3. This means that Python features 
unique to versions 2.2 and 2.3 are unavailable in the current stable version of jython:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
	<a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.2.3/whatsnew/whatsnew22.html">New in Python 2.2</a>
	<ul>
	<li>deriving from built-in types</li>
	<li>attribute and method descriptors</li>
	<li>changes to the class lookup algorithm for complicated class hierarchies</li>
	<li>new built-in methods for attribute access</li>
	<li>iterators</li>
	<li>generators</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li>
	<a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.3.2/whatsnew/whatsnew23.html">New in Python 2.3</a>
	<ul>
	<li>new boolean and set data types</li>
	<li>source code encodings</li>
	<li>importing from zip archives</li>
	<li>universal newline support</li>
	<li>an enumerate function for clearer iterative loops</li>
	<li>new import hooks</li>
	</ul>
</li>

</ul>


<p>
An alpha version of jython, available for download at the Jython site, implements a 
mixture of Python 2.1 and 2.2. The Jython group characterizes this alpha version
as an unstable and experimental release that contains significant known issues. In other words,
use the alpha version at your own risk.
</p>

<p>
Besides lacking recent Python language features, jython is missing some Python
modules in its library implementation. On top of that, there is little documentation
describing which modules are supported and which are not. If you want to know if a module is supported, the 
<a href="http://www.jython.org/cgi-bin/faqw.py?req=index">FAQ</a> suggests attempting to import the
module in question. If the import fails, you can try to copy over
the corresponding *.py module from the CPython implementation. As a last effort you can 
request help on the public <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=12867">mailing lists</a>.
</p>


<p>
While the Python support in jython is restricted to version 2.1, the Java support is completely up-to-date. You
can use _any_ Java code from inside the jython interpreter. This includes the
standard Java 1.4.2 libraries, libraries written by third parties, and your own custom libraries.
</p>

<p>
For example, you could use Java's 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/package-summary.html">Abstract Window Toolkit</a>
(AWT). The AWT is a graphical
windowing library that provides widgets for creating user interfaces (windows, buttons, text areas, 
etc). You could write Python code that accessed the AWT, and then run that code using the jython
interpreter.
</p>

<p>
Here's an example of using AWT functionality from within Python:
</p>

<pre class="code">
#
# file: AWTTest.jy
#

#
# Import the AWT classes.
#

from java.awt import Frame
from java.awt import Panel
from java.awt import Button
from java.awt import TextArea
from java.awt.event import ActionListener


#
# Define the TestButtonAction class. TestButtonAction
# inherits from the Java ActionListener interface.
#

class TestButtonAction(ActionListener):

        def actionPerformed(self, e):
                textArea.append("Test Button Clicked!\n")


#
# Create the Frame, Panel, Button,
# TextArea, and TestButtonAction objects.
#

frame = Frame("Hello World")
panel = Panel() 
button = Button("Test Button")
buttonAction = TestButtonAction()
textArea = TextArea()


#
# Put everything together and show
# the window.
#

button.addActionListener(buttonAction)
panel.add(button)
panel.add(textArea)
frame.add(panel)
frame.pack()
frame.show()
</pre>

<p>
You can run this using the jython interpreter:
</p>

<pre class="code">
<b>prompt$</b> jython AWTTest.jy
</pre>

<p>
Running this code should produce a window similar to the following:
</p>

<img alt="[screenshot]" src="misc/tougher/awt.jpg" width="608" height="192" />

<p>
The example creates a window and adds a Button and a TextArea to it.
When you click the button, the text "Test Button Clicked!" is appended to the TextArea's
contents. The example displays a few key features of Jython:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Imports</b> - Java classes are imported using the standard Python import syntax. The above
example imports the Frame, Button, Panel, TextArea and ActionListener classes from the AWT.</li>
<li><b>Instantiation</b> - Java classes can be instantied, and their public properties and methods can be 
accessed. This is shown with the Frame, Panel, Button and TextArea classes.</li>

<li><b>Inheritance</b> - you can define a Python class that derives from a Java class, and then 
pass that Python class to Java code that expects a Java class as input. The example
passes the TestButtonAction class to the Button class' addActionListener() method. When
a user clicks the button, the Button class calls the TestButtonAction class' actionPerformed method.</li>
</ul>



<h2>
Using The Jythonc Compiler
</h2>

<p>
The second tool that the Jython project provides is <a href="http://www.jython.org/docs/jythonc.html">jythonc</a>.
jythonc compiles Python source code into Java bytecode. This Java bytecode
can be executed using a standard Java Virtual Machine.
</p>

<p>
(Java bytecode is the intermediate language that the Java Virtual Machine executes. When you compile a 
Java source file using javac, the compilation output is a file with a *.class extension. This
file contains Java bytecode, which you can execute using the Java Virtual Machine. For more information 
about Java bytecode and the JVM, check out 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec/">The Java Virtual Machine Specification</a>
)
</p>

<p>
jythonc suffers from the same feature lag as the jython interpreter - the latest jythonc release implements
features from Python 2.1. Furthermore, the alpha version of Jython contains a jythonc compiler
that is basically unchanged since the last release. It looks like jythonc will be stuck at version 2.1 
for a while.
</p>

<p>
When compiling a Python class with jythonc, you need to provide extra information
about each publically accessible method in your class. This information includes the return type,
arguments, argument types, throws clause, and access control declaration (private, public, 
or protected). You can provide this information in one of two ways:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Inheritance</b> - you derive your Python class from an existing Java class or interface 
that defines the publically accessible methods, and override those methods in your Python class. The
base Java class provides the information that the JVM needs.
<li><b>Docstrings</b> - you describe each method's signature in its corresponding docstring. The docstrings
need to follow a special convention to be available to the JVM.
</ul>

<p>
For example, you could write a <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/">Java Servlet</a> in Python
(servlets are Java classes that run inside servlet containers, like 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a> and 
<a href="http://jetty.mortbay.org/jetty/">Jetty</a>, and 
respond to web page requests).
You could create a Python class that derives from HttpServletRequest, compile that 
class into bytecode using the jythonc compiler, and run that bytecode inside of a servlet container.
</p>

<p>
The following is a simple servlet written in Python:
</p>

<pre class="code">
#
# file HelloWorldFromJython.py
#

import os
from javax.servlet.http import HttpServlet


class HelloWorldFromJython(HttpServlet):

        def service(self, request, response):

                response.setContentType("text/html")
                out = response.getOutputStream()
                print >>out, """&lt;html&gt;
                                &lt;head&gt;
                                        &lt;title&gt;Hello World Servlet&lt;/title&gt;
                                &lt;/head&gt;
                                &lt;body&gt;
                                        &lt;p&gt;Hello World From Jython!&lt;/p&gt;
                                        &lt;p&gt;os.getcwd() == """ + str(os.getcwd()) + """&lt;/p&gt;
                                &lt;/body&gt;
                                &lt;/html&gt;"""

</pre>


<p>
You can run this example using <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>. 
Tomcat installation is pretty straightforward - it only requires downloading the distribution
and extracting it to your hard drive. You should create an environment variable named TOMCAT_HOME 
and set its value to the Tomcat root directory:
</p>

<pre class="code">
#
# For Tomcat.
#

export TOMCAT_HOME=~/apps/jakarta-tomcat-4.1.27/
</pre>


<p>
The next step is to compile the Python servlet with the jythonc compiler 
(note that the CLASSPATH environment variable needs to be updated to include the servlet.jar archive):
</p>

<pre class="code">
<b>prompt$</b> export CLASSPATH=$TOMCAT_HOME/common/lib/servlet.jar:$CLASSPATH
<b>prompt$</b> jythonc --deep HelloWorldFromJython.py

processing HelloWorldFromJython
processing javaos
processing string
processing UserDict
processing copy
processing repr
processing javapath
processing re
processing sre
processing sre_constants
processing sre_compile
processing copy_reg
processing sre_parse

Required packages:
  java.lang
  org.python.core
  java.io
  javax.servlet.http

Creating adapters:

Creating .java files:
  sre_constants module
  javaos module
  sre module
  javapath module
  re module
  string module
  sre_compile module
  copy_reg module
  HelloWorldFromJython module
    HelloWorldFromJython extends javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet
  UserDict module
  sre_parse module
  repr module
  copy module

Compiling .java to .class...

[snip]
</pre>

<p>
The jythonc compiler creates a directory named "jpywork" in your current directory. This directory contains
the *.class file output of the jythonc compilation, along with supporting files.
</p>

<p>
The next step is to deploy the binary *.class files to the Tomcat server's webapps directory.
Normally you would create a new web application for your servlets, but for this example 
you can use the existing "examples" web application that ships with Tomcat. Create a new 
directory inside of that web application and copy the class files to it:
</p>

<pre class="code">
<b>prompt$</b> mkdir $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/examples/WEB-INF/classes/HelloWorldFromJython
<b>prompt$</b> cp jpywork/*.class $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/examples/WEB-INF/classes/HelloFromJython/
</pre>

<p>
Next add the jython.jar archive to the webapp's lib directory (if the directory doesn't exist,
create it):
</p>

<pre class="code">
<b>prompt$</b> mkdir $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/examples/WEB-INF/lib
<b>prompt$</b> cp $JYTHON_HOME/jython.jar $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/examples/WEB-INF/lib/
</pre>

<p>
Now that the Python servlet has been compiled and deployed to the Tomcat server, and
the jython.jar archive has been included in the lib directory, you can run the Tomcat server:
</p>

<pre class="code">
<b>prompt$</b> $TOMCAT_HOME/bin/startup.sh

Using CATALINA_BASE:   /home/robt/apps/jakarta-tomcat-4.1.27
Using CATALINA_HOME:   /home/robt/apps/jakarta-tomcat-4.1.27
Using CATALINA_TMPDIR: /home/robt/apps/jakarta-tomcat-4.1.27/temp
Using JAVA_HOME:       /home/robt/apps/j2sdk1.4.2_01
</pre>

<p>
You should be able to access your Python servlet using the following URL:
</p>
<ul>
<li>http://yourmachine:8080/examples/servlet/HelloWorldFromJython/HelloWorldFromJython</li>
</ul>

<p>
The servlet will produce output similar to the following:
</p>

<pre class="code">
<b>prompt$</b> wget http://yourmachine:8080/examples/servlet/HelloWorldFromJython/HelloW
orldFromJython

<b>prompt$</b> cat HelloWorldFromJython

&lt;html&gt;
	&lt;head&gt;
		&lt;title&gt;Hello World Servlet&lt;/title&gt;
	&lt;/head&gt;
	&lt;body&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Hello World From Jython!&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;os.getcwd() == /home/robt/apps/jakarta-tomcat-4.1.27/bin&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<H1> 1. Firebird </H1>
<!--docid::SEC1::-->
I have been using Mozilla Firebird for some time now and have stopped
my search of a better browser. I had used Mozilla earlier, but it was
so bloated that I switched to Galeon. However, if I had a beefier
system, I would have been happy with Mozilla, bloat or no
bloat. Mozilla took a lot of time to startup and came bundled with a
chat client and a mail reader, which I seldom used. On the other hand
its <SAMP>`tabbed windows'</SAMP> reduced a lot of desktop clutter. The
Firebird is a spin-off from Mozilla. The project aims to
develop software that is smaller and faster than Mozilla by extracting
and redesigning the browser part of the application suite.
<P>

The developers of Firebird started out with the aim of creating a
browser to provide an efficient (speedy, easy to use, useful) web
access. According to the
<A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firebird/charter.html">Mozilla
Firebird 1.0 Development Charter</A>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The goal was, and is not to have more or less features than any other
client (Mozilla included) but to have the <EM>right set of features</EM>
to let people get their jobs done.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
From what I see, I must congratulate the developers on a job very well
done.

<H1> 2. Installation </H1>
<!--docid::SEC2::-->
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>Using RPMs</STRONG>
<DD>I used the RPM to install Firebird on Red Hat 9.0. I am sure the hints
provided here will prove useful for installing on another RPM based
system. I used the RPMS for Red Hat maintained and built by
<A HREF="http://dag.wieers.com/packages/mozilla-firebird/">Dag Wieers</A>. If
you want to locate the RPMs for your own distribution, try searching
at <A HREF="http://rpmseek.com/">rpmseek</A>. Use <SAMP>`mozilla-firebird'</SAMP> as
your search string.
<P>

After downloading the RPM, you can install it from the command prompt <BR>
<CODE>rpm -ivh &#60;package-name&#62;</CODE>  <BR> 
</P><P>

If you had installed Mozilla or Galeon earlier, you should have no
dependency problems. Otherwise, you may have to search, download and
install other packages too to solve the dependency problems. Again the
best places to find the packages are
<A HREF="http://rpmseek.com/">rpmseek</A>,
<A HREF="http://rpmfind.net/">Rpmfind.Net</A> and
<A HREF="http://rpm.pbone.net/">Rpm pbone</A>. 
</P><P>

If you installed Firebird using the RPM package provided by Dag
Wieers, then you can launch Firebird by giving the command
<CODE>mozilla-firebird</CODE>. If you installed using the package provded by
some other repository, type <CODE>rpm -ql &#60;package-name&#62;|grep -i
/usr/bin</CODE>. That will provide you the command to launch Firebird.
</P><P>

<DT><STRONG>Using official Firebird Release</STRONG>
<DD><STRONG>Disclaimer </STRONG> I installed from a RPM and not from the official
Firebird Release.
<P>

You can get Firebird from the
<A HREF="http://texturizer.net/firebird/download.html">Mozilla Firebird
download page</A>.  At the time of writing, the website recommends to
install Mozilla Firebird 0.7. There are downloads available for
<A HREF="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firebird/releases/0.7/MozillaFirebird-0.7-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz">GTK (9.1 MB)</A> and
<A HREF="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firebird/releases/0.7/MozillaFirebird-0.7-i686-linux-gtk2+xft.tar.gz">GTK2
and XFT (8.6 MB)</A>. Read the
<A HREF="http://texturizer.net/firebird/download.html#install">How To
Install</A> section to learn more on installation. 
</P><P>

I will give a brief outline of the installation process. After you
have downloaded the appropiate tarball from the above mentioned links,
login as <CODE>root</CODE>. Unzip the files into the directory
<TT>`/usr/lib/'</TT>. Next, issue the command <BR> <CODE>chown -c -r
root:root /usr/lib/mozilla-firebird</CODE> <BR> In case you unzipped the
tarball into a different directory, remember to substitute the proper
name of the directory. That's all to the install process. To launch
your brand new browser, issue the command <BR>
<CODE>/usr/lib/mozilla-firebird/MozillaFirebird</CODE> <BR> However, if you
want to make it your default browser in GNOME and want to avoid the
hassle of typing the full path every time, see the next section.
</P><P>

<DT><STRONG>Installation in Windows</STRONG>
<DD>If you have a 100% Linux shop, you can safely skip this
step. However, if you have to use Windows, I would strongly suggest
that you consider switching from Internet Explorer to
<A HREF="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firebird/releases/0.7/MozillaFirebird-0.7-win32.zip">Firebird</A>. I
tested it out on a Windows 2000 PC. As in Linux, you have to just
unzip the files, click on the <TT>`MozillaFirebird.exe'</TT> and that is
the end of the installation process. The first time it starts up,
Firebird imports your IE bookmarks and also asks you if you would like
to make Firebird your default browser.
<P>

</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="Making it the default browser in GNOME"></A>

<A NAME="SEC3"></A>
<H1> 3. Making it the default browser in GNOME </H1>
<!--docid::SEC3::-->
Login as root and in your <TT>`/usr/bin/'</TT> directory create a file
called <TT>`firebird-remote'</TT>. Put the following lines into it
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#!/bin/sh
/usr/lib/mozilla-firebird/MozillaFirebird  -remote "openURL($@, new-tab)" ||
exec /usr/lib/mozilla-firebird/MozillaFirebird "$@";
</pre></td></tr></table>Just change the directory locations to suit your installation.  Use
<CODE>chmod a+x /usr/bin/firebird-remote</CODE> to assign everyone the
permission to execute the script. That is all the work required by you
as root. 
</P><P>

In case you are wondering what this shell-script does, here is a brief
explanation. When Firebird is invoked with the <SAMP>`-remote'</SAMP>
argument, it does not open a window, but instead connects to and
controls an already-existing process. The argument <SAMP>`openURL
(URL, new-tab)'</SAMP> creates a new tab displaying the specified
document. If you would rather have it open a new window, use
<SAMP>`openURL (URL, new-window)'</SAMP> instead. The page
<A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/unix/remote.html">remote control of unix
mozilla</A> has more explanation about this. Thie above script first
checks if we already have a Firebird running and displays the page in
a new tab. If it does not find one, it creates a new process and
displays the page in it.
</P><P>

Next, if you wnat to make Firebird your default browser in GNOME, you
have to edit the file <TT>`~/.gnome/Gnome'</TT>. You will find it contains a directive  
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>[URL Handlers]
http-show=nautilus "%s"
https-show=nautilus "%s"
:
[ other non-interesting suff ]
:
</pre></td></tr></table>Add or edit the lines so that it becomes
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>[URL Handlers]
http-show=firebird-remote "%s"
https-show=firebird-remote "%s"
ftp-show=firebird-remote "%s"
:
[leave this portion unchanged]
:
</pre></td></tr></table>Thats all to it. Your default browser for GNOME and its associate apps
like Evolution is now Firebird.

<A NAME="What is Good"></A>

<A NAME="SEC4"></A>
<H1> 4. What's Good </H1>
<!--docid::SEC4::-->
Firebird packs quite a lot of power under its hood. The feature I like
the most is <EM>tabbed-browsing</EM>. When you <KBD>Ctrl + click</KBD> on a
link, it opens on a page in background <EM>Tab</EM>. This way, you go on
reading the current page and the new page gets loaded in the
background.
<P>

Firebird stops annoying popup windows dead in their tracks. This is a
good example of a good thing implemented in a very non-intrusive
manner. When it blocks a popup window, it displays an icon in the
status bar. Clicking this icon shows a breakdown of the popup that
Firebird stopped when loading the current page. You can then allow
some or all of the popup windows to be shown.
</P><P>

Quite a few people think
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</A> means
an ugly user interface. Firebird is aesthetically designed, with nice
icons and colors. If you are not happy with the default look-and-feel,
checkout the <A HREF="http://www.texturizer.net/firebird/themes/">themes
collection on display</A>. Some themes simply change the colors of
Mozilla Firebird, others can change every piece of the browser
appearance. I have switched from the default theme to the
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/alfredkayser/mozilla/thunderbird.htm">LittleFirebird theme</A>, which reduces screen-space usage.
</P><P>

Firebird allows enhancing of the basic browser by use of
extensions. If there a particular feature which you think Firebird
lacks, check out the
<A HREF="http://www.texturizer.net/firebird/extensions/">extensions</A>
available. In all probability, you will find what you need there.

<A NAME="More tips"></A>

<A NAME="SEC5"></A>
<H1> 5. More tips </H1>
<!--docid::SEC5::-->
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>Plugins</STRONG>
<DD>Whenever Firebird comes across a page which needs some particular
plugin to be installed, it asks you whether you want to install the
plugin or not. It then takes you to the download page of that
particular plugin. However, you can get all the major plugins from
<A HREF="http://plugindoc.mozdev.org/linux.html">Mozilla Plugin Support
page for Linux</A> (or the
<A HREF="http://plugindoc.mozdev.org/windows.html">Windows page</A>).
<P>

<DT><STRONG>Block opening new windows</STRONG>
<DD>Firebird doesn't stop web pages from opening in new windows (i.e using
the <CODE>target="_blank"</CODE> or the illegal <CODE>target="_new"</CODE>
properties.) you can tweak your settings to do this. In the address
bar, if you type <CODE>about:config</CODE>, it takes you to the browser's
settings page. Use the <SAMP>`Filter'</SAMP> to find the string
<CODE>browser.block.target_new_window</CODE>, right click on it and
<CODE>Modify</CODE> the value to <CODE>true</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><STRONG>Increase text size</STRONG>
<DD>If you find the text size of a site too small, you can increase it by
using the <KBD>Ctrl</KBD> + <KBD>+</KBD> key.
