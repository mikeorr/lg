<h3><a name="Intro" id="Intro"></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>This article describes a Linux module that replicates its input
on all of its outputs, a so called "fanout" or "one to many"
multiplexer.</p>

<p><b>Purpose:</b> The purpose of fanout is to give Linux a simple
broadcast IPC.</p>

<p>Our own purpose for writing the module was to distribute log
messages to one or more processes that want to be notified when an
event occurs. We use /dev/fanout, a web server, and XMLHttpRequest
on a web client to build an alarm system with multiple web
interfaces running simultaneously. One nice feature of our alarm
system is that the web interfaces don't use polling but still
update automatically when a new alarm system message arrives.</p>

<p><b>Common Approaches to Broadcast:</b> The two most common
broadcast mechanisms in Linux are signals and UDP packets. You can
broadcast a signal to a group of related processes using the kill
command with a PID of zero. This works well if all of the processes
are related and if the program knows what action is required on
your signal.</p>

<p>Signals will not work for our application since there is no way
to directly route a signal from a web server to a web client, and
because web servers do not know that we want to redraw certain web
screens on a particular signal.</p>

<p>We can also broadcast events using UDP or TCP. We've built event
servers which accept TCP connections and broadcast event
information down each accepted connection. We use XMLHttpRequest to
request a PHP page that opens the TCP connection and waits for the
event. While this approach works well, it requires yet another
process and has the slight extra burden of an additional TCP
connection for each web client.</p>

<p><b>A Better Broadcast Approach:</b> A better approach would be
to have something like a FIFO, but instead of having all of the
listeners compete for the single copy of the input message, have
all of the listeners get their own copy. Consider the following
bash dialog:</p>

<pre class="code">
  mkfifo event_fifo
  cat event_fifo &amp;
  cat event_fifo &amp;
  cat event_fifo &amp;
  echo "Hello World" &gt; event_fifo
  Hello World
</pre>

<p>The message appears only once, since only one instance of the
cat command is given the fifo output. Now let's consider the same
experiment using fanout:</p>

<pre class="code">
  cat /dev/fanout &amp;
  cat /dev/fanout &amp;
  cat /dev/fanout &amp;
  echo "Hello World" &gt; /dev/fanout
  Hello World
  Hello World
  Hello World
</pre>

<p>The message now appears once for each of the three listening cat
commands. We use bash commands just to illustrate what fanout does.
Its real power lies in letting many different programs get
identical copies of a data stream.</p>

<p><b>Which fails: send or receive?</b> No matter how hard we try
to avoid it, one day we'll find a reading process that can not keep
up with the writing process. Allocating more memory postpones the
problem but does not eliminate it. When this problem occurs we have
two choices: apply back pressure to the writer causing the writer
to block, or let the readers miss some output.</p>

<p>The problem with blocking the writing process is that you may
affect other parts of the system. Our original purpose was to build
an alarm system and we chose to route all event notifications
through syslogd. Since we have /dev/fanout as a target in the
syslog.conf file, blocking the writer would block syslogd and
defeat the whole purpose of our alarm system.</p>

<p>The author of fanout very deliberately chose to cause the reader
to fail when it can not keep up. Data is stored in a circular
buffer and if a reader can not keep up with the writer, it will
eventually ask for data that is no longer in the circular buffer.
The fanout device returns an EPIPE error to the reader when this
happens. In our application for /dev/fanout we are happy to protect
syslogd at the expense of the web clients when we are forced to
choose one over the other.</p>

<h3><a name="Installsw" id="Installsw">Build and Install
/dev/fanout</a>
</h3>

<p>The source code to the fanout module is available as a
compressed tarball <a href="misc/smith/fanout.tgz">fanout.tgz</a>,
or you can pick up the individual files, <a href=
"misc/smith/fanout.c.txt">fanout.c</a> and <a href=
"misc/smith/Makefile">Makefile</a>.</p>

<p>Build the module with the following commands:</p>

<pre class="code">
  cd /usr/src/linux
  tar -xzf fanout.tgz
  cd fanout
  make
</pre>

<p>When you install the module you can set the size of the circular
buffer and can set the verbosity of the printk messages. The
default buffer size is 16k and the default debug level is 2. A
debug level of 3 traces all calls in the module and a debug level
of 0 suppresses all printk messages. Here is an example that
overwrites the default values for buffer size and debug level:</p>

<pre class="code">
  insmod ./fanout.ko buf_sz=8192 debuglvl=3
</pre>

<p>Fanout uses a kernel assigned major number so you need to look
at /proc/devices to see what was assigned. The following lines
create all ten of the possible instances of a fanout device.</p>

<pre class="code">
  MAJOR=`grep fanout /proc/devices | awk '{print $1}'`
  mknod /dev/fanout c $MAJOR 0
  mknod /dev/fanout1 c $MAJOR 1
  mknod /dev/fanout2 c $MAJOR 2
  mknod /dev/fanout3 c $MAJOR 3
  mknod /dev/fanout4 c $MAJOR 4
  mknod /dev/fanout5 c $MAJOR 5
  mknod /dev/fanout6 c $MAJOR 6
  mknod /dev/fanout7 c $MAJOR 7
  mknod /dev/fanout8 c $MAJOR 8
  mknod /dev/fanout9 c $MAJOR 9
</pre>

<p>If all has gone well, the "Hello World" example given above
should now work for you.</p>

<h3><a name="Design" id="Design"></a>How /dev/fanout Works</h3>

<p>This section is a high level design review of the fanout module.
We explain the design and architecture, and relate specific lines
of code in the module to the overall design.</p>

<p>The key to understanding how fanout works is to know how a
little about how read() works. If you were to open a disk file and
make five read() calls with each call reading a thousand bytes, you
would expect the next read to give you the data starting with byte
5000. Internally, the operating system keeps a counter, called
<tt>f_pos</tt>, that remembers where you are in the file. Once
you've read the first 5000 bytes, you don't normally want to read
them again, and since you aren't likely to ask for them again,
fanout can forget them. The mechanism used to remember only the
most recent data is a circular queue.</p>

<p>The fanout device uses the <tt>count</tt> variable to keep track
of how many bytes have been written so far. At quiescence, the
readers have all read <tt>count</tt> bytes (<tt>count</tt> and
<tt>f_pos</tt> are equal), and the readers are now asking for data
starting at <tt>*offset</tt> (which also equals <tt>count</tt>).
<img src="misc/smith/byte_counters.png" alt=
"Readers and fanout track bytes written" align="middle" border="2"
hspace="10" vspace="10"></p>

<p>When a writer adds data to the queue, the <tt>count</tt>
variable is incremented by the amount added. Each of the readers
must now wake and read the bytes between <tt>*offset</tt> and
<tt>count</tt>. After adding data to the queue, a writer wakes any
sleeping readers with the call to <tt>wake_up_interruptible()</tt>
in fanout_write().</p>

<p><b>Buffer overflow:</b> One of the fundamental decisions to make
in a design is what to do when a reader can not keep pace with the
writers. In many designs you would apply flow control to the
writers to slow them down to keep pace with the slowest reader. The
fanout device, however, returns an error to the slow reader.
Specifically, the reader gets an EPIPE error when it requests data
that is no longer in the circular buffer (i.e. <tt>*offset &lt;
count - buf_sz</tt>, where <tt>buf_sz</tt> is the number of bytes
in the circular buffer).</p>

<p>A reader does not immediately get an EPIPE after opening a
fanout device that's been operating for awhile because in the file
open routine, <tt>fanout_open()</tt>, we explicitly force the
reader to be caught up with the writers. The line of code that does
this is:</p>

<pre class="code">
    filp-&gt;f_pos = fodp-&gt;count;
</pre>

<p><b>Code notes:</b> It is said that programmers can read code and
know what it does, but they can not read a variable and know what
it <i>means</i>. So instead of reviewing the code, we are going to
review the variables.</p>

<p>The fanout module supports up to <tt>NUM_FO_DEVS</tt> instances
of a fanout device. <tt>NUM_FO_DEVS</tt> is currently set to ten.
Each instance of a fanout device is described by the following data
structure:</p>

<pre class="code">
struct fo {
    char     *buf;           /* points to circular buffer */
    int       indx;          /* where to put next char recv'd */
    loff_t    count;         /* number chars received */
    wait_queue_head_t waitq; /* readers wait on this queue */
    struct semaphore wlock;  /* write lock to keep buf/indx sane */
};
</pre>

<p>Let's look at each of these variables in turn:</p>

<p><b>buf:</b> The buf variable points to the start of the
<tt>buf_sz</tt> number of bytes allocated for the circular queue.
The memory is not allocated until the first open() on the device,
and the memory is allocated using kmalloc(). Allocated memory is
not freed until the module is unloaded.</p>

<p><b>indx:</b> This variable gives the location of where to place
the next byte in the circular queue. It is updated by
fanout_write() as bytes are added to the queue. When indx gets to
buf_sz, it wraps back to zero.</p>

<p><b>count:</b> This variable is the total number of bytes written
to the device. It is updated only by fanout_write() and a reader
has data to read when count is not equal to *offset.</p>

<p><b>waitq:</b> When a reader has no new data to read it blocks
until new data is available. Specifically, the reading process
sleeps in a call to <tt>wait_event_interruptible()</tt>. The
writer's call to <tt>wake_up_interruptible()</tt> causes the
readers to wake and continue execution with the lines of code
immediately after the wait_event_interruptible().</p>

<p><b>wlock:</b> While writers are writing to the circular queue,
there is a short time during which the count and indx variables are
not yet consistent with the data in the queue. During this window
of inconsistency another writer might run and inadvertently corrupt
the queue. The <tt>wlock</tt> mutex prevents this by locking out
other writers while one writer is updating the queue.</p>

<p>One final note on the code is the use of the
<tt>*private_data</tt> in the file structure. Fanout uses this
variable to store a pointer to the <tt>struct fo</tt> appropriate
to that file. The FanOut Device Pointer (fodp) is usually retrieved
at the start of a routine with a line of code like this:</p>

<pre class="code">
    struct fo *fodp = (struct fo *)filp-&gt;private_data;
</pre>

<p><b>Known bugs:</b> While there may be several implementation
bugs, the one possible design bug is that fanout assumes that the
file offset counter never wraps. This should probably be fixed.</p>

<h3><a name="Arch" id="Arch">Security and Obsolescence</a>
</h3>

<p><b>Security:</b> In our use of /dev/fanout we let a web server
read directly from it so that web clients can be updated when an
event occurs. Giving the web server direct access to a device file
is considered a security risk. You generally don't want your web
server to follow symbolic links and you don't want the file system
with the web server root directory to allow device nodes in it.
(The file system should be mounted with the <tt>nodev</tt> option.)
The fear is that if an attacker breaks Perl, PHP, or some other
component of the web server, the attacker might be able be able to
create /dev/hda1, /dev/mem, or some other critical device.</p>

<p>We will be using /dev/fanout in an appliance where, after boot,
we can at least drop the system capability CAP_MKNOD when we drop
the other system capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Obsolete already?</b> It is widely anticipated that one of
the next releases of the 2.6 kernel will include two new system
calls, tee() and splice(). These calls will probably make obsolete
the approach used to build fanout, and might make /dev/fanout
entirely obsolete. This might be a good thing since, from a
security point of view, it might be better to create a one-to-many
multiplexer as a variant of a FIFO that can be attached to a nodev
mounted file system. More information on tee() and splice() is
available in an article at the Linux Weekly News (<a href=
"http://lwn.net/">http://lwn.net/</a>). The article number is
