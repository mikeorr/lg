Dear James,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I hope you don't mind my contacting you, but I was going through the  Linux
Gazette and I noticed that you had a lot of good advice for those having
problems using Linux platforms.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
There is a new site (www.inforocket.com) where people with questions on
Linux and other computer-related issues pay people like you to answer them.
You can click here
<A HREF="http://www.inforocket.com//index.phtml?mod=categories&amp;category=computers"
	>http://www.inforocket.com//index.phtml?mod=categories&amp;category=computers</A> to
see all of the computer questions. In the column to the right is the amount
the person is willing to pay to have it answered. If you want to answer a
question, you need to register
https://www.inforocket.com/index.phtml?mod=regrocket, and then you just bid
to answer it, specifying how much you would like to be paid (if more than
the amount offered). Then you will be e-mailed if the person wants you to
answer it.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
There are several questions on the site that I think might appeal to you. If
you are not interested then please disregard this e-mail. Again, I hope you
don't mind that I contacted you.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thank you,
<br>Margaret Pesuit
</STRONG></P>

Hmm.  eBay (<A HREF="http://www.ebay.com"
	>http://www.ebay.com</A>) meets Experts Exchange
(<A HREF="http://www.experts-exchange.com"
	>http://www.experts-exchange.com</A>).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You don't seem to have a section devoted to Linux.  The
site is Lynx-ugly (though not quite Lynx <EM>HOSTILE</EM>, just ugly).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Most of the questions seem to go for less than $10 and have
somewhere between 2 and 230 bids outstanding on them.  I notice
that there is currently one $50 question with 237 bids on it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When <A HREF="http://www.linuxcare.com/">Linuxcare</A> sends me in they charge a couple hundred dollars an
hour for my services.  When I was doing my own consulting (sole
proprietorship) I was charging a bit over $100.  The "big fifty
question" I saw there (how to edit an MS-DOS <TT>AUTOEXEC.BAT</TT> file)
would take less than ten minutes to answer by voice. (I'm fairly
confident of that answer since I used to do voice line support for
Quarterdeck, then Symantec.  Many of those calls involved editing
CONFIG.SYS and <TT>AUTOEXEC.BAT</TT> and my average call time was 10
minutes --- a bit longer than my associates, but with much lower
recidivism).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
On the surface that would seem like a reasonably good deal for
me.  If there were enough of those questions I could make $300/hr.
But wait!  I'm not alone up there.  I'm in competition with those
other 200 bidders, many of whom offered to answer this question
for far less than the requested $50 (many offers were as low as
$3).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Considering the speculative risk factors (non-payment, under
bidding, etc) it doesn't look like a viable financial model to
me.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Let's compare this to Experts Exchange which has been around since
1996.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
At Experts Exchange you're bartering "expertise points" to
exchange your knowlege in some areas (or other forms of
participation) with that of others.  Thus you answer questions
about MS Windows to earn points and get answers about Linux or
UNIX. (You apparently also earn points for "taking surveys" and
"visiting advertisers").
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The FAQ at Experts Exchange humorously suggests you can use your
expertise point ratings as &quot;tangible evidence of their
expertise.&quot;  They even say that with a straight face and go on
to say:  &quot;This evidence may be used in resumes or letters of
recommendation...&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(I don't think they're kidding, but they SHOULD BE).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I hope that it's obvious that I don't do the "Answer Guy" column
in Linux Gazette for any financial renumeration.  (There isn't any).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I don't write the occasional article for the Linux Journal,
Linux Magazine, sysadmin Magazine, etc for the $100 check I get
out of it.  (In fact I've forwarded some of those off to the FSF
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/"
	>http://www.gnu.org</A>, in the past, and I try to send them at least
$100/yr out of my own pocket).  I didn't spend over two years
researching and a year writing my first book for the couple grand
that they gave me in advances.  (That book won't generate any
royalties until it pays off all of the advances --- that's what an
"advance" in the publishing industry is all about!)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have other reasons for doing this.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I gained most of my expertise by reading netnews, participating in
free mailing lists, playing with the software (more recently) by
searching the web for answers to other people's questions.  Doing
"tech support" for the free software and open source communities
is my way of expressing my gratitude to rms (Richard M Stallman,
the founder of the "free software" movement as we know it), Linus
Torvalds, and the thousands of unsung heros that actually write
all this software.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course my writing has brought me considerable indirect
benefit.  I've gained some recognition (a tiny glimmer next to the
bright likes of Stephen Tweedie, Alan Cox, Eric S. Raymond, and
Jordan Hubbard).  My reputation certainly has garnered me many
of consulting clients and job offers.  (Of course, I've known the
founders of Linuxcare, my current employer, since long before they
started this venture; but I hope that my work here helps them is
some small way).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Ironically I didn't come up with some "idea" of being "the Answer
Guy."  I just offered to help Marjorie Richardson (former editor
of LG, currently senior editor of Linux Journal
<A HREF="http://www.linuxjournal.com"
	>http://www.linuxjournal.com</A>) with technical questions that strayed
into the editor's mailbox.  She forwarded questions to me (about a
dozen in the first month) and I copied her on the reply (as a
courtesy, so she'd know that they hadn't just been lost).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A couple months later I noticed that my answers were being
gathered up into a column and that I'd been dubbed the "answer
guy."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Let me tell you, for a guy coming from USENet netnews, it's
pretty scary getting an appellation like that.  I've tried not
to disappoint my readers but I still feel a bit nervous about
being called THE Answer Guy!]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Anyway, I'm sure that some of my readership might visit your
site.  Some might even try it.  It does have the advantage that
there are more people answer it than questions to my column (it's
more "scalable."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, I'd also suggest that people remember the old reliable
USENet netnews.  Those who didn't know about them should learn
a bit about this old Internet and UNIX lore.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
USENet is free.  It consists of thousands of newsgroups which
are propagated to servers all over the world.  It's been around
for about 30 years, and is accessible even over UUCP (an old
store-and-forward system for mail, files and news that can use
dial up serial, packet radio, and various other transports).
Most better ISPs still offer netnews service.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are dozens of specialized client programs for accessing net
news (<tt>tin</tt>/<tt>rtin</tt>, <tt>nn</tt>, <tt>trn</tt>, etc) and netnews protocols (mostly NNTP
and NNRP these days) are supported by Netscape Communicator and by
emacs (using its Gnus package).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Despite the popularity of <TT>/.</TT> (<A HREF="http://www.slashdot.org"
	>http://www.slashdot.org</A>) I still
think that web based discussion forums are slow, clunky and a far
cry from Netnews.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Netnews is still around.  I haven't had much time to drop in on it
for a couple years (100 LG Answer Guy questions every month,
writing a book and working for a startup will really cut into your
other hobby time).  However, I decided to shuffle off to another
'<tt>screen</tt>' window to check it out.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Wow!  I just saw a post in comp.unix.shell by Barry Margolin.
The amazing thing is that I remember him from back when I spent
a lot of time in tin.  He's the closest that comp.unix.shell
has to an "Answer Guy!"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
And I could resist jumping in to answer a few extra questions
while I was there.  It's refreshing.  Of course I long since
dropped my own newsfeed into the house, so I had to telnet out to
my ISP.  I've never run tin there, so I had to fire it up,
and subscribe to some newsgroups (to create a new <tt>.newsrc</tt> file)
before I could do that.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Here's some of the newsgroups that I perused:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
comp.os.linux.advocacy<br>
comp.os.linux.alpha<br>
comp.os.linux.development.apps<br>
comp.os.linux.development.system<br>
comp.os.linux.hardware<br>
comp.os.linux.misc<br>
comp.os.linux.networking<br>
comp.os.linux.portable<br>
comp.os.linux.powerpc<br>
comp.os.linux.security<br>
comp.os.linux.setup<br>
comp.os.linux.x<br>
comp.unix.admin<br>
comp.unix.misc<br>
comp.unix.shell
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
...etc.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Be sure to read the FAQs for any newsgroup that has one before
you post there.  You can find FAQs for most newsgroups and many
topics in general at:  http: with no content for me).
