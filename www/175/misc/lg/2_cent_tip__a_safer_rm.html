<p>
If you've ever tried to delete Emacs backup files with
</p>

<p>
rm *~
</p>

<p>
(i.e. remove anything ending with ~), but you
accidentally hit Enter before the ~ and did "rm *",
you might want to put this in your .bashrc and .bash_profile :
</p>

<p>
function rm () {
  if test "a $*" == "a $(echo *)"; then
    echo "If you really meant that, say -f"
  else /bin/rm $@; fi }
</p>

<p>
That way, typing "rm *" will give you a message
telling you to use the -f flag if you really meant it,
but any other rm command will work.
(The "a" in the test is to ensure that any
options for "rm" are not read as options for "test".)
</p>

<p>
(It's also possible to alias rm to rm -i, but
that's more annoying as it prompts EVERY time,
which is likely to make you habitually type -f
and that could be a bad thing.)

Well, "preferred" is too strong of a term (unless you qualify it as
"preferred by me"); the numbers certainly don't support you. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

(Note: $@ is the same thing as $* until you put double quotes around it;
see "man bash".)

<p>
Unfortunately, mistyping the above as "rm * ~" would still blow away
everything. Aside from the 'rm -I' option that I mentioned, you could
possibly script around it this way:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
function rm () {
    if [ "${#*}" -ge `/bin/ls|/usr/bin/wc -l` ]
    then
        echo "To delete everything, use 'rm -f *'."
    else
        /bin/rm "$@"
    fi
}
</pre>

<p>
This counts the number of entries in the current directory and compares
it to the number of entries on the 'rm' command line. If the first is
the same or greater than the second, it spits out the message;
otherwise, it passes the list to the actual "rm" program.
</p>

I enclose my solution to the problem. It will come as no surprise to
those who know me that it is overkill. Nonetheless, I have used it for
some time and have found it quite satisfactory. It deletes emacs
backup files anywhere in the tree under the current working directory.
</p>

<p>
Further, because I have an interest in forensic analysis, I have not
deleted the original incarnation (which, of course, is not executed).
Anyone adopting (some of) my solution can delete the "exit" and all
that follows.

It could have been created as a function, but perhaps back then I did
not know about or understand functions.

Ah.  That's no good.  What if $matches has special characters?   Without
quoting it, $matches is guaranteed to undergo word-splitting.  You mean of
course:

<pre>
rm "$matches"
</pre>

<p>
... and the same goes for any variable really.  <strong>Use</strong> *more* <strong>quotes</strong>.
Always!

<p>
Also, there's a more efficient way of doing this in general -- rather than
relying on quoting, just get find to NUL-terminate the files.

1. Your suggestion won't work:

	find /tmp | grep qqq
/tmp/qqqq
/tmp/qqqr
/tmp/qqqs

	echo $aaa
/tmp/qqqq /tmp/qqqr /tmp/qqqs
	rm "$aaa"
rm: /tmp/qqqq
/tmp/qqqr
/tmp/qqqs: No such file or directory
</pre>

<p>
2. "cleanup" is for me. It is used to clean up files <strong>I</strong> have been
editing with emacs. Such files <strong>  NEVER  </strong> contain special characters.
(Why would they?)
</p>

<p>
I cannot recall any occasion when cleanup.sh has caused me grief.
</p>



<pre>
&gt;Also, there's a more efficient way of doing this in general -- rather than

&gt;
&gt;``
&gt;find . \( -name '*~' -o -name '.*~' \) -print0 | xargs -0 rm
&gt;''
</pre>

<p>
The above deletes without prompting.
</p>

<p>
I'm an extremely cautious person. Before I delete, I display the files
that will be deleted. Before the delete takes place, I have to confirm.
(I also wear a belt and braces <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">.
</p>

<p>
But I understand that my way is not to everyone's taste.
</p>

<p>
BTW, efficiency is not really an issue. The big gain for me in
efficiency was going from 4 finds to one. I only found that out when I
invoked "cleanup" on a very big directory tree. After that, the object
of the exercise (for me) was to not inadvertently delete the wrong
things. Hence the checking. And hence, originally, the default on the
prompt to NOT delete. I had to enter exactly "y" for the delete to
occur.
</p>

<p>
I felt quite brave when I changed the default from "do not delete" to
"delete" - after 8 years!

Whoops. Except, maybe, in this case.

<p>
In general, I agree with Thomas: most shell scripts are missing a
significant number of critically-necessary quotes, making them quite
fragile. However, in the above situation, $match contains multiple
strings - and given the way that shells generally concatenate strings,
you already have a problem. Consider:
</p>

<pre>
ben at Jotunheim:/tmp/x$ touch a b c\ d
ben at Jotunheim:/tmp/x$ files=`find -type f`
ben at Jotunheim:/tmp/x$ echo $files
./c d ./b ./a
</pre>

<p>
At this point, quotes will not help a whole lot.
</p>


<pre>

Well, wait a minute. Since we're doing this in TAG, which is intended to
be exposed to a rather broad readership, that's not a reasonable
standard. At that point, we might as well go back and say "well, <strong>I</strong>
always double-check my typing before hitting 'Enter', so this tip isn't
even worth talking about!" But that's not the case here; what we're
trying to do is inform that readership about the issues that exist as
well as the broader issues around them - so saying "it works for me" is
insufficient.
</p>

<p>
Between you and Thomas, you've exposed a rather important problem that
comes up in shell scripting - and it would be a good idea to show how to
deal with that problem.
</p>

<p>
The solution that Thomas proposed - the null-terminated '-print0' and
"xargs" - is a pretty good one, but somewhat limited in that you can't
break into that loop (e.g., to print the names of the files, as you do).
As a result, showing a listing of all the files takes an extra 'find'
command (instead of reusing the results.) Yours handles the above by
storing a list of files - but it's not very friendly (i.e., will fail)
with odd filenames. So, we need something that will slide between those
two.
</p>

<p>
How about this:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
#!/bin/bash
# Created by Ben Okopnik on Tue May 18 10:52:20 EDT 2010
 
files=$( find $PWD \( -name '*~' -o -name '.*~' \) )
 
read -p "Enter 'y' to delete the following files:
$files
"
 
echo $REPLY|grep -qi '^y$'
[ "$?" -eq 0 ] || exit
 
# Change the IFS to a single '\n'
IFS='
'
 
for f in $files
do
    rm "$f"
done
</pre>


<pre>
&gt; I'm an extremely cautious person. Before I delete, I display the files
&gt; that will be deleted. Before the delete takes place, I have to confirm.
&gt; (I also wear a belt and braces <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">.
</pre>

<p>
That's a good idea, in general. I like using "echo" instead of "rm" or
even instead of "mv" in my scripts while I'm testing them; it's
prevented much suffering.
