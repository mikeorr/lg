<h1>The things I do with digital photography on Linux</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/silva.html">Anderson Silva</a></b></p>


<p>
	  I've been a Linux user for almost fifteen years, and a digital
photography enthusiast for about ten. I bought my first digital camera back
in the late 90s while in college, which I used mostly for sharing pictures
of my family with my parents, who live in Brazil.  About five or six years
ago, I crossed the line from family photos to photography as a hobby. I
still cannot quite put into words exactly what photography means to me. All
I can say is that it is a form of art, and I find it beautiful and
inspiring. One of the things I have discovered throughout the years is that
a lot of photography is not about having the big, expensive equipment, but
being at the right place at the right time. The trick sometimes is
realizing that you are there.
</p>
    
<p>
	 That is when I started to carry my camera with me more often. I started
carrying it around with me everywhere I went; from going to work to getting
my car's oil changed at the local mechanic. I got so used to carrying it
around with me that I became a fan of compact, point-and-shoot cameras: I
could simply carry it in my jeans pocket, and pull it out anytime I thought
a moment was worth capturing. Believe it or not, I decided to purchase
a 'bigger, better' camera only just a couple of months ago, and I have finally made
the transition to a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_single-lens_reflex_camera" id=eo-9
title=DSLR>DSLR</a> camera, which has provided me with quite a bit of
flexibility to shoot photos -- yet, not as easy to drag around everywhere I
go, and that is why, even with my DSLR, I still keep my point-and-shoot
around. Even though it is rare, there have been occasions where I was
presented with a moment that I so desperately wanted to capture that I
even used my cellphone camera to do so. That is how desperate I get to take
photos. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
</p>
    
<p>
      In this article, I will attempt to share with you how I use Linux to
manage, edit, and share my photos. With that said, I will warn you right
now that I am not a professional photographer: it is something I enjoy,
something I am constantly learning about, yet what I do with my photos may
or may not be what a professional photographer would recommend.
</p>
    
<p>
      So, how does one start talking about all that? Since I am not quite
sure, I decided to just pick a starting point: equipment.
</p>
    
<h3>The Equipment</h3>
    
<p>
      Currently, I have three different devices to take photos. They are:
</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        iPhone 3G
      </li>
      <li>
        Samsung TL34hd (a.k.a. Samsung NV100HD outside the US)
      </li>
      <li>
        Canon EOS Rebel XSi w/ lenses:
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Canon EF-S 18-55 mm IS
      </li>
      <li>
        Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM
      </li>
    </ul>
    
<p>
	 Yes, you read it right, I consider my cellphone's built-in camera good
enough to be part of my hobby in photography. The one thing that all of the
above devices have in common is that Linux, at least my distribution of
choice (<a href="http://www.fedoraproject.org" id=bg3n title="Fedora
Linux">Fedora Linux</a>), recognizes all of them as storage devices -- and
GNOME, my desktop manager of choice, automatically prompts me to
import the photos directly from my phone or SD Cards via <em>gthumb</em> . In
this very first step of importing my photos, I must decide two things:
</p>
    
<p>
      First, the directory structure in which I am going to save my photos:
I usually archive my photos based on the dates I have taken them, using the
'YYYYMMDD' format. For example, the photos I transferred today were
saved under ~/Pictures/20091101. The second decision is whether I want to
keep the original photos on my SD card or delete them after the transfer is
complete. I usually delete them.
</p>

      <img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_38djb7ffcj_b.jpg" style="WIDTH:648px; HEIGHT:405px">
</div>

<h3>The Process</h3>

<p>
	 Once you have your photos on your file system, you have a few choices
of applications to manage your work. I personally prefer using <a
href="http://picasa.google.com/linux/" id=faez title="Google's
Picasa">Google's <em>Picasa</em></a> - but it is not open source, usually lags
behind the Windows version, and uses a customized version of WINE to run.
In this article, I am only going to discuss using Picasa, but if you want
to stick with 100% open-source solutions, take a look at: <em>F-Spot</em>,
<em>Shotwell</em>, and <em>DigiKam</em>, which I will actually mention a
bit more, later on.
</p>
    
<div id=ri_9 style=TEXT-ALIGN:center>
      <img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_39d8fwbcgk_b.jpg" style="WIDTH:648px; HEIGHT:405px">
</div>

<p>
      There are four simple, main reasons why I use Picasa over an
alternative open-source application:
</p>
    
<ol>
      <li>
		I am able to do a lot of the mass editing I need to do with my
photos. Picasa offers a limited but very well defined set of
functions that I can apply to my photos. I can crop, tweak shadow,
highlight and modify lighting, saturation, and sharpening levels. I can reduce red
eye, rotate photos, auto enhance (something I try not to do often), and
apply some standard effects like: black &amp; white, sepia, glow, and tint. 
      </li>
      <li>
		One of the online services I use to share some of my photos is <a
href="http://picasaweb.google.com" id=j72k title="Google's Picasa Web
Album">Google's Picasa Web Album</a>, and even though both F-Spot and
DigiKam can also upload photos to it, Picasa is the only one (at least that
I know of) that lets you backup your existing online photos to your hard
drive.
      </li>
      <li>
	 I find that Picasa's effects and tuning tools work better on the
photos than those of F-Spot or DigiKam, but, then again, I think that is mostly a
personal preference.
      </li>
      <li>
		Finally, the most important reason why I choose
Picasa over other alternatives is because Picasa is also available for
Windows and Mac OS. I find it easier to suggest to others who may not
use Linux an application that I also have access to, and can
help them use to solve their own issues with photo management.
      </li>
    </ol>
  
<p>
    Once I have all my photos organized, edited, and tweaked on Picasa, I
usually ask myself one question: Is this a photo I want to share with my
family or with the world? If the answer is 'family', and most of them are,
I usually select the photos in question and upload them to Picasa Web
Album. Now, if the answer is 'world,' at least three things will happen:
</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
       I will tweak the photo a bit more on Picasa, sometimes adding extra
shadows or fading away the color to give a more 'artsy' feeling to it.
    </li>
    <li>
	  I will export the photo from Picasa, usually at the 1600px size and
the highest image quality, and then apply some final touches using The
GIMP.
    </li>
    <li>
	  Finally, I will upload the final product to Yahoo's <a
href="http://www.flickr.com/" id=cjh6 title=Flickr>Flickr</a>. I have grown to
really enjoy Flickr, not only due to its functionality, but because of the
community that grew up around it. I have learned a lot from other Flickr
users by exchanging ideas on each other's photos and by simply being
inspired by the work of others. Flickr also provides a very easy and
intuitive way to keep your photos 'Open Source' under the <a
href=http://creativecommons.org/ id=jyga title="Creative Commons">Creative
Commons</a> License.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
<h3>
  The GIMP
</h3>

<p>
   In the world of digital photography, it is very hard to carry out a
conversation or write an article without mentioning Adobe Photoshop.
Virtually all professional photographers use it, and a lot of hobbyists do
as well. In our world, the Open Source world, there have been many
discussions and articles about where <em>The GIMP</em>
 can and cannot fill the void for Photoshop users.  This article is not
about that, since I am not good enough with either The GIMP or Photoshop. I can
use both just enough to be dangerous, but not enough to be good. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
</p>
  
<div id=ik-b style=TEXT-ALIGN:center>
	<img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_41cktxdsgp_b.jpg" style="WIDTH:648px; HEIGHT:405px"><br>
        <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afsilva/3898492514" id=pf4q title=http://www.flickr.com/photos/afsilva/3898492514>http://www.flickr.com/photos/afsilva/3898492514</a>
</div>

<p>
      One of my favorite tricks to use with The GIMP, which works almost the
same way in Photoshop, is to create a duplicate layer of the photo you are
editing, and then:
</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        Select the top layer
      </li>
      <li>
        Go to Filters -&gt; Blur -&gt; Gaussian Blur...
      </li>
      <li>
        Change both Horizontal and Vertical Blur Radius to somewhere between 20 and 30
      </li>
      <li>
        Click OK
      </li>
      <li>
        Under the floating window of Layers, Channels..., change the Mode from Normal to Multiply.
      </li>
    </ol>
    
<p>
      The result is usually a ghostly, foggy photo that adds a lot of
emotion to your shot. If the photo turns out too dark, I also tweak the
Opacity slide bar right underneath the Layer Mode.
</p>
    
<div id=d-50 style=TEXT-ALIGN:center>
      <img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_42c95gdm35_b.jpg" style="WIDTH:648px; HEIGHT:455.373px"><br>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afsilva/1075022878/" id="zqf:" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afsilva/1075022878/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/afsilva/1075022878/</a>
</div>
    
<p>
      The above photo was also created in The GIMP by creating multiple
duplicate layers of a color photo and a black and white photo, and using the
magic wand to erase certain areas of the black and white photo exposing the
color underneath.
</p>
    
<h3>Panoramas</h3>

<p>
	 One special type of photos that I have started working on recently is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panoramic_photography" id=htu8
title="panoramic photos">panoramic photos</a> , a technique for
capturing photos with an 'elongated field of view.' The proper way to
create usually requires setting the camera in the portrait position (AKA
standing up) on a rotating-head tripod, and taking a series of overlapping
photos of your subject. Then, you download your shots and stitch your
photos together with some specialized piece of software. I don't have a
tripod (yet), but still have fun putting these together.
</p>
    
<div id=dx.g style=TEXT-ALIGN:center>
      <img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_43gthgcmd2_b.jpg" style="WIDTH:648px; HEIGHT:259.2px">
</div>

<p>
		The above is my attempt to create a panoramic photo of Lake
Raleigh, NC. It took a total of thirteen shots and using the Open Source
application <em>hugin</em>, which is available for most current Linux
distributions as well as for other operating systems. Some distributions may
not include the 'auto-stitch' feature, which basically just means you have
to go through your photos and add common points between your photos so the
program can stitch each photo correctly.
</p>
      
<div id=jcfg style=TEXT-ALIGN:center>
        <img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_44hd67bq4t_b.jpg" style="WIDTH:500px; HEIGHT:191px"><br/>
        <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afsilva/4031388689/" id="y.5:" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afsilva/4031388689/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/afsilva/4031388689/</a>
</div>
      
<p>
	 Above is the final result.
</p>
        
<h3>Facebook and Mobile Photos</h3>

<p>
	 How many of you are on Facebook? <em>Linux Gazette</em> is (see: <a
href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=110960368283" id=dkds
title=http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=110960368283>http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=110960368283</a>
). As I said in the beginning, I even use my cellphone to take photos,
more often than not the photos taken with my cellphone get uploaded
directly to Facebook, never to be shared with anyone outside of my
friends list. But sometimes, I do want to share them on Picasa Web Album or
Flickr, and the original from the cellphone is no longer there.
</p>
    

<div id=hy1b style=TEXT-ALIGN:center>
      <img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_46nj8qhcf5_b.jpg" style="WIDTH:648px; HEIGHT:405px">
</div>
    
<p>
     The solution is to use the <em>kipi-plugins</em> on <em>digiKam</em>, 
and import your Facebook photos. It is a great way to recover old
cellphone photos, and to backup any other photos that may have been uploaded to
Facebook.
</p>
    
<h3>What's Next?</h3>
    
<p>
	 The next technique that I would like to play with, in photography, is <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging" id=emnt
title="High Dynamic Range (HDR) image processing">High Dynamic Range (HDR)
image processing</a>, which is a way to "allow a greater dynamic range of
luminances between the lightest and darkest areas of an image". The open
source application that I will be working with is <em>qtpfsgui</em>, 
and when I do have some decent results to show off, I will surely 
write up some steps on how to get them working.
</p>
    
<p>
     And finally, if you are interested in learning more about
photography and terms like aperture, exposure, wide
angle and telephoto, I highly recommend Volumes 1, 2, and 3 of <a
href="http://www.kelbytraining.com/product/the-digital-photography-book.html"
id=n62h title="The Digital Photography Book">The Digital Photography
Book</a> by Scott Kelby. It will give you several tips on what type of
techniques, software, and hardware the professional photographers are
using in the 'real' world. Enjoy!

[ Keeping one's own photographs in order is an important task. In case you want to
automatically rename your digital images using metadata from the camera itself you
might want to check out the <a href="http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/">jhead</a> tool,
which can query and modify the JPEG header and EXIF information. -- Ren&eacute; ]
