<p><strong>From Terry Singleton on 18 Aug 1998 </strong></p>

<p><strong>Hi there,
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Being a newbie LINUX user I searched YAHOO and found your site. It
is a relief to actually find a site which has some newbie
material..thanks.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>I am hoping you can shed some light on this subject.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>I recently put up a LINUX server, I am hoping to use it for email
and http purposes. However our users are not knowledgeable enough to
be able to ftp html files into their directories and therefore we
would like to use Front Page. I have downloaded and installed APACHE
1.3.1 and noticed that MS does have FP extensions that are supposed
to run on LINUX and APACHE.
</strong></p>

>I think you are underestimating your users.  You might
want to find the WS_FTP and/or the "CuteFTP" package.
These shareware Windows packages are pretty easy for
Windows users --- and work pretty much like the old
file manager.

use Netscape Communicator's POP client.  You can also
offer them Eudora and Pegasus Mail.  These will work 
with any POP server --- including whichever one was
almost certainly already installed with your distribution).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The easiest way to allow your Windows users access to their
files on your web server is to install and use Samba.  Samba
implements the SMB protocol --- which is the native file sharing
system that's implemented in Windows for Workgroups, Windows '95, 
Windows '98, Windows NT, and OS/2 (LAN Manager and LAN Server). 
files.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>With Samba you'd give each user access to their home directory
(possibly creating symlinks from their home directories to any
shared directories).  You users would simply drag and drop
files using the same file manager and "Explorer" interfaces
that they'd use with any other WfW or NT fileserver.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>You can also create group shares (on your Linux or other Unix
system) which will automatically show up to the appropriate
users in their browse lists.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The last time one of my associates looked into using
Microsoft's FrontPage server extensions the idea was abandoned
without even attempting the installation.  There were
showstopper limitations and design features that obviated any
need to look further at it.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Her conclusion was also supported by a number of messages that
I've read on the Bugtraq and NTSecurity mailing lists.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>So I recommend that you reconsider your options and avoid
FrontPage if you have any choice in the matter.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>If you insist on using FP despite these limitations then
you'll probably want to look at:
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Although I've never used it, I've read about another way to
upload files to a web server using HTTP POST commands.  It's
described in the O'Reilly book on _CGI_Programming_ (one with
a mouse on the cover) on page 414 (Appendix D).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Basically you create a form that looks like so:
</blockquote>

<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML//EN"&gt;&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;
File Upload Form &lt;/TITLE&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;&lt;H1&gt;
File Upload Form &lt;/H1&gt;&lt;HR&gt;
&lt;FORM ACTION="/cgi-bin/upload.pl" 
ENCTYPE="multipart/form-data" METHOD="POST"&gt;
Your Name: &lt;INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="username"&gt;
File to Upload: &lt;INPUT TYPE="file" NAME="filename"&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="Send the Multi-part (MIME) file..."&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE="reset" VALUE="Clear/Restart"&gt;
&lt;/FORM&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre>
<blockquote>At the time it was only supported in Netscape.  This will show
up as a form with a filename field, and a "Browse" button next
to that.  I don't know if any other browsers ever added
support for it. (I just check with Lynx 2.7.2 --- it
recognized the <tt>INPUT TYPE="file"</tt> and rendered it as "Not
Implemented")
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Also you'll have to create/find a cgi script/program that
implemented the file/MIME decoding portion of this (I just
used "<tt>upload.pl</tt>" as a placeholder for this example).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>That same book listed some Perl 5 modules that might be useful
for this sort of thing --- I think one of them was
"BasePlus.pm" --- you'd want to search CPAN (the Comprehensive
Perl Archive Network: <A HREF="http://www.cpan.org">http://www.cpan.org</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local">http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local</A> among many) for related work.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>I don't know for sure but you might start at:

<p><strong>From Terry Singleton on 20 Aug 1998 </strong></p>

<p><strong>thanks...I would love some more information on getting SAMBA
working. I have read alot about a NFS client. Will I still need the
NFS client to connect when using SAMBA.
</strong></p>


<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" height="28" width="50" 
	alt="(!)" border="0"
>No.  You won't need NFS to access your Samba systems.
As for more info on Samba --- there's a whole book on
the subject.   There's also an SMB-HOWTO that's quite old
but should still get you started;

<blockquote>... I gather that this hasn't been updated since '96!
I know that Samba has been under constant, sometimes 
intense, development throughout that time.  However,
the basics still work that same. 
</blockquote>

<strong><p><img src="../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" height="28" width="50"

>Or if I implement SAMBA will the machine be accessible by
\\linuxmachinename like other NT boxes...do I have to create a WINS
entry for the LINUX box??
</p></strong>

<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" height="28" width="50" 
	alt="(!)" border="0"
>Yes.  You can use UNC naming and normal "Explorer" browsing
to access your Linux box.  It will look "just like" an 
NT box to those protocols.  (Many sysadmin's have reported
that they've replaced NT servers with Linux with increases
in performance, capacity, reliability --- and no complaints
or comments from their users).

>Terry comments about Linux' Future</H3>
<p><strong>From Terry Singleton on 20 Aug 1998 </strong></p>
<!-- begin body -->

<p><strong>You really are the answer guy, thanks for your time.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Comments:
Being new to LINUX I am very impressed with it. I initially bought a copy of
RedHat to get started with UNIX. The college just bought this bohemith DEC
ALPHA server which is to run DEC UNIX. Because I was now to learn this OS I
thought it prudent to play with LINUX as it would install on my machine
quite easily.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>After inserting my setup boot diskette and 20 minutes of answering quite
simple questions I am up and running with LINUX and a GUI called CDE.
Although I would not install the GUI on a server for a desktop environment
it is quite nice.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RedHat install detected by 3COM905 NIC card, my ATI video card and used
my DHCP server to set itself up on the network, I must say that even with NT
or 95 most of the time I need to supply additional drivers for the install,
not in LINUX's case. Now I must say that I am not sure that these drivers
are optimized for the OS but they are functioning fine.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>After having great success with LINUX on the desktop and learning most of
the basic shell commands I installed LINUX again, this time in a server
environment(kind of a rogue operation). Configured sendmail, qpopper and
dns; now this little LINUX box handles all our student email and DNS
requirements. It replaced 2 NT servers and handles 2000 POP3 users and
1000's of emails per day.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Future Directions: I am hoping LINUX can provide some much needed LDAP
services for email address books and I may even consider using LINUX as our
corporate web server OS, because LINUX also provides SAMBA file services we
may even look to LINUX for our file and print services needs. The only thing
holding me back in this arena is MS's ASP technology which is a great server
side scripting language. Perhaps when SUN et al finalize JSP (JAVA Server
Pages) and the JDK is released for LINUX I will re-examine this issue.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>To move this environment to the desktop for the <EM>masses</EM> I would say to
COREL, keep up the good work(they ported Word Perfect to LINUX), to Triteal,
keep working on the CDE environment.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>LINUX definetly is an OS with much greater potential than any other OS
currently in development.
</strong></p>
