<p>
A family member has a number of directories containing photos in JPEG format. 
3 directories contain different versions of the same collection of photos. 
One is the current master and the others are earlier snapshots of the same 
collection. I believe that all the photos in the older snapshots are present 
in the current master, but I would like to verify that before I delete them. 
Also many other directories probably contain duplicates of photos in the 
master collection and I would like to clean those up.
</p>

<p>
Identifying and cleaning up byte for byte identical JPEGs in the snapshots has 
freed up a considerable amount of disk space. A sample of the remaining 
photos suggests that they are probably in the master, but the tags and 
position in the directory tree have changed. I don't want to go through 
comparing them all by hand. 
</p>

<p>
Initial research suggests that ImageMagick can produce a "signature", which is 
a SHA256 checksum of the image data. I believe that this would be suitable 
for identifying identical images, on which the tags have been altered. 
</p>

<p>
Are there any graphics experts in the gang who can confirm this? Alternatively 
suggestions of existing tools that will do the job, or better approaches, 
would be most welcome.

<p>
Y'know, I recall hearing about it, but had never tried it out. I just
did, and - it doesn't seem to work.
</p>

<p>
I grabbed a random JPG and copied it, then ran 'compare' against the
original and the copy (as expected, any ImageMagic util has a weird
syntax...)
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
ben at Jotunheim:/tmp$ compare 1.jpg 2.jpg out.jpg
 @ 0,0
</pre>

<p>
OK, so it produced a "comparison map" - out.jpg - that was just a very
low-contrast version of the original. Presumably, though, the '@ 0,0'
means that the two are the same. OK - so then, I edited one of the
two files in Gimp and changed the lower right corner pixel to white (it
had been quite dark, possibly black), and ran the comparison again.
Still got the same '@ 0,0' - even though the two images were now
different, including their filesizes - although the map was now some
weird-looking thing with red streaks running riot through it (but
nothing notable in the lower right corner.)
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the usual confusing-as-hell IM man page contains the secret, but
I haven't been able to find it.

Oooh, nice idea. Although it'll be a little slow if you've got a lot of

Fire this off with your top-level pic directory as an argument; it'll
return a list of all pics with identical checksums, grouped by checksum
values.
</p>

<p>
Using one of the Perl checksum modules would have been a lot faster, but
would require installing that module.

(ref <a href='http://studio.imagemagick.org/pipermail/magick-users/2003-March/007964.html'>http://studio.imagemagick.org/pipermail/magick-users/2003-March/007964.html</a>)
</p>

<p>
 Two images with identical pixel data, even if stored in different
 formats, will produce the same signature.  It is the SHA digest
 computed over the pixels in a canonical form.
</p>

<p>
So "imagemagick -identify | grep signature" can indeed be used to
check whether two images are pixel for pixel identical.

Is there an actual "imagemagick" program, or is it some util from the IM
suite? I don't have an "imagemagick" on my system, despite having the
package installed.

Hi ben, I am with you on this. AFAIK, ImageMagick is just the name of
the package. The programs there have various names, but none of them
are "ImageMagick".

Oops. That should have been 'identify -verbose | grep signature' 
or (if you use graphicsmagick which is a fork of imagemagick)
'gm identify -verbose | grep signature'.

It seems like there <em>should</em> be a way to do this in two passes - some
kind of a rough (but fast) comparison that will weed out definitely
incompatible images, and a second one to do a 'signature' comparison for
precise matching - which would reduce the run time. I just wish I could
think of a way to do that initial weeding pass... I don't think that
size is a reasonable metric.

I have been comparing big trees of files myself. My files are on two
different computers, not just drives. So I went for a locally
run find/md5sum, writing to a local file and a perl script which later
compared the two files, sorting them by  md5sums and outputting
duplicate/missing files. 
</p>

<p>
A problem I ran into were image tags. One copy of the files was tagged
in f-photo  and unless the copy was taken after the first import, the
actually identical photos were binary different because of the tags. I
would have to strip all headers on both version, compare whats left --
but never got round to implement that. Same applies to tagged mp3,
ogg, ...

Well, OK - I got un-lazy enough to look this up (actually, I've been
struggling with a corroded alternator bolt for the past however-long,
and now that I've got it out, I desperately need a break!) Yep, Perl has
an interface to Image::Magick (this can be installed via 'apt-get
install perlmagick) - and with that, things get lots easier.  All the
rest of the required modules are part of the default Perl installation.
</p>

use strict;
use File::Find;
use Image::Magick;
use Cwd 'abs_path';
 
die "Syntax: ", $0 =~ /([^\/]+)$/, " &lt;dir to search&gt; [...]\n"
	unless defined $ARGV[0] &amp;&amp; -d $ARGV[0];
 
# Canonicalize the directories
map { $_ = abs_path($_) } @ARGV;
 
my %list;
find(\&amp;wanted, @ARGV);
	
sub wanted {
	return if -d $File::Find::name || $File::Find::name !~ /\.(?:jpg|png|gif|bmp)$/i;
	my $img = Image::Magick -&gt; new();
	$img -&gt; Read($File::Find::name);
	my $sig = $img -&gt; Get('signature') || return;
 
	push @{$list{$sig}}, $File::Find::name;
}
 
for (sort keys %list){
	my $a;
	if (@{$list{$_}} &gt; 1){
		print $a++?"\t$_\n":"$_:\n" for @{$list{$_}};
	}
}
 
</pre>

<p>
Now <em>that</em> works as advertised - except it looks like signatures only
stay the same if you convert JPG &lt;=&gt; PNG, but not to GIF or BMP.
That seems rather limited. :\

[laugh] You know me too well, Kapil. The only problem with the above is
that I'd be spawning a shell process to run each one of these - one per
image - so that would be way too slow. With that many images to process,
and an O(n^2) factor in the works, I wanted at least the controllable
factors working as fast as possible.
</p>

<p>
I wonder if it would make sense to pre-sort the images by header date?
As I'd said, anything rejected before the comparison would make a big
difference.

I just tried a few tests, and the time that it takes to get that info is
just awful - about 5.5 seconds per image with 'identify', and about
1.125 seconds with Perl and Image::Magick. Unless someone comes up with
a way to pre-sort by "external" data (e.g., file size, time, etc.), or
read those bits significantly faster [1], we've pretty much defined the
worst-case run-time for this thing.

<p>
[1] If somebody wants to look up the JPG header info and tell me where
the necessary bits are located, I can read them "raw" and save a lot of
time - but calculating stuff like signatures would likely be a pain.

That's definitely faster, thanks. Too bad it doesn't contain that
signature data - we'd be able to collect all the necessary info from
just this one run, and then the slowdown would just be in the
calculation end... It does have a bunch of data, though.

Thanks to Kapil for that one. Hopefully, there's a more efficient and

Y'know, that might be a good point. Even if the camera make and model
are absent (true for about 1/4-1/3 of my photos), that would still be
useful.

<p>
The 'signature' from imagmagick is calculated as part of its
identification module so it is available for all image formats.
</p>

<p>
However, since that calculation is based on 'raw data' it will not be
able to compare two different image formats with each other (which is what
I think Ben meant).
</p>

<p>
What <em>should</em> be possible (but slow!) is to write something that uses
the magick library to convert the image into a standard bitmap (like
ppmraw) and <em>then</em> match signatures (or just do a bit-by-bit
comparison). This would work fine for loss-less compression like png
but will not be so great for lossy formats like jpeg. Moreover, there
would be problems of comparison between vector and bitmap formats
since the conversion to bitmap would be lossy in the former case.
</p>

<p>
The question in those cases is to define a "measure" of the
difference between two bitmaps in identical format (say ppmraw for
definite-ness). There appears to be a program 'pnmpsnr' that does
exactly that. This too should be accessible through the netpbm
library.
</p>

<p>
If the measure is small enough then the older file is the ancestor
and the newer one the descendant. (Always using "internal"
time-stamps where available over file-system time-stamps.)
</p>

<p>
This provides an "in principle" solution which I am too lazy to code!
</p>

<p>

</p>

Kapil.

<p>
Actually, for the real-world case of comparing camera-produced images, I
think we can reject any that aren't in the same format (that would be a
much more complex task, I agree.) If we're just trying to eliminate
actual copies, then that would be pretty simple:
</p>

<p>
1st pass: use unique file sizes as keys, lists of files with that size
as values
</p>

<p>
2nd pass: any lists with 2 or more files get checked for format and camera
make/model equivalence
</p>

<p>
(optional) 3rd pass: any lists that still have 2 or more entries get
checked for signature equivalence.
</p>

<p>
The actual solution is left to the student. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
