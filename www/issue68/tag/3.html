Well folks....I've patiently waited several weeks for a response to my
LONG letter.....and have given up and am  re-contacting you to ask if you
even got it?

Your message of 2 May 2001 did indeed arrive.    It may be found
at the list archive,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You raise some interesting questions.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The fact that the Open source software base comprises untold millions
of lines of code (has anybody ever counted?) indicates that there must
be some reason people do this.  Eric Raymond has a few interesting
ideas.  See <A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings"

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I suspect that absence of responses on this mailing list was due to
the fact that none of the regular posters felt they had much in
particular to contribute, at least on the day your mail appeared,
to the questions you raise.  For this I don't really apologise;
we're all volunteers here, and we do what we can.

I guess I should stop responding so IMMEDIATELY... &lt;wicked grin&gt;

...and so you have sadly developed the illusion that you should get 1 hour
turnaround on your problems from TAG.  That's not the way it works here.
<EM>Linux Gazette</EM> is not any sort of company, TAG's just a batch of friends
that try to help folks like you out... and the Gazette gets to publish
the results, if it looks like they'd "Make Linux a Little More Fun!" for
others.  That's the only pay we get, too.  You want timely, buy a tech
support contract from some Linux vendor that sells them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I remind you that The Answer Gang does not guarantee any answers will ever
arrive, much less in a timely fashion.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Even if it were a company a fast turnaround might be unreasonable, but that
depends on whatever the original problem was.  Most companies actively limit
what type of questions they'll even bother to answer; "Linux" is quite a
broad topic, these days.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If Ben or any of the other members of the Gang continue the thread, great.
If not, oh well.  Sorry you got your hopes up.  You can re-send your message
if you like.  If you do, its successful delivery to any TAG gurus doesn't
obligate them to answer.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"

... I'm thinking maybe something went
wrong in the sending process, although I never received a "failure" notice!
It has also suspiciously disappeared from my "sent messages" folder!!!
I have to wonder if you guys are being "watched"? Immediately after
mailing you, I received some strange e-mails .....one from
"<em>friends@hoovertime</em>" with no message.....just an attachment!

So, it looks like your site gets spam too. (Due to an open policy of
receiving queries from Linux users all over the world, we get an unfair
share, ourselves.)  Luckily, you probably can do something about it...
procmail filters or something.  There have been a few useful articles
against that subject in recent issues of <em>LG</em>. 
<br> (To be fair, it might be little hard to filter spam in your hotmail 
	account.  Oh well. )

Anyway, please let me know if infact you did receive my e-mail of
several weeks ago.

We get an increasing amount of mail each month.  You have provided no special
context that I could use to find it anyways other than your name.  It's not
reasonable for us to go looking for it.  I hope that some of what Ben said for
you was helpful so far.  If your actual thread of question and answers is
useful to others by the end of the month, it may get published in whole or part.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Yes, I agree, it's polite to continue a thread in progress, and for all I
know, 3 of them have it lazing about in their draft folders.  One of TAG may
have sent you something which never arrived at your end.  If they didn't copy
the publishing staff here, I actually have <EM>no means</EM> to find it for you, or
even to publish it later.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Meanwhile, good luck in your endeavors.

Dear Dan,  ( and stern Heather too!)
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
Thanks SO MUCH for answering! Now I know that my letter  did infact
arrive! I REALLY appreciate it and all that you and the other volunteers do.
I hope that my "interesting questions" generate some "food for thought"
among linux programmers! It looks like IBM and their new associates will be
addressing many of the drawbacks that I pointed out ....by paying their
programmers to code using the linux kernal (along with the NSA)! I hope that
"far-reaching" programs like the two I have initiated will garner monetary
support somehow!
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
Please know that I put myself "at your service" to the whole of the
linux community, as a "synergy design consultant" ( which pretty much covers
EVERYTHING) and would be glad to volunteer to contribute my prospective on
any projects/problems!
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
Remember: "the significant problems we face today cannot be solved by
the same level of thinking that created them" Albert Einstein.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
May the Source be with you,  Darrell Ernest Rolstone
