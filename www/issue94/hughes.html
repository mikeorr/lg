This program is a simple interface that allows you to
build a web page from the Metar data output from
weather stations around the world.
I wouldn't call it exciting but it does work.
<p>
Rather than try to describe what you will see, go <a
href="http://pictures.fylz.com/weather.html">here</a>
and take a look. You should see at least two and
possibly as many as five weather reports from around
Costa Rica.
That is, the program has a list of five weather
stations to check and displays the information from
all that report.

<h2>System Structure</h2>

<p>
The heart of this system is the Pymetar package
available <a href="http://www.schwarzvogel.de/software-pymetar.shtml">
here</a>.
This is a Python program which fetches Metar data
described <a href="http://www.noaa.gov"> here</a>.
Pymetar is a command-line tool but it does all the
dirtywork.
<p>
My goal is to make this information available on a
web page.
I didn't want to turn this into a huge programming
project but I want the implementation to make sense.
The most basic approach would have been to run the
program as a CGI script for each request. However,
this was potentially very inefficient because it
would require the program to grab all the data each
time a CGI request came in.
More important, it would mean the user would have to
wait for all these requests to complete.
<p>
I decided the best compromise was to set up a cron
job to fetch the data and build a weather page.
Then, each page request would just be displaying a
static page.
As the weather data does not change all that often,
this actually offers pretty much current information.

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>
First, here is the code:
<pre>

#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys
import time
sys.path.insert(0, "/home/fyl/pymetar-0.5")
import pymetar

def stations(args):
    for arg in map(lambda x: x.strip(), args):
        try:
            weather = pymetar.MetarReport(arg)
        except IOError, msg:
            # uncomment the following and remove pass line to see the errors
            # sys.stderr.write("Problem accessing the weather server: %s\n" % msg)
            pass
        else:
            if weather.valid:
		print "&lt;h3>"
                print weather.getStationName()
                print " ( Lat: %s, Long: %s, Alt: %s m)" % \
		  weather.getStationPosition()
		print "&lt;/h3>"
		print "&lt;table border=\"2\">"
                print "&lt;tr>&lt;td>Updated&lt;/td>&lt;td> %s&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>" % \
		  weather.getTime()
                if weather.getWindDirection() is not None:
		    print "&lt;tr>&lt;td>Wind direction&lt;/td>&lt;td> %s°&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>" % \
		      weather.getWindDirection()
                if weather.getWindSpeed() is not None:
                    print "&lt;tr>&lt;td>Wind speed&lt;/td>&lt;td> %6.1f m/s&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>" % \
		      weather.getWindSpeed()
                if weather.getTemperatureCelsius() is not None:
                    print "&lt;tr>&lt;td>Temperature&lt;/td>&lt;td> %.1f°C (%.1f°F)&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>" % \
		      (weather.getTemperatureCelsius(), \
		      weather.getTemperatureFahrenheit())
                if weather.getDewPointCelsius() is not None:
                    print "&lt;tr>&lt;td>Dew point&lt;/td>&lt;td> %.1f°C (%.1f°F)&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>" % \
		      (weather.getDewPointCelsius(), \
		      weather.getDewPointFahrenheit())
                if weather.getHumidity() is not None: 
                    print "&lt;tr>&lt;td>Humidity&lt;/td>&lt;td> %.0f%%&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>" % \
		      weather.getHumidity()
                if weather.getVisibilityKilometers() is not None:
                    print "&lt;tr>&lt;td>Visibility&lt;/td>&lt;td> %.1f Km&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>" % \
		      weather.getVisibilityKilometers()
                if weather.getPressure() is not None:
                    print "&lt;tr>&lt;td>Pressure&lt;/td>&lt;td> %.0f hPa&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>" % \
		      weather.getPressure()
                if weather.getWeather() is not None: 
			print "&lt;tr>&lt;td>Weather&lt;/td>&lt;td> %s&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>" % \
			  weather.getWeather()
                if weather.getSkyConditions() is not None: 
			print "&lt;tr>&lt;td>Sky conditions&lt;/td>&lt;td> %s&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>" % \
		          weather.getSkyConditions()
		print "&lt;/table>"
            else:
                print "Either %s is not a valid station ID, " % arg
		print "the NOAA server is down or parsing is severely broken."


print "&lt;html>"
print "&lt;head>"
print "&lt;title>Costa Rica weather from PlazaCR.com&lt;/title>"
print "&lt;/head>"
print "&lt;body>"
print "&lt;h1>Costa Rica weather from PlazaCR.com&lt;/h1>"
print "&lt;p>Latest reports as of %s CST" % time.ctime()
gm = time.gmtime()
print "(%d.%02d.%02d %02d%02d UTC)" % (gm[0], gm[1], gm[2], gm[3], gm[4])
print '&lt;p>&lt;a href="images/costa_rica.gif" target="_blank">Costa Rica map&lt;/a>'

stations(["MROC", "MRLM", "MRCH", "MRLB", "MRPV"])

print "&lt;/body>"
print "&lt;/html>"
</pre>
<p>
I chose to just import the pymetar.py code in the
wrapper than generated the HTML page.
To do this, I added the Pymetar directy to the path
being searched by Python.
<p>
Next I define <b>stations</b>, a function that queries the
weather stations using the Pymetar code and then
formats the output into HTML.
It looks pretty ugly because it is just some long
print statements building HTML strings with some if
statements tossed in to see if we actually got the
data.
The important point is that you pass it a list of the
station names and you get the body of the web page
back.
<p>
Finally, the last maybe 15 lines of code just build
the HTML boilerplace and call stations to produce
the guts.

<h2>Testing and Installation</h2>

<p>
Because of the design, testing is very easy.
There are no web-based dependencies in the design so
you can just run the program from the command line.
<p>
In my case, I called the program wcr, so just typing
./wcr will run the program and display the HTML on
standard output.
If all goes well, run the program again, redirecting
the output to a file. For example,
<pre>
./wcr > /tmp/weather.html
</pre>
<p>
You can now point a web browser at the file and see
if it renders the page the way you want.
If not, now is the time to make changes in wcr and
continue testing.
<p>
Once you are happy with the output, upload the code
to your web server and set up a cron job to run it.
Normally, crontab -e will allow you to edit your
crontab entry.
<p>
I elected to run the program twice an hour, at 5 and
35 minutes past.
The crontab entry must execute the program and write
the output file to a location the web server can get
to. I used:
<pre>
5,35 * * * * /home/fyl/pymetar-0.5/bin/wcr > /var/www/htdocs/weather.html
</pre>
<p>
The four asterisks tell cron that the 5 and 35 minute
times apply to every hour of every day.
The next field is the name of the program to run.
Finally the redirect operator (>) is followed by
location where the HTML file is to be stored.
<p>
Assuming you set all the permissions right--that is,
the program can write to the file and the web server
can read the file, you are all done.
Just point to this file and you have a weather page.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
For the perfectionist, you probably need a fancier
soluution.
Why?
Well, there will be a point in time when the contents
of the HTML file will not be valid.
When cron fires of the job the contents of the output
file are truncated.
Then the program runs and builds a new file.
<p>
Because of the way the program works this time is
not just a short execution time of some Python code
as the program queries the various weather stations
and has to wait for a response.
With the five stations I poll, I see elapsed times
between one and ten seconds.
If having bad data on the site for a maximum of 10
seconds every 30 minutes is acceptable to you, all is
well.
If not, write the output to a temporary file and then
move it to the real file when all is done.
Still not perfect but really close.
<p>
Now, for us mortals, we have a quick and dirty
weather page. Have fun.
