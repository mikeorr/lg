<h1>Installing VMWare Server 2 on Ubuntu Server 8.10 (Intrepid Ibex)</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dokopnik.html">Deividson Luiz Okopnik</a></b></p>


<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>Finding reliable information about turning an Ubuntu Server 
installation into a Virtualization Server is not an easy task, and if 
you - like me - are going for a command-line only server, you will find 
this guide extremely useful.</p>

<p>VMWare Server 2 is a very good, free alternative to virtualization 
from VMWare - a company that has always been a leading provider 
in the virtualization arena. VMWare Server 2 requires a license 
number for installation, but this license can be freely obtained after 
registering at the VMWare page.</p>

<p>This product offers a solution that allows, among other things, the
creation of headless servers. These are completely administrable via a
browser, including creating virtual machines, powering up or down, and even
command-line access. </p>

<p>Please note that while this article is aimed at a clean Ubuntu 
Server installation, most of the information contained within can be 
used on any modern distribution, whether command-line only or GUI.</p>

<h3>2. Obtaining VMWare Server 2</h3>
<p>To obtain the VMWare Server 2, you need to register at the VMWare
Web page, <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/server/">http://www.vmware.com/products/server/</a>, by 
clicking on the "Download" link.</p>

<img width="219" height="237" src="misc/dokopnik/01.jpg" alt="VMWare login creation">

<p>After you submit your data, you will receive an e-mail with the serial
numbers  needed to activate your account - both on Windows and on a Linux
host - and the download links. In this article, we will install using the
VMWare Server 2 tar package, so go ahead and download it - get the one that
fits your computer architecture (32 or 64 bit) - and save it on the
computer where you want to install it. I will use "/home/deivid/" as the
file location in the next few steps - change it to reflect the actual
location where you saved the file.</p>

<h3>3. Installing VMWare Server 2</h3>

<p>First things first. To install VMWare Server 2, you need to install
three packages: build-essential, linux-headers-server, and xinetd.  If
linux-headers-server does not point to the headers of the kernel you are
using, install the correct ones. I had to install
"linux-headers-2.6.27-7-server". You can check what kernel version you
are currently running with "uname -r".</p>

<p>You can install these packages by using:</p>
<pre class="code">sudo apt-get install build-essential xinetd linux-headers-$(uname -r)</pre>

<p>After you install the required packages, go to the folder where VMWare 
Server's tar package was saved, unpack it, and execute the install 
script as follows:</p>

<pre class="code">tar xvzf VMware-server-*.tar.gz
cd vmware-server-distrib
sudo ./vmware-install.pl</pre>

<p>The install script will ask you some questions -  where to install the
files and docs, the current location of some files on your system, etc. On
all of those questions, you can accept the default option by pressing
"Enter". On the EULA screen, you can quit reading it by pressing "q", but
you'll need to type "yes" then press "Enter" to accept it.</p>

<p>The next questions will be about the location of the current kernel
header include files, so the installer can use them to compile some modules
for you.  The usual location is "/usr/src/linux-headers-&lt;<i>kernel
version</i>&gt;/include" - for example, 
"/usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.27-7-server/include". After that, some files
will be compiled, and the installer will ask several more questions - but
again, the defaults all work fine.</p>

<p>After that, the service will be installed and running and you can access
the control interface via any Web browser, accessing &lt;<i>server
ip</i>&gt;:8222 - for example, 192.168.0.150:8222. Please note that on
Firefox, there will be a warning about this site's certificate, but it's
safe to add an exception to it for this particular use.</p>

<!-- I added "particular use" above, because I think it's wrong to advise
users to ignore warnings in a blanket fashion. - KTO -->

<p>To log in, by default you use the "root" account and
password of the machine it's running on. With Ubuntu, you need to set a root
password first - easily be done via the command "sudo passwd root". You
can give permissions to other users in the "Permissions" link of the Web
interface.</p>

<p>All the virtual machine administration can be done via this Web 
interface, including virtual machine creation, boot-up, access, and 
shut-down.</p>

<h3>4. Creating a Virtual Machine</h3>
<p>The process to create a virtual machine is pretty simple. Just click 
the "Create Virtual Machine" link in the web interface, and follow the 
on-screen instructions.</p>

<img width="673" height="417" src="misc/dokopnik/03.jpg" alt="Virtual Machine Creation">

<p>Here's a description of some of the data the system asks for during the
installation:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Name</strong> 
<dd>Virtual machine name
<dt><strong>Datastore</strong> 
<dd>Location where the virtual machine data will be stored inside the computer 
(configured during the VMWare Server 2 installation)
<dt><strong>Guest Operating System</strong> 
<dd>the OS that will run inside the virtual machine
</dl>

<p>In the next few steps, you configure the specifications of the virtual
machine, including the amount of RAM and number of processors, capacity of
the HD and the location where the data will be stored, details about the Network
adapter, CD-ROM, floppy drives, USB controllers, etc. Configure
accordingly with what you will need in the virtual machine.</p>

<p>In the Networking configuration dialog, you have three options for a network 
connection:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Host Only</strong>
<dd>Direct connection to the host machine (host X VM only)
<dt><strong>Bridged</strong> 
<dd>Gives the virtual machine a real IP in the external network 
via Bridging
<dt><strong>NAT</strong> 
<dd>The virtual machine can access the external network via a NAT 
table without having its own external IP
</dl>

<p>After you've completed all of the above configuration, the Virtual
Machine will be created.</p>

<h3>5. Accessing a Virtual Machine</h3>

<p>All the access to the virtual machine, as previously mentioned, is done
via the Web interface. To power up the machine, you select it in the menu
and press the "Play" button at the top of the window - other buttons
are used to power-down and reboot it.</p>

<p>To gain access to the virtual machine console (e.g., to install an 
Operational System), after the machine is powered on, click on the 
"Console" link. Note that you will have to install a browser plug-in the
first time you do so, but the installation is pretty straight-forward
(click "Install Plug-in" and follow your browser's instructions - it's also
needed to reboot the browser after the plug-in installation).</p>

<p>After that you can use that "Console" link to have access to the 
computer. Operating System installation on a virtual machine goes as if 
you were using a normal computer, so if needed, you can use any article 
about installing the operating system of your choice.</p>

<h3>6. Summary</h3>

<p>Virtualization is an important topic in computing, and is getting
more and more popular lately. However, finding specific information -
like how to make use of virtualization on a command-line only server, is a
bit tricky. That is the gap this article has tried to fill - and I hope you
(readers) can make a good use of it.</p>
