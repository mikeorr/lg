Hey, <I>LG</I> <STRONG>does</STRONG> mention "Yamaha" a dozen times in past
issues (the sound card, obviously). Maybe the guy was getting desperate and
trying every source... That is pretty wild, though. I'm still waiting for "Dear
Earthlings: I just installed Windows on my UFO, and now I can't get back in..."

"Hey Earthlings, we just installed something called Windoze En-Tee on
our flying saucer, and it made all or monitors turn 
<FONT COLOR="blue">blue</FONT>.  There's a message
in <FONT COLOR="gray">white</FONT> letters on the screen, but we don't
understand the language.  Please help <STRONG>URGENTLY</STRONG> as our
spacecraft is out of control and is locked on a crash course with Earth."

Fellow-being: What you need is to install something else quick.
Since your saucer can run Windoze (also called MSwin or windows or wind*ws)
I recommend "ZipSlack" 
<A HREF="">http://www.slackware.com/zipslack/getzip.php</A>.
It can load quickly onto the "FAT" filesystem MSwin uses and once you have
successfully launched that you should stop crashing...

<P> You may want something more well-tuned to your saucer once you have that
going.

<P> According to my research (slim pickings, most of our movies about aliens
don't describe their software, but one notes you are able to run some of our
virus software), apparently your native operating system most closely resembles
something here called "MacOS".  This is at least part of the problem, nearly 
any earthling knows that the MacOS and Windows vendors are at war with each 
other. 

<P> Unfortunately MacOS is proprietary so getting you a working copy without
getting some Earth hardware to go with it, may be a problem, esp. if you 
have no Earth currency aboard.

<P> Fortunately, we Linuxers can recommend either 
<A HREF="http://www.yellowdoglinux.com">Yellow Dog Linux</A> or 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxppc.com">LinuxPPC 2000</A>
, as well as 
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org">Debian</A>.  I can't say which will have the fastest install -
a Mac-using friend highly recommends the first... Debian is highly available
so you should be able to reach a mirror site no matter which of our land
masses you are presently nearest.  To save you time the web link you need
is <A HREF="http://cdimage.debian.org/ftp-mirrors.html">http://cdimage.debian.org/ftp-mirrors.html</A>.

Normally they discourage getting ISO images directly like that but, they
expect you to have a stable system to fetch.  I hope you will have no
problems whatsoever creating discs ...

By the way, most earthlings don't understand the funny messages generated
by those blue screens either.  Luckily I can assure you they don't help fix 
the problem...

<A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3092.html">RFC 3092</A> muses on the
etymology of 'foo' and 'bar'.  Among other things, it says the "wildly popular"
Smokey Stover comic strip of the 1930s by Bill Holman
"featured a firetruck called the Foomobile that rode
on two wheels."  

<P> The RFC also has a table of which other RFCs mention "foo", "bar" or
"fubar".

<P> <A HREF="http://rtmark.com/cuehack/">CueJack</A> is a Windows application
that lets you scan a products with a :CueCat scanner, then displays a web page
with "alternative information" about the product's company.
As you can guess, the "alternative information" is stuff the company
doesn't want you to know.  
"This could be information about corporate abuse, boycotts against the company,
even how much money the company is making, their corporate image as presented
to shareholders, etc."

<P> Miscellania: The program was renamed from CueHack because another program
already had the same name.  The author is working on a Linux version but says
there are technical difficulties.

<P> ... helps Businesses to eliminate the need of hiring telemarketers 
Automated initial customer application process and many more
features......... You will smile all the way to the Bank!!

<P> Automatically calls........ To market products and to make announcements.
To confirm preset appointments, prescheduled meetings, and conferences.  Our
CTI software can be used by businesses and services by calling sequentially or
randomly.  Automatically dials up to 2,000 - 10,000 prospects per day without
human interference.  When our CTI software calls it can simply leave a message
or it can ask for a response. You may obtain responses by recording their
voices, asking them to press a key, to respond to choices or transferring to a
live operator. Just record your messages, select which group ( Data Bases) you
want to call , when you want to start and stop, and then let our CTI software
got to work calling everyone.  You will save tremendous time and get results
very fast ! without increasing your overheads or hiring extra help.

<P> Regarding the 
<A HREF="../issue65/lg_backpage65.html#notlinux">Nigerian money scam</A> 
in last month's Not Linux.

<P> I've been receiving faxes the same as this for a few years at work, the
scam is worse than it looks: they *have* been succesful on several
occaions - all UK (if not world) banks know not to let their customers
get involved.

<P> What basically happens is A N Idiot agrees to the deal, signs the papers
and money appears in his/her account. A N Idiot then transfers most of
the money to another account (the scammer's). The money coming into the
account then never arrives - originating bank denies knowledge or
whatever - A N Idiots bank ha's, in the mean time, sent the money to
another bank. The first thing the bank does is debit A N Idiot's
account... A N Idiot is holding the can for an awful lot more money than
they thought they'd ever see.

<P> Holding the can for more money than you thought you'd ever see is
probably better than holding the can for the first million you've just
made and is all you have because if you're 999,000 away from paying back
1,000,000 they aren't really going to try to get it back but if you're
nearly their they'll clean you out then lock you up.

<P> These scammers are real bastards, if I didn't know it happened I wouldn't
believe people could be so bad to other people.

<P> Anyway, I just thought I'd let you know that this scam has worked and how
it worked (roughly and AIUI).

<P> Keep up the work with the gazette.
