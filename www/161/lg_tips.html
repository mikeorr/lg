<h3>2-cent Tip: Screenshots without X</h3>

<p>
Hello,
</p>

<p>
I had to do this to debug a program so I thought I'd share it.
</p>

<p>
X window dump without X
</p>

<p>
How does one take a screenshot without X? (For example, from the text
console)
</p>

<p>
Use Xvfb (the X server that runs on a virtual frame buffer).
</p>

<p>
Steps:
<pre class='code'>
  1. Run Xvfb
       $ Xvfb
     This will usually start the X server :99
       $ DISPLAY=:99 ; export DISPLAY
  2. Run your application in the appropriate state.
       $ firefox <a href='http://www.linuxgazette.net'>http://www.linuxgazette.net</a> &amp;
  3. Find out which window id corresponds to your application
       $ xwininfo -name 'firefox-bin' | grep id
     Or
       $ xlsclients
     Use the hex string that you get as window id in the commands
     below
  4. Dump the screen shot of that window
       $ xwd -id 'hexid" &gt; firefox.xwd
  5. If you want to, then kill these applications along with the 
     X server
       $ killall Xvfb
</pre>

<p>
'firefox.xwd' is the screenshot you wanted. Use 'convert' or on of
the netpbm tools to convert the 'xwd' format to 'png' or whatever.
</p>

<p>
Additional Notes:
</p>

<p>
A. You can use a different screenshot program.
</p>

<p>
B. If you need to manipulate the window from the command line, then
programmes like 'xautomation' and/or 'xwit' are your friends.
Alternatively, use a WM like "fvwm" or "xmonad":
<pre>
  DISPLAY=:99 xmonad &amp;
</pre>
This will allow you to manipulate windows from the command line if
you know some Haskell!
</p>

<p>
Regards,
</p>

<p>
Kapil.

<h3>2-cent Tip: Lists of files by extension</h3>

Recently, I decided to sort, organize, and generally clean up my rather
extensive music collection, and as a part of this, I decided to
"flatten" the number of file types that were represented in it. Over the
years, just about every type of audio file had made its way into it:
FLAC, M4A, WMA, WAV, MID, APE, and so on, and so on. In fact, the first
step would be to classify all these various types, get a list of each,
and decide how to convert them to MP3s (see my next tip, which describes
a generalized script to do just that.)
</p>

<p>
The process of collecting this kind of info wasn't unfamiliar to me; in
fact, I'd previously done this, or something like it, with the "find"
command when I was trying to establish what kind of files I'd want to
index in a search database. This time, however, I took a bit of extra
care to deal with names containing spaces, non-English characters, and
files with no extensions. I also defined a list of files that I wanted
to ignore (see the "User-modified vars" section of the script) and
provided the option of specifying the directory to index (current one by
default) and the directory in which to create the 'ext' files
(/tmp/files&lt;random_string&gt;) by default; the script notifies you of the
name.)
</p>

<p>
This isn't something that comes up often, but it can be very useful in
certain situations.

echo "Done."

<h3>2-cent Tip: Converting from $FOO to MP3</h3>

<p>
Recently, while organizing my (very large) music library, I analyzed the
whole thing and found out that I had almost 30 (!) different file types.
Much of this was a variety of info files that came with the music (text,
PDF, MS-docs, etc.) as well as image files in every conceivable format
(which I ended up "flattening" to JPG) - but a large number of these
were music formats of every kind, a sort of a living museum of "Music
Formats Throughout the Ages." I decided to "flatten" all of that as well
by converting all the odd formats to MP3.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, there's a wonderful Linux app that will take pretty much
every kind of audio - "mplayer"
(<a href='http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/codecs-status.html#ac'>http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/codecs-status.html#ac</a>). It can also dump
that audio to a single, easily-convertible format (WAV). As a result, I
created a script that uses "mplayer" and "lame" to process a directory
of music files called "2mp3".
</p>

<p>
It was surprisingly difficult to get everything to work together as it
should, with some odd challenges along the way; for example, redirecting
error output for either of the above programs was rather tricky. The
script processes each file, creates an MP3, and appends to a log called
'2mp3.LOG' in the current directory. It does not delete the original
files - that part is up to you. Enjoy!
</p>
