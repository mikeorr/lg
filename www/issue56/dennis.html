<P> There are many packages that can supply standard mail services
under Linux.  Basically the UNIX/Linux e-mail model involves
MTA (mail transport agents), MSA (mail storage/access agents)
and MUAs (mail user agents). There are also a variety of 
utilities that don't really quite fit in any of these categories.  

<P> Under Linux there are several MTAs including sendmail, the 
most common across most forms of UNIX; and D.J. Bernstein's
qmail and Wietse Venema's Postfix.  These accept and relay 
mail.  This sounds quite simple, but in practice it can be 
quite complex.  There are a number of routing and masquerading
options that can be set by administrative policy --- and these
amount to programming languages that filter and modify the 
headers of each message as it is relayed.  In addition the
process of routing mail and finding user mail boxes (mail 
stores) can involve arbitrarily complex interactions with
various directory services (DNS, passwd files, NIS, LDAP
alias/dbm files, and all manner of custom databases).  

<P> These days MTAs also have to implement anti-spam features that
amount to access control lists and rules about the address formats
(to and from headers) that are allowed from specific domains and
address ranges.  (Those generally also involve queries on tables or
directory services, including those like Paul Vixie's RBL
(real-time blackhole list: or MAPS, mail abuse prevention system)
and it's ilk, like Dorkslayer/ORBS.  Recently, MTAs are being
increasing required to enforce other policies and implement
anti-virus/anti-worm features.

<P> The most common cases are easy enough to install and configure.
However, all that power and flexibility comes at a price.  As your
organization chooses to tailor its MTA to meet your special
routing, nomenclature, security and anti-spam requirements you'll
require more sophisticated configuration options and many of those
will involve choreographing complex relationships between your MTA
and various other subsystems (such as any LDAP and DNS servers
you use).

<P> Once you've selected, installed and configured an MTA you
generally will also need to go through the same process for
an MSA.  Most organizations these days don't deliver mail 
directly to desktop client systems.  They store the mail 
on servers and have the users fetch their mail via POP or
IMAP.  There are various protocols for managing a mail store
but the only two that really count these days are POP3 and 
IMAP4 (there are also older versions of each of these 
protocols, of course).   As with the MTAs there are a number
of programs (daemons) can can provide each of these services.
Most MSAs can work with any common MTA.  In addition these 
systems usually do locking and/or use other mechanisms so that
multiple MSAs can be concurrently in use without conflict.  

<P> That means that you can have some users who access their mail 
via POP, while others use IMAP and others might even log in
and use a local MUA (such as pine, mutt, or elm).  Individual
users can swith from what mail access method to another, usually
without requiring any sysadmin intervention.  Clever users can
often bypass the normal MSA/MUA tools and use normal UNIX commands
(like cp, and mv) and FTP or rsync to move their mail around.
(This is generally too clunky for normal use, but can be quite
handy when fixing corrupted mailboxes, etc).

<P> The first time I was ever called upon to set up a POP server on 
an existing general purpose Linux server, I was surprised to 
find that there was no work required.  A POP daemon had been 
installed and enabled when I did the initial OS installation;
I had disabled it (commenting out a line in the /etc/inetd.conf
file) during my routine system hardening.  So "setting" up the 
service simply require that I uncomment one line in one file,
and restart one service/daemon.

<P> IMAP is similar.  Where POP generally transfers mail to the 
client system and removes it from the server, IMAP allows one
to store the mail on server side folder, and the copies on
client systems are essentially a cache or "working copy" ---
this usually costs more server storage space, but it allows
the IT teams to focus on server backup/recovery and allows the
client systems to be considered more-or-less disposable.  IMAP
can be used just like POP (where the mail is expunged from the
server by the clients after delivery).    Operationally, there
isn't much difference.  Both services are normally started by 
inetd (the network dispatcher service; Linux's "receptionist"
if you will).

<P> A POP or IMAP server can run for years, serving hundreds, even
thousands of mailboxes and users without ever requiring any special
attention.  Usually you're users or their e-mail correspondents
will occasionally do something stupid, or some software they run
will exhibit some bug that will require the system administrator to
go in and do some troubleshooting or cleanup.  

<P> For example, one time I had some complaining that his POP e-mail
was broken.  I found out that one of his customers had sent him a
bit of e-mail with a 100Mb file attachment!  (It was a Netware
crash dump image).  This was bumping into some diskspace and
speed/capacity limits on the old 32Mb 486 what we were using to
serve mail to him and the other 50 people in the department.  I
fixed it in a few minutes with some shell commands, used some
command line tools to uudecode the attachment back into a file
which I put in the user's home directory.  I tossed together a
quick throwaway script to extract the rest of his e-mail by
building a new mailbox for him.  (mbox files under UNIX are simple
text files.  qmail mail stores are directories with individual
small text files, one for each message).  Any competent
intermediate system administrator could have done the same thing.

<P> So most of the problems you might encounter with MSAs and MTAs
can be fixed with text editors and common UNIX filters and 
utilities.

<P> There are many MUAs that will work with POP and IMAP servers,
including Microsoft's Outlook.  Under Linux many people use
'fetchmail' to fetch their mail to a local mail spool (mailbox).
Then they can use any MUA (elm, pine, mutt, MH/exmh, EMACS' rmail,
vmail, mh-e, gnus, and the plethora of GUIs like Balsa, Mahogany,
etc).  Many other Linux users choose Netscape Communicator's
built-in mail client.

<P> Under Linux and UNIX there are other tools like procmail, vacation,
biff, and fetchmail which, as I said before, don't fall into any of
the three classic categories (MTA, MSA, MUA) that I describe
earlier.

<P> procmail is usually used as a "local delivery agent" and as a mail
processing agent.  It's generally used to filter the part of the
final delivery of a message to its end recipients.  This allows a
user to write scripts to automatically refile, reject, respond to,
forward or otherwise work with selected bits of mail as they are
received.  (It can also be used to post process mailboxes and as a
more general e-mail programming language/library).

<P> (vacation is an old program that can be used to simply provide
an automated response to e-mail upon reciept.  It was originally 
used to warn correspondents that the recipient was "on vacation."
This can be also done with a simple two line procmail recipe).

<P> biff is a utility to notify a user that mail has arrived.  (There
are various similar utilities for doing this in GUIs, displaying
icons, animations, emitting music or vocal announcements, relaying
biff notifications over a network and using various backend
MSA protocols, etc).
