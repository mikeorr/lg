<blockquote>
Abstract: A proposal to architect and offer Linux based low cost and reliable 
collaborative systems to be used by the virtual support communities for all 
applications in support of the community especially in the arenas of distance 
learning and telemedicine.
</blockquote>

What is needed by the population of these communities including
<UL>
<LI>users: members of the community
<LI>professionals in support of the community
<LI>moderators, experts in specific applications
<LI>government
<LI>health care
<LI>teachers, parents, kids
<LI>aged
<LI>ailing
<LI>disabled
</UL>

is a unified, simple, reliable, affordable telecom platform system, 
preferably voice-activated, that lets the user check for caller ID, receive 
short messages, check for incoming and outgoing E-mail, access address books 
for both telephone numbers, URLs and e-mail addresses, and place and end 
telephone calls. All this without using the maddening complexity of Windows.
<P>
These segments of the population are in deep need for telemedicine and 
distance learning applications which could be delivered on Linux based low 
cost, rugged and simple platforms.
<P>
These segments of the population are in deep need for telemedicine and 
Linux based platforms in which all systems: client desktops, client 
laptops, client tablets, embedded sensors, communication nodes, blade 
servers, all run on Linux. One good example is the Yellow Dog Linux software 
from www.terrasoftwaresolutions.com. 
<P>
The end users of the collaborative community extranet systems appreciate the 
higher grade reliability of the hardware on which Yellow Dog Linux runs since 
it is more rugged and reliable than the PC hardware: Yellow Dog Linux runs on 
the same chips Apple OS X runs on: Power G4, iMAC and variations of it. In 
fact any problems with the hardware or with the OS running on it would defeat 
the collaborative community since the users including the professionals and 
the people in need of health services are not that computer-wise so have no 
tolerance for any glitches. 
<P>
Of course we do not need to be purists and we should also use AMD or Intel 
chip based PCs and even servers as long as they run under Linux such as 
Lindows. The competition between AMD and Intel is providing better and more 
cost effective processor chips including hyper-threading which allows 
multitasking: running multiple applications at the same time.
<P>
Many other Linux hardware and software sources are also worthwhile to 
mention:
<UL>
<LI>to lower the cost of the server farm for the community www.eracks.com 
provides blade servers
<LI>to make available any application software www.linuxiso.com offers 
downloadable Linux software distribution
<LI>to learn about Linux www.freshmeat.com provides Linux tutorials
<LI>some telemed applications such as sensors and actuators may  need custom 
hardware from www.penguincomputing.com 
<LI>certain legacy application interfaces may need will need switching between
Linux and Windows using the  www.pogolinux.com offerings 
</UL>
     
One of the most important features for the collaborative community system 
will be the server based voice recognition capability. Everything that is now 
done by typing and text, will be more quickly and easily performed with voice 
recognition.  That is, a voice will identify a caller, read short messages 
aloud, provide e-mail services in both text-to-voice reading of the incoming 
e-mail and voice-to-text for outgoing E-mail, voice access of address books, 
and voice-activated placing and closing out phone calls, search the web, 
collaborate with the mentor, etc.   
<P>
Once the users are able to answer, make and end a call or a web session 
using just their voices, working with the Linux collaborative system will be 
a breeze and seniors will not feel isolated and lonely.  What a boon to 
society voice-activated unified services will be including telephony and web 
services.  
<P>
Whether or not users are at all computer-savvy, e-mail will also be 
extensively applied in the Linux based collaborative community support system 
machine.  It is, after all, a form of communication as is the telephone.  
Of great value to the user would be e-mail and its corresponding address 
book.  As e-mail comes in, messages could be read by way of a text-to-voice 
method.  Also of great value would be a telephone system with its 
corresponding address book and numbers.  Short messaging could be read 
through text-to-voice technology and short messages can be left using 
voice-to-text methodology.
<P>
With the attractive price of a Linux-based unified communication device 
encompassing all the applications mentioned above, users can be connected and 
productive without the need for an expensive Windows system. Anything that 
allows independence for the user is bound to be helpful to every aspect of 
society.
<P>
Of course the professionals in support of the community will also benefit 
from the simplicity of the user interface of the Linux-based client machine: 
desktop or laptop or later even a tablet. Simpler interface makes it quicker 
to use the system as well as voice recognition will make it more convenient 
resulting in higher precision records and faster execution of sessions.
<P>
Even the able-bodied eyes-busy, hands-busy professionals can use it to 
improve their productivity. This low cost virtual community platforms and 
associated Web connectivity could be very useful in many government and 
commercial employment arenas as well reaching out to the individuals who are 
in need of upgrading in skills. 
<P>
Of course there is still work to be done. Applications for the community 
system must be developed or perfected to allow collaboration between the 
health service professionals or social worker professionals and the many 
people in need. Web connected AT oriented software components running on 
Linux client machines connected to Linux servers have to be created such as...
<UL>
<LI>simple and application specific user interface,
<LI>voice based interaction via computer/telephone,
<LI>always on and always available systems,
<LI>a collaborative virtual community systems,
<LI>life function sensors: blood pressure, respiration, retina, etc.
</UL>
In fact voice recognition offers great promise for the future. However, it 
isn't perfect and needs to be improved. One improvement could use lip reading 
to bolster its accuracy. Still another is multi-tonal voice input. Another is 
directional microphones. Every generation of voice recognition software will 
improve as the hardware for Linux gets bigger and stronger. 
<P>
Using such telephone simple systems the professionals can monitor, mentor and 
moderate and even medicate the members of the collaborative community. 
<P>
For a good example: 
<P>
Dealing with students who have learning disabilities, it is 
important to get their attention, to bolster their behavior 
and finally to improve their cognitive productivity.  With 
assistive technology people can prevent further destruction 
of their faculties, improve their quality of life and can even be 
rehabilitated somewhat.  Just the idea of being productive 
adds to a person's self-esteem enormously. 
<P>
Another very important example is the telemedicine capability which can be 
used in preventative fashion to detect some of the early and silent 
conditions of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular conditions.
