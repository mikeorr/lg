<h1>Low-Fat Linux - Now with Less Cruft!</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/okopnik.html">Ben Okopnik</A></b></p>

<p>
OK, I admit it - there's no such thing as "Low-Fat Linux"
(unless somebody just came out with it in order to spite me.) These
days, the average installation is pretty big - and many of the most
popular programs take up huge swaths of space. Even with a 60GB
hard drive like the one in my laptop, you still have to pay close
attention lest it become Godzilla, The Eater Of All Available Space
(and time, too - but we're not talking about Quake III or Xbubble
at the moment.)
</p>

<p>
So there you are - going along, innocently doing your work (or
playing your games), installing delicious little packages (<a
href="http://linux.softpedia.com/get/Utilities/Yum-2656.shtml">Yum</a>!)
that sound interesting or that your friends recommended... and
then, one day, you cast a casual glance at your system, and a
slight chill runs down your spine.
</p>

<pre class="code">

</pre>

<p>
<strong><em>Yikes!</em></strong> Just look at that '/usr'
partition!
</p>

<p>
And now comes the dreadful awareness that <strong>you're going
to have to delete something.</strong> In fact, given the size of
the partition, and the number of megabytes that it takes to make up
even one percent of it, you're going to have to delete <strong>a
lot</strong> of that something. How the heck are you supposed to
figure out what to delete???
</p>

<p>
Let the panic begin.
</p>

<p>
After a few calming exercises - a little yoga, a lot of deep
breathing, several gin-and-tonics, etc. - you decide on a rational
approach (at least if you didn't go for the gin-and-tonics.
Otherwise, you'll be doing it later - and that hangover headache
will not be working in your favor.) First, you clean out a few
games - the ones you don't play much if at all. However, you
quickly discover that the <em>interesting</em> games are all BIG -
and the simple, boring ones don't do much to fill the trash bucket
with megabytes. Kilobytes, more likely. Run "apt-get clean" to
remove the cached installation packages in Debian? Oh, that
helped... in the '/var' partition, that is. Not in '/usr', where we
need it most desperately.
</p>

<p>
OK, well... let's give it some thought. Oh yeah... all those
installed packages - right. It's going to be quite the long and
tedious process, but it does indeed pay off: one of the effects of
free software is that many people tend to install things "just to
check them out", get distracted, and - well, cruft, like entropy,
always increases. It's just a law of physics. However, although we
haven't yet found a way to reverse the latter, the former can
indeed be done - with a bunch of effort. So, on my Debian laptop,
it all looks like this (at least post-cleanup):
</p>

<p>
Over 2,000 packages... well, I could mutter some sort of a
justification for most of them, anyway. The ones that I couldn't
find a reason to keep went away - configuration and all. That cleared
away a significant chunk - but not enough to "grow on". It was
similar to giving your house a quick little once-over with a whisk
broom and ignoring the dust monsters under the bed, the horrible
mess in the attic ("It's not a problem - nobody can see it!"), and
the biological experiment that used to be a half a pound of tuna
salad in your refrigerator: just fine for a quick visit from your
neighbor, but it would all collapse in a second if your snoopy aunt
Marge came over. Heck, the stuff in the attic will just collapse
onto your head if you let it go a couple more weeks even without
Auntie crawling around up there. It really is better to take care
of it now, <em>before</em> the ambulances, the embarrassing
articles in the local newspaper ("Local Man Buried In His Own
Trash: Mother Dies Of Shame"), and your friends' sarcastic
laughter. Indeed, Drastic Measures are now called for.
</p>

<p>
"<strong>More</strong> drastic measures?", you say, aghast.
"What could be more drastic than giving up my programs, installed
by the sweat of my brow (even if I have no idea what they do and
have never used them in the three years that they've been
installed)? What do you want, <em>blood</em>???" Nah, nothing like
that; I'm usually happy with fine wine and chocolate. Maybe a side
of blood oranges and Rainier cherries, if you really insist.
</p>

<p>
However, my point is that system cruft accumulates almost
invisibly - and costs you little (other than a little study and
searching) to remove. If you've had your system installed for any
significant length of time, and have done a lot of updates, there
are a number of programs which don't remove their previous versions
before installation - notably, programming languages. I'm a big fan
of Perl, and have been installing every new version of it, as well
as many of its modules, as long as I've been using Linux. Chances
are that you, too - given how many programs on the average Linux
systems require Perl - have done the same thing. Ditto Python.
Ditto the GCC compiler. Ditto your favorite language - or perhaps
some language that you've never even heard of but is necessary for
compiling your favorite applications. In other words, you need to
take a second, differently-informed look at that package listing:
even if you don't know much about programming, you can still spot
multiple installed versions of languages. Of course, if trying to
uninstall one produces a message warning you of current
dependencies, and you want to keep all the programs that depend on
that specific version of a language, then you need to hold on to it
- but usually, the latest version is enough. If you're careful, and
know what you're doing, you can look at, e.g., the
'/usr/{share,lib}/{perl,python,ruby}*' and
'/usr/local/{share,lib}/{perl,python,ruby}*' directories and see
which ones are redundant - or perhaps can become so if you
reinstall the modules in the newest versions of those languages. I
found, for example, that removing the old Perl, Python, and Ruby
versions from those locations freed up several hundred megabytes -
at no cost beyond reinstalling a few packages. Admittedly, this did
take some time and careful querying of the package database.
</p>

<p>
OK, now that we're on the hunt - what's next? Well, one of the
traditional ways to chomp arbitrary but huge amounts of space on
your machine - not that this is specifically Linux-related - has
always been the installation of <em>fonts</em>. Great Ghu knows why
we need so many: after all, despite our best imagination, few of us
are actually graphic designers. Most of us, though, end up
installing lots and lots of them... and then sneaking in a few
more, just to be sure. Many ([<em>cough</em>] several hundred) of
these can all be some indistinguishably-similar version of Arial or
Times New Roman or Tekton - but, hey, who knows? We just might feel
like <em>this</em> one instead of <em>that</em> one someday, and
then what would we do if it wasn't there?...
</p>

<p>
"Off", cried the Red Queen, "with their heads!" And rightly so.
At least if they're unnecessary fonts.
</p>

<pre>
ben@Fenrir:~$ xlsfonts|wc -l
18673
</pre>

<p>
Oh, dear. That is just way, way too many fonts. Sure, I like them
as much as anyone else... but really. If I estimate - generously -
the number of fonts that I actually use, explicitly and by name, I
<em>might</em> come up with a dozen. OK, two dozen. If I want to
get really fancy with an OpenOffice document while making up a
business brochure, I might like to have a field of, say, fifty or a
hundred to look at... but over eighteen <strong>thousand</strong>?
I think not.

[ Actual complete list snipped in embarassment ]
</pre>

<p>
Well, lots of them, anyway.
</p>

<p>
A careful review and removal of these - paying attention to the
dependency warnings, of course - helped quite a lot, another couple
of hundred megabytes or so. What helped even more was a careful
examination of the actual font directories - it turns out that
X.org (as contrasted against XFree86) decided to rationalize their
font structure by combining it with the traditional system location
for fonts, '/usr/share/fonts' instead of the old
'/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts'. <strong>However</strong>, the old font
directory was still there - and still packed with a hundred-plus MB
worth of files! A careful comparison of what was there (in fact, I
backed up the entire directory temporarily to see if there were any
bad effects) with the new '/usr/share/fonts/X11' structure helped
recover a huge bunch of space. I did end up keeping quite a lot
more than a hundred fonts, by the way - I depend on Unicode fonts
for quite a lot of my work, and I need a good selection of Russian
and Japanese fonts in addition to the base font package that comes
with X - but at this point, I'm down to a much more reasonable
5000+ fonts (around 3000 unique ones), including all the TrueType
fonts that I like.
</p>

<p>
A quick digression into details may be useful here: I suggest
taking a good look at Thomas Adam's <a href="../128/adam.html">"How
Fonts Interact with the X Server and X Clients"</a> article to gain
a bit of understanding of how fonts work. Taking him at his word
("...font servers: you don't need them."), I carefully checked all
my font directories for the presence of "fonts.alias", "fonts.dir",
and, in the case of TrueType fonts, "fonts.scale" files - all
easily created with the help of the 'ttmkfdir' and 'mkfontdir'
utilities. I then confirmed that all my font directories were
listed in my '/etc/X11/xorg.conf', in the "Files" section, and -
<em>Voila!</em> - I had all my fonts available without running the
'xfs' or 'xfstt' servers, or having 'unix/:7100' or 'unix/:7101'
(the server ports) listed in that section or in the 'xset q'
report. Not that those servers took up a huge amount of space, but
X now seems to start a bit faster than it used to, at least in my
perception.
</p>

<p>
So, was all that worth it? You might say so.
</p>

<pre class="code">
ben@Fenrir:~$ df -h
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/hda3             958M  362M  548M  40% /
/dev/hda5              33G   25G  6.5G  79% /home
/dev/hda1             5.5G  4.8G  521M  91% /home/ben/Music

/dev/hda7             1.9G  700M  1.1G  40% /var
/dev/hda8              46M  9.1M   35M  21% /boot
tmpfs                 253M  4.0K  253M   1% /dev/shm
</pre>

<p>
Sure, that took a couple of hours of work - but at this point, I
know the state of my system, I've got a couple of gigabytes worth
of space in '/usr' again, and I'm more aware of what kinds of
things eat up space (and what should be checked once in a while.)
In my opinion, that's definitely a gain - in knowledge and
understanding, as well as in available disk space.
