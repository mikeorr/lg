<p>In these days of distributions that come on six CDs, it's
good to remember that a very functional Linux
fits on a Zip cartridge -- or even a couple of floppies.

<p>To prove the utility of a tiny Linux, I set up a two-floppy
system on a 486 and used it to write this article.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>"It all" began when I was given a pair of PCs and one monitor.
The larger computer, an Aptiva, had a P133 CPU, a 2GB hard drive,
a CD-ROM drive, and no RAM at all.
The second computer was an HP Vectra 486/33N
with a 170MB hard drive, Windows 3.1, and 8MB of RAM (no CD).
Both systems had mice, but no keyboards.
A trip to Wal-Mart and $10(US) later, and I had a PS/2-compatible
keyboard.
Since the two computers both used 72-pin SIMMs, the first thing I
did was to swap the RAM into the Aptiva and see if anything useful
was on that big hard drive.

<p>I learned something valuable.
I learned what Window 98 chokes on insufficient RAM, ungraciously.

<p>I didn't happen to have any extra RAM lying around.
So I put the RAM back in the Vectra and dug up the RedHat 4.0 disks
I had... oops, they're CDs and this Vectra doesn't have a CD (and
no slots in the case to mount one).
Obviously, I needed another strategy.

<h2>Lookin' Mighty Floppy</h2>

<p><a href="http://lwn.net/daily/">Linux Daily News</a> is one of my
daily stops on the Web.
If LWN doesn't have the info you need, they have a link to it.
I pulled up the <a href="http://lwn.net/Distributions/">Distributions</a>
page and scrolled down to the floppy-based list.

<p>My first thought was everyone's favorite single-floppy rescue
distribution,
<a href="http://www.toms.net/rb/home.html">tomsrtbt</a>.
I have a Windows laptop at work, strictly secondary to my Mac G3,
but on occasion it actually makes itself useful.
Unfortunately, tomsrtbt uses some funky disk voodoo to pack
1.7MB onto a 1.44MB floppy, and IT had recently "up"graded the
laptop to Windows 2000.
W2K doesn't allow such shenanigans, and I don't have easy
access to another Windows system.

<p>Back to the list.
While poking around a few other resources, I found that
<a href="http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~ichi/baslinux.html">BasicLinux</a>
isn't really a CD-based distribution (like the LWN Distribution
page claims).
It comes in a single ZIP file, totalling 2MB, but the unpacked
files fit easily on two floppies and doesn't require you to
write an image (it uses LOADLIN.EXE to start from DOS).
Derived from Slackware 3.5, it sports a 2.0.34 kernel and libc5.
It also allocates only 4MB for its RAMdisk, allowing the Vectra
to get its first taste of free software.

<h2>Up and Away</h2>

<p>Despite differences in software vintage, disk format, and
intent, floppy-based distributions have a fairly similar startup
sequence:

<ol>
<li>Initialization, either at startup (LILO) or after DOS loads
(LOADLIN).
<li>The loader decompresses the kernel and starts it.
<li>The kernel creates a RAMdisk for its userland.
<li>The loader decompresses the userland and loads it into the RAMdisk.
<li>Booting proceeds as normal, with the RAMdisk mounted at root.
</ol>

<p>A disk image containing the userland (i.e. the contents of
the filesystem) usually
fits snugly on a 1.44MB floppy and expands to about 3MB.
Running from a RAMdisk, even a 486/33 feels pretty snappy.

<h3>Tradeoffs</h3>

<p>Wedging even a minimal Linux onto two floppies brings to mind
Heinlein's immortal observation "TANSTAAFL"
(There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch).
While it's possible to offer some basic utilities and even X11,
you won't find KDE, Gnome, or Mozilla.
Emacs addicts can just forget it (well, mostly).

<p>Even the basic commands and utilities, the things you expect
from any OS whose name ends in 'X,' are cut-back versions.
Actually, most of them are simply symbolic links to a program
called <a href="http://busybox.lineo.com/">BusyBox</a>.
Lineo developed this clever kit for embedded Linux systems,
but it has also found its way into the various rescue and
micro distributions.
It packs 54 of the essential commands into a single binary
of just over 110K.
Create a link (using ln -s) named <b>cp</b>, and when you
enter that command Busybox acts like a <b>cp</b> command.
When you run it as <b>mv</b>, it moves or renames files.
The <b>--help</b> option provides a brief description of
the command, eliminating an absolute need for manpages as well.
Without BusyBox, I dare say floppy-based distributions would
have to make even more compromises.

<h2>Working with BasicLinux</h2>

<p>BasicLinux is a compact but competent networking system.
Besides the essentials (via BusyBox), it provides network
connectivity through both Ethernet and dialup, and can
pull firewall duty using <b>ipfwadm</b>.
Utilities like <b>fetchmail</b> and <b>links</b> (not
<b>lynx</b>, that threw me) provide mail and web connectivity.
To keep seasoned Linux users comfortable as possible, it
provides the familiar <b>bash</b> shell.
The default inittab provides three console logins, more
than enough for my purposes (I sometimes use two consoles
at a time, one for me and one for root).

<p>Unlike some distributions, BasicLinux offers two text
editors, the tiny <b>e3</b> and the popular <b>pico</b>.
Taking advantage of some leftover space in the boot image,
and the historic
Slackware package archive, I replaced them both with
<b>joe</b>. Joe is an editor slightly larger than <b>pico</b>
but it can emulate <b>pico</b>, WordStar, and Emacs
(but without all the bloated Emacs hyper-functionality).
The result is a larger compressed image, but
one that still fits on a floppy.

<h3>Editing the Image</h3>

<p>The <b>readme.txt</b> file that comes with BasicLinux
is brief, but provides enough detail for anyone familiar
with a console to customize the system or create
a bootable floppy image.

<p>As I write this section of the article, I have the
BasicLinux files on the C: drive of a 486 that would
otherwise be running MS-DOS.
Customizing the image is simple:

<ol>
<li>Use <b>gunzip</b> to decompress the image.
<li>Mount the image on a loopback device.
<li>Make changes as desired.
<li>Unmount the image.
<li>Gzip the image.
</ol>

<P> I've written up a <A HREF="misc/kollar/loopback.html">separate page</A> describing
the loopback device.

<h2>Migrating to the Hard Drive</h2>

<p>This isn't difficult, if you're willing to wipe out everything
on the hard drive.
The Vectra had Windows 3.1 and a pile of applications,
nothing that I particularly needed to keep.

<p>Before plunging forward, I did a little research and backed
up the MS-DOS directory onto floppy (using a zip compressor that
was already on the computer).
With a 160MB hard drive and 8MB of RAM, I figured I would have
enough room to build a capable system without being tempted to
overload it.

<p>A Google search for partition resizing programs turned up
the free
<a href="http://www.igd.fhg.de/~aschaefe/fips/">FIPS</a>
(First non-destructive Interactive Partiton Splitting program).
Following the instructions, I put FIPS on a boot floppy and
used it to shrink the C: partition.
I wanted to reduce it to 10MB, but FIPS (for whatever reason)
would not go below 16MB.
After wiping out all the Windows 3.1 stuff and defragmenting
the hard drive, I had less than 5MB on C: so I'm not sure
what happened.
Oh well.

<p>Now I started Linux again and used the <b>fdisk</b>
utility that came with BasicLinux to create a 32MB swap
partition and dedicate the rest of the drive to root.
Running <b>mkswap</b>, <b>mke2fs</b>, and <b>e2fsck</b>
prepared the new partitions for use.
Finally, I unpacked the BasicLinux <b>instl2hd.zip</b>
archive and followed the instructions that came with it
to load my RAMdisk image (and some extras) onto the
hard drive.
From there, it was a simple matter of editing /etc/fstab
to point to the new root and swap partitions.
One more reboot, and I was running from the hard drive.
Life is good.
I copied my article to the Linux partition and continued
writing.

<h2>Caught in the Net</h2>

<p>With the console-based system using less than 5MB of
RAM, and leaving 3MB of RAM free, I set
my sights a little higher.
In short, I wanted to add:

<ul>
<li>groff (the GNU troff formatter)
<li>vim (first-class text editing)
<li>rogue (kill some monsters, break the mental block)
<li>X11 (display draft documents)
<li>gcc (at least temporarily, to compile groff and rogue)
</ul>

<p>Fortunately, the Vectra came with an SMB-Ultra network card.
It didn't take long to find the proper module, and the BasicLinux
documentation told me to load the 8390 module first.
Since I already have my Mac G3 running a NAT firewall
(ipchains) under Linux to share the dialup, adding the
Vectra to the network was mainly a matter of carrying it
into the room with the LAN and plugging in a cable.
After some fiddling and reading the <b>route</b> manpage
several times, I finally figured out the incantations
needed to get Skeeter (as I started calling the Vectra)
talking to the LAN then through the G3's gateway and into
the outside world.

<p>Downloading the X11 packages reminded me that there are
even slower network links than my dialup.
This was one of the few times I was glad to not have
broadband; I would have felt cheated.
But eventually, I got them all onto the hard drive,
then set about configuring X11.
Poking around on the net for help, I learned that
the SuperProbe utility would tell me what the Vectra's
on-board video was, and that my monitor was
strictly 640x480.
On my second evening, I got the GUI running and switched to
the recommended <b>icewm</b> for a window manager.
<b>Icewm</b>'s pager and small size made the cramped
screen tolerable if not palatable.
But to be fair, a 35-line <b>rxvt</b> window beats a 25-line
console screen for writing, so overall I'm satisfied.

<h3>The Rest</h3>

<p>With the network and GUI working, it was now time to
finish out the build.
At this point, the entire system weighed in at just under
21MB of hard drive space (out of 113MB available).
Adding the compiler packages took this up to 35MB.

<p>Adding the packages needed to compile
<a href="http://groff.ffii.org/">groff</a> and
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/gawk.html">gawk</a>,
plus the compiled applications themselves, went over 60MB used.
After installing the programs and deleting the build directories,
I was satisfied with the 57MB in use.

<p>Having dealt with sharing a printer over a LAN via
<b>lpr</b> before, it wasn't long before I was able to
run a few test <b>groff</b> documents and have them
print to the G3's USB laser printer.
At this point, Skeeter is doing everything I'd planned for it.
I'd like to put a larger monitor on it (800x600 at least),
and perhaps compile Chimera 1.x for use as a graphical
web browser, but neither of these are absolute necessities.

<h2>Finding its Own Niche</h2>

<p>Besides being available for writing articles like this one,
Skeeter can connect to MUDs for recreation (imagine three
people sharing a dialup -- since two are using <b>telnet</b>,
and the third is just reading email in a browser, nobody
complains about the connection being slow).
Rogue captivated my teenage son and his friend -- the friend
marvelled at how a game without graphics could be so fun!

<p>Skeeter has also made itself useful as a sort-of remote
floppy drive.
The iMac (now running MacOS X) has no floppy, and the G3's
drive is somewhat dodgy.
So if we need to read or write a floppy, we call on Skeeter.
Skeeter may become a print server in the future as well.

<p>In the end, I deem the experiment a success.
An investment of $10
plus a little sweat equity gave me another useful
computer and some new skills.
