<H2>Here, Mousie....</H2>

By <A HREF="mailto:H.Drummond@wlv.ac.uk">Harry Drummond</A>

<P> If you're reading this, you're probably well at ease with your mouse by
now. Some of us got the idea fairly easily, while others had to struggle.
One of the roots of failure, I've observed, is that beginners often hold
the mouse from above, like a cat that's just pounced on it and is
determined that it isn't going to get away from <EM>them</EM>. Then they punch the
button ferociously, and the mouse sheers wildly off target in terror.

<P> I've persuaded several such people to relax their death-grip; to let their
hand lie on the surface behind the mouse, just guiding it quietly with
thumb and little finger, and gently clicking the buttons when necessary.
And if their hand-eye co-ordination was shakey, then to work in L-shapes
(e.g. down then across), and allow direct movement to creep in in its own
time. These people have all come back a week later, pleased to report that
they've got much better.

<P> But in earlier days of computer mice, when they were still alien objects to
many people, it was not uncommon for me to watch students put a mouse on
its back and twiddle the mouse ball with their finger tips. The screen
behaviour was wonderfully erratic, and as a method of selection it had
distinct problems with clicking buttons, too.

<P> On one occasion I watched two girls doing this and in friendly fashion
showed them the proper way of using a mouse. They smiled, said thank you,
and a few minutes later the mouse was on its back again. Not foolish - just
their way of working. Or maybe I was seeing the birth of the trackerball...

<EM>Mike ("Iron") is the Editor of <I>Linux Gazette</I>.  You can read what he has
to say in the Back Page column in this issue.  He has been a Linux enthusiast
since 1991 and a Debian user since 1995.  He is SSC's web technical
coordinator, which means he gets to write a lot of Python scripts.
Non-computer interests include Ska/Oi! music and the international language
Esperanto.  The nickname Iron was given to him in college--short for Iron Orr,
hahaha.</EM>
