<h3><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
<strong>What is White Box?</strong> <a href="http://whiteboxlinux.org/">White Box
Enterprise Linux</a> is just RedHat's Enterprise Server 3 recompiled from
the source RPMs RH provides. Just for kicks, I ran a md5sum comparison
between the RH RPMs and WhiteBox RPMs, and in almost all cases, they were
identical. Most of the mismatches were related to trademark logos and such
or were RPMs that WhiteBox didn't need.
<p>
White Box is very good for testing and developing since it doesn't
require any licenses to use. It also should be considered for
production use. Please consider contributing towards the White Box. 
It is a great project!
<p>
<strong>What is Kickstart?</strong> A means of automating Linux installations
and upgrades. First, you create a single configuration file which
you put on a floppy disk. Then, you boot your computer from the floppy disk, and
it will be configured based on the Kickstart configuration file. 
If the configuration file is set up right, no questions or prompts are asked
during the installation.
<p>
<strong>So what are the Kickstart tricks?</strong> In this article, I'm
going to talk about the experience I've gained using Kickstart during the
last 6 years and in the course of my work at <a
href="http://www.nuasis.com/">Nuasis</a>
as a Systems Administrator and Programmer.<p>
Please read the following manual before reading the rest of this
article.
<ol>
  <li><a
 href="https://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-9-Manual/custom-guide/">
 https://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-9-Manual/custom-guide/</a></li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="Kickstart"></a>Kickstart walk through</h3>
To me, this is what Kickstart does:
<ol>
  <li>You stick in your boot floppy or boot cdrom.</li>
  <li>It brings you to the isolinux boot prompt (similar to lilo). You
can override various settings. 
  </li>
  <li>It boots from the media. 
  </li>
  <li>Installs a shell and the installation software from an image
(from the media or the net).
  </li>
  <li>Tries to get the Kickstart file (ks.cfg), whether it is on the net or on
your media.</li>
  <li>Starts the installation.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="kickpost"></a>KickPost trick</h3>
There is a neat trick you can do to your ks.cfg file. An undocumented
feature which works just fine is the ability to include another ks.cfg
file in your ks.cfg file. Put something like this
<pre>
%ksappend http://10.10.10.10/include_this_file.ks
</pre>
into your ks.cfg file. It will probably also work with another file on the
floppy disk or cdrom (but why would you do that?).
<p>

<h3><a name="dhcp"></a>DHCP Stupidity + ksappend Trick</h3>
By setting <code>append ip=dhcp</code>
in the isolinux.cfg file of the boot floppy or cdrom, or by typing in
"ip=dhcp" at
the boot prompt, you can boot your computer from a DHCP server for
Kickstarting
purposes. The Kickstart process will also try to use DHCP if you try to get
something from the net and the network settings were not specified. 
NOTE: The ip address during Kickstart doesn't have to be the same as
when
the computer reboots after installation.
<p>Besides setting up the network settings, DHCP has the capability of
telling your computer where to get the Kickstart file. Here is the
problem: The installation program has no way of getting a file except
through NFS. Trying to pass a url for a the location of the file won't work.
I hate
NFS. I have always had problems with it. I prefer to use a web server
for Kickstarts. </p>
<p>There are two solutions around this:

<ol>
  <li>issue the <tt>ks=http://somewhere.com/myconfig.ks</tt> command at boot
time or in the isolinux.cfg file located on the boot floppy or boot
cdrom. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Use the kickpost command in a generic Kickstart file. <br>
  </li>
</ol>
If you decide to use the kickpost command in the Kickstart file, then
leave the ks.cfg file on your boot media as generic as possible. The
kickpost command in the Kickstart file will download the rest of your
Kickstart file. <p>
Thus, the ks.cfg file located on the floppy or cdrom would look like
this:
<pre class="code">
keyboard us
lang en_US
langsupport en_US
network --bootproto=dhcp
%ksappend http://10.10.10.10/include_this_file.ks
</pre><p>
The isolinux.cfg file would look like<br>
<pre class="code">
default my_default
prompt 1
timeout 600
display boot.msg
F1 boot.msg
F2 options.msg
F3 general.msg
F4 param.msg
F5 rescue.msg
F7 snake.msg
label my_default
  kernel vmlinuz
  append ip=dhcp initrd=initrd.img 
  kssendmac ksdevice=eth0 lang=en_US
label linux
  kernel vmlinuz
  append ks initrd=initrd.img
label text
  kernel vmlinuz
  append initrd=initrd.img text
label expert
  kernel vmlinuz
  append expert initrd=initrd.img
label ks
  kernel vmlinuz
  append ks initrd=initrd.img
label lowres
  kernel vmlinuz
  append initrd=initrd.img lowres</pre>
Thus, you can get around the fact that DHCP can't send a url as the location
of your Kickstart file. 
Also, <tt>include_this_file.ks</tt>
doesn't have to be a text file. It could be a script which prints out
the correct Kickstart file based on the ip or MAC address. 
<p>
Another trick -- let the DHCP server be a DNS server as well. 
<br>If your include command is something like this:
<pre>%ksappend http://Kickstart.foo/include_this_file.ks</pre>
Then have DHCP point to itself to be the DNS server, and it can assign
an ip address for "Kickstart.foo" (which could be itself).
 This enables you use an arbitrary
server. Practically, you would probably have the dhcp, dns, and Kickstart
services run on the same computer. 
<p>

<h3><a name="cdrom"></a>Boot installation cdrom</h3>
If you want to create your own bootable cdrom for installation, then
please read the link below. This eliminates the need to use floppies.
Another nice thing to do is have your computer eject the cdrom and reboot.
(Assuming
your rack mount server doesn't reload your cdrom after a reboot) you start the
Kickstart, walk away and go to lunch, come back, and your computer is
ready to be used. If your computer loads the cdrom after a reboot, then
you don't want to do that. <br>
<a
 href="https://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-9-Manual/install-guide/s1-steps-install-cdrom.html#S2-STEPS-MAKE-CD">
https://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-9-Manual/install-guide/s1-steps-install-cdrom.html#S2-STEPS-MAKE-CD</a>
<p>
A sample isolinux.cfg file for the bootable cdrom would look like this:
<br>
<pre class="code">
default my_default
prompt 1
timeout 600
display boot.msg
F1 boot.msg
F2 options.msg
F3 general.msg
F4 param.msg
F5 rescue.msg
F7 snake.msg
label my_default
  kernel vmlinuz
  append ks=http://10.10.10.10/Kickstart/wb.ks ip=10.10.10.100 gateway=10.10.10.1 netmask=255.255.255.0 dns=10.10.10.50 initrd=initrd.img kssendmac \
  ksdevice=eth0 lang=en_US
label linux
  kernel vmlinuz
  append ks initrd=initrd.img
label text
  kernel vmlinuz
  append initrd=initrd.img text
label expert
  kernel vmlinuz
  append expert initrd=initrd.img
label ks
  kernel vmlinuz
  append ks initrd=initrd.img
label lowres
  kernel vmlinuz
  append initrd=initrd.img lowres</pre>
<br>
Now how do you eject the cdrom at the end of the installation?
Put <tt>reboot</tt> as an option in your ks.cfg file if your computer doesn't
reload the cdrom after a reboot. 
Otherwise, put this at the end of the post section in your <tt>ks.cfg</tt> file. 
It will basically try to eject every IDE device. If it is a hard drive,
who cares, but if is a cdrom, it works.
If there is an easy way to do it with a normal command in Kickstart, I
missed it.
<pre class="code">
mkdir /mnt/hda
mkdir /mnt/hdb
mkdir /mnt/hdc
mkdir /mnt/hdd
mknod /dev/hda b 3 0
mknod /dev/hdb b 3 64
mknod /dev/hdc b 22 0
mknod /dev/hdd b 22 64
echo '/dev/hda /mnt/hda iso9660,ro 0 0
/dev/hdb /mnt/hdb iso9660,ro 0 0
/dev/hdc /mnt/hdc iso9660,ro 0 0
/dev/hdd /mnt/hdd iso9660,ro 0 0' &gt;&gt; /etc/fstab
/mnt/sysimage/usr/bin/eject /dev/hda
/mnt/sysimage/usr/bin/eject /dev/hdb
/mnt/sysimage/usr/bin/eject /dev/hdc
/mnt/sysimage/usr/bin/eject /dev/hdd</pre>

<h3><a name="boot"></a>Boot prompt options</h3>
Read these two docs. <br>
<ol>
  <li><a
 href="https://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-9-Manual/install-guide/ch-bootopts.html">https://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-9-Manual/install-guide/ch-bootopts.html</a></li>
  <li><a
 href="http://docs.rage.net/system/anaconda-9.0/command-line.txt">http://docs.rage.net/system/anaconda-9.0/command-line.txt</a></li>
</ol>
Whether you boot from a floppy disk or a cdrom, these two docs are very
useful. Basically, what you want to do is customize the isolinux.cfg
file located on the floppy disk or cdrom. For example, you can put in
the ip address, netmask, dns, gateway, and even the location of the
Kickstart file on the net. This can be very useful if you Kickstart a
computer over and over again and you don't have or want dhcp. You can
override these options at boot time. One idea is to create a generic boot
cdrom, and then at the boot prompt
 type in the ip address you want to use (if you
don't have a DHCP server).<p>
Here is a useful trick given the configuration below. The "wb.ks" file
on the web server doesn't have to be a text file. If can actually be a
script which detects the ip address or MAC address of the computer
being Kickstarted and print out the appropriate Kickstart file. Thus,
the url for the Kickstart file will stay the same, but the network
settings might change. This is useful if you don't have a DHCP server.
For Perl, look at the %ENV hash and for Python, look at the os.environ
dictionary, to get the ip address or the MAC address. 
You can also pass arguments in the url if you know what you are doing
 (for example, pass the host name, and then the perl or python script
can determine which Kickstart file to use if it doesn't recognize your
ip address or MAC address).
<p>
A sample isolinux.cfg file for the bootable cdrom would look like this:
<br>
<pre class="code">
default my_default
prompt 1
timeout 600
display boot.msg
F1 boot.msg
F2 options.msg
F3 general.msg
F4 param.msg
F5 rescue.msg
F7 snake.msg
label my_default
  kernel vmlinuz
  append ks=http://10.10.10.10/Kickstart/wb.ks ip=10.10.10.100 gateway=10.10.10.1 netmask=255.255.255.0 dns=10.10.10.50 initrd=initrd.img kssendmac \
  ksdevice=eth0 lang=en_US
label linux
  kernel vmlinuz
  append ks initrd=initrd.img
label text
  kernel vmlinuz
  append initrd=initrd.img text
label expert
  kernel vmlinuz
  append expert initrd=initrd.img
label ks
  kernel vmlinuz
  append ks initrd=initrd.img
label lowres
  kernel vmlinuz
  append initrd=initrd.img lowres</pre>
<br>

<h3><a name="wget"></a>pre and post tricks with wget</h3>
"wget" is a program which is available during installation time. It can
download files over the net. Why is this program useful during
Kickstart? In your ks.cfg file, you can use it to download files and
put it on your computer. Why is this useful? Well, if you can only
install an rpm after the computer has booted, then you can at least
download it during installation time. Then, if you are smart
enough, you can use a firstboot script to install the rpm the first
time the computer comes up. <p>
An example in the ks.cfg file would be:<br>
<pre>%post
wget -q -O /mnt/sysimage/usr/src/local/sompackage.rpm http://myserver.local/sompackage.rpm</pre>

<h3><a name="install"></a>Kickstart tricks with the installer:
ssh,
bash, and other binaries</h3>
Here is an advanced trick which you should only do if you are good at
Linux in general. You can basically install any piece of software into
your installation program. For example, you can install ssh and ssh to
a computer somewhere to you read your email while the computer is being
Kickstarted. Sometimes, I am trapped in our Network Operations Center at work, and I am bored
watching a Kickstart process, so I use ssh to connect to one of my
computers to do something useful. <p>
Below, I am going to show you how to install any binary file. You have
to be careful about how much space you use up. First off, the
installation program uses an image to get a lot of the binaries it uses
during installation. An example image is 
<a href="ftp://mirror.physics.ncsu.edu/pub/whitebox/3.0/en/os/i386/RedHat/base/netstg2.img">
ftp://mirror.physics.ncsu.edu/pub/whitebox/3.0/en/os/i386/RedHat/base/netstg2.img</a><p>
Now, what you do is modify this image. Here is an example script:<br>

<pre class="code">

### in case you run this script twice
mkdir -p mnt
umount mnt
rm -rf new_image
rm -f netstg2.img

  ## Get and mount the old image
wget -q -O netstg2_orig.img ftp://mirror.physics.ncsu.edu/pub/whitebox/3.0/en/os/i386/RedHat/base/netstg2.img
mkdir -p mnt
mount -o loop netstg2_orig.img mnt
  ## Make the new image directory
mkdir -p new_image

  ## rsync the old image to the new image
rsync -a mnt/* new_image/
 
  ## rsync a bunch of other stuff over
rsync -a /usr/sbin/ssh* new_image/usr/sbin/
rsync -a /usr/bin/ssh* new_image/usr/bin/
rsync -a /usr/bin/rsync* new_image/usr/bin/
rsync -a /usr/bin/nmap* new_image/usr/bin/
rsync -a /usr/bin/scp* new_image/usr/bin/
rsync -a /bin/bash new_image/usr/bin/

  ## Make a dependency list -- very crude
ldd /usr/sbin/sshd | cut -d ' ' -f3 | cut -d '.' -f1 &gt; List.dep
ldd /usr/bin/ssh | cut -d ' ' -f3 | cut -d '.' -f1 &gt;&gt; List.dep
ldd /usr/bin/nmap | cut -d ' ' -f3 | cut -d '.' -f1 &gt;&gt; List.dep
ldd /bin/bash | cut -d ' ' -f3 | cut -d '.' -f1 &gt;&gt; List.dep
ldd /usr/bin/rsync | cut -d ' ' -f3 | cut -d '.' -f1 &gt;&gt; List.dep
ldd /usr/bin/scp | cut -d ' ' -f3 | cut -d '.' -f1 &gt;&gt; List.dep
ldd /usr/bin/screen | cut -d ' ' -f3 | cut -d '.' -f1 &gt;&gt; List.dep

  ### execute the perl script to copy over the libraries
chmod 755 Copy_Lib.pl
./Copy_Lib.pl

  ### Make your image. 
mkcramfs --verbose new_image netstg2.img

  ### replace netstg2.img on the Kickstart server or cdrom 
  ### with the new one you just created.
</pre>
<p>
Here is the Copy_Lib.pl script:
<pre class="code">
#!/usr/bin/perl

open(FILE,&quot;List.dep&quot;);
my @Lines = &lt;FILE&gt;;
close FILE;
(@Lines) = grep($_ =~ /[a-zA-Z0-9]/, @Lines);

my $Home = &quot;new_image&quot;;
foreach my $Line (@Lines) {
    chomp $Line;
    my $Reverse = reverse $Line;
    my (@Temp) = split(/\//, $Reverse, 2);
    my $Dir = reverse($Temp[1]);
    print `mkdir -vp $Home/$Dir`;
    $Command = &quot;rsync -av --ignore-existing $Line* $Home/$Dir/&quot; ;
    $Command2 = &quot;rsync -av --copy-links --ignore-existing $Line* $Home/$Dir/&quot;;
    print &quot;$Command\n&quot;;
    print `$Command`;
    print &quot;$Command2\n&quot;;
    print `$Command2`;
}
</pre>
<p>
I had trouble changing the default shell to bash during the Kickstart. 
So, in the <tt>%pre</tt> section of the ks.cfg file, I entered this command:
<pre>cp /usr/bin/bash /</pre>
then when I clicked on Alt-F2 during installation time, I executed the
command:
<pre>./bash</pre>
and I got a good bash shell. 
<p>

Here is another interesting tidbit, you can also install a service. For
example, I tried to get sshd running during a Kickstart. I copied over
all the libraries, created a shadow password file, modified
/etc/passwd, and actually got sshd to run at Kickstart time
automatically. However, when I tried to connect to the computer being
Kickstarted, it would crash sshd running on that computer. Crashing
sshd didn't affect the Kickstart process. It wasn't important enough
for me to get it working, so I gave up.<p>If I actually could get
to work, I could watch the Kickstart process from my desktop.
 I think running an Apache web server should be fine.
I could setup the web server
with a few python scripts. Those scripts would report on the health of
the Kickstart process. That would be cool. Python already exists in the
Kickstart program. <br>


<h3><a name="improve"></a>Things to improve</h3>
There are only two things in Kickstart which upset me, and either I can
live without. <br>
<ol>
  <li>You can't send a host name request to the DHCP server (you
would have to change the boot options of your install media to do this
if it were possible). The only thing the DHCP server can do is match
your computer by its MAC address. With the normal dhclient program
(after you have installed Linux) you can make a host name request, but
not during Kickstart (maybe we should copy over the dhclient
software onto the netstg2.img file and execute dhclient in the
%pre section of the ks file?). If you know how to setup the
dhcp server, it can return the correct fixed ip address even without
knowing the MAC address. It is beyond the scope of this article to
explain how to do that. <br>
  </li>
  <li>DHCP only lets you get the Kickstart file from an NFS server.
This is not a problem with DHCP but with the Kickstart process.
It should be able to return a url and the installer
should be able to detect the url and download  the ks file. It looks
like it should be very easy to edit the source code of Anaconda to make
it do just that. I briefly looked at the source code and everything is
there to download files from a web or ftp server, so it is just a
matter of someone doing it.</li>
</ol>
My complaints above actually affect my work. Because DHCP relied
heavily on the MAC address, and we couldn't get MAC addresses ahead of
time, we ended up not using DHCP for one solution. That was
unfortunate. <br>
<h3><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3>
Overall, I have been pleased with Kickstarting computers. It has proven to 
be a very powerful tool. 
<p>
I pretty much have no future plans with Kickstart except to contribute
to the <A href="http://linux.duke.edu/projects/yum/">Yum</a>
 project by making a Yum server capable of making Kickstart configurations
 and managing Yum repositories. My dream is to replace
RH satellite servers with Yum servers.
I would of course use the Python
programming language to do this, as it is my favorite programming language
and Yum is already written in Python (yeah!).
