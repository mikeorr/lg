<h3>
<a NAME="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
I am sick of playing cds. Half the songs on a cd suck. I don't like switching
cds in and out. I am sick of commercial radio with their stupid mid-life
crisis hosts who try to appeal to teenagers by trying to act like them (grow
up). I like to listen to music (from cds)
 or shows on NPR as background noise while I
program. I decided to develop a way to make my computer play songs and NPR 
shows as though it were a radio. This will eliminate cds and commercial radio
shows. 
I want my computer to play this stuff in 
a random order. The first thing I wanted to do was rip songs from my cds
and play them in a random order. 
The second thing (which is not in this article) was to download
a playlist of all the shows I like to listen to on NPR
(I hope someday NPR will accept my offer to develop playlists (as my donation) 
for their listeners). 

<p>For now, I am keeping things really really simple. In the future, I plan
to add playlists, give songs weight, put stuff into a PostgreSQL databases,
add accounts, etc. 

<p>
I am very lazy. So lazy, I didn't bother to look long at the various web-based 
mpeg organizers of your favorite songs. I just wanted something to spit out
200 songs in a random order so that it simulates a radio station. I first
had to rip the songs and then write a simple 
<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> script to split out a playlist. 
<p>

<h3><a NAME="apache"></a>Configuring Apache</h3>
On your Linux server, find your html root directory for your httpd server.
On some systems, this is located at "/var/www/html". Assuming that it is,
do this:
<pre>
cd /var/www/html
mkdir audio
</pre>

Now copy all of your mp3, rm, wav, or other audio files into the directory
"/var/www/html/audio". NOTE: Do you not use your web server for anybody
but yourself. Only you may listen to these songs or you may get into
copyright problems. Contact an attorney for issues regarding legal issues.
<p>
To start your webserver, usually you can do this "service httpd start".
If that doesn't work, then look at the documentation that came with your
Linux distribution to figure out how to start and stop the web service.
Usually the default web server on most Linux systems with be Apache.

<h3><a NAME="grip"></a>Using Grip to Rip</h3>
After looking at many programs, Grip seemed to be the easiest to use to
rip songs from a cd. It organizes the songs by author and album. Nice. 
Here are the steps I used to configure Grip. 
<ol>
<li> Download and install "LAME" from http://www.mp3dev.org. Be aware of
any patent issues. 
<pre>
cd /usr/local/src
lynx --source http://twtelecom.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/lame/lame-3.93.1.tar.gz > lame-3.93.1.tar.gz
tar -zxvf lame-3.93.1.tar.gz
cd lame-3.93.1
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/lame
make install
ln -s /usr/local/lame/bin/lame /usr/bin/lame
</pre>
</li>

<li>Start Grip.</li>
<li>Configure Grip. Under the "Config" menu, do this.
<br>Click on Encode, choose 'lame' as the encoder. Where is says "Encode
File Format" make sure you specify the directory "/var/www/html/audio" as the
base directory. Mine looked like this '/var/www/html/audio/%A/%d/%t_%n.mp3'.
</li>

<li>Click on "Tracks" in the top menu and select the tracks you want to rip.</li>
<li>Click on "Rip" in the top menu and then click on "Rip + Encode". </li>

</ol>


<h3><a NAME="python"></a>The Python Script.</h3>
Put this python script at "/var/www/cgi-bin/playlist.py". Execute this
command after putting it there "chmod 755 /var/www/cgi-bin/playlist.py".
After you have properly installed this python script (please use Python 2.2)
and you know it works right, you might have to change the url from 127.0.0.1
to the ip address of your computer for the network so that other computers
in your house can play the music as well. 

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/python
# Make sure this line above is the first line of this file.

### Copyright under GPL 

  ## import the python modules we need. 
import os, re, time, random

  ## Setup some variables. You can change these varaibles for your needs. 
Home = "/var/www/html/audio"
Url_Base = "http://127.0.0.1/audio"
Song_Max = 200
List_Type = "mpegurl"

## DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING BELOW HERE UNLESS YOU ARE A PYTHON GEEK.
File_Match = re.compile('[{mp3}{rm}{wav}{ogg}{mpeg}]$')
Home_Re = re.compile('^' + Home)
List_Types = {'smil':'application/smil', 'mpegurl':'audio/x-mpegurl'}

#---------------------------------------
  ## This function will go through and get the absolute path of all files
  ## that match. It is a recursive method. 
def Dir_Contents(Item=""):
  Final_List = []  
  if Item == '': return ('')
  elif os.path.isdir(Item):
    List = os.listdir(Item)
    for Item2 in List:
      Item3 = Item + "/" + Item2
      Temp_List = Dir_Contents(Item=Item3)
      for Item4 in Temp_List: Final_List.append(Item4)
  elif os.path.isfile(Item):
    if File_Match.search(Item):   return([Item])
    else:   return([])
  return (Final_List)
      
#--------------------------

List =  Dir_Contents(Home)
List_Copy = List
  ## Randomize how many times we call random. 
Secs = int(time.strftime('%S')) * int(time.strftime('%H')) * int(time.strftime('%M'))
for i in range(0,Secs): random.random()

  ## Randomly get one file at a time until there is none left. 
New_List = []
while (len(List_Copy) &gt; 0):
  Position = random.randint(0,len(List_Copy) - 1)
  New_List.append(List_Copy[Position])
  del List_Copy[Position]

  ## Redo the urls in the list.
Urls = []
for Item in New_List:
    ## For each item, strip the Home directory prefix and preappend the url.
  Url = Url_Base + Home_Re.sub('', Item)
  Urls.append(Url)    

  ## If we are greater than the number of songs we want to listen to,
  ## cap it off. Bonus points if you can figure out how many songs
  ## are in this array when Song_Max = 200.
if len(New_List) &gt; Song_Max:  New_List = New_List[0:Song_Max]

  ## If the idiot who edited this file has an invalid list type.... 
if not List_Types.has_key(List_Type): List_Type = 'mpegurl'
Content_Type = List_Types[List_Type]

  ### Now print out the content. 
print "Content-Type: " + Content_Type + "\n\n"

if List_Type == 'mpegurl':  
  for Url in Urls: print Url
elif List_Type == 'smil':
  print "\n&lt;smil&gt;\n   &lt;body&gt;\n"
  for Item in Urls:  print "      &lt;audio src='" + Url+ "'/&gt;"
  print "   &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/smil&gt;\n"
else:  
  for Url in Urls: print Url

<h3><a NAME="play"></a>Play the List. </h3>
Personally, I use Real Player. I tried to use xmms, but it didn't work for 
some reason (with the mpegurl list). 
Real Player accepts both smil and mpegurl, so I just use it. 
I would like to switch to some free GPLed player instead someday. 
<p>
Just type this into your browser, Real Player, or whatever other player you
are using "http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/playlist.py".

<h3>
<a NAME="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3>
This little setup is perfect for me. In the future, I want to create
accounts, playlists, keeping track of which songs haven't been played yet, 
give a song weight, and a bunch of others things. For now, I am finished
with this and will move onto making a playlist of my favorite NPR shows. 
<p>
I am big ideas of where this could lead. Since I have a lot of unfortunate
experience with Flash, Real Player, Windows Media Player, and Javascript, 
it seems like something could develop here. I heard a lot of stuff about
internet radio stations, but it seems like none of them are really
approaching the market right. They seem to be stuck in the old days of
radio. They need to move forward and not be constrained by the media giants 
(legally). It seems like the internet radio stations don't see the big
picture. For now, I am just going to develop my own little radio for myself
and maybe do something with it for real later.
