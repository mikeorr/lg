Hi,
Whenever I try to get to linuxgazette.net:80 from a perl script I get a 
redirect to gentikayos.com
What can be causing this?

Hi there,
</p>


<pre>

&gt; redirect to gentikayos.com
</pre>

<p>
When I do it and leave out the http Host: header, I get the content for
genetikayos.com, but I don't get a redirect.
</p>

<p>
It might just be a terminology thing.
</p>

<p>
Your script isn't doing what it should.
</p>

<p>
What you should do is send lines like
</p>

<pre>
"""
GET / HTTP/1.0
Host: linuxgazette.net
</p>

<p>
"""
</pre>
to the tcp port 80. If your client doesn't send the Host: header, it
can't really expect to work well on the current web. (There are other
headers that probably should be sent too, as per RFC. And if you're a
spider, there are other things to be aware of.)
</p>

<p>
Module authors hopefully wrote correct clients, if you're in a rush to
"have a client" rather than "write a client", that might be a useful
path to take.
</p>

<p>
All the best,
</p>

Thanks. I did read the RFC but I guess the "Host: " part was in one of the

I'm actually writing a tiny client to just check that links ar ok (2xx). Now 
don't tell me there's a header to do that instead of GETing
</p>

<p>
Thanks again.

'HEAD' is one of the aliases optionally installed during the
installation of the LWP module. If you have it installed, but don't have
those aliases, simply rerun the installation ('force install LWP') in
the CPAN shell and choose the right thing when you're prompted.

Well, I don't have LWP, infact I don't have anything but the core modules and
have never run the CPAN shell before. Now that I did, the first thing was 
'install LWP'..... it has been downloading/installing dependencies since
These perl guys think of everything, don't they? There's a link tester module
on CPAN already.......

[blink] I guess I'm not surprised. Not <em>very</em> surprised, anyway. If you
want to script it, we've already got a volunteer who's willing to do the
actual link testing. Or you two could team up - your choice, since you
were first.
</p>

<p>
LWP is a really good kit of stuff to have, anyway - it drags in stuff
like MD5::Hash and Readline, etc. All good, useful things that come up
again and again.

If there's someone already doing it, then let them continue. I was just trying
it out for a bit of fun (and experience). I have a "skeleton" for the script
though and I could send it in to the other volunteer if they haven't started
on it yet. Who is (s)he?

Well yeah, it dragged in quite some stuff.

No, that a module for this already exists. There's probably a module for
picking the nose of an ambidextrous spotted wombat, too (with options
for specific colors, degrees of furriness, etc.); there are modules for
just about anything you can name.

It's not really that someone was already doing it; you volunteered to
write the script, and Suramya Tomar volunteered to do the actual
link-checking.  If you two want to get together and work out a good way
to do this, that would be great. I'll ping you off-list with his
address.
