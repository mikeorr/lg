<h1><font color="maroon">Sendmail Made Easy!</font></h1>

<P> <HR> <P>  

All Linux distributions come with a Mail Transfer Agent (the program
that does the routing and sending of the messages. The daddy of them
all is <b>sendmail</b> (http://www.sendmail.org/).
<p>
<b>sendmail</b> is usually preconfigured, but if you need to set up a special
situation (for example UUCP), it can become quite a nuisance. The
reason for this is that at the initial writing of sendmail the
configuration language was designed to parse quickly at the expense of
being cryptic. I looked at a sendmail.cf in 1987 and didn't look again for 10 
years.
<p>
<b>smail</b> is easier to understand and has always had the nice
feature of batching messages, running the batches through gzip and
sending the jobs off via UUCP. Saved me quite a lot of money in phone
bills over the years.
<p>
However, a year and a half ago I found a package called BSMTP (Batched
Simple Mail Transport Protocol) for taking care of the batch-gzipping stuff. 
BSMTP is a package which is used with UUCP.  sendmail uses the SMTP Protocol 
if sending
or reeiving mail via TCP/IP, but you can also feed mail into sendmail
directly using this protocol. Now this package will take outgoing
mail, put many messages in batches with SMTP commands inserted between
messages, gzip the batches and hand them to UUCP for transport. On the
other end the process is reversed, uucp receives, hands to an
uncompressor which feeds to sendmail.  This results in a compression
of better then half. Using advanced features of the uucp on Linux you
can achieve very high throughputs.  BSMTP works with both smail and sendmail
and has a macro package which makes sendmail configuration much
easier. I like to tinker so I tried it. It took about a weekend 
to get sendmail working with BSMTP/UUCP.
Once I had figured out the basics, it became much easier, I only needed about
an hour to set it up for my leased line. 
<p>
Since you have Linux, you have all the tools required. If not, install
them from your distribution. I'll assume you have a working DNS with MX entries
for our system and are connected by a leased line. Install the latest
sendmail and sendmail-cf RPMs in the /usr/lib/sendmail-cf directory.
<p>
Consider the following few lines in a file called linux.mc located in
/usr/lib/sendmail-cf/cf:
<p>
<pre>
divert(-1)
OSTYPE(linux)
FEATURE(use_cw_file)
define(`confCW_FILE', `-o /etc/sendmail/sendmail.cw')
FEATURE(mailertable,`hash -o /etc/sendmail/mailertable.db')
FEATURE(local_procmail)
define(`STATUS_FILE',`/etc/sendmail/sendmail.st')
MAILER(procmail)
MAILER(smtp)
</pre>
It's rather cryptic--or is it?
<p>
Run this file through the <b>m4</b> command by typing:
<p>
<pre>
m4 ../m4/cf.m4 linux.mc > sendmail.cf
</pre>
It produces a sendmail.cf of approximately 1200 lines (still
unreadeable to me) which has been in production use on my system.
<p>
Now let's have a look at what those lines mean.
<p>
<pre>
# divert(-1)
</pre>
This line is a directive to the macro processor which I have never
bothered to understand. It has something to do with suppressing 
newline characters.
<p>
<pre>
OSTYPE(linux)
</pre>
Now, that's fairly easy, right? Well, what it doesn't tell you is that
the local delivery program <b>mail.local</b> from the sendmail distribution
needs to be in /bin or your mail will disappear without a trace.
<p>
<pre>
FEATURE(use_cw_file)
define(`confCW_FILE', `-o /etc/sendmail/sendmail.cw')
</pre>
What on earth is a CW file?
<p>
I receive a lot of mail to the address of
el@lisse.na; however, the host name is linux.lisse.na. No problem, we
have an appropriate MX entry pointing lisse.na to linux.lisse.na,
right? Wrong. You must tell sendmail the names under which it can receive
mail on the local host. For example:
<p>
<pre>
lisse
lisse.na
linux
linux.lisse.na
</pre>
When doing this is overlooked, sendmail sends an error message which is 
somewhat misleading.  The bouncing message has the  following Subject: line:
<PRE> 
Subject: Returned mail: Local configuration error
</PRE> 
And the MX list line is what is confusing:
<PRE> 
   ----- Transcript of session follows -----
554 MX list for nws.com.na. points back to linux.lisse.na
554 el@nws.com.na... Local configuration error
</PRE> 
<p>
<pre>
FEATURE(mailertable,`hash -o /etc/sendmail/mailertable.db')
</pre>
This line is only required if you have special delivery situations. For
example, to use the BSMTP package to deliver mail for Triple A,
Inc. via the UUCP neighbour <tt>bbbbb</tt>, set up an MX entry in the 
DNS and write something like this in the mailertable file:
<p>
<pre>
.aaa.com.na	bsmtp:bbbbb
aaa.com.na	bsmtp:bbbbb
</pre>
A TAB character is in between the pairs, and you must run a program
from the sendmail package called <b>makemap</b> on the file mailertable to
produce the binary database file mailertable.db. For example:
<p>
<pre>
makemap hash &lt; mailertable mailertable
</pre>
There are other database systems (for example, <b>dbm</b>) but
let's not complicate matters.
<p>
<pre>
FEATURE(local_procmail)
</pre>
This line redefines the local mailer to be <b>procmail</b>. You most 
definitely want that.
<p>
<pre>
define(`STATUS_FILE',`/etc/sendmail/sendmail.st')
</pre>
This line defines the status file. Make sure you have created this directory
as root.
<p>
<pre>
MAILER(procmail)
</pre>
<b>procmail</b> was written by Stefan van der Berg at my alma mater and
deserves its own article. In short it is <i>the</i> local delivery program.
Its strength lies in its message filtering capabilities. Very nice for
those mailing lists.
<p>
<pre>
MAILER(smtp)
</pre>
Please note that I have left out the <tt>bsmtp</tt> entry that would be
required, if you had used a BSMTP entry in the mailer table. If
you had a UUCP neighbour, you'd need a mailer entry too which must come
after <tt>smtp</tt>.
<p>
Now, test this configruation file, copy it to the /etc directory after making a
backup copy of the old one and restart sendmail. As root, I use
the command:
<p>
<pre>
killall -HUP sendmail
</pre>
I did not show you how to set up sendmail for UUCP, BSMTP, anti-SPAM
or virtual domains. However, now that you have mastered the basics, it will be 
fairly easy.
