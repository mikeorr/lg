<h2>News in General</h2>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Power IT Down Day - August 27, 2009 </h3>
<p>Intel, HP, Citrix and others will join together in encouraging 
government and industry to reduce energy consumption on the second annual 
Power IT Down Day, scheduled for August 27. The IT companies will promote 
Power IT Down Day through a series of activities and educational events. A 
schedule of those events, along with additional information about Power IT 
Down Day and green IT, can be found at <a href="http://www.hp.com/go/poweritdown">http://www.hp.com/go/poweritdown</a>.</p>

<p>"We can't just sit back and leave it to the next person in line to fix
the planet," said Nigel Ballard, federal marketing manager for Intel. "By
turning off our own computers each and every night, we make a positive
environmental impact, and we proved that last year. At the end of the day,
we're in this together so let's power IT down on August 27 and be part of
the solution."</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Ubuntu Remix to power Intel Classmate Netbooks</h3>
<p>Canonical reached an agreement with Intel in June to deliver Ubuntu Netbook 
Remix [UNR] as an operating system for Intel Classmate PCs.</p>

<p>The new Classmate is a netbook specifically designed for the education
market, It features a larger screen, more memory and larger SSD or HDD than
the original classmate PC. It will also feature a modified version of
Ubuntu Netbook Remix for the first time, improving the experience on
smaller screens.  The Intel-powered convertible Classmate PC features a
touch screen, converts from a clamshell to a tablet PC and auto-adjusts
between landscape and portrait depending on how the machine is held. Ubuntu
UNR will support all these use cases.</p>

<p>Ubuntu Netbook Remix is designed specifically for smaller screens and to
integrate with touch screen technologies. It has proven to be popular with
consumers on other devices. Ubuntu UNR makes it easy for novice computer
users to launch applications and to access the Internet.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Citrix Contributes Code for Virtual Network Switch</h3>

<p>Citrix made several key virtualization announcements at its annual
Synergy Conference in Las Vegas last May. Key among these was the release
of its virtual network switch code to open source, as a way of extending
its low-cost XenServer infrastructure.</p>

<p>Along with the code donation, Citrix also announced version 5.5 of
Xenserver, its free hypervisor.  Citrix also revised its virtual desktop
and virtual application products and released a new version of its bundled
virtualization infrastructure product, Xen Essentials.  Finally, Citrix is
also offering virtual versions of its NetScaler web accelerator product,
the VPX virtual appliance for X86 hardware, allowing lower entry costs for
single and clustered NetScalers. These are described in the product
section, below.</p>

<p>The virtual switch code reportedly will run on both the Xen and KVM
hypervisors.  This code can be used by 3rd party network vendors to develop
virtual switches for XenServer that can compete with the Cisco Nexus 1000V
virtual switch for VMware vSphere 4.0.</p>

<p>A virtual switch would be a good way to get more detailed insight into
virtual network traffic or to partition VM traffic and this helps complete
needed virtual infrastructure.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">New Community Website for Growing XenServer Customer Base</h3>

<p>In addition to general availability of the 5.5 product releases, Citrix
announced in June the XenServer Central community website, a new resource
to help users with their use of the free virtualization platform. The
XenServer Central website will feature the latest product information, tips
and tricks, access to the Citrix KnowledgeCenter and web-based support
forums. Twitter and blog postings will also be integrated. </p>

<p>Offers from Citrix partners for free or discounted licenses for
complementary products will also be featured, as well as the latest
XenServer content on CitrixTV.  XenServer Central went live on June 19 at
<a
href="http://www.citrix.com/xenservercentral">http://www.citrix.com/xenservercentral</a>.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Dell and Goodwill Expand Free Computer Recycling Program</h3>

<p>Dell and Goodwill Industries International are expanding Reconnect, a
free drop-off program for consumers who want to responsibly recycle any
brand of unwanted computer equipment, to 451 new donation sites in seven
additional states - Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, New Mexico,
Oklahoma, and West Virginia. They are also expanding the program in
Wisconsin. Consumers can now drop off computers at more than 1,400 Goodwill
Locations in 18 states, plus the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>Goodwill, which is focused on creating job opportunities for individuals
with disabilities or others having a hard time finding employment, plans to
hire additional staff to oversee the expanded recycling program.</p>

<p>Reconnect offers consumers a free, convenient and responsible way to
recycle used computer equipment. Consumers can drop off any brand of used
equipment at participating Goodwill donation centers in their area and
request a donation receipt for tax purposes.  For a list of participating
Goodwill locations across the U.S., visit <a

August 15, Foundation for Blind Children - 1224 E. Northern, Phoenix, AZ  

<p>
August's Phoenix Linux User Group HackFest Lab will center around puppet.
We will have a one-ish hour of presentation, a puppet test lab
including a fully fleshed out securely setup system.  We will take
some fest time to show how easy it is to pull strings, maintain
configurations and standards in any network comprising two or more
systems.  We might even turn the tables and attempt "evil" puppetry.
</p>

<p>
Please see the LinuxGazette's July "Linux Layer 8 Security" article
for the lab presentation materials.  Bring your recipes to wow us,
since all PLUG events are full duplex, allowing for individual
expansion and enrichment as we follow our critical thought, rarely
constrained by anything but time.  "Don't learn to hack; hack to
learn".

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">A naming contest for Ubuntu 10.04 and the South African Linux community</h3>
<p>
A fun little competition may interest the South African Linux
community. It surrounds the codename of Ubuntu 10.04. There are some great
prizes to be won. Details can be found at:

</p>


<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Fedora 11: Many Virtualization Enhancements</h3>

<p>The Fedora project released the next version of the popular Linux 
operating system in June. The new Fedora 11 release, known as "Leonidas", 
showcases recent enhancements to virtualization technology including 
management, performance and security.</p>

<p>Among the new virtualization features in Fedora 11, one is a redesign 
of 'virt-manager', an end-to-end desktop UI for managing virtual 
machines. The 'virt-manager' feature manages virtual machines  no 
matter what type of virtualization technology they are using. New 
features within "virt-manager" include:</p>

<ul><li> a new VM creation wizard;</li>
<li> improved support for host-to-host migration of VMs;</li>
<li> an interface for physical device assignment for existing VMs, 
easing allocation of physical resources tied to VMs;</li>
<li> an upgraded statistics display that shows fine grained disk and 
network I/O stats;</li>
<li> improved VNC authentication to connect to VMs, which allow clients 
to securely connect to remote VMs.</ul>

<p>Learn more about this new tool at <a href="http://virt-manager.et.redhat.com/">http://virt-manager.et.redhat.com/</a>.</p>

<p>Also in Fedora's latest release is a sneak peak at some functional 
improvements to the Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) that can set the 
performance bar higher for virtualized environments. </p>

<p>And the new integration of SELinux with the virtualization stack 
via sVirt provides enhanced security. Virtual machines now run 
effectively isolated from the host and one another, making it harder 
for security flaws to be exploited in the hypervisor by malicious guests.</p>

<p>Fedora 11 includes the MinGW Windows cross compiler, which allows Linux-based 
developers to cross-compile software for a Windows target. Other new features 
in Fedora 11 include better support for fingerprint readers and the inclusion 
of the ext4 file system.</p>

<p>To check out KVM, sVirt, Virt Manager and other new technologies included in 
Fedora 11, download Fedora 11 at <a href="http://get.fedoraproject.org">http://get.fedoraproject.org</a>.</p>

<p>The Fedora Project showed its release schedule for Fedora 12, which does not 
show the customary public alpha release. This will leave testers just two 
public development builds to try. The first beta is planed for late August, 
while the second one is expected in early October. The final release of Fedora 
12 is currently scheduled for November 3rd, 2009. For further information, 
check the Fedora 12 release schedule at:

<h2>Software and Product News</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Opera 10 beta: new features, new speed</h3>

<p>Opera has released the first beta of Opera 10, which sports new features, a new look and 
feel, and enhanced speed and performance.  Opera 10 is completely free for Linux, Mac and Windows 
users from <a href="http://www.opera.com/next/">http://www.opera.com/next/</a>.</p>

<p>Using state-of-the-art compression technology, Opera Turbo delivers 3x to 4x the speed on 
slower connections and can offer broadband-like speeds on dial-up.  Opera 10 is also much 
faster on resource intensive pages such as Gmail and Facebook and is more than 40% faster 
than Opera 9.6.</p>

<p>Web developers can enjoy Web Fonts support, RGBA/HSLA color and new SVG improvementsalong 
with the new features in Opera Dragonfly, Opera's on-board Web development tools. Opera 
Dragonfly alpha 3 now allows editing of the DOM and inspection HTTP headers in more than 
36 languages.</p>

<p>Another updated feature is the tab bar, updated from the original design, and is now 
resizeable, but with a twist. Pull down the tab bar (or double-click the handle) to 
reveal full thumbnails of all open tabs.</p>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Oracle 11g Sets New Price/Performance Record with TPC-C Benchmark</h3>

<p>Oracle and HP have set a new world record for Oracle Database 11g Standard Edition One 
running on Oracle Enterprise Linux. With this result, Oracle now holds the top five 
record benchmark positions in the Top Ten TPC-C price/performance category.</p>

<p>The winning HW/SW combination - including Oracle Database 11g, Oracle Enterprise Linux 
and the  HP ProLiant ML350 G6 Server - was posted in late May.</p>

<p>The result was 232,002 transactions per minute with a price/performance of $.54USD/tpmC, 
using Oracle Database 11g Standard Edition One with Oracle Enterprise Linux running on an 
HP ProLiant ML350 G6 server with a single-socket Intel Xeon E5520 quad-core processor and 
HP Smart Array P411 controller.  This package delivered the best price-per-transaction-per-minute 
ever achieved with the TPC-C benchmark, in addition to delivering the fastest result for a one 
socket system.</p>

<p>TPC-C is an OLTP (online transaction processing) benchmark developed by the Transaction 
Processing Performance Council (TPC). The TPC-C benchmark defines a rigorous standard 
for calculating performance and price/performance measured by transactions per minute 
(tpmC) and $/tpmC, respectively. More information is available at <a href="http://www.tpc.org/">http://www.tpc.org/</a>.</p>
