<h1>Joey's Notes: Basic Networking and IP Forwarding</h1>

<p>
Linux is a networking powerhouse. It can act as a DHCP server, a network
router, a simple client, a gateway, a bridging firewall -- well, you get
the idea. To accomplish these tasks - indeed, to make it to work at all -
there are several key files that must be configured properly. That is the
subject of this month's article.
</p>

<p>
Working in the computer lab at the college's Red Hat Academy, I am often
faced with helping students fix their network configuration so they can get
out to the Internet through the network. Since our computer lab is shared
with the Microsoft lab, all the computers are labeled, and have removable
hard drives to allow for easy switching between Red Hat Linux and Windows.
This would be an excellent way to do things - <em>if</em> students would
put the proper drive in the proper computer in the Red Hat Lab. They don't,
of course, and they constantly move them - so I get to assist in the proper
reconfiguration of their networking.  
</p>

<p>
To verify your specific configuration, you need to first find out what your
specific network configuration should be, either from your ISP or your
network administrator. Please do not go by the settings I have used as
examples here; they will not be correct for your machine and specific
setup. And <strong>always</strong> make a backup of your configuration
files (e.g., <tt>cp /etc/sysconfig/network /etc/sysconfig/network.bak</tt>)
before you make any changes to them! I don't suggest making any changes to
your system if your networking is already working; this is intended to be a
starting point for understanding how these files control basic networking
on a Linux machine. If you do modify any settings, you will probably need
to at least bring the network interface down, then back up, or restart
networking on the machine to see if the changes worked.
</p>

<p>
To configure basic networking on a Red Hat system, there are several key 
configuration files we must check. They are:
</p>

<ul>	
	<li>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/<b>ifcfg-eth0</b>&nbsp;  This file contains 
your network card settings</li>
	<li>/etc/sysconfig/<strong>network</strong>&nbsp;  This file contains various other 
settings, mainly the hostname and gateway</li>
	<li>/etc/<strong>resolv.conf</strong>&nbsp;  This file contains our search domain and 
nameservers</li>
	<li>/etc/<strong>hosts</strong>&nbsp;  Hostname and other entries for local machines 
not in DNS</li>
</ul>

<p>
To configure IP forwarding on a Red Hat system, the configuration file we must 
check is:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>/etc/<b>sysctl.conf</b>&nbsp;  Configuration file for various aspects of 
kernel routing and IP forwarding</li>	
</ul>

<h3>Configuration of the "/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0" file</h3>

<p>
In this file, you would find your basic network device configuration. Here,
<tt>ifcfg-eth0</tt> is the first Ethernet device; <tt>ifcfg-eth1</tt> would
be the second Ethernet NIC (network interface card), and so forth. In this
file, you can have quite a few settings. 
</p>

<table align="center" width="90%" border="1">
<tr><td><strong>Directives</strong></td><td><strong>Required / Optional</strong></td>
<td><strong>Expected Settings</strong></td><td><strong>Comment</strong></td></tr>		
<tr><td>DEVICE=</td><td>Required</td><td>eth<em>X</em></td><td>You must have
 this entry specifying the Linux device name. </td> </tr>

<tr><td>ONBOOT=</td><td>Optional</td><td>yes / no</td><td>Start the device on
 boot? This will default to yes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>BOOTPROTO=</td><td>Required</td><td>static / dhcp / none </td><td>Static 
hard set our IP, or do we want a dhcp assignment? "dhcp", "none" is the same as static.</td></tr>
<tr><td>IPADDR=</td><td>Optional</td><td>IP address of machine</td><td>The 
address we want if we are setting a static IP for the interface.</td></tr>
<tr><td>NETMASK=</td><td>Optional</td><td>Subnet mask</td><td>Required for 
static IPs. The subnet mask.</td></tr> 
<tr><td>NETWORK=</td><td>Optional</td><td>Network address</td><td>Recommended 
for static IPs. The network that we are on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>BROADCAST=</td><td>Optional</td><td>Network broadcast address</td>
<td>Recommended for static IPs. The broadcast address.</td></tr> 
<tr><td>HWADDR=</td><td>Optional</td><td>Device MAC address</td><td>The MAC 
address of our network card. Normally provided by the Anaconda installer at 
install time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>USERCTL=</td><td>Optional</td><td>yes / no</td><td>Allow normal
non-administrative user to take down and bring up the device. Defaults to
"no".</td>
</tr><tr><td>GATEWAY=</td><td>Optional</td><td>IP address of gateway</td>
<td>The network gateway IP address.</td></tr> 
</table>	

<p>
Not all of these are necessary for proper operation, and the order they are
in is irrelevant. I prefer to specify the additional directives of NETWORK
and BROADCAST in my <tt>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0</tt> on
machines that I want to have a hard-set IP address, mainly servers of any
sort. If you want to use a DHCP-assigned address, your
<tt>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0</tt> file would look
something like this:
</p>

<pre>
# Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] 79c970 [PCnet32 LANCE]
DEVICE=eth0
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
HWADDR=08:00:27:4B:3B:06
ONBOOT=yes
</pre>

<p>
Of course, your HWADDR address would be different.  In addition, the
comment would reflect your network adapter or may not even be present. Here
are some guidelines (I left my settings in as an example, just to give an
idea what it would look like):
</p>

<p>
<strong>Recommended Static Directives Sample Configuration</strong>
</p>

<pre>					
DEVICE=eth0				
ONBOOT=yes				 
BOOTPROTO=static			 
IPADDR=192.168.0.17			
NETMASK=255.255.255.0			
NETWORK=192.168.0.0			
BROADCAST=192.168.0.255			
</pre>

<strong>Minimum Recommended Static Directives Sample Configuration</strong>

<pre>
DEVICE=eth0
BOOPROTO=static
IPADDR=192.168.0.17
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
</pre>

<p>
<strong>Minimum DHCP Directives Sample Configuration</strong>
</p>

<pre>
DEVICE=eth0
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
</pre>


<h3>Configuration of the "/etc/sysconfig/network" file</h3>	

<p>
This file defines the basis for networking on the machine; again, not all
directives have to be set for our network configuration to work. A lot
depends on the configuration.
</p>

<table align="center" width="90%" border="1">
<tr><td><strong>Directives</strong></td><td><strong>Required / Optional</strong></td>
<td><strong>Expected Settings</strong></td><td><strong>Comment</strong></td></tr>

<tr><td>NETWORKING=</td><td>Required</td><td>yes / no</td>
<td>Enable networking.</td></tr> 
<tr><td>HOSTNAME=</td><td>Required</td><td>Hostname</td>
<td>The machine hostname. It's a good practice to put the Fully Qualified 
Domain Name in here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>GATEWAY=</td><td>Recommended</td><td>IP address of gateway</td>
<td>The gateway out of our network.</td></tr> 
<tr><td>NETWORKING_IPV6=</td><td>Optional</td><td>yes / no</td>
<td>Enable IPV6 networking capability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>NISDOMAIN=</td><td>Optional</td><td>NIS domain name</td>
<td>The name of our NIS domain, if we are connecting to one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>GATEWAYDEV=</td><td>Optional</td><td>eth<em>X</em></td>
<td>Gateway device to use if we have more than one NIC.</td></tr>

</table>
<p>
The <tt>/etc/sysconfig/network</tt> file should contain the IP address of
the gateway device through which the traffic leaves your network. In a
simple home network configuration, this would be your router's internal IP
address. This file can be as simple as this example below, and may contain
any number of the above elements, depending on your configuration. For DHCP
configurations, you may not even have a gateway listed in this file, and
will probably have only the NETWORKING and HOSTNAME elements defined.
</p>

<strong>Recommended Static Directives Sample Configuration</strong> 

<pre>
NETWORKING=yes
HOSTNAME=localhost.localdomain
GATEWAY=192.168.0.254
</pre>

<strong>Minimum DHCP Directives Sample Configuration</strong>

<pre>
NETWORKING=yes
HOSTNAME=server1.example.com
</pre>

<h3>Configuration of the "/etc/resolv.conf" file</h3>

<p>
This file deals with DNS nameserver resolution.  If you executed, e.g.,
"nslookup google.com" and didn't get an answer, this would probably be the
culprit. This file usually contains the search domain and nameserver IP
address. It may contain the word "domain" in place of the word "search".
</p>

<table align="center" width="90%" border="1">
<tr><td><strong>Directives</strong></td><td><strong>Required / Optional</strong></td>
<td><strong>Expected Settings</strong></td><td><strong>Comment</strong></td></tr> 

<tr><td>search</td><td>Optional</td><td>Domain name</td>
<td>The search domain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>domain</td><td>Optional</td><td>Domain name</td>
<td>The domain the machine is on.</td></tr> 
<tr><td>nameserver</td><td>Required</td><td>IP address of nameserver</td>
<td>One or more nameservers are required to perform name resolution.</td></tr>

</table>
<p>
Here is what a typical <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt> looks like, just as it was
generated by the DHCP script. 
</p>

<pre>
; generated by /sbin/dhclient-script
search example.com
nameserver 10.0.2.3
</pre>
<p>
You can have multiple nameservers listed in this file, which is a good practice 
and provides a type of fault tolerance in case the first nameserver fails. 
In that case, it would then go on to the next one in the list. As matter of 
fact, you can lighten the load on nameservers this way, by specifying that 
half of a large network gets a certain nameserver as the primary, and the
other half has the order of the nameservers reversed.</p>

<strong>Recommended resolv.conf Directives Sample Configuration</strong>

<pre>
search example.com
nameserver 10.0.2.3
nameserver 216.239.32.10
</pre>

<strong>Minimum resolv.conf Directives Sample Configuration</strong> 

<pre>
nameserver 10.0.2.3
</pre>

<h3>Configuration of the "/etc/hosts" file</h3> 

<p>
This is the file that resolves our loopback IP address 127.0.0.1 to our
hostname localhost.localdomain. This is also the first place that your
machine will attempt to resolve hostnames to IP addresses, unless the
lookup order in the <tt>/etc/nsswitch.conf</tt> file has been changed.
The line "hosts:   files dns" says to look first in the /etc/hosts file
then to DNS for answers.
</p>

<p>
One way to prove that the machine will look in the /etc/hosts file for name 
service is to try this little exercise: 
</p>

<p>
My daughter is a normal teenager obsessed with Myspace, and, if I let her,
would spend her entire life, wasting away, on this site. According to her,
all is meaningless compared to this site. At the college, it gets an
astounding 20,000 hits a day -- an incredible waste of time, especially for
college students. To remedy this at home, I have implemented a minor
modification on her Windows computer, and all my Linux machines. I edit the
hosts file on the machines. In Windows, it's in
<tt>c:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts</tt>; in Linux,
<tt>/etc/hosts</tt>. I ping the site I want her to view instead
(i.e., 'ping www.cnn.com') to get the IP address. I then take the IP address
and add that to the hosts file, across from the hostname of
www.myspace.com, like this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
# Do not remove the following line, or various programs
# that require network functionality will fail.
127.0.0.1          localhost.localdomain localhost 
::1           	   localhost6.localdomain6 localhost6

64.236.91.24	 www.myspace.com 	myspace.com
</pre>

<p>
Now, when she gets home from school and tries to go to Myspace, it will
resolve by first checking this file, and looking up the IP address for
Myspace as being 64.236.91.24, which is really the IP address of CNN news,
so she gets to instead view the current world news. She soon gets disgusted
by the war in Iraq and Middle East terrorism, and resumes the functions of
a normal human teenager instead of that of a Myspace addict. Now, she's
thinking that there is a problem with the Myspace Web site. To verify that
this works, open a Web browser and try to go to Myspace with the new
addition to your /etc/hosts file. You will be redirected to cnn.com.  
</p>

<p class="editorial">[ Of course, now that Joey has written this article
and explained his <strike>base treachery</strike> perfectly reasonable
parental control measures, his daughter will happily reverse the procedure
by pinging myspace.com, etc. Sorry, pal - you'll have to think harder than
that to outwit your teenager! :) -- Ben ]
</p>

<p>
A typical /etc/hosts for a networked computer could look like this: 
</p>

<pre class="code">
# Do not remove the following line, or various programs
# that require network functionality will fail.
127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain localhost 
::1             localhost6.localdomain6 localhost6
192.168.0.17	station17.example.com
192.168.0.100	workbox.example.com workbox
192.168.0.110	nfsbox.example.com nfsbox
192.168.0.120	mail.example.com mail 
</pre>

<strong>Minimum Configuration IPV4</strong>

<pre>
127.0.0.1          localhost.localdomain localhost 
</pre>

<strong>Minimum Configuration IPV6</strong> 

<pre>
127.0.0.1          localhost.localdomain localhost 
::1           	   localhost6.localdomain6 localhost6
</pre>

<h3>IP Forwarding</h3>

<strong>Configuration of the "/etc/sysctl.conf" file to enable IP 
forwarding</strong>

<p>
For basic network configuration, you should <em><strong>not</strong></em>
need to change anything in this file, but I believe it is important to be
aware that the option to enable IP forwarding exists in this file. IP
forwarding would be enabled to allow use of the system as a router or
gateway for our network, and is only one of the steps involved in the
process.  This file has several advanced kernel configuration options that
are beyond the scope of this article, so we will just discuss IP forwarding
at this time.  The comment section at the top of this file says it uses
binary values --  a "0" indicates the option is disabled and a "1"
indicates enabled, as stated in the comments below. If we make changes to
this file, we would need to make the kernel re-parse the
<tt>/etc/sysctl.conf</tt> file. You would use the "sysctl -p" command to
get this to happen. It will produce some output, as I have shown below.  
</p>

<pre class="code">
# Kernel sysctl configuration file for Red Hat Linux
#
# For binary values, 0 is disabled, 1 is enabled.  See sysctl(8) and
# sysctl.conf(5) for more details.

# Controls IP packet forwarding
<b>net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0</b> 

# Controls source route verification
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1

# Do not accept source routing
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0

# Controls the System Request debugging functionality of the kernel
kernel.sysrq = 0

# Controls whether core dumps will append the PID to the core filename
# Useful for debugging multi-threaded applications
kernel.core_uses_pid = 1

# Controls the use of TCP syncookies
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1

# Controls the maximum size of a message, in bytes
kernel.msgmnb = 65536

# Controls the default maximum size of a message queue
kernel.msgmax = 65536

# Controls the maximum shared segment size, in bytes
kernel.shmmax = 4294967295

# Controls the maximum number of shared memory segments, in pages
kernel.shmall = 268435456
</pre>

<p>
Here is the output produced from re-parsing this file after IP forwarding
was turned on in <tt>/etc/sysctl.conf</tt>: 
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# sysctl -p
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0
kernel.sysrq = 0
kernel.core_uses_pid = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
kernel.msgmnb = 65536
kernel.msgmax = 65536
kernel.shmmax = 4294967295
kernel.shmall = 268435456
[root@localhost ~]# 
</pre>

<p class="editorial">[ Note that the same functionality can be achieved
within a given session and without any need to reboot, etc., by setting the
values in the appropriate files in the /proc directory - e.g., 'echo 1 &gt;
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward' will enable IPv4 IP forwarding.  A more
permanent configuration, however, is done just as described above.  -- Ben
]
</p>

<p>
That about sums it up. Remember to always <strong>comment out</strong> items you 
don't plan on using in these files, instead of deleting them from the files. 
Then, to verify that things work, you will need to restart networking on the 
machine and verify connectivity. This way, if you need to, you can re-enable the
option again very easily, and you don't lose the settings as they were 
originally. If you are not in this habit already, this is one that you will 
need to develop, as it will save you a lot of headaches.

Joey was born in Phoenix and started programming at the age fourteen on
 a Timex Sinclair 1000. He was driven by hopes he might be able to do
 something with this early model computer. He soon became proficient in
 the BASIC and Assembly programming languages. Joey became a programmer
 in 1990 and added COBOL, Fortran, and Pascal to his repertoire of
 programming languages. Since then has become obsessed with just about
 every aspect of computer science. He became enlightened and discovered
 RedHat Linux in 2002 when someone gave him RedHat version six. This 
 started off a new passion centered around Linux. Currently Joey is 
 completing his degree in Linux Networking and working on campus
 for the college's RedHat Academy in Arizona. He is also on the staff of
 the Linux Gazette as the Mirror Coordinator.
