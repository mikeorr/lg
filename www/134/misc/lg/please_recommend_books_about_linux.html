I'd be interested in reading the best, most BASIC book
about Linux and the joys of migrating from Windows XP.
Mine is a stand-alone eMachines T1120, about 5 years
old, used just for personal idiotics, not for
business. XP crashes regularly and often, usually when
I click on Minimize, maximize or close.
I'll need a stable system if I'm goin' to whup the
IRS's butt, which I know can be done. I'll need a
quick, easy, and reliable installation. Is that too
much to tax...I mean ask?

[ John, you can skip down to the content to see my answer to you. ]

<p>
Hi, VIGNESH -
</p>

<p>
1. SPELLING IN ALL CAPS IS CONSIDERED YELLING. PERHAPS "Vignesh" WOULD WORK
JUST AS WELL?
</p>

<p>
2. You neglected to include the original poster in the reply list, which
means that he wouldn't see your answer until the next issue of LG.
Please remember to do so next time; I've corrected it this time by
adding John's name to the CC list.
</p>

<p>
3. You sent your message in HTML format. This doubled the size of your
message without any benefit in return, and will create extra work for
our Mailbag editor. This is mildly annoying when done by a querent, but
egregiously poor form when done by a member of this list. Please change
your mailer's settings to stop it from doing this. For more info, please
see &lt;<a href="http://expita.com/nomime.html">http://expita.com/nomime.html</a>&gt;.
</p>

<p>
4. You have also top-posted, which, without an explicit need to
distinguish comments like this one from an actual reply to the subject
matters, is very poor email manners. Please stop doing that. I've
corrected the reversed time sequence in your post.
</p>

<p>
5. When replying, please reply-quote (i.e., precede with '&gt;' symbols)
the text to which you're replying. Indenting, as you've done below, is
not sufficient to distinguish the two parts, and - again - causes
problems in formatting for publication. I've fixed this as well.
</p>

<p>
6. Please read - and if necessary, re-read - "Asking Questions of The
Answer Gang" at <a href="../../../tag/ask-the-gang.html">http://linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html</a> and the
Members' FAQ <a href="../../../tag/members-faq.html">http://linuxgazette.net/tag/members-faq.html</a> ; these
contain basic posting protocol for this list.
</p>

John -

I don't know that there's such a thing as "the best" in this regard
(although there are several books I can think of that are contending for
the title of "worst".) Migrating from Wind0ws does not normally require
books, although it may, in complex cases, require the help of a friendly
experienced Linux user such as may be found at your local Linux Users
Group (LUG). In the far more common, simple situations, I recommend
simply popping in a LiveCD distribution - e.g., Knoppix
(<a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html">http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</a>) and using it for a while.
If you run into any problems, you can usually get answers here, or from
the help documentation that comes with Knoppix, or in a number of places
on the Web. "Migration", unless you're a large company with a number of
complex services, is mostly an imaginary construct that just gets in the
way.
</p>

<p>
Give it a shot, and let us know how it goes!

Many thanks, Ben, for the concise, eminently readable
suggestions. I must confess I got my brain kernal
going and checked the local library, and found "Moving
to Linux" by Marcel Gagne, which comes with a WFTL
Edition Knoppic CD. I'm optomistic this move can be
done without any major problems, especially with LUG's
and all the other support out there. (Getting that
LiveCD edition you mentioned sounds enticing too.) I'm
starting to look forward to this. Thanks again.
