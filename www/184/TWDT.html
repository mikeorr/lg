<h2>News in General</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Google's Honeycomb may influence Android 2.4</h3>

<p>
Honeycomb is the new variation of the Android Operating System for tablets,
just announced in February and shipping currently on the Motorola Xoom
tablet.  But a new version of Android will probably be announced at or just
before the Google IO conference in May and it is expected some of the new
features in Honeycomb will migrate to the standard Android phone distro.
</p>

<p>
The newest version of the Android smart phone OS, nicknamed Gingerbread,
Android 2.3,  was announced just before Christmas  It features UI
improvements, better copy and paste selection, and improved power
management.  Android 2.3 better supports VOIP and Internet telephoney by
including a full SIP protocol stack and integrated call management services
so applications  can  set up outgoing and incoming voice calls. Android 2.3
also adds API support for several new sensor types, including gyroscope,
rotation vector, linear acceleration, gravity, and barometer sensors.
</p>

<p>
Honeycomb was announced in February and is designed for bigger, multi-touch
screen and longer user interactions.  It features improved 2D and 3D
graphics, redesigned widgets, improved applications such as Google Maps
that can take advantage of improved hardware and screen size,   Honeycomb
was pre-announced in January when a marketing video for the tablet OS
surfaced on YouTube and referenced Android 3.0:  
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/hPUGNCIozp0&amp;hl=en_US">http://www.youtube.com/v/hPUGNCIozp0&amp;hl=en_US</a>
</p>

<p>
A transition version of Android is expect to bridge the feature gap for
rest of 2011.
</p>

<p>
The developer site developer.android.com lists the Honeycomb features for
tablets as being part of the an upcoming Android 3.0 without a release date
target:
<a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-3.0-highlights.html">http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-3.0-highlights.html</a>
</p>

<p>
According to developer.android.com, Android 3.0 will allow users to "...
connect full keyboards over either USB or Bluetooth, for a familiar
text-input environment. For improved wi-fi connectivity, a new combo scan
reduces scan times across bands and filters. New support for Bluetooth
tethering means that more types of devices can share the network connection
of an Android-powered device."
</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Intel Goes MeeGo</h3>
<p>
At Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Intel made several announcements
regarding the MeeGo open source platform and the industry momentum backing
both MeeGo and Intel Atom processors.
</p>

<p>
According to Intel, since MeeGo was introduced one year ago, the open
source operating system platform has had multiple code releases. MeeGo has
also gained industry momentum with system integrators as well as OEMs and
products are shipping today in multiple form factors including netbooks,
tablet, set-top-boxes and in-vehicle infotainment systems in cars.
</p>

<p>
Intel demonstrated a compelling new MeeGo tablet user experience now
available through the Intel AppUp Developer Program. Intel also released
the MeeGo tablet user experience (UX). It features an intuitive
object-oriented interface with panels displaying content and contacts This
gives consumers fingertip access to social networks, people, videos and
photos.
</p>

<p>
The Intel AppUpSM developer program is expanding to accept apps for
MeeGo-based tablets and netbooks. The program now offers technical
resources, tools and incentives for developers to create, distribute and
sell MeeGo-based apps.  MeeGo apps will also be included in the Intel App
Store.
</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">The Document Foundation launches LibreOffice 3.3</h3>

<p>
The Document Foundation recently released LibreOffice 3.3, the community
version of OpenOffice 3.3, a short time after setting itself up as an
alternative to the Oracle-controlled product.  This first stable release is
available for download.
</p>

<p>
The next release, version 3.3.1, is expected around Feb. 14, following the
FOSDEM conference in Brussels on February 5 and 6, where LibreOffice
developers will be presenting their work during a one-day workshop with
speeches and hacking sessions coordinated by several members of the
project.
</p>

<p>
In less than four months, the number of developers hacking LibreOffice has
grown from less than twenty in late September 2010, to well over one
hundred. This has allowed them to release on the aggressive schedule set by
the project.
</p>

<p>
LibreOffice 3.3 is also important  for a number of other reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li> - the developer community has been able to build an independent
process, and get up and running in a very short time
<li> - with a large number of new contributors attracted to the project,
the source code is quickly undergoing a major clean-up to provide a better
foundation for future development of LibreOffice;
<li> - the Windows installer, which is going to impact the largest and most
diverse user base, has been integrated into a single build containing all
language versions, thus reducing the size for download sites from 75 GB to
11GB, making it easier to deploy new versions more rapidly and lowering the
carbon footprint of the entire infrastructure.
</ul>

<p>
Caol&aacute;n McNamara from RedHat, one of the developer community leaders,
commented, "This is our very first stable release, and therefore we are
eager to get user feedback, which will be integrated as soon as possible
into the code, with the first enhancements being released in February.
Starting from March, we will be moving to a real time-based, predictable,
transparent and public release schedule....". The LibreOffice development
roadmap is available at <a href="http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleasePlan">http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleasePlan</a> 
</p>

<p>
LibreOffice 3.3 provides all the new features of OpenOffice.org 3.3, such
as new custom properties handling; embedding of standard PDF fonts in PDF
documents; new Liberation Narrow font; increased document protection in
Writer and Calc; auto decimal digits for "General" format in Calc; 1
million rows in a spreadsheet; new options for CSV import in Calc; insert
drawing objects in Charts; hierarchical axis labels for Charts; improved
slide layout handling in Impress; a new easier-to-use print interface; more
options for changing case; and colored sheet tabs in Calc. Several of these
new features were contributed by members of the LibreOffice team prior to
the formation of The Document Foundation.
</p>

<p>
LibreOffice 3.3 also brings several new features, including in no
particular order: the ability to import and work with SVG files; an easy
way to format title pages and their numbering in Writer; a more-helpful
Navigator Tool for Writer; improved ergonomics in Calc for sheet and cell
management; and Microsoft Works and Lotus Word Pro document import filters.
In addition, many great extensions are now bundled, providing PDF import, a
slide-show presenter console, a much improved report builder, and more
besides. A more-complete and detailed list of all the new features offered
by LibreOffice 3.3 is viewable on the following web page:

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">IBM's Watson, DeepBlueQA, Wins on Jeopardy!</h3>

<p>
Reminiscent of the classic battle of John Henry and the Steam Shovel, the
first-ever man vs. machine Jeopardy! competition was aired in February
with two matches being held over three consecutive days.  And like John
Henry, the humans lost.
</p>

<p>
At a press conference in January, Jeopardy! and IBM revealed the non-profit
beneficiaries of the upcoming contest between two of the most celebrated
Jeopardy! Champions - Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings - and IBM's "Watson"
computing system.  Rutter and Jennings planned to donate 50 percent of
their winnings to charity, and IBM will donate 100 percent of its winnings
to charity.
</p>

<p>
The grand prize for this competition was be $1 million, with second place
earning $300,000, and third place earning $200,000.
</p>

<p>
Watson, named after IBM founder Thomas J. Watson, was built by a team of
IBM scientists who set out to accomplish a grand challenge - build a
computing system that rivals a human's ability to answer questions posed in
natural language with speed, accuracy and confidence. The Jeopardy! format
provides the ultimate challenge because the game's clues involve analyzing
subtle meaning, irony, riddles, and other language complexities in which
humans excel and computers traditionally do not.
</p>

<p>
The Jeopardy! game show, winner of 28 Emmy Awards since its debut in 1984,
was inducted into the Guinness Book of World Records for the most awards
won by a TV Game Show.

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Gemalto Launches One Time Password Application for Mobile Users</h3>

<p>
At the RSA Conference in San Francisco and Mobile World Congress, in
Barcelona, in February, Gemalto introduced Protiva Mobile OTP, a
convenient, secure and cost-effective new way for businesses and their
employees to deploy two-factor authentication, with their mobile phones.
The new solution is part of Gemalto's Protiva Strong Authentication family,
which encompasses the validation server and a range of Protiva
authentication application software and authentication devices.
</p>

<p>
A One Time Password (OTP) replaces static passwords with strong
authentication and provides a convenient additional level of security for
transactions and access control.
</p>

<p>
Protiva Mobile OTP works with the popular handset platforms, including
Blackberry, iPhone, and handsets running Java, Windows CE and Brew.
Employees simply need to download Gemalto's secure app onto their mobile
phone, which is setup to immediately generate and receive OTPs using the
phone.
</p>

<p>
Combining the mobile credential with their username and one-time-password
grants employees the appropriate access to company resources such as a VPN,
intranet, mail directory, digital signature, mail and Web pages. Protiva
Mobile OTP is simple for IT administrators to deploy and provision, and is
compatible with the majority of industry-leading IT infrastructure
elements.
</p>

<h3>The Move</h3>

<p>
<em>
"... we'll have 4 weeks to move, beginning early October. We need to get
as much gear racked by then as possible, so it can be switched off,
the whole rack wheeled to the new server room, plugged in and switched
on."
</em>
</p>

<p>
I came out of my reverie and looked up. I found our fortnightly
meetings pointless. What had I been thinking? I couldn't remember. It
didn't matter.
</p>

<p>
"What kind of downtime are we advertising?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"None during business hours," replied Chairman John. "If we have
networking done, we can wheel over racks out of hours."
</p>

<p>
Damn. I should have been paying attention. I'd asked the wrong
question.
</p>

<p>
I decided to try again.
</p>

<p>
"Shouldn't we advertise greater vulnerability at this time? Things can go
wrong with moving racks, especially old hardware, e.g. unix33. What
happens if something slips and a rack falls over? If you over-promise
and under-deliver, you'll be unpopular."
</p>

<p>
Unsurprisingly, Chairman John latched onto the improbability of a rack
falling over, completely missing the point that what characterises
unforeseen setbacks is that they are, um, unforeseen.
</p>

<p>
A few others also expressed the sentiment that I was being overly
pessimistic. I felt like Cassandra.
</p>

<p>
"I just think we should hope for the best, but prepare for the worst,"
I ventured.
</p>

<p>
Believing that he sensed the mood of the meeting, Chairman John
summarised, "Anyway, there won't be any problems because...", he
paused for effect, "... it is <em>mandated</em> that there will be no
interruption to computer service during business hours."
</p>

<p>
He looked at me with satisfaction. He had played his trump card!
</p>

<p>
I was left speechless. Later, reviewing this part of the meeting, I
realised what I should have come back with: <em>"In the end, crossing
one's fingers is not really the best risk-management strategy."</em>
</p>


<h3>ELVIS - Extremely Large Very Important Storage</h3>

<p>
The meeting continued. Later the discussion turned to ELVIS, our very
large (expandable to a petabyte, maybe more) disk storage.
</p>

<p>
Chairman John announced, "HP tech is due today to rebuild ELVIS with
the very latest OS. This new OS still won't handle CIFS and NFS
simultaneously."
</p>

<p>
Here's the deal. Chairman John has bought two ELVISes from HP, one for us
and one for our remote satellite site. Originally, the technology was
developed by IBRIX, which has since been acquired by HP. In essence, it's a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_access_server" title="Network
access server">NAS</a>.
</p>

<p>
But there seems to have been a slip between the cup and the lip.
</p> 

<p>
As I understand it, it can export NFS; it can export CIFS. But it
seems that it can't export both at the same time: there's some sort of
locking problem. HP can't guarantee that there won't be corruption.
</p>

<p>
Why am I using such vague terminology? Well, I have discovered in the
last few months that some people can have a Microsoft effect on me.
OK, one particular person. I've discussed this with my colleagues.
They agree that whenever there's a meeting with Chairman John, a fog
of stupidity envelopes the room, reducing all participants to the IQ
of cattle.
</p>

<p>
But I still didn't get it. "Why do they need to rebuild from scratch
for an upgrade?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I told them they could. Did you have any data that you needed
on the disk?"
</p> 

<p>
It's a bit late to be asking me that now. Shouldn't he have asked me
<strong>before</strong> he gave permission to erase the data?
</p>

<p>
And why hasn't he answered my question?
</p>

<p>
I expressed my misgivings that if every upgrade of the ELVIS OS
required a complete wipe of the disk and a rebuild, then what do we do
after ELVIS is populated with data?
</p>

<p>
Chairman John stated categorically that this would not be the case,
that in the future, upgrades would take place over the existing data.
</p>

<p>
Um, and he knows that <em>how</em>?
</p>

<p>
Here is a piece of technology that is touted as the wave of the future.
But, let's just examine the proposition.
</p>

<p>
First of all, we already have this technology, the aging unix33
mentioned before. This is our file server. It only has about 30 or 40
terabytes, but it works. It's a Sun-Fire-V245 running Solaris 10. It
serves all those terabytes as NFS, Samba (SMB) and AppleTalk -
concurrently. In our organisation, it serves to all the Unix and Linux
machines as well as all the PCs and Macs.
</p>

<p>
Its only problem is that it lacks grunt.
</p>

<p>
But the technology to serve NFS and Samba (or CIFS) is not rocket
science. Crumbs, I do it on my desktop at home. I have never for an
instant had a concern that there could be locking problems.
</p>

<p>
Why wouldn't HP simply use CentOS?
</p>

<p>
Why did Chairman John allow himself to purchase technology that did
not work when, demonstrably, he can get technology that does work? I
say again, this is not rocket science.
</p>

<blockquote>
	Most people in their domestic management have to deal with
	electricians and plumbers - and car salesmen. Most people
	don't know an awful lot about electricity or plumbing - and
	most women know very little about the technology behind
	automobiles. What colours does it come in?

	And yet, usually, they are able to make competent decisions
	about which plumber or electrician to engage. With car
	salesmen, it's not possible to deal with a good one. But most
	of us seem to know how to negotiate a reasonable deal.

	But when it comes to computers, most people seem to turn their
	brains off. The salesman only needs to start talking
	technicalities (megabytes or megaherz, gigabytes or gigabits)
	and purchasers forget the fundamentals of purchasing, and
	behave absurdly. "He said I needed to spend at least $5000 to
	get decent performance." <em>But all you do is use Hotmail!</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
I could, perhaps, consider the way most people behave excusable. But
<strong>the head of IT?</strong>
</p>

<p>
The rest of the department is fine; a nice blend of computer
professionals with various skills. But whenever I think of
Chairman John in relation to the department, I think of the mother as
the troops march past. "Look! Here they come. And my son is the only
one in step!"

<h1>HAL: Part 2 My Favourite Aliases</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/grebler.html">Henry Grebler</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<p>
I began this series with <A
HREF="../183/grebler1.html"> HAL: Part 1 Preliminaries</A>. I plan to
discuss scripts and functions in other articles.
</p>

<p>
If you downloaded my HAL from the the first of these articles, you
will be drowned in 171 aliases, many of them obsolete and
long-forgotten. I'm a hoarder: you never know when something might
come in handy.
</p>

<p>
Of those 171 aliases, you can discard anything with "cd " in it. I no
longer cd to anywhere (well, almost never). That gets rid of 30
aliases.
</p>

<p>
I will mention this one however:
</p>

<pre>
	alias a='cd'
</pre>

<p>
This exemplifies the point of HAL. I'd forgotten that it was there. I
can no longer remember when I created it; I can confirm that it
existed by November 1993 (because I use RCS).
</p>

<p>
On Prime computers, we "attached" to a directory. The command could be
abbreviated to "a". When I joined <A
HREF="http://optimation.com.au/">Optimation</A>, the company's main environment
was Prime. Some form of *n*x did not come until later in the form of
SunOS. This was one of the aliases which facilitated the transition
from Prime to SunOS, and enabled me to switch back and forth
seamlessly.
</p>

<p>
It became superfluous when I discovered pushd (also before November
1993), aliased it to its first letter, and began using it in
preference to cd.
</p> 

<p>
Aliases in this category include
</p>

<pre>
	alias del='rm'
	alias dir='ls -la'
</pre>

<p>
In all these cases, the alias acted like scaffolding. As I grew more
comfortable with my new environment, I gradually discarded these
props.
</p>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *
</pre>

<p>
Before proceeding, I will make one prefatory remark about aliases. I
have a function (dating back perhaps to Mar 1991) called "alias" which
is defined in $HOME/bash/csh-compat. Normally, you have to write
</p>

<pre>
	alias name=value
</pre>

<p>
My function allows me to write
</p>

<pre>
	alias name value
</pre>

<p>
This is why in $HOME/.ENV./.cshrc_bash you will see all the aliases
defined without the use of an equal sign (=).
</p>

<p>
I started using c-shell before I discovered bash (which originated
about 1989). In c-shell, the syntax for aliases does not use an equal sign:
</p>

<pre>
	alias name wordlist
</pre>

<p>
My function facilitated the transition from c-shell to bash.
</p>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *
</pre>

<pre>
	alias cad='cat &gt; /dev/null'
</pre>

<p>
cad is a great alias. It's actually a lot more than an alias. I
usually have at least one xterm with "cad" in the title bar. The xterm
icon is placed near the top-right of my screen next to the clock in
the corner. As soon as I launch this xterm, I enter the cad alias and
just leave the window waiting.
</p>

<p>
I use it as a general purpose scratch pad or clipboard. If I want to
remember something for a little while, I paste it there.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I want to select several fields from, say, a browser window
and paste it somewhere else, maybe another browser window. It is often
more convenient to have the first browser window and the cad window
open side by side and copy and paste from the first browser window
into the cad window; and then bring up the destination window and copy
and paste in the other direction.
</p>

<p>
This is extremely comfortable in my environment: I have
focus-follows-mouse so I don't have to click to change windows; the
window which has the focus does not have to be on top; the act of
selecting causes the selection to be copied (no Ctrl-C is necessary);
pasting is simply Middle-Click (no Ctrl-V is necessary). So, it's just
swipe, move mouse, click, move back; swipe, move mouse, click, move
back.
</p>

<p>
I use the cad window hundreds of times a day. It means I do very
little typing. This is a good thing because I live in a command-line
world and I am not a great typist. Yes, I'm lazy; no question. But,
more importantly, copy-and-paste improves accuracy. Computers are more
pedantic than humans; you can't get away with, "You know what I mean."
And they're unforgiving. Better to avoid errors - especially when it
can be done conveniently.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I sometimes use the cad alias in any window to temporarily
store text. It's hard to think of a reason off the top of my head; but
when the tool is there, it often finds a use.
</p>

<p>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<pre>
	alias acroread='acroread -geometry 800x898+152-0'
</pre>

<p>
This is an example of an inadvertent alias. The way I have defined it,
my usual invocation of acroread will invoke the alias. I'd have to do
something special to not invoke the alias.
</p>

<p>
I don't recall why I defined this alias. My best guess is that I was
annoyed with the defaults offered by acroread. I probably fooled
around with different settings before settling on these. I can only
say that it must be doing something right, because I cannot recall
being annoyed with the acroread window when it pops up.
</p>

<p>
Of course, it's always possible that this alias has outlived its
usefulness; that acroread now behaves differently. After all, I've had
this alias for over 10 years.
</p>

<p>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<pre>
	alias cp='cp -ip'
</pre>

<p>
Another inadvertent alias. The "p" option preserves inode information
(date, permissions, ownership). The "i" option prevents me from
inadvertently overwriting a file.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the "i" option, I also use bash's noclobber option so
that output redirection (&gt;) cannot overwrite an existing file.
</p>

<p>
I rely on the dates in the inode. If I copy a file, I haven't changed
its contents. I want the default date to reflect that fact. The "c"
date (ls -ltc) will indicate when I copied the file; the "t" date (ls
-lt) will reflect the date the contents last changed.
</p>

<pre>
Also
	alias mv='mv -i'
</pre>


<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *
</pre>

<pre>
	alias ed='emacs -nw --basic-display --unibyte'
</pre>

<p>
One of my core aliases. Fits into almost all categories. I think "ed"
was the name of the editor on Prime. Further, this alias helps protect
me from GNU. (Almost) every new rev of emacs comes out with some
incompatibility with a previous rev of emacs. In my view, FSF has an
awful lot to answer for. I won't repeat myself: see <A
HREF="../183/grebler.html">Ten Things I Dislike About Linux</A>.
</p>

<p>
My most recent change comment:
</p>

<pre>
	# 15 Jan 2010 Don't let emacs colourise.
</pre>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *
</pre>

<pre>
	alias gcat='gunzip -vdc'
	alias gunzip='gzip -vd'
</pre>

<p>
Just for convenience. I prefer "gcat" to "gzcat".
</p>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *
</pre>

<pre>
	alias h='history'
</pre>

<p>
Saves so much typing when referring to bash's history.
</p>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *
</pre>

<pre>
	alias hmg='more /home/henryg/hmg/help'
</pre>

<p>
Long forgotten. I'm guessing that, once upon a time, I had a single
help file! Wow! What a discovery! Sometimes this archaeology pays
dividends. This is where it all began. Look at the first line:
</p>

<pre>
	help - a file to help me with things I forget
</pre>

<p>
There is also help2 through help5. Waddya know?
</p>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *
</pre>

<pre>
	alias lok='sleep 1;xset s activate'
</pre>

<p>
I've acquired the habit of using this whenever I leave my computer. It
blanks the screen.
</p>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *
</pre>

<pre>
	alias mph='less /home/henryg/hmg/phone'
</pre>

<p>
I use this to look up my personal phone directory. It has other
information, not just phone numbers.
</p>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *
</pre>

<pre>
	alias psa='/bin/ps auxw'
</pre>

<p>
Apart from its obvious purpose, this is a different sort of alias. It
is not defined in $HOME/.ENV./.cshrc_bash, but rather in 
$HOME/.ENV./.shells_rc.* where the asterisk represents one of the
possible platforms I've worked on - because the ps command is rarely
the same on any two platforms. So far I have these platforms: AIX,
HP-UX, Linux, SCO_SV, SunOS4, SunOS5.
</p>

<p>
Ben has reminded me that I also ought to have
</p>

<pre>
	alias psag 'psa | grep -v grep | grep'
</pre>

<p>
And now I have!
</p>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *
</pre>

<pre>
	alias rlok='rlog -R -L RCS/*,v'
	alias rloka='rlog -R -L RCS/*,v RCS/.*,v'
</pre>

<p>
Answers the question, "Which files in RCS are locked?"
</p>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *
</pre>

<pre>
	alias rs='rsync -urlptog'
</pre>

<p>
should be
</p>

<pre>
	alias rs='rsync -urlptogH'
</pre>

<p>
The essential rsync options.
</p>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *
</pre>

<p>
For FreeBSD only:
</p>

<pre>
	alias seq='gseq'
</pre>

<p>
On Linux it's called seq; on FreeBSD gseq.
</p>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *
</pre>

<pre>
	alias su='BSD_su'
</pre>

<p>
su is one of the most idiosyncratic commands - a bit like the ps
command (above). Because I'm human and inconsistent (perhaps because
the alias goes back further), this gets defined in ~/.bashrc - unlike
ps.
</p>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *
</pre>

<pre>
	alias w='(pwd; /bin/pwd ) | uniq'
</pre>

<p>
Bash's notion of where you are sometimes differs from where you really
are if there are symlinks involved. If the two pwds agree, only one
entry is printed. The use of "w" for "where am I?" comes from DEC or
Prime.
</p>

<p>
I've just discovered that I have defined this twice - and
inconsistently. Here's why:
</p>

<pre>
#  Henry Grebler    31 Jul 96  bash (and only bash) sometimes has a different
#                               answer for pwd. Print both if different.
</pre>

<p>
The file .cshrc_bash is intended to be shared between csh and bash.
</p>

<p>
I have just changed this alias to
</p>

<pre>
	alias w '(pwd; /bin/pwd ) | uniq; df -h | tail -1'
</pre>

<p>
I often also want to know whether I'm on a local disk or not.
</p>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *
</pre>

<pre>
        alias xd       "date '+%a %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z %Z';\
                        date '+%A %d %B %Y %H:%M:%S %z %Z';\
                        date '+%a %e %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z %Z';\
                        date '+%A %e %B %Y %H:%M:%S %z %Z';\
                        date '+%Y%b%d.%H:%M:%S';
                        date '+%d %b %y'"
</pre>

<p>
This looks meaningless until you see its output:
</p>

<pre>
Tue 08 Feb 2011 10:47:00 +1100 EST
Tuesday 08 February 2011 10:47:00 +1100 EST
Tue  8 Feb 2011 10:47:00 +1100 EST
Tuesday  8 February 2011 10:47:00 +1100 EST
2011Feb08.10:47:00
08 Feb 11
</pre>

<p>
In my opinion, there is no more useless date format than the default
for Linux:
</p>

<pre>
	date
	Tue Feb  8 10:47:32 EST 2011
</pre>

<p>
Who uses this format? Why?
</p>

<p>
In this alias I have a template for every form of the date I'm ever
likely to want: both full and abbreviated day and month name; day of
month with leading space and leading zero. The second last form is for
appending to filenames, e.g.
</p>

<pre>
	cp /var/log/xxx /var/log/xxx.2011Feb08
</pre>

<p>
The last form is for change log entries at the head of shell scripts
and C code:
</p>


<pre>
	#  12 Nov 01  Henry Grebler    First cut.                       sh
	   12 Nov 99  Henry Grebler    Start of initial coding.         c
</pre>

<p>
But I'm starting to prefer 4 digits for the year to avoid any
possibility of ambiguity:
</p>

<pre>
	#  12 Nov 2011  Henry Grebler    First cut.
</pre>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *
</pre>

<h3>Aliases Which Invoke Scripts</h3>

<p>
Arguably, these are unnecessary: I could simply use a symlink.
</p>

<p>
I will discuss the shell scripts in another article.
</p>

<p>
I have written these in the form they appear in
$HOME/.ENV./.cshrc_bash because then they retain environment variables.
</p>

<pre>
        alias cleanup $HOME/scripts/cleanup.sh
	alias diff $HOME/scripts/diff.sh
	alias lns '$HOME/scripts/lns.sh'
	sol='/home/henryg/scripts/sol.sh'
	alias tcg='/home/henryg/scripts/tarcompressuuencode.sh +u -g'
	alias tcu='/home/henryg/scripts/tarcompressuuencode.sh'
	alias uue='/home/henryg/scripts/uuencode.sh'
	alias uut='/home/henryg/scripts/uudecodeuncompresstar.sh'
	alias x='/home/henryg/scripts/expr.sh'
	alias xr='/home/henryg/scripts/xrenamewindow.sh'
	alias xt='/home/henryg/scripts/xterm.sh'
</pre>


<h3>Summing Up</h3>

<p>
I've tried to restrict myself to aliases which are in some way
instructive.
</p> 

<p>
If anyone is interested in any of this, I have a recommendation. Don't
try to expand your repetoire with too many aliases (or anything else)
at one time. It can be extremely difficult, and the exercise may end
in disappointment.
</p>

<p>
The aliases can be categorised. Clearly, many are obsolete, as this
waltz down memory lane has revealed. They may have been very important
for a while, then fell into disuse.
</p>

<p>
But that is true for many things in life. At home, we have many Thomas
the Tank Engine videos. There was a time when my younger son watched
them constantly. Now, at 22, not so much.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, some become more important, give rise to variations
which sometimes outgrow the capabilities of aliases. They become
functions or shell scripts.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, I create an alias and soon after wonder how I ever got by
without it.
</p>

<p>
I've shown (<A HREF="../181/grebler.html">What
Really Matters or The Counting Article</A>) that I almost cannot live
without 2 of them, 'p' and 'bdx'. Some are not quite as essential, but are
still used frequently:
</p>

<pre>
	cad cp mv ed h lok mph psa rs su w xd
</pre>

<p>
Some are only invoked occasionally.
</p>

<p>
The last category is aliases which invoke scripts. I will discuss
these in an article about scripts.

Henry has spent his days working with computers, mostly for computer
 manufacturers or software developers. His early computer experience
 includes relics such as punch cards, paper tape and mag tape. It is
 his darkest secret that he has been paid to do the sorts of things he
 would have paid money to be allowed to do. Just don't tell any of his
 employers.

<p>
He has used Linux as his personal home desktop since the family got its
 first PC in 1996. Back then, when the family shared the one PC, it was a
 dual-boot Windows/Slackware setup. Now that each member has his/her own
 computer, Henry somehow survives in a purely Linux world.

%T   "Snip, burn, solder, shred: seriously geeky stuff to make with your kids"
</pre>

<p>
First things first: this book is not about Linux. What it is about,
however, is the thing that for me is indistinguishable from Linux: a spirit
of exploration, of curiosity, of getting your hands into an interesting,
fascinatingly-complicated Thing and making it work - even if you have to
assemble it piece by piece. This book is a terrific catalyst for igniting
the imagination - and not only in kids, but in any adult with even a bit of
curiosity.
</p>

<p>
The thing that I found instantly appealing about it is the absence of what
I call "assumed stupidity" on the part of the reader. The Do-It-Yourself
(DIY) air throughout the book, the underlying assumption of intelligence,
caution, and ability in the reader is refreshing. Sure, there are plenty of
warnings about the various dangerous bits you're going to deal with - and
it says quite a lot for the author that even these are interesting to read!
- but... one of the projects is a "Ticklebox", a way to zap yourself and
your friends with a little jolt of electricity, while another is a
Marshmallow Gun, which drives its soft, fluffy projectile with (I kid you
not) <em>breath spray</em> exploded by the flash circuitry from a
disposable camera.
</p>

<p>
(If you're anything like me, the last sentence will have you running out
the door and to your nearest book store to grab this book RIGHT NOW. Go
ahead; I'll wait.)
</p>

<p>
The project list veers wildly, from an squid sock puppet to an
electric guitar that you can build for $10; in fact, most of these projects
can be built very cheaply, and the pages are packed with suggestions on
using scraps of this, bits of that, and cheap but strong goop to secure it
all inside an empty cigar box or maybe an empty can with its ends cut out.
The required factor here is a will to tinker and explore, not a pocket full
of cash.
</p>

<p>
And since you're off and building that guitar, you might as well build an
amp and a stomp box, too - oh, did I mention that this book gives you a
mini-education in practical electronics just so you can complete these
projects? Perfect example of the author's DIY mindset - and as a life-long
teacher as well as an electronics engineer, I admit to being quite
impressed by it. Very well done, and bursting at the seams with even more
"curiosity bait"; anyone who gets hooked on playing with soldering irons
and electronic components is left with lots of info resources which they
can use to expand their new-found skill.
</p>

<p>
All in all, I'm very pleasantly impressed by this book - and I am usually
not the kindest of reviewers. If I have any complaint to make, it is that
the author sometimes forgets that the readers don't have access to all the
info in his head: the section on musical instruments, for example, has very
little info on actually using them - you're more or less expected to know
all that stuff. To be fair, this is a very common and completely natural
failing: we're not always aware of everything we know as a learned skill,
because after a while it becomes "just the way the world is". But then, if
you're interested in music, this becomes just another avenue of learning
and exploration...

Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became interested in electricity
at the tender age of six, promptly demonstrated it by sticking a fork into

<h1>The reason why I have switched to zsh - Part 2</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/silva.html">Anderson Silva</a> and <a href="../authors/woodson.html">Matt Woodson</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
<a href=
"http://linuxgazette.net/183/silva.html">Last month</a>, Matt and I decided to 
share with you why zsh is worth a try. Matt shared his .zshrc in the article, 
and we started
to walk you through a few of the &lsquo;goodies&rsquo; available under zsh. We
concluded the first part of this zsh series by promising you we would tackle a
few more zsh features this month. Well, here they are:</p>

<h3>Spelling correction</h3>

<p>In bash, mistype vim and you will likely get the
infamous: &nbsp;&ldquo;command not found&rdquo; message on your terminal. In
zsh:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ ivm <br>
zsh: correct 'ivm' to 'vim' [nyae]?
</pre>

<p>To turn on this feature add: setopt CORRECT to your .zshrc</p>

<p>If you feel really lucky, you can tell zsh to
try to correct your mispellings even in the argument list by using: setopt
CORRECT_ALL.</p>

<h3>Extended Globbing</h3>

<p>Do you find &lsquo;find&rsquo; (no pun intended)
a bit too cumbersome to use? Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love the find command,
but zsh gobbling makes some forms of the find command look a bit
ugly.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a few examples:</p>

<p>1. Find all executable files by owner under
current directory and sub-directories:</p>

<p>With find:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ find . -perm -u+x -type -f
</pre>

<p>With zsh:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ ls -s **/*(.x)
</pre>

<p>2. Find files that are larger than 100MB in size
under current directory and sub-directories:</p>

<p>With find:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ find . -type f -size 10M
</pre>

<p>With zsh:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ ls **/*(.Lm+100)
</pre>

<p>3. List all non jpg files under directory and
sub-directories:</p>

<p>With zsh:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ ls **/^*.jpg
</pre>

<p>You can turn on extended globbing on your .zshrc
by adding:</p>

<p>setopt extendedglob</p>

<p>If you would like to see all the globbing
options for ls zsh support enter:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ ls *(&lt;tab&gt;
completing glob qualifier
% &nbsp;-- device files
) &nbsp;-- end of qualifiers
* &nbsp;-- executable plain files
+ &nbsp;-- + command name
- &nbsp;-- follow symlinks toggle
. &nbsp;-- plain files
/ &nbsp;-- directories
: &nbsp;-- modifier
= &nbsp;-- sockets
@ &nbsp;-- symbolic links
...
</pre>

<h3>Aliases</h3>

<p>zsh has many different types of aliases,
including regular, suffix, and global.</p>

<p>Regular aliases are treated the same as in bash.
&nbsp;These alias need to be run in the command position (first thing typed) on
the terminal. e.g:</p>

<pre class="code">
alias ll=&rsquo;ls -la&rsquo;
</pre>

<p>Suffix aliases execute a command based on a
file&rsquo;s extension. Suffix aliases are used with the alias -s command.
&nbsp;Here&rsquo;s my favorite feature of aliases in zsh. &nbsp;By adding this
line:</p>

<pre class="code">
alias -s html=vim
</pre>

<p>when you enter a file name with the .html
extension, something like:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ index.html
</pre>

<p>zsh will automatically invoke vim to open up
that file.</p>

<p>Global aliases can be used anywhere in the
command line, not just the command position. &nbsp;This is best seen by
example. &nbsp;The global alias defined:</p>

<pre class="code">
alias -g G=&rsquo;|grep &lsquo;'
</pre>

<p>This would be invoked like this:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ cat /var/log/messages G ERROR
</pre>

<p>This will put it in the pipe with the grep
command. </p>

<h3>Floating Point Math</h3>

<p>Given the following shell script:</p>

<pre class="code">
(( X = 5.0 + 0.5 ))
(( Y = 33.0 / 9.0 ))
echo $X
echo $Y
</pre>

<p>Output:</p>
<pre class="code">
5.5000000000
3.6666666667
</pre>

<p>Many times in bash I have needed to do floating
point math calculations for a variety of reasons. &nbsp;Now, with zsh, you
don&rsquo;t need to invoke external programs like bc or perl just to do a
floating point math calculation.</p>

<h3>Version Control Information on Your
Prompt</h3>

<p>If you ever used git, you probably have checked
a branch, and then forgot what branch you were in, and ran: <em>git branch -a</em> to locate yourself within the repo.
In zsh, a person can set up their prompt so it will display all the relevant
information needed while navigating some of the most populate version control
systems out there.</p>

<p>The following needs to happen to get your VCS
information displayed:</p>

<p>1. Load the vcs_info module into zsh. You can
achieve this by adding the following to your .zshrc:</p>

<pre class="code">autoload -Uz vcs_info</pre>

<p>2. Set the zstyles for the vcs_info. Here, you
will be able to tell what type of VCS it should detect, and how it should
behave. For a more in depth look at zstyles for vcs_info check out the zsh
manual page. &nbsp;</p>

<p>zstyle ':vcs_info:*' enable git cvs
svn</p>

<p>If you take a look at Matt&rsquo;s zshrc file
from<a href=
"http://linuxgazette.net/183/silva.html">
last month</a>, you will see a few other zstyles
configured to manage color and behavior of the vcs_info function.</p>

<p>3. Call vcs_info function before each prompt.
This will be accomplished by a really interesting zsh function called precmd(),
which will discuss on part three of the zsh series.</p>

<pre class="code">
precmd() {<br>
&nbsp;vcs_info &lsquo;prompt&rsquo;</br>
}<br>
</pre>

<p>4. Set the PROMPT variable with vcs_info_msg_0_
variable. In zsh, PROMPT is the same as PS1.</p>

<pre class="code">
PROMPT='${vcs_info_msg_0_}%B%F{blue}]&#9472;&gt;
%f%b&rsquo;'
</pre>

<p><img height="258" src="misc/silva/zsh-p2.png" width="584"></p>
<p>In this screenshot, my prompt tells me what vcs
I am using, git, in which branch of the repository I have currently checked
out, master, and in what stage of the commit is currently being displayed. The
yellow asterisk &lsquo;*&rsquo;, means I have modified a file.</p>
<p>The yellow plus &lsquo;+&rsquo;, means I have
added the file, but still need to commit it.</p>

<h3>Vertical Argument History</h3>

<p>Ok, I made up the name &lsquo;Vertical Argument
History&rsquo;, but bear with me. Do you know how in bash (and zsh), while on
the command line one can use the up and down keys to move through the shell
history?</p>

<p>In bash, you may be familiar with Alt-., which
takes you to the last argument of the previous entry from your history. Well,
in zsh, one can use: Alt-/ (slash) and Alt-, (comma) to move through the
argument history of your shell history... Get it? Check this out:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ touch 1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
$ cp &lt;Alt-Slash&gt; /tmp
</pre>

<p>The above command with the Alt-/ shortcut will
generate:</p>

<pre class="code">$ cp 5 /tmp/</pre>

<p>Hit Alt-/ twice, instead of once and it will
execute:</p>

<pre class="code">$ cp 4 /tmp/</pre>

<p>As you hit Alt-/ and go through the list of
previous arguments, you can use Alt-, to go back through the
arguments.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I don&rsquo;t claim to be a zsh expert, and
during the past few weeks, I have been picking Matt&rsquo;s brain every time I
have a question about it, and every time he figures out a new feature he is
kind enough to share with me. Hopefully, the above has given you a few more
reasons to give zsh a try, and we look forward to finishing up the zsh series
next month when we will write about the precmd() and preexec() functions in zsh
and give you an example or two of how to use it.

<h1>Playing around with IPv6 on Linux and Freenet6</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/silva.html">Anderson Silva</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<p>Earlier this month, ICANN announced that it had
assigned the last remaining blocks of IPv4 available under its control.
Essentially, this means that for regions without free addresses, it will no
longer be possible to get new devices to directly connect to the
Internet.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I decided to learn a bit more
about IPv6, and to try to get a Linux server working with an IPv6 address. In
this article, I am not going to go over the basics of IPv6 and how it compares
to IPv4. You can read all about that on<a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#Comparison_to_IPv4">
Wikipedia</a>. I also don&rsquo;t claim to be an IPv6
expert or a networking expert. In fact, part of this article is based on <a href=
"http://www.mrball.net/tutorials/ipv6-go6.html">
IPV6 Go6 Mini-HowTo</a> from 2008. I basically used it
to set up my own host, but had to do quite a few modifications for it to work
in 2011. &nbsp;I will show you how to set up a linux box to connect the
Internet using IPv6 using the gogo client from Freenet6.net. I will also show
you how to set up lighttpd to serve pages on IPv6, and a few other IPv6 related
tools.</p>

<p>Before we start, let me give you everything I
needed to get up and running:</p>

<ol>
<li>A linux host with root access and
Internet connectivity: I have a slicehost running CentOS 5.5, running as a dns
and web server (lighttpd).</li>
<li>An <a href=
"http://freenet6.net">
freenet6.net</a> account: 
<a href=
"http://gogonet.gogo6.com/page/freenet6-registration">
http://gogonet.gogo6.com/page/freenet6-registration</a></li>
<li>The freenet6 gogoCLIENT: <a href=
"http://gogo6.com/downloads/gogoc-1_2-RELEASE.tar.gz">
http://gogo6.com/downloads/gogoc-1_2-RELEASE.tar.gz</a></li>
</ol>

<h3>Making sure your linux box is IPv6 ready:</h3>

<p>Check for the ipv6 kernel module:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ /sbin/lsmod | grep ipv6
ipv6          222188 xxxxx
</pre>

<p>Check for ifconfig output:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ /sbin/ifconfig | grep inet6
  inet6 addr: fe80::4240:6fff:fef7:334a/64 Scope:Link
</pre>

<p>If neither of the above commands return the
desirable output then check your /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist and make sure ipv6
isn&rsquo;t being blacklisted. If it is, comment it out and load the
module:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ /sbin/modprobe ipv6
</pre>

<h3>Installing and Setting up the gogoCLIENT:</h3>

<p>Download the client:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ wget http://gogo6.com/downloads/gogoc-1_2-RELEASE.tar.gz
</pre>

<p>Install the router advertisement daemon for IPv6:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ yum install radvd
</pre>

<p>Enable IPv6 forwarding kernel parameter:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ echo &ldquo;net.ipv6.conf.default.forwarding=1&rdquo; &gt;&gt; /etc/sysctl.conf
$ sysctl -p
</pre>

<p>Install necessary packages to compile package:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ &nbsp;yum install gcc gcc-c++ openssl-devel
$ make
</pre>

<p>Untar, compile and install package:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ tar -zxvf gogoc-1_2-RELEASE.tar.gz
$ cd gogoc-1_2-RELEASE
$ make target=linux install installdir=/usr/local/gogoc
</pre>

<p>Configure gogoc:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ cd /usr/local/gogoc
$ mkdir etc logs
$ mv bin/gogoc.conf* etc
</pre>

<p>Edit gogoc.conf and change the following
parameters:</p>

<pre class="code">
userid=&lt;enter the id you created with freenet6
passwd=&lt;chosen password&gt;
server=broker.freenet6.net &nbsp;
auth_method=any
host_type=router
if_prefix=eth0 # or whatever device you are
going to connect to the Internet with
log_file=2
log_filename=/usr/local/gogoc/logs/gogoc.log
</pre>

<p>Set up a service script, source of script:
<a href="https://github.com/afsilva/config-files/raw/master/gogoc">
https://github.com/afsilva/config-files/raw/master/gogoc</a></p>

<pre class="code">
$ cd /etc/init.d
$ wget https://github.com/afsilva/config-files/raw/master/gogoc
$ chmod 755 gogoc
$ chkconfig --add gogoc
$ chkconfig --list gogoc
</pre>

<p>At this point you should be able to connect to freenet6:</p>
<pre class="code">
$ service gogoc start
</pre>

<p>Testing connection:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ ping6 -n ipv6.google.com
PING ipv6.google.com(2001:4860:b007::67) 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 2001:4860:b007::67: icmp_seq=0 ttl=53 time=274 ms
64 bytes from 2001:4860:b007::67: icmp_seq=1 ttl=53 time=274 ms
</pre>

<p>Finding out your IPv6 address:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ /sbin/ifconfig | grep Global
   inet6 addr: 2001:5c0:1400:b::9e55/128 Scope:Global
</pre>

<p>You can also install elinks, and go to <a href=
"http://www.whatismyipv6.net">http://www.whatismyipv6.net</a></p>

<h3>A few extra notes:</h3>

<p>Note 1: radvd is used by the gogoc service
script; do not try to start it manually or tell it to start at boot
time.</p>

<p>Note 2: The first time I tried to do this,
connecting to broker.freenet6.net timed out. I tried two or three
more times and then it eventually started working.</p>

<p>Note 3: Be mindful of the logs; if you have any
issues, looking at the logs will most likely help.</p>

<p>Note 4: Also be aware that any iptables rules
you may have on your system are probably set for IPv4. To set up your IPv6
iptables you must install, configure and run: iptables-ipv6.</p>

<h3>Enabling IPv6 on lighttpd:</h3>

<p>Add the following to your /etc/lighttpd config:</p>

<pre class="code">
$SERVER["socket"] == "[YOUR_IPv6_ADDRESS]:80"
{
  accesslog.filename = "/var/log/lighttpd/ipv6.access.log"
  server.document-root = "/var/www/html6/"
}
</pre>

<p>Note: Replace YOUR_IPv6_ADDRESS with the IPv6 assigned
to you by gogoc.</p>

<p>Make sure you create the /var/www/html6/
directory (or whatever other directory you want your document-root to be) and
place an index.html in there.</p>

<p>Restart lighttpd:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ service lighttpd restart
</pre>

<p>And you should be good to go. To test via
command line with links:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ links http6://YOUR_IPv6_ADDRESS/
</pre>

<p>Or on your firefox, if you have an IPv6 provider, use the following
(don&rsquo;t forget the brackets):</p>

<pre class="code">
http://[YOUR_IPv6_ADDRESS]/
</pre>

<p>Finally, if you want to have your IPv6 address
on your DNS server, add the following to your domain&rsquo;s zone
file:</p>

<pre class="code">
some_subdomain &nbsp; IN &nbsp;AAAA &nbsp;YOUR_IPv6_ADDRESS
</pre>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to update your zone
file&rsquo;s serial number and restart named service.</p>

<p>You should now be able to access your IPv6 web
server via a browser with the address: http://some_subdomain.yourdomain.com
</p>

<em>
<p>
Born September 22, 1969, in Gardena, California, "Penguin" Pete Trbovich
 today resides in Iowa with his wife and children. Having worked various
 jobs in engineering-related fields, he has since "retired" from
 corporate life to start his second career. Currently he works as a
 freelance writer, graphics artist, and coder over the Internet. He
 describes this work as, "I sit at home and type, and checks mysteriously
 arrive in the mail."
</p>

<p>
He discovered Linux in 1998 - his first distro was Red Hat 5.0 - and has
 had very little time for other operating systems since. Starting out
 with his freelance business, he toyed with other blogs and websites
 until finally getting his own domain penguinpetes.com started in March
 of 2006, with a blog whose first post stated his motto: "If it isn't fun
 for me to write, it won't be fun to read."
</p>

<p>
The webcomic <em>Doomed to Obscurity</em> was launched New Year's Day,
 2009, as a "New Year's surprise". He has since rigorously stuck to a
 posting schedule of "every odd-numbered calendar day", which allows him
 to keep a steady pace without tiring. The tagline for the webcomic
 states that it "gives the geek culture just what it deserves." But is it
 skewering everybody but the geek culture, or lampooning geek culture
 itself, or doing both by turns?
</p>

<h1>The Foolish Things We Do With Our Computers</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/okopnik.html">Ben Okopnik</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>"Foolish Things" is a now-and-again compilation we run based
on our readers' input; once we have several of these stories
assembled in one place, we get to share them with all of you. If
you enjoy reading these cautionary tales of woe, proud stories of
triumph, and just plain weird and fun things that happen between
humans and silicon, that's great; if you have some to share so
that others may enjoy them, even better. Please send them to
<img src="../gx/lgmail/articles.png" alt="email address">.</p>

<p>[ You can even tell us that it happened to A Friend of Yours,
and we'll believe you. ]</p>

<p>-- Ben</p>

<h3>"Measure Seven Times, Cut Once"</h3>
<p id="by"><b>Marcello Romani</b><br></p>

<p>
I had a horror story <a href="../183/lg_foolish.html">similar to Ben's</a>,
about two years ago. I backed up a PC and reinstalled the OS with the
backup usb disk still attached. The OS I was reinstalling was a version of
Windows (2000 or XP, I don't remember right now). When the partition
creation screen appeared, the list items looked a bit different from what I
was expecting, but as soon as I realized why, my fingers had already
pressed the keys, deleting the existing partitions and creating a new ntfs
one. Luckily, I stopped just before the "quick format" command...
</p>

<p>
Searching the 'net for data recovery software, I came across TestDisk,
which is targeted at partition table recovery. I was lucky enough to
have wiped out only that portion of the usb disk, so in less than an
hour I was able to regain access to the all of my data.
</p>

<p>
Since then I always "safely remove" usb disks from the machine before
doing anything potentially dangerous, and check "fdisk -l" at least
three times before deciding that the arguments to "dd" are written
correctly...
</p>

<h3>*Snap*, and Your Data is Gone</h3>
<p id="by"><b>Derek Robertson</b><br></p>

<p>
I'd just started as a trainee computer operator in a datacentre which
housed an IBM 370/158 mainframe.  It was a weekday with lots of users
grabbing a piece of the 1 megabyte of main memory our state of the art
machine had installed.  The shift leader was showing me the basics and had
the panels open on the mainframe.  He was telling me what would happen if
the CPU overheated. Pointing to one of the switches he said "Yeah - the
switch will move over like so..." making a swift lateral movement of his
hand - neatly hitting the switch so flicking it over.  It went awfully
quiet and seconds later the helpdesk switchboard lit up like a christmas
tree...."Ah for pete's sake" was his approximate response.
</p>

<h3>NOT an Apocryphal Story</h3>
<p id="by"><b>Derek Robertson</b><br></p>

<p>
Another tale came from one of our programmers who was in the business at
the time PC's ran off floppies - a 5 meg winchester costing the earth.  He
had installed some financial package onto the PC of a clerk who was
instructed to take a copy of the data floppy every week, keeping 4 weeks
worth of data.  One day the main floppy went belly up and our programmer
went to the clerk to ask for the backup floppies to do a restore with.  She
pulled open her drawer and handed him a neatly clipped sheaf of 4 pages of
A4 paper. It turned out that "taking a copy of a floppy" can have a different
meaning to some people when you have a photocopier handy!
</p>

<p class="editorial">[ Just to back up Derek's story, I've seen this happen
- in no less than three different places. Working tech support and field
service back in the late 80s, before computers became common home
furnishings, certainly had its moments... -- Ben ] </p>

<p>
Last but not least this was a joke, that who knows, has probably happened.
A user rings the helpdesk to complain that the system he is attempting to
log onto won't accept his password.
</p>

<p>
Helpdesk: "Are you sure you're putting in the right password?"<br>
User: "Yeah - of course!"<br>
Helpdesk: "You are making sure the case is right, you know, by typing in lower and uppercase where necessary?"<br>
User: "Yes its a simple straightforward password."<br>
Helpdesk: "And it is the current password?"<br>
User: "Yeah, I watched my manager typing it in this morning!"<br>
Helpdesk: "Ok, what is the password you've got?"<br>
User: "Eight stars!"<br>

Ben is the Editor-in-Chief for Linux Gazette and a member of The Answer Gang.
</p>

<p>
<em>
Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became interested in electricity
at the tender age of six, promptly demonstrated it by sticking a fork into
a socket and starting a fire, and has been falling down technological
mineshafts ever since. He has been working with computers since the Elder
Days, when they had to be built by soldering parts onto printed circuit
boards and programs had to fit into 4k of memory (the recurring nightmares
have almost faded, actually.)
</p>

<p>
His subsequent experiences include creating software in more than two dozen
languages, network and database maintenance during the approach of a
hurricane, writing articles for publications ranging from sailing magazines
to technological journals, and teaching on a variety of topics ranging from
Soviet weaponry and IBM hardware repair to Solaris and Linux
administration, engineering, and programming. He also has the distinction
of setting up the first Linux-based public access network in St. Georges,
Bermuda as well as one of the first large-scale Linux-based mail servers in
St. Thomas, USVI.
</p>

<p>
After a seven-year Atlantic/Caribbean cruise under sail and passages up and
down the East coast of the US, he is currently anchored in northern
Florida. His consulting business presents him with a variety of challenges,
and his <strike>second brain</strike> Palm Pilot is crammed full of alarms,
many of which contain exclamation points.
</p>

<p>
He has been working with Linux since 1997, and credits it with his complete
loss of interest in waging nuclear warfare on parts of the Pacific Northwest.
