<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;Executable files are stored in a defined format
on the disk, different operating systems may have different definitions
for the actual format but there are generally common elements in the way
they are stored. A format commonly used on Unix systems such as Linux is
called Extensible Linked Format (ELF). An ELF programme consists of an
ELF header, a program header table, a number of sections and an optional
section header table. The header contains all the information the kernel
needs to create a process image (i.e. load the programme into memory and
allocate resources to prepare it for execution).</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Programme code on a multitasking operating system must
be re-entrant. This means it can be shared by multiple processes. To be
re-entrant the code must not modify itself at any time and the data must
be stored separately from the instruction text (such that each independent
process can maintain its own data space).</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;When a programme is loaded as a process it is allocated
a section of virtual memory which forms its useable address space. Within
this process image there are typically at least four elements :</FONT>
