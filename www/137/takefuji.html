<h1>Rule-based DoS attacks prevention shell script</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/takefuji.html">Yoshiyasu Takefuji</a></b></p>

<h3> Introduction</h3>
<p>
In this article, I describe a simple rule-based DoS attack-prevention
shell script.  However, the proposed shell script is not a perfect tool
for preventing DoS attacks, but a powerful tool for alleviating DoS
attacks overheads of the Linux servers significantly.</p>

<p class="editorial">[ Dealing with dynamic threats and automatically
taking evasive action is very difficult to do and requires some thought.
The article focuses on text patterns and log files. There are other
methods that lead to similar results and are mentioned after the
author's conclusion. -- Ren&eacute; ]
</p>

<p>
In order to understand DoS or DDoS attacks, it is useful to see the log
files in /var/log.  In this article, an ssh DoS attack-prevention shell
script is mainly mentioned.  We have been observing the behavior of ssh
DoS attacks through three Linux servers in the last six months.  We have
been manually manipulating iptables commands for disabling the access
from specific IPs, after detecting DoS attacks.  The proposed shell
script is to automate the whole manipulated commands for DoS attacks
prevention.  If the proposed simple shell script detects DoS attacks
that match predefine rules in the shell script, then the DoS
attack IPs are added to the detected-IPs file and have their access to
the server disabled.  Since detecting DoS attacks is rule-based, it is
expandable.  Kernel-mode implementation of the proposed idea is
expected, for immediate DoS attacks prevention, instead of using crontab
in this article.</p>

<h3> How to detect DoS attacks from /var/log/secure file</h3>

<p>
In order to see /var/log/secure file, you have to be a root. In this
article, "grep", "awk", and "sed" commands are often used for building
rules in the proposed shell script.  The shell script is composed of a
part of DoS attack detection rules, a part of reducing redundant IPs,
and a part of disabling detected IPs.  The following is an example of
the typical ssh attack using the dictionary, where every second user name
is changed from root, delta, admin,,,, after the system did not receive
identification string from 64.34.200.202.

<pre class="code">
Feb 18 09:14:08 neuro sshd[8978]: Did not receive identification string from 64.34.200.202

Feb 18 09:18:29 neuro sshd[9017]: pam_unix(sshd:auth): check pass; user unknown

</pre></p>

<p>
The following command sends the disabled IPs information from
/etc/sysconfig/iptables into tmp file.

<pre class="code">
grep DROP /etc/sysconfig/iptables|awk '{print $5}' &gt;tmp    
</pre></p>

<p>
If the system did not receive identification string from the specific
IPs, the machine access should be disabled.  The following command adds
the detected IPs to a temporary file. Detected IPs using rules will be added in
that file.

<pre class="code">
grep Did /var/log/secure|awk '{print $12}' &gt;&gt;tmp     
</pre></p>

<p>
A new rule can be added to the tmp file using the simple command.  The
dictionary attacks can be easily detected by "Invalid user" from
/var/log/secure.  If you misspell in ssh login name, you may not be able
to login any more from your machine.  In order to re-enable login from
the machine again, you must delete all the lines including your machine
IP from /var/log/secure file and flush the iptables by /sbin/iptables
-F.

<pre class="code">
grep "Invalid user" /var/log/secure|awk '{print $10}' &gt;&gt;tmp  
</pre></p>

<p>
Maximum login DoS attacks can be detected by the following command.

<pre class="code">
grep "Maximum login" /var/log/secure|awk '{print $7}'|sed 's/.*\[\(.*\)\])/\1/g' &gt;&gt;tmp       
</pre></p>


<h3>How to reduce redundant detected IPs from the temporary file</h3>

<p>
The following commands reduce redundant detected IPs from the temporary file, and
store the unique detected IPs in file ttt.  The variable "size"
indicates the number of lines in the tmp file.

<pre class="code">
size=`wc tmp|awk '{print $1}'`
i=0
while test $i -lt $size
do
      us=`sed -n 1p tmp`
      sed /$us/d tmp &gt;tmps
      echo $us &gt;&gt;ttt
      cp -f tmps tmp
      size=`wc tmp|awk '{print $1}'`
done     
</pre></p>

<h3>How to activate /sbin/iptables </h3>

<p>
DoS attack IPs are stored in file ttt.  The following simple loop
activates /sbin/iptables.  

<pre class="code">
size=`wc ttt|awk '{print $1}'`
size=`expr $size + 1`
/sbin/iptables -F
i=1
while test $i -lt $size
do
        ip=`sed -n "$i"p ttt`
        i=`expr $i + 1`
/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -s $ip -j DROP
done
</pre></p>

<h3>How to install the proposed shell script</h3>

<p>
You have to be root.  "crontab -e" command sets the crontab, where the
proposed shell script test is stored in /var/log in our system.  The
following setting means, that every five minutes, the shell script test is
activated, everyday.

<pre class="code">
0-59/5 * * * * /var/log/test 
</pre></p>

<p>
The entire shell script /var/log/test is as follows.

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash
rm -f ttt
touch tmp
# disabled IPs can be obtained from /etc/sysconfig/iptables
grep DROP /etc/sysconfig/iptables|awk '{print $5}' &gt;tmp
# ------------------------ DoS attacks rule -------------------------
#identity mismatch in secure
grep Did /var/log/secure|awk '{print $12}' &gt;&gt;tmp
#Invalid user
grep "Invalid user" /var/log/secure|awk '{print $10}' &gt;&gt;tmp
# Maximum login
grep "Maximum login" /var/log/secure|awk '{print $7}'|sed 's/.*\[\(.*\)\])/\1/g' &gt;&gt;tmp
#
# ------------------ reduce redundant IPs from tmp file -------------
size=`/usr/bin/wc tmp|awk '{print $1}'`
i=0
while test $i -lt $size
do
      us=`sed -n 1p tmp`
      sed /$us/d tmp &gt;tmps
      echo $us &gt;&gt;ttt
      cp -f tmps tmp
      size=`/usr/bin/wc tmp|awk '{print $1}'`
done
rm -f tmp tmps temp0 temp
#
# ------------------ activate detected IPs --------------------------
size=`wc ttt|awk '{print $1}'`
size=`expr $size + 1`
/sbin/iptables -F
i=1
while test $i -lt $size
do
        ip=`sed -n "$i"p ttt`
        i=`expr $i + 1`
/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -s $ip -j DROP
done   
# -----------------end of shell script test -------------------------                   
</pre></p>

<h3>Examine shell script</h3>
<p>
Before running the cron shell script, you must be root and should
examine the shell script by:

<pre class="code">
sh /var/log/test
</pre>

<p>
In order to see the current iptables, type the following command.

<pre class="code">
/sbin/iptables -nL
</pre></p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Since the proposed shell script is portable, it can be placed in every
server or router.  In order to share the blacklist of IPs, the shell
script must be placed in every router, and router-to-router
communication is needed to assemble the blacklist of IPs for the larger
framework of network security.</p>

<p class="editorial">[ The system described in this article relies on
predefined patterns that have to be extracted from the log files; this, of
course, requires that the syslog server on the machine not drop any log
messages. Both assumptions can lead to problems when log entries are
dropped or the text pattern of the failed login attempts isn't detected
properly. The author mentioned a way to do this automatically from the
kernel; the Linux Netfilter provides a module than can be used to
automatically deny repeated login attempts. There is an <a
href="http://hostingfu.com/article/ssh-dictionary-attack-prevention-with-iptables">article</a>
that describes this method. Whatever you decide to do, keep in mind that a
resilient security measure should not depend on less than fully-reliable
grounds. Parsing log files makes a fine part of your security measures;
just don't make it a cornerstone of your security considerations. --
