<P>
Vim has many wonderful features; unfortunately, printing - especially
printing that retains all the fancy colorizing stuff that Vim enables
you to do via the various syntax files - is not one of them, at least
not automatically. However, here's something you can add to your
"~/.vimrc" that will set it up, including previewing:
</P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/tips/fancyprint.vimrc.txt">fancyprint.vimrc.txt</a></tt></p>
<P>
Once you have this, simply use the ":ha" command; the output will be
displayed by "gv" (which, obviously, is required) which will also allow
you to print it.

<P>
[ My first 2-cent (2-pence) tip ]
</P>
<P>
If you have a computer like mine, where the CMOS
battery is shafted for whatever reason, you might find
that when you go to untar a tarball, you get a series
of messages like:
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>file.abc has modification time in the future.
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
Now although this isn't too much of a problem usually,
it <EM>can</EM> be if the tarball contains source-code that
you are going to compile, since "make" will usually
after trying, sit back and laugh at you saying:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>make ** error 1 ** clock scew
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
To circumvent this problem, you can append the "m"
switch when you are untarring your tarball. For
example:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>tar mxzf ./my_file.tar
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
Hope It's Useful

<BR>Asked by Rich Price 

<P><STRONG>
I am attempting to connect my new Samsung ML-1210 printer to my quite
old Linux server.  The server is running <A HREF="http://www.slackware.org/">Slackware</A> 7.1.
The server has no X libraries [I never loaded them] and, after I updated
ghostscript with the RPM supplied on Samsung's install disk, ghostscript
started failing with the following message.
</STRONG></P>
<Pre><STRONG>
gs: error in loading shared libraries: libXt.so.6: cannot open shared
object file: No such file or directory.
</STRONG></Pre>
<P><STRONG>
I am assuming that this library comes with X.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
You're correct; "Xt" is one of the core X libraries.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
While I could just find it
somewhere and try to figure out where to put it, I don't know what other
errors are hidden behind that one. [How many other libraries are also
missing?]
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Well, if you had an executable program that came with your RPM, you
could do "ldd &lt;program&gt;" to learn about its library dependencies;
however, I have no idea what Samsung's RPM contains (it may be a program
to which GS delegates the output, or another library, or...)
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I am willing to send anyone who is interested the RPM from the Samsung
install disk.  I didn't include it here to save bandwidth.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Why did applying this RPM make GS start failing?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
To be precise, GS itself isn't failing (at least so far as I can tell) -
the added "stuff" from the RPM is making a call to the non-existent
library, and that's what's failing.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Could the RPM be changed
to still drive the printer without needing X libraries?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Only if a) you're a programmer, b) know how to write drivers, and c)
have Samsung's (presumably proprietary) printer and software engine
protocols. In other words, no.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Is there a
working version of GS that comes with the Samsung ML-1210 driver out of
the box?  If so, where can I get it?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
It doesn't have anything to do with versions of GS. Winprinters, such as
the one you have, are missing a large chunk of circuitry which must be
emulated by a software "engine" (this is another Micr*s*ft attempt to
make the world proprietary - like winmodems.) Buying one is a bad idea
in the first place, although I'd imagine you didn't realize that -
you're paying for a real printer and getting a brainless shell that
sucks up a chunk of your CPU processing power for no good reason at all.
</P>
<P>
The 'gdi' driver is some well-meaning programmer's attempt to make these
things work under Linux. I'm sure it works for some people - but it
obviously requires at least the Xt library.
</P>
<P>
My suggestion, just in case you have this option open to you, is to
return this gadget to the vendor and demand a real printer - which is,
after all, what you've paid for. Failing that, you need to load whatever
libraries 'gdi' requires, and - you're absolutely right - there's
nothing that guarantees that it won't need other ones after Xt.
</P>

<FONT COLOR="navy">testing your procmail recipes</FONT></H3>
Tue, 30 Apr 2002 09:52:21 -0400
<BR>Benjamin A. Okopnik (<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net?subject=%20Re%3A%20%5BLG%2079%5D%202c%20Tips%20%238">The Answer Gang</a>)

<P>
When you initially set up your ".procmailrc", you're going to be
tweaking it for a while; getting rid of the first 99% of spam is easy,
the next .9% is somewhat tricky, and the next .09% is a fine art. 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
What that involves is adding recipes that block as broad of a selection
of spam as possible, without affecting your regular traffic; often, you
quickly cobble one up while looking at the spam itself - and that's the
right time to test it.
</P>
<P>
Using another xterm window, another console, or a shell escape (often
'!', as in Mutt, or perhaps a 'Ctrl-z' to suspend the current program),
create a file in your home directory - I actually keep a template called
"proc" there just for this - and enter the following:
</P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/tips/proc.procmail-recipe.txt">proc.procmail-recipe.txt</a></tt></p>
<P>
Note that the "mailbox" for a match here is "<TT>/dev/null</TT>"; in your actual
".procmailrc", you'd probably want to change that to your "spam" mailbox
</P>
<P>
- at least for a while - to make sure you're not tossing good mail.
</P>
<P>
Now, from your mail client, pipe the spam ('|' in Mutt) to the following
expression:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>procmail proc
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
where "proc" is the name of the file you've just created. If you've
matched it correctly, you should not get any output. Now, try the same
thing on one of your valid emails - and you should see it in its
entirety. Once satisfied, add the new recipe to your ".procmailrc".

<P>
Spammers often send or Cc: to a large list, and these are usually from
an archive of "confirmed" addresses - arranged in some order (usually by
host or username.) So, if you get an e-mail that's been sent to or has a
"Cc:" list with 5 identical users or hosts, that's pretty certainly a
bingo (I still send it to my "spam" box rather than bit-bucketing it,
just to make sure.)
</P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/tips/spammers-cc-too-many.procmail-recipe.txt">spammers-cc-too-many.procmail-recipe.txt</a></tt></p>
<P>
For those who are curious about the code: "formail" separates out the
specified headers' contents. Perl reads them in, ignoring newlines; gets
rid of everything except the addresses; creates a "frequency list" of
the usernames and hosts; sorts the list in numerical order and prints
out the highest count, which is tested against "greater than or equal to
5".
</P>
<P>
Please note that this is just a refinement to an existing ".procmailrc".
If you do not have "procmail" set up in the first place, I suggest
reading my "No More Spam!" article in LG#62:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
<A HREF="../issue62/okopnik.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/issue62/okopnik.html</A>
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
Note also that this may not work very well for you if you are on some
sort of an in-company Cc-list (rather than a list-manager type of
setup), unless you have a "whitelist" of the sort that I describe in my
article.

<P>
I recently switched ISPs and lost the multiple email addresses that the
old ISP provided; now, my wife and I are restricted to sharing a single
public email address. With fetchmail, I can retrieve our email from my
ISP's POP3 server and store it in my lan server for on-demand "offline"
reading, but with one email address, either my wife and I have to read
each other's mail, or one of us gets no mail at all.
</P>
<P>
I fixed this little problem with the judicious use of a procmail recipe
that uses a feature of email addresses to seperate mail destined for my
wife from mail destined for me. You see, although email addresses are
usually expressed in the form of
</P>

<blockquote><pre>  userid@host.domain
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
there is an alternate form that's a bit more readable:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>  John Q Public &lt;userid@host.domain&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
The leading plaintext name (called a 'nickname') is ignored by the mail
agents, but is treated as part of the email address for the purposes of
data entry and display.
</P>
<P>
This means that
</P>

<blockquote><pre>  Wifes Name &lt;lpitcher@sympatico.ca&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
and
</P>

<blockquote><pre>  Husbands Name &lt;lpitcher@sympatico.ca&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
are delivered to the same email address (<A HREF="mailto:lpitcher@sympatico.ca"
	>lpitcher@sympatico.ca</A>), but
carry slightly different (and testable) values in the email To: field.
</P>
<P>
This difference permits me to write a procmail recipe that will detect a
difference in the nickname and redirect any mail to "Wifes Name" into my
wife's local mail spool, while directing mail to "Husbands Name" into my
local mail spool. Additionally, mail addressed to "Husband and Wife" or
"Wife and Husband" can be duplicated into each of our mail spools.
</P>
<P>
The procmail recipe that does all this looks like...
</P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/tips/sharing-account.procmail-recipe.txt">sharing-account.procmail-recipe.txt</a></tt></p>
<P>
Of course, you can add as many users as you want nicknames to this, and
each user will (ultimately) only get the email addressed to them.
</P>

<blockquote>
Excellent tip, Lew! Well done. As a relevant additional tip, try the '+'
address hack: I haven't used it all that much, but it worked fine for
the few times when I did. Mail sent to "<tt>user+string@host</tt>" will be
delivered to "<tt>user@host</tt>", and the part after the '+' can be pretty much
anything you like (obviously, excluding whitespace and the '@'
character.) A friend of mine uses this as part of his spam reduction
policy: when he posts in a Net forum or newsgroup, he'll do something
like
</blockquote>

<blockquote><pre>joe+forum_name@hostname.com
</pre></blockquote>
<blockquote>
He can then route everything from there to a specific mailbox, and
can tell exactly where his address got harvested. When a given alias
gets too heavily spammed, he blocks it and uses another one.

<P>
Have you ever started a long download, left the computer to do its
thing, and come back to a message that says "Download timed out" - at
just a tiny fraction of the file size? Even with the "resume" feature of
"htget", "wget", etc., you've still got the whole thing to do over. How
can we get something to 'watch' our downloads, and restart them if they
fail?
</P>
<P>
In Linux, that capability is actually built right in. When programs
exit, they return an 'exit code' which indicates success or failure,
with most programmers using a sensible definition (i.e., "no, the
program didn't crash, but it didn't finish the download") for failure.
Given that, all we have to have is a tiny "wrapper" script that checks
the exit code, and restarts out process when we're done.

<P>
If I want to, for example, install "gimp" on my system, I know that the
download will take all night (I have a very slow wireless modem.) Since
I use <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>, I would normally type "apt-get install gimp"; instead, I'm
going to do
</P>

<blockquote><pre>persist apt-get install gimp
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
and walk away knowing that I'll have it by morning.
</P>
<P>
Be sure to check for immediate errors (such as "file not found", etc.)
though, or you'll be cycling errors all night long.

Hej Answer Gang,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I recently forwarded a problem to you that was very nicely solved.
I am very thankful and I also learned a lot. That problem was probably
not of much interest to the general reader of the Gazette, but that is not
up to me tu to judge. Gazette is a very nice forum, and I like it a lot.
Especially I like the "More 2 -Cent Tips" and "The Answer Gang".
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thank you all.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
In the name of all probably: no probs

<P><STRONG>
Well, disregarding the text above, I have a question that may be of
more general interest. (Have checked FAQ's and your index search,
but not found any obvious answers).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Have made my own icons (.xpm). No problem to make a X*Y one with a defined
background. Many  Linux .xpm icons,however, have the nice feature to "assert"
the wanted pixels only, leaving the background (what ever it is) untouched.
How to create or filter a X*Y .xpm file to achieve this feature ?
All tips welcome.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Well, I think you mean transparent, meaning the background shining
through, right? There is a special color defined. If you use this
color not that color is shown but rather none. Dunno what that color
is in hex, take a look at an icon that does it with an hex-editor,
that should do it

Hi,
</P>
<P>
Thank you for putting me on the right track.
I actually found out that the .xpm files are ASCII coded. I always
thought they were binaries.
</P>
<P>
Setting, for example, the background to white it would come out in
the .xpm file's color definition as (for 24 bits):
</P>

<blockquote><pre>"   c #FFFFFFFFFFFF"
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
Editing this line to:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>"   s None c None"
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
will do it. Perhaps not the most straight forward method, but it works.
</P>
<P>
Best regards
<BR>Hans.

<P><STRONG>
hi i am kinda new to linux. i am setting up a redhat 7.1 box and i can not
telnet into the box. i can ping it. i can telnet out from the box. when i
try it says connecting ( IP ADD) cannot open connection to host. it won't
even telnet to its self. i seen alot of help for 6.2 but not for 7.1 in 6.2
there is a file inet.d i think that it that you have to modify but 7.1 i
can't find it.?
thanx brian
</STRONG></P>
<blockquote>
In RH 7.x, they switched over to using xinetd instead of the old inetd.
You will now find a directory called <TT>/etc/xinetd.d.</TT> In there you will
find a file called "telnet" (and "ftp" and ...).  Open the file with
your favorite editor and change the line that reads "disable = no" to
"disable=yes".  Then restart xinetd with a "<TT>/sbin/service</TT> xinetd
restart" as the root user.
</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>
Actually you probably don't even have the telnet server daemon
installed. <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> (Good Distributor! pat pat) doesn't install
it by default anymore. Try
</strong></blockquote>

<blockquote><pre>rpm -q telnet-server
</pre></blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>
to see if you've got it. If not, install the package and follow Faber's
instructions above. -- Breen
</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>
However, you shouldn't be using telnet.  telent transmits passwords in
the clear (not encrypted) so people can find out what your password is
by "sniffing the wire".  Use ssh instead (assuming, of course, that you
installed the ssh server). -- Faber
</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>
Absolutely true. ssh is far superior. -- Breen
