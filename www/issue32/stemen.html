      Every tool I have found for Linux and other UNIX environments seems to
      be designed primarily to backup files to tape or any device that can
      be used for streaming backups.  Often this method of backing up is
      infeasible, especially on small budgets.  This led to the development
      of bu, a tool for backing up by mirroring the files on another file
      system.  bu is not necessarily meant as a replacement for the other
      tools (although I have set up our entire disaster recovery system
      based on it for our development servers), but more commonly as a
      supplement to a tape backup system.  The approach I discuss below is a
      way to manage your backups much more efficiently and stay better
      backed up without spending so much money.

        <h4>* Some problems I have found with streaming backups</h4>
        <dd>
          <dl>
            1. The prices and storage capacities often make it infeasible.
            <dd><br>
              The sizes of hard drives and the amount of data stored on an
              average server or even workstation is growing faster than the
              capacity of the lower end tape drives that are affordable to
              the individual or small business.  5 and 8 gig hard drives are
              cheap and common place now and the latest drives go up to at
              least 11 gig.  However, the most common tape drives are only a
              few gig.  Higher capacity/performance tape drives are
              available but the costs are out of the range of all but the
              larger companies.
              <br><br>
              For example:<br>
              Staying properly backing up with 30GB of data (which can be
              just 3 or 4 hard drives) to a midrange tape drive, can cost
              $15,000 to $25,000 or more inside of just 2 to 4 years. There
              is a typical cost scenario on
              <a href="http://www.exabyte.com/home/press.html">
              http://www.exabyte.com/home/press.html</a>.
              <br><br>
              This is just the cost for the drive and tapes.  It does not
              include the cost of time and labor to manage the backup system.
              I discuss that more below.  With that in mind, the comments I
              make on reliability, etc, in the rest of this article are based
              on my experience with lower end drives.  I haven't had thousands
              of extra dollars to throw around to try the higher end drives.
              <br><br>
          </dl>
          
          <dl>
            2. The cost of squandered sys admin time and the lost productivity
            of users or developers waiting for lost files to be restored, can
            get much more expensive than buying extra hard drives.
            <dd><br>
              To backup or restore several gig of data to/from a tape can take
              up to several hours.  The same goes for trying to restore a
              single file that is near the end of the tape.  I can't tell you
              how frustrating it is to wait a couple of hours to restore a
              lost file only to discover you made some minor typo in the
              filename or the path to the file so it didn't find it and you
              have to start all over.  Also, if you are backing up many gig of
              data, and you want to be fully backed up every day, you either
              have to keep a close eye on it and change tapes several times
              throughout the day, every day, or do that periodically and do
              incremental backups onto a single tape the rest of the days.
              With tapes, the incremental approach has other problems, which
              leads me to number 3.
              <br><br>
          </dl>
        
          <dl>
            3. Incremental backups to tape can be expensive, undependable
            and time consuming to restore.
            <dd><br>
              First, this kind of backup system can consume a lot of time
              labeling, and tracking tapes to keep track of the dates and
              which ones are incremental and which ones are full backups, etc.
              Also, if you do incremental backups throughout a week, for
              example, and then have to restore a crashed machine, you can
              easily consume up to an entire day restoring from all the tapes
              in sequence in order to restore all the data back the way it
              was.  Then you have Murphy to deal with.  I'm sure everybody is
              familiar with Murphy's laws.  When you need it most, it will
              fail.  My experience with tapes has revealed a very high failure
              rate.  Probably 20 or 30% of the tapes I have tried to restore
              on various types of tape drives have failed because of one
              problem or another.  This includes our current 2GB DAT drive.
              Bad tape, dirty heads when it was recored, who knows.  To
              restore from a sequence of tapes of an incremental backup, you
              are dependent on all the tapes in the sequence being good.  Your
              chances of a failure are very high.  You can decrease your
              chance of failure, of course, by verifying the tape after each
              backup but then you double your backup time which is already to
              long in many cases.

        <h4>* A solution (The history of the bu utility)</h4>
        <dd>
          With all the problems I described above, I found that, like most
          other people I know, it was so inconvenient to back up that I
          never stayed adequately backed up, and have payed the price a time
          or two.  So I set up file system space on one of our servers and
          periodically backed up my file systems over nfs just using cp.
          This way I would always be backed up to another machine if mine
          went down and I could quickly backup just one or a few files
          without having to mess with the time and cost of tapes.  This
          still wasn't enough.  There were still times I was in a hurry and
          didn't want to spend the time making sure my backup file system
          was NFS mounted, verifying the pathname to it, etc, before doing
          the copy.  Manually dealing with symbolic links also was
          cumbersome.  If I specified a file to copy that was a symbolic
          link, I didn't want it to follow the link and copy it to the same
          location on the backup file system as the link.  I wanted it to
          copy the real file it points to with it's path so that the backup
          file system was just like the original.  I also wanted other
          sophisticated features of an incremental backup system without
          having to use tapes.  So, I wrote bu.  bu intelligently handles
          symbolic links, can do incremental backups on a per directory
          basis with the ability to configure what files or directories
          should be included and excluded, has a verbose mode, and keeps log
          files.  Pretty much everything you would expect from a fairly
          sophisticated tape backup tool (except a GUI interface :-) but is
          a fairly small and straight forward shell script.

        <h4>* Backup strategy</h4>
        <dd>
          Using bu to backup to another machine may or may not be a good
          replacement for a tape backup system for others as it has for us,
          but it is an excellent supplement.  When you have done a lot of
          work and have to wait hours or even days until the next scheduled
          tape backup, you are at the mercy of Murphy until that time, then
          you cross your fingers and hope the tape is good.  To me, it is a
          great convenience and a big relief to just say "bu src" to do an
          incremental backup of my whole src directory and know I
          immediately have an extra copy of my work if something goes wrong.
          <br><br>
          It is much easier and faster to restore a whole file system over
          NFS than it is from a tape.  This includes root (at least with
          Linux).  And, it is vastly faster and easier to restore just one
          file or directory just using the cp command.
          <br><br>
          So far as cost: You can get extra 6GB hard drives now for less
          than $200 dollars.  In fact I can buy a whole new computer with
          extra hard drives to use as a backup server for $1000 or less now.
          Much less than the cost of buying just a mid to high end tape
          drive, not counting the cost of all the tapes and extra time spent
          managing them.  In fact, one of the beauties of Linux is, even
          your old 386 or 486 boat anchors make nice file servers for such
          things as backups.
          <br><br> For those individuals and small businesses who use zip
          drives and jaz drives for backing up so they can have multiple
          copies or take them off site, bu is also perfect, since
          incremental backups can be done to any file system.  I often use
          it to back up to floppies to take my most critical data and recent
          work off site.
          <br><br>
          Here is an interesting strategy we have come up with using bu that
          is the least expensive way to stay backed up we could come up with
          for our environment.  It is the backup strategy we are setting up
          for our development machines which house several GB of data.  Use
          bu to backup daily and right after doing work, to file systems
          that are no more than 650 mb.  Then, once or twice a month, cut
          worm CD's from those file systems to take off site.  WORM CD's are
          only about a dollar each in quantities of 100, and CD WORM writers
          have gotten cheap.  This way your backups are on media that
          doesn't decay like tapes and floppies tend to do.  Re-writable
          CD's are also an option if you don't mind spending a bit more
          money.  If you have just too much data for that to be practical,
          hard drives are cheap enough now that it is feasible to have extra
          hard drives and rotate them off site.  It is nice to have one of
          those drive bays that allow you to un-plug the drive from the
          front of the machine if you take this approach.  Where bu will
          really shine with large amounts of data, is when we finally can
          get re-writable DVD drives with cheap media.  I think, in the
          future, with re-writable DVD or other similar media on the
          horizon, doing backups to non-random access devices such as tape
          will become obsolete and other backup tools will likely follow the
          bu approach anyway.
