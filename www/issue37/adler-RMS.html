The man himself, Richard Stallman. Was was going through his
introductory comments at the time I took this picture. Within about
5 minutes after this shot, the room was filled with passioned
arguments about free software. I think the English term free, will
haunt Richard and the GNU project for some time. The English term free
has two meanings, 0 cost and liberty. In other languages, like Spanish,
this confusion does not exist since the terms for 0 cost free and
liberty free each have their own words. But, this confusion does help
fuel the passion of Free Software discussions through the English
speaking populations of the world.
