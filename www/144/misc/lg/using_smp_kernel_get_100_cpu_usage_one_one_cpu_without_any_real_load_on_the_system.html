Hi I'm on a P4 running an smp kernel ie.
</p>

<p>
uname -a :
 
Linux jims-laptop 2.6.20-16-386 #2 Sun Sep 23 19:47:10 UTC 2007 i686
GNU/Linux
</p>

<p>
For some reason occasionaly one of my cpu's runs away and starts showing
100% cpu usage, however top only shows the program using the most cpu at
7% or less. Where is that 93% going? This is driving me crazy. I have to
reboot the machine to get it back to normal. I've tried Fedora and
Kubuntu. Though Kubuntu appeared more stable it still happened. Played
around with changing max_cstate without success.I've just downgraded to
a 386 kernel to see if that helps. This isn't a real solution however.
Do you have any suggestions? I've asked around on forums and irc
channels without luck. Thanks.
Jim

<p>
Looking at /proc/cpuinfo, sounds like you have P4 with hyperthread 
enabled, true? If so, this 7% max of CPU usage, is it only on one core 
or cumulative load over all cores?
</p>

<pre>

&gt;   
</pre>
My simple suggestion right now: please download latest stable kernel 
from kernel.org and compile by yourself. There is a chance you hit a 
(unknown?) kernel scheduler bug. Or it could be a power management 
problem (is it a mobile processor?).
</p>

<p>
Since I am not really knowledgeable in this field, try to fiddle with 
options during kernel configuration such as ACPI, APM, APIC support and 
so on.
</p>


<p>
let's see if that will cure your problem.

One of the things that might be worth trying is reducing everything to a
minimum and seeing if it still happens. That is, try booting into single
mode and shutting down any non-critical processes, then just letting the
system "cook" for a little while. If it happens again, you've most
likely narrowed it down to either a) the kernel or b) the hardware. For
troubleshooting the former, check out the kernel compilation options (I
seem to recall a developer/debugging option accessible via 'make
config'.) For the latter, try a hairdryer aimed at the offending CPU. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Yes, and quite often the other main offender is choosing a wrong arch
type for your system.  That'll cause quite often either a high CPU
load or massive amounts of disk access.  In addition, specifying:

Hello, Jim!

<p>
Well, if you run a SMP kernel the output is usually something like this:
</p>

<p>
Linux nightfall 2.6.22.9 #1 SMP PREEMPT Tue Oct 2 22:02:38 CEST 2007
x86_64 GNU/Linux
</p>

<p>
uname shows a "SMP" next to the version. Double check if your kernel has
activated SMP code. Your output of /proc/cpuinfo only shows one
processor. You should have two (indicated by a different ID next to the
field "processor").
</p>

<p>
It should be noted that although some P4 CPUs have hyperthreading not
all mainboards or BIOS variants support it. I've seen P4s not capable of
hyperthreading simply because of the hardware or the BIOS on the board.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; For some reason occasionaly one of my cpu's runs away and starts showing
&gt; 100% cpu usage, however top only shows the program using the most cpu at
&gt; 7% or less. Where is that 93% going? This is driving me crazy.
</pre>

<p>
Does the system become unresponsive or sluggish?
</p>

<p>
Can you check if "top" shows any distribution of the load? My top and
procinfo tools also show what the load is like, such as IRQ activity,
waiting for I/O or other things. This is an output of procinfo on my
SMP system (Intel Core 2 Duo):
</p>

<p>
There's user, nice, system, IOwait, the IRQ modes and idle time. And
yes, now I see that procinfo also counts the CPUs by printing "2CPU". <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
Using "x86info -v" is yet another way of checking SMP mode and CPU
capabilities.

<p>
top also reports kernel, idle, user  and a few others...
</p>

<p>
Are you 100% user?  Is the system sluggish?
</p>

<p>
What type of load average are you seeing?
</p>

<p>
Also, if you're SMP there's an option in top to display each CPU (in recent procps tops, type 1).
</p>

<p>
[tops a lovely program -- there's been so many flavors since Bill Lefebvre version -- all slightly different...
</p>

<p>
Have you also run other load monitors as a sanity check?

I tried switching into Single User Mode once the 1 processor jumped to
100% but it didn't seem to change anything. I've tried unloading some
modules but I keep getting Resource currently unavailable after running
rmmod. Do you know what this would mean in this context? This glitch is
hard to track down because sometimes it doesn't happen for a day or so
after I've rebooted.

Any idea what it could mean??
Thanks again for the help.

&gt; &gt; Hi I'm on a P4 running an smp kernel ie.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; uname -a :
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Linux jims-laptop 2.6.20-16-386 #2 Sun Sep 23 19:47:10 UTC 2007 i686
&gt; &gt; GNU/Linux
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For some reason occasionaly one of my cpu's runs away and starts showing
&gt; &gt; 100% cpu usage, however top only shows the program using the most cpu at
&gt; &gt; 7% or less. Where is that 93% going? This is driving me crazy. I have to
&gt; &gt; reboot the machine to get it back to normal. I've tried Fedora and
&gt; &gt; Kubuntu. Though Kubuntu appeared more stable it still happened. Played
&gt; &gt; around with changing max_cstate without success.I've just downgraded to
&gt; &gt; a 386 kernel to see if that helps. This isn't a real solution however.
&gt; &gt; Do you have any suggestions? I've asked around on forums and irc
&gt; &gt; channels without luck. Thanks.
&gt; &gt; Jim
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; output of cat /proc/cpuinfo :
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; top also reports kernel, idle, user  and a few others...
&gt; 
&gt; Are you 100% user?  Is the system sluggish?
</pre>
Yes I am the only user and the system is very sluggish.
</p>

<pre>
&gt; 
&gt; What type of load average are you seeing?
</pre>
I see 100% on one cpu and 7% or so on the other. In terms of overall
load, I'll check again next time the sytem goes crazy.
</p>

<pre>
&gt; 
&gt; Also, if you're SMP there's an option in top to display each CPU (in recent procps tops, type 1).
</pre>
Yes I see that now , thanks. I had been using htops which shows both
cpus automatically. I didn't know about entering 1 in top to get both
cpus. Thanks.
Jim.
</p>

<pre>
&gt; 
&gt; Have you also run other load monitors as a sanity check?
</pre>
Just htops but I can tell as soon as it happens because everything
crawls along including closing down the system.
</p>

&gt; One of the things that might be worth trying is reducing everything to a
&gt; minimum and seeing if it still happens. That is, try booting into single
&gt; mode and shutting down any non-critical processes, then just letting the
&gt; system "cook" for a little while. If it happens again, you've most
&gt; likely narrowed it down to either a) the kernel or b) the hardware. For
&gt; troubleshooting the former, check out the kernel compilation options (I
&gt; seem to recall a developer/debugging option accessible via 'make
&gt; config'.) For the latter, try a hairdryer aimed at the offending CPU. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
&gt;
&gt;   
</pre>
I've seen this behaviour before in combination with run-away acpi
processes (acpid and friends)
My own laptop (a dell D810 with a dual-core with Hyperthreading) shows
the same behaviour if I try to hot-(un)dock it from it's docking station

&gt; I tried switching into Single User Mode once the 1 processor jumped to
&gt; 100% but it didn't seem to change anything. 
</pre>

<p>
You need to go single-user <em>before</em> it happens. That way, you'll know if
it's some program that you're running when you're not in single-user,
which is the valuable piece of info here.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I've tried unloading some
&gt; modules but I keep getting Resource currently unavailable after running
&gt; rmmod. 
</pre>

<p>
Sounds like your process table got filled up - that's when I've seen
that kind of message.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Do you know what this would mean in this context? This glitch is
&gt; hard to track down because sometimes it doesn't happen for a day or so
&gt; after I've rebooted.
</pre>

<p>
Unfortunately, this kind of problem usually breaks down to one of two
possibilities:
</p>

<p>
1) You're just Joe Average-User, messing around at home and trying to
learn something. Because of this, you have the leisure to experiment as
I suggested, so you spend several days twiddling and fiddling, and you
discover a kernel bug that earns you world-wide recognition, undying
fame, and a bouquet of roses from Linus Torvalds (*NOW* you'll be able
to get all the girls!)
</p>

<p>
2) You work in the corporate environment, and your company hasn't quite
yet spent the money on the spares that you've been begging them to get
for years. You curse them, curse the damn computers, and start madly
swapping hardware and kernels until it sorta kinda works (i.e., no
crashes in a 24-hour period), and forget all about it until the next
problem comes along.
</p>

<p>
Or there's always whatever intermediate version of these that you come
up with for yourself. Take your pick. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Hi Jim...
</p>

<p>
I am sorry for this late reply...
</p>

<pre>
&gt; No it is only on one core.
&gt;   
</pre>
OK, I think you hit a classic Linux kernel "bug". Not a bug in its true 
meaning, but the inability of Linux kernel to recognize the specific 
nature of Hyperthread processor. AFAIK, HT is not like multi core CPU. 
You have one true core and a "sibling". This sibling is actually 
like...uhm can't find the right word...ok..let's just say a "dummy" 
processor. It's like additional pipelines but isn't really a complete 
processor.  But in Linux kernel's point of view, the real core and the 
sibling are identical.
</p>

<p>
This brings one implication. During load balancing between real core and 
the sibling, sometimes Linux kernel brings heavy jobs to the sibling 
instead of toward the real core (the powerful one). I don't know if the 
recent kernel release has already fix this "bug", so you are free to test.
</p>

<p>
Or, if you're really desperate, try to stick with non SMP kernel. That 
way, your tasks will always get assigned to the real core, abandoning 
the weak sibling.
</p>

<p>
I hope this clears up your confusion.
</p>

<p>
