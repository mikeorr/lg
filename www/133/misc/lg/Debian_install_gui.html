&gt; There was a thread running a while ago about the alleged difficulty of
&gt; installing Debian, and much was mode of the lack of a GUI installer. 
&gt; 
&gt; Actually it does exist, and has for a while. It has been updated for
&gt; the Etch RC1, but its a bit of a secret. If you burn the install iso
&gt; and boot, it looks the same as it always has, but if you type
&gt; installgui instead of just hitting enter you get the new install
&gt; interface. 
&gt; 
&gt; Its a direct mapping of the old dialogue, so if you expect it to hook
&gt; gparted to help with partitioning, get used to disappointment. The
&gt; only significant difference, so far, is that it does sometimes ask
&gt; multiple questions on one page - e.g. for password verification.
</pre>

This illustrates yet again that, when less-technical users say "your
Linux distribution needs [foo]", they often mean something else entirely
-- or aren't really sure what they mean -- and have a bizarre tendency
to express themselves using code phrases.
</p>

<p>
That is, the code phrase "GUI installer" in this context usually turns
out to really have very little to do with graphics.  The speaker really
means "I want an OS installer that asks me very, very few questions and
does extensive hardware autoprobing."  I.e., (they believe) they want
completely automated installers, or as close as possible.
</p>


<p>
Old-timers may recall the antique debate point used by MS-Windows and
Macintoy OS users for years:  "Linux needs more applications."  After
hearing this for many years, I sat down with one of them, a longtime
Windows user, at a Linux desktop box and typed:
<pre>
$ grep Package: /var/lib/apt/lists/*Packages | wc -l
</pre>
I pointed out that the return value of 17,511 was the number of
currently available software packages, in that distribution.  Mr.
Windows said:  "Um, desktop productivity software, I mean."  So, I
showed the guy a list of the roughly dozen different full "office"
suites that were then available for x86 Linux systems.
<pre>
RM:  A dozen.  How many are enough office suites?  Two dozen?  A hundred?
Mr. Windows:  Well, I <em>thought</em> there weren't any at all.
RM:  And <em>why</em> did you think that?
Mr. Windows:  Well, I looked on the shelves in my corner software store.
RM:  So, because you can't conceive of getting software any other way
     than in a separate, extra-cost retail package, you simply 
     <em>assumed</em> that Linux "needs more applications".  By the way,
     how many office suites do <em>you</em> use?
Mr. Windows:  {face turning red}  One.

&gt; Imagine if the corner shop sold copies of OpenOffice (and other open
&gt; source packages), in a good looking boxes for $100+ each.
&gt; 
&gt; Users would realize that Linux software exists, the corner shop would
&gt; get a generous profit for each sale, and the users wouldn't know any
&gt; better.

Funny you should mention that.  Around 1995-6 I think it was, I heard a
guest speaker at CalLUG (University of California at Berkeley LUG) from
a little company, a Novell spin-off, called Caldera Systems.  While
still an internal project (the "Corsair Project") at Novell under the
late Ray Noorda, they had surveyed Novell customers about the
possibility of Novell backing a desktop corporate operating system
platform, that could take the place of MS-Windows.  Among the options
discussed was a desktop platform based on Linux -- but the customer
business executives seemed oddly uneasy about that.  So, Novell asked
them why.
</p>

<p>
The presenter, a straight-arrow fellow who gave every appearance of being
a Mormon farm boy, deadpanned, "They told us they weren't comfortable
with the idea of a free operating system.  So, we offered to sell it to
them."
</p>

<p>
Gee, I wonder whatever became of Caldera?  ;-&gt;
