<p>
A little while back I bought a cheap HP desktop and today I decided to put a 
2nd hard disk in. This is when I found that, although the spec sheet tells 
you you have a spare 3.5 in hard disk bay, it doesn't tell you that there are 
only 2 SATA connectors on the board and they are both in use! The PCB has 
spaces for 4 SATA connectors, but only 2 have been connected up, although 
bizarrely they have put in an IDE connector and a floppy connector.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, I have a spare SATA controller, so I can still get the disk in. 
Unfortunately, when I boot Debian the disk order gets swapped, so GRUB sees 
the original disk as disk 1, but Debian sees it as disk 2. The upshot is that 
it refuses to boot, as it can not mount the root partition. Interestingly 
Knoppix still sees them in the expected order.
</p>

<p>
Using partition labels in /etc/fstab isn't a solution because it can't 
actually find /etc/fstab.
</p>

<p>
I have a temporary workaround, as I have swapped the DVD SATA connection to 
the second hard disk, so both are connected from the motherboard. This has 
the advantage that they are mounted in a predictable order, but the 
disadvantage is that I no longer have the option of booting from CDROM, 
without swapping the cables back.
</p>

<p>
Does anyone know how the disk order is determined and is there any way to 
force Debian to put the disks connected from the Motherboard ahead of those 
connected from the additional SATA controller?

You can often enforce the ordering through the BIOS, since this is what GRUB
uses.  You can issue something at the GRUB prompt too, to tell it what the
root partition is for the specific drive, but I forget what.

Try using map in your menu.lst assuming you can see the drive 
where it is.

I don't think the BIOS helps because the problem isn't the ordering in GRUB, 
it's the ordering in the kernel and that's different from the ordering in 
GRUB. Also I'm not sure how the BIOS interacts with a separate controller. 
</p>

<p>
Thinking about it some more, I think I just need to change root=/dev/sda2 to 
root=/dev/sdb2 and as long as the ordering doesn't change, It'll be OK. Time 
for some more experimentation.

You have run into the "persistent device naming" problem.
IRST this has been discussed in TAG before.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, my own solution is to use the disks under lvm (Debian package
"lvm2"). Since the boot process scans <strong>all</strong> volume groups a root
device like /dev/vg/root always works whether it is based in
/dev/sda2 or /dev/sdb2.

<p>
There is till the grub problem for which I don't really know a
solution --- perhaps pupa (grub2) has a solution.

You may be able to do something with the "map" and "find" commands
for "grub" but currently the menu file does not seem to have branching.

I've decided that a hardware solution is best. I considered 
<a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=260184741633&amp;ssPageName=_RSCC_Pr4_PcY_BIN_IT">http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=260184741633&amp;ssPageName=_RSCC_Pr4_PcY_BIN_IT</a> 
but do I really need 0.36TB of disk installed? I don't think so, at least not 
yet, so something like 
<a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/3-5-SATA-PC-USB-External-Hard-Drive-Hdd-ENCLOSURE-Case_W0QQitemZ220183997193QQihZ012QQcategoryZ86758QQssPageNameZWDVWQQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem">http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/3-5-SATA-PC-USB-External-Hard-Drive-Hdd-ENCLOSURE-Case_W0QQitemZ220183997193QQihZ012QQcategoryZ86758QQssPageNameZWDVWQQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem</a> 
will probably be ideal, as it makes my spare disk a portable backup and data 
transfer solution.

Good thought, Neil. I often find that a difficult and complicated
software solution can be circumvented with a simple hardware solution -
and I think that a lot of people lose track of that option.

Of course you do! Or at least you will. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> Waiting until you <em>really</em>
need it, however, lowers the price drastically - see Moore's Law.
