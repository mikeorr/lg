<h1>How to Start a Linux User Group</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/crosby.html">Dafydd Crosby</a></b></p>


<p>
The Linux User Group (also known as a LUG) has been one of the
cornerstones of Linux advocacy ever since its first inception. Bringing
together local Linux lovers, it is the grassroots of Linux - where
neighbours and other townfolks can sit around a table and discuss the best
way to compile the kernel for their machines, or how to get their Slackware
network devices going again. It is also a high bandwidth way to share
knowledge - if you've ever heard of the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet">sneaker-net</a>, you'll
appreciate the advantages of being in a room full of real people who share
your interest in open-source software. 
</p>

<p>
Chances are good that you are already in an area that has a local LUG,
and a simple search online should be able to confirm it. However, if you happen
to be in an area where none currently exists, the process of actually
setting up a group is very easy.<a id="crosby.html_1_back"></a><a href="#crosby.html_1">[1]</a>
</p>

<h3>Setting up a group</h3>

<p>
Your group will be ready to go once you've got a basic framework in place:


<ul> 

<li><strong>A Web site</strong> - This part is easier to do
than ever before. <a href="http://www.linux.com">Linux.com</a> allows you
to set up a group page in a simple, straight-forward fashion. It's a lot
like a social network, so other members can easily join and keep informed
of events.</li> 

<li><strong>A mailing list</strong> - This is the pulse of
your group, where interested people can ask questions and swap info. With a
simple mailing list, you can coordinate your efforts with other group
members, discuss future meeting ideas, and keep the blood flowing in the
group.</li> 

<li><strong>A meeting spot</strong> - Find a spot (preferably a
public one) that is quiet enough to allow speakers and presentations, but
large enough to hold however large your group is. Location is key! Some
good spots that are often free (or very cheap) are schools and university
campuses. You'll want an Internet connection and power sockets, so keep
that in mind when looking for a place.</li> 

</ul>
</p>

<p>
The first two items shouldn't take longer than a couple of hours to set
up, and will only need minimal maintenance after that. The meeting spot
will take a little longer, but, with the collective effort of your group
(communicating through the mailing list) it shouldn't be too difficult.
</p>

<p>
Now it's just a matter of getting a few people interested. It's alright
if the first members are your friends - that's how the ball gets rolling!
The LUG will take on a life of its own, once you have outsiders coming in,
so find ways of getting the word out around town. Postering universities
and cafes (be sure to ask permission) is a great way to get other
like-minded folks to check out your Web site and meetings. 
</p>

<h3>Having fun and keeping the LUG interesting</h3>

<p>
Keeping things interesting isn't something that is easily done
spontaneously, so you'll want to keep note of ideas for presentations and
events for future use. It's essential to keep the creative pump primed,
otherwise it will be hard keeping members coming to meetings. 
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, your members will be a great resource in letting you know
what they're interested in - after all, they want to have fun, too! When
someone is bursting with passion over the new distro he or she just installed,
that enthusiasm can be infectious. Encourage this passion, because these
people will help keep the group moving along. 
</p>

<p>
Occasionally, there's the meeting where a talk or the scheduling has
fallen through. This is a great time to be generating ideas and keeping
those creative juices flowing. Keeping the meet-ups consistently fun and
engaging will keep everyone showing up time and time again. 
</p>

<h3>Reaching out to the community</h3>

<p>
The greatest benefits of a LUG is what it can do for the local community.
It can be donating Linux-loaded machines to non-profit groups, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_User_Group#Installfests">install-fests</a>
to help people start using Linux, or connecting people from different
technology groups who wouldn't normally interact. 
</p>

<p>
One of the beauties of Linux and F/OSS software is that there are many
ways that people from different technology backgrounds and groups can
contribute. Java programmers, hardware hackers, and theoretical scientists
can all sit at the same table and meet common ground at a LUG, when given a
good topic to think over. Therefore, keep connected with all the local
groups which could potentially have a few Linux users (or future Linux
users). 
</p>

<h3>The long road ahead</h3>

<p>
A lot of groups get side-tracked by things like dues, group bylaws, and
other organizational structures that are necessary to keep the group viable
year-to-year. Transparency is key, but don't let the meetings get bogged
down in administrative matters - keep it short, keep it simple, and keep it
civil. If an issue can be relegated to the mailing list, that's the best
spot for it. That way everyone has a chance to speak up, and it's all
available on the public record. 
</p>

<p>
Starting a LUG is a rewarding experience, and can be a great experience
for everyone involved. With so many successful groups running now, it has
never been easier to start your own, so start organizing one today!

My rule of thumb in the LUG HOWTO, and <a
href="http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Linux_PR/newlug.html">other writings</a> 
on the subject, is that a successful LUG seems to need a core of at least
four active members -- who need not be particularly knowledgeable.  
As you say, not a lot else is strictly necesssary.
