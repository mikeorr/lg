While I am not a big time web developer or graphics enthusiast, I
found <i>Programming Web Graphics</i> to be very interesting reading. The
book begins with a down-to-earth explanation of graphics and file
formats. From there, it goes into how web servers serve the files and
reviews the free libraries available to develop graphics. The details of
the libraries may not be everyone's cup of tea, but understanding
what they can do helps with understanding how browsers and other utilities
can benefit you.
<p>
The graphic programming tools are not for the rookie Perl hacker,
but are explained in reasonable detail that anyone with some experience
in Perl can learn to use the available free tools.
<p>
The exciting part of writing programs to do graphics on the Web is
dynamic techniques. <i>PWG</i> covers image maps and animated GIFs, and
includes techniques on how to roll your own tools, such as web counters,
web cams and thumbnailing groups of images.
<p>
It is refreshing to see a book that does not ignore the non-graphical web
user, and reviews the good and bad of writing browser-specific web pages.
<p>
Overall this is a great book for understanding some of the more advanced
techniques and as a tool book for generating ideas and methods of your
own. If you are looking for a ``how-to'', hands-on tutorial,
for the un-initiated non-Perl coder, keep looking.
