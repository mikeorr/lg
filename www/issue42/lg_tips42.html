IP address in Linux Gazette

Date: Wed, 5 May 1999 08:39:07 -0400<BR> 
From: "F. D. Jones", <A HREF="mailto:mrj@magicnet.net">mrj@magicnet.net</A> 
<P>
	FYI, the current implementaion of pppd automatically runs the
script /etc/ppp/ip-up when the ppp connetion is established.  One of
the variables created in the script is $IPLOCAL which is your assigned
ip address.  No perl or awk required, and it's reliable because it's
reported by the daemon handling your ppp!  There are a few other
conditional  scripts invoked by pppd, also.  Check them out.
<P>
   From the man page for pppd:
<P>
SCRIPTS
       Pppd invokes scripts at various stages in its processing which can be used  to  perform
       site-specific ancillary processing.  These scripts are usually shell scripts, but could
       be executable code files instead.  Pppd does not wait for the scripts to  finish.   The
       scripts  are  executed  as root (with the real and effective user-id set to 0), so that
       they can do things such as update routing tables or run privileged daemons.  Be careful
       that the contents of these scripts do not compromise your system's security.  Pppd runs
       the scripts with standard input, output and error redirected to /dev/null, and with  an
       environment  that  is empty except for some environment variables that give information
       about the link.  The environment variables that pppd sets are:
<P>
       DEVICE The name of the serial tty device being used.
<P>
       IFNAME The name of the network interface being used.
<P>
       IPLOCAL
              The IP address for the local end of the link.  This is only set  when  IPCP  has
              come up.
<P>
       IPREMOTE
              The  IP  address for the remote end of the link.  This is only set when IPCP has
              come up.
<P>
       PEERNAME
              The authenticated name of the peer.  This is only set if the peer  authenticates
              itself.
<P>
       SPEED  The baud rate of the tty device.
<P>
       UID    The real user-id of the user who invoked pppd.
<P>
       Pppd  invokes  the  following scripts, if they exist.  It is not an error if they don't
       exist.

This shuts up or quietens noisy modems during dialup. recall the following 
AT commands.
<P>
controls speaker volume:
<ul>
<li>L0      low volume.
<li>L1      low volume.
<li>L2      medium volume (default).
<li>L3      high volume.
</ul>
<P>
operates speaker:
<ul>
<li>M0      speaker always off.
<li>M1      speaker on until connect (default).
<li>M2      speaker always on.
<li>M3      speaker on after dial, until connect.
</ul>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Z       resets modem
<li>DT      tone dials specified phone number.
</ul>
<P>
you now have to modify the expect-send pairs in your chat script. note that 
the above commands should be prefixed by AT. the following chat script turns 
off the modem speaker.
<PRE>
/usr/sbin/chat                                     \
   ABORT           '\nBUSY\r'                      \
   ABORT           '\nNO ANSWER\r'                 \
   ABORT           '\nRINGING\r\n\r\nRINGING\r'    \
   ''              ATZ                             \
   'OK'            ATM0                            \
   'OK'            ATDT1234567                     \
   CONNECT         ''                              \
   ogin:--ogin:    mylogin                         \
   assword?        mypassword
</PRE>
after specifying the ABORT strings, the sequence will first expect nothing; 
and then send the string ATZ to reset the modem. the expected response to 
this is the string OK, after which the string of ATM0 is sent to turn off 
the modem speaker. when it receives OK, the phone number 1234567 is dialed 
out, after which the login procedure begins.
<P>
to vary the speaker's volume, just suitably modify the expect-send pairs 
before the ATDT command, eg. replacing ATM0 by ATL0 uses low volume for the 
speaker.

if [ -z $1 ]; then
    echo "You must specify a network interface."

I'll try to keep this short enough to stay at the Two Cent Tips level :)
<P>
'zip and 'unzip' are the Linux tools to deal with .ZIP files.  According
to the 
man page, it's been around since 1990, so it predates Linux itself by
several 
years, it exists on other UNIX and UNIX-like systems too.  (And it's
been ported 
to MSwin - see <A HREF="http://www.itribe.net/virtunix/">http://www.itribe.net/virtunix/</A> for an unzipper that
handles long 
names and fixes line ends.)  
<P>
At any rate, I can see your point -- MSwin users are used to finding
apps and 
documentation wrapped in .ZIP files, but true newvies don't know what a
.TGZ is, 
and assume it's useless to them.
<P>
It's not. tough!  WinZIP (<A HREF="http://www.winzip.com/">http://www.winzip.com/</A>) handles tar-gzipped
files
with no hassle whatsoever.  I have two laptops, one w95 and one Linux -
and with
these two utilities I really don't have to think about file formats when
I toss
archives back and forth.

You can Download the text or HTML files and untar them with WinZip. Winzip

I know of at least one program that will read Linux files from your
Windows 95 operating system.  It is called "explore2fs.exe."  It is
about 486K long, and is self contained, if I recall correctly.  I know
it is a long note, but I have copied the author's Readme.txt file
below.  The author, John Newbigin, is from Australia.  The program
opens an explorer like window showing your Linux file systems, ie.,
/dev/hda5, /dev/hdb6, or whatever.  You can read most files, if I
recall correctly.  I also use a program called Windows Commander, by
Deiter Prissing, I believe, in Germany.  It may be that program that
enables me to read individual files, but it is John's program that
makes it possible to read and scan the Linux file systems.

Try running the a.out binary with the command line:

I recently installed RedHat 5.2 and found that its $PATH statement
does not include a path of " ./: "
./ is the path of the current directory that you are in.
Remarkably, RedHat does not set up paths so that your current path is
looked at to execute a file.

You should probably install a different C development package. Most
distributions have two available: one for a.out and one for ELF
binaries. Install the package that makes ELF binaries. 
<P>
If you want to run the a.out binaries, you have to have support for
that in the kernel. Either compiled in or as a module (binfmt_aout).

I do not think you can mount an ftp site directly.

But you might want to check if the FTP site also supports NFS (Network

Dear Pepijn,
<P>Just recently, my roomate and I installed RH5.2 and NT/4.0 on the same
machine and had a problem very similar to the one you describe.&nbsp; The
network card used was a 3C509b that had been in an 486 running RH5.0 and
was known to work.&nbsp; In the new machine, NT/4.0 could see and use the
network card fine but RH5.2 could not.&nbsp; More specifically, RH5.2 could
find the network card but could not initialize it and Tx/Rx packets.&nbsp;
The answer turned out be that NT/4.0 would <I>Reset and Change</I> the
card's IO port and interupt values to a different set of numbers each time
the computer was rebooted so that the card was on a different IO/IRQ each
time RH5.2 started.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps Win95 is doing something similar.
<P>The fix was to force NT/4.0 to choose one and only one IO/IRQ combination.&nbsp;
Then all worked fine.

When you type 'a.out' the directories in your path variable are =

You sure you want script based?  I don't think you do.  I went to the
homepage for what appears to be your internet provider
(<A HREF="http://www.asiaaccess.net.th/">http://www.asiaaccess.net.th/</A>), and I see no mention of the logins requiring a
script.  Try "PAP" under kppp - it stands for Password Authentication
Protocol.   Since you're using kppp this should be easy to set up.
<P>
Might as well go all the way since I'm trying to help:
When you create a new account under kppp, all you should need to fill in
is:
<PRE>
(Dial Tab):
	Connection Name and Phone Number
	Authentication:		 PAP!
(DNS Tab):
	Primary and secondary DNS #'s from ISP.
</PRE>
It is advisable to backup/delete ppp.options (as you originally did),
since kppp generates its own options (but may get confused if you added
conflicting options in that file).
<P>
It looks like AsiaAccess does have an option for a script, but
using PAP is easier and supposedly faster
<P> 
Let me know if this works.

If you want to have Unix-like access on a remote machine, you'd better use NFS. It's
not possible to mount FTP shares (if it's, mail-me =).
<P>
Your Windows apps were only hiding you the whole FTP thingy. They did the same thing
KFM does: show folders _as if_ they were local, no more.
<P>
NFS is in stock distro now and 2.2.x NFS performances are rather good, but worse than
FTP of course. Compile a new kernel for your rescue disk w/ NFS included.

Slackware (and other distributions, I suppose) has a "rescue disk" that
becomes the "root disk" of the boot-root floppy disk pair.  If one uses
the "boot" floppy called 'net.i' and the "root" disk called 'rescue.gz'
one finds a highly funtional system at hand.  Using this pair I recently
initialized the network card (an Intel EtherExpress Pro) when the
standard kernel failed at the task.  Using the 'ifconfig' and 'route'
commands I put the machine on my network in minutes.
<P>
Just about any site that handles various distributions will have this
disk set available.  Create the floppies using:
<PRE>
	dd if=/path/to/boot/or/root/image of=/dev/fd0
</PRE>
under Linux, or with 'rawrite.exe' under DOS.
<P>
Network initialization is accomplished with the following commands:
<PRE>
	ifconfig eth0 192.168.x.y
	route add -net 192.168.x.0
</PRE>
or with appropriate addresses for your network. I hope this helps.

You can check out one of one-floppy mini distributions, or set up nfs-root
