<H2>The Software World--It's a Changin'</H2>
<H4>By <a href="mailto:phil@ssc.com">Phil Hughes</a></H4>

<P> <HR> <P>  

First, let me set the scene: today is January 22.
The important events of this day are:
<ul>
<li>Bill Clinton is once again accused of a sexual impropriety.
<li>The Pope is in Cuba.
<li>Netscape has announced that that their browser is now free and that
they will freely distribute the source code for it.
<li>Microsoft has somewhat folded in its browser battle with the U.S. Justice
Department.
</ul>
The first two items are just for context--it has been an exciting day.
I am really here to discuss the last two items.
<p>
Let's get the Microsoft information out of the way first.
My understanding is that a compromise has been reached between Microsoft
and the justice department--the Internet Explorer icon
will not appear on the desktop, but the browser itself will still be
included.
As the easiest way to get a new browser is to download it off the Internet
and 90% of all personal computers today come with Microsoft Windows, it
seems that all we have done is make it a little harder for Internet Explorer to
be on 90% of the desktops.
Hopefully, there will be further developments in the Microsoft vs. the U.S. Justice
Department game.
<p>
The Netscape item has two parts.
The first, making the browser available for free really is a
necessity;
90% of new personal computers come with Windows and, thus, Internet
Explorer.
Whether IE is better than anything Netscape offers or not isn't the
issue if one comes with your computer and you have to go buy and
install the other one.
Numbers back up this statement.
Netscape used to account for about 90% of the browser market while 60%
is probably the case today.
<p>
The good news for Netscape is that they have managed to shift their
revenue stream away from stand-alone client software.
Their own numbers show that in the fourth quarter of 1997 these
revenues were only 13% of total, down from 45% a year earlier.
<p>
By far the most interesting part of Netscape's announcement for the
Linux community is the fact they will
release the source code for Communicator starting with 5.0.
Sure, this will also make a change for them in the Windows arena and
may force Microsoft to make some brave decision as well, but let's look
at what this does for the Linux community.
<p>
The first thing I see is talk on the Gnome mailing list about a version of
Navigator using Gnome.
Call it Gnomescape, it is potentially a full-featured browser with a
look and feel that is likely to become the Linux standard. [For more on
Gnome see the "KDE and Gnome" article by Larry Ayers in issue
24 of <I>Linux Gazette</I> January 1998.]
<p>
Netscape claims they are releasing the code to allow the Internet
community to contribute to the development.
(I expect Linux helped them realize that is possible.)
For us, this can mean that instead of complaining about Netscape bugs, we
can fix them.
I expect, based on Linux history, the best, most bug-free version of
Netscape will appear on Linux systems first.
<p>
Free Communicator and free source code means that Linux systems become
a much cheaper choice for "Web Appliances".
It also means inexpensive kiosks at shopping malls, car dealers, etc.
While I am sure Netscape made this decision to help their competitive
position with Microsoft, I think we will see a huge impact on the
Linux scene.
Of course, if Linux replaces Windows as the operating system installed
on 90% of the PCs sold today, Netscape will be as happy as the Linux
community.
<p>
What's still up in the air is what sort of license the source code
will fall under.
GPL is one choice; a license more like that of BSD is another.

<A HREF="http://www.linuxjournal.com/">web site</A> to get up to the
minute information on what is happening.
