<p>
I don't usually get this effusive about any book, but the authors of
<i>Blown to Bits</i> have written a must-read handbook on the most
important political questions we face regarding the present and future of
technology. Whether you're already familiar with these issues because
you're the go-to guy for all your less-techie friends, or you're the
bewildered by technology sort, Abelson, Ledeen, and Lewis have laid out the
background and the analysis with in-book citations as well as pointers to
sources and references available on the World Wide Web.
</p>

<p>
In the preface it is noted, "The book emerged from a general education
course we have taught at Harvard, but it is not a textbook." The course
they refer to is "Quantitative Reasoning 48 . . . a course on information
for non-technical, non-mathematically oriented students". Each chapter
starts with a real news story that illustrates the topic, and then
continues with discussion. It's all written in a very approachable, almost
conversational style, with short, easy to digest sentences. They succeed
where many others fail, being informative without being patronizing or
pedantic.
</p>

<p>
Chapter 3, for example, is entitled "Ghosts in the Machine: Secrets and
Surprises of Electronic Documents". In 35 pages, they explain preservation
of information ("redacted" documents, change tracking, metadata),
compression, file formats, secrecy, archives, and a sidebar on "Open
Document, Open Source, and Free". Just that section alone is the subject of
numerous other books, but <i>Blown to Bits</i> has another five chapters
with just as much breadth of information. Chapter 4 covers search engines,
Chapter 5 explains cryptography, Chapter 6 discusses copyright and
peer-to-peer filesharing. Chapter 7 deals with computer crimes and
censorship. Chapter 8 goes into traditional broadcast media and the
(U.S.) Fedecral Communications Commission.
</p>

<p>
The majority of the book deals with the U.S. first, but these issues are
transnational, and global impact is not neglected.
</p>

<p>
In keeping with the net-savvy approach and background of the authors,
readers are encouraged to participate in ongoing discussion at the book's
Web site (<a href="http://bitsbook.com">http://bitsbook.com</a>).
</p>

<p>
Those of us living in democracies bear a responsibility to safeguard
freedoms, and the foundation of the power to do so is knowledge. Grab a
copy of <i>Blown to Bits</i> and get the insight and vocabulary to explain
these important issues to others. Send a copy to your elected
representatives - we need people in power who actually know how the
Internet and other technologies work, and why it's important.

<em>
<p>
Kat likes to tell people she's one of the youngest people to have learned
to program using punchcards on a mainframe (back in '83); but the truth is
that since then, despite many hours in front of various computer screens,
she's a computer user rather than a computer programmer.
</p>
<p>
Her transition away from other OSes started with the design of a
massively multilingual wedding invitation.
<p>
When away from the keyboard, her hands have been found wielding of knitting
needles, various pens, henna, red-hot welding tools, upholsterer's shears,
and a pneumatic scaler. More often these days, she's occupied with managing
her <a href="okopnik1.html">latest project</a>.
