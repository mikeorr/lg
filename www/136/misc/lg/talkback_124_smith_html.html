Hi, Ireaded your article about 6 seat Linux enviroment.
</p>

<p>
I have an idea from that, but I don't have anyclue how to do it. I Have  
Ubuntu 6.10, gnome, and 2 disjointed screens. Now I'd like to bind 2  
keyboards, one for each screen, but still use my mouse as of now, jumping  
to another screen over the edge of monitor. Would that be possible in any  
way?
</p>

Sure, just run two copies of whatever it is you want on each screen.
Note that without things like Xinerama support, you won't be able to
move windows between screens, but then this can't be a requirement if
you don't want the mouse to move between them either.  For instance:
</p>

<pre>
exec fvwm -d :0.0
exec fvwm -d :0.1
</pre>
Now, assuming you setup X just to use two monitors without enabling
things like Xinerama, such operations tend to happen automatically in my
experience, as the above example with FVWM.  I couldn't say how GNOME or
KDE works in that regard.

<p>
Thanks for the help so far.
</p>

<p>
Maybe I wasn't clear enough (finnish is my native language).
</p>

<p>
I have my screens enabled already etc, can't drag windwos to eachother as  
said, and I know that too.
</p>

<p>
My point was that I'd like to bind one keyboard to one screen, but have  
the one mouse jumping across as it is now. mouse cursor alone does change  
screen just by going over the screen edge. my point here is that I could  
for example play full screen game on screen 0 and still be able to write  
IM with Gaim on another screen.
</p>

<p>
Current situation is that when I drag the mouse to another sceen, that  
"session" becomes the one also having my keyboard.
</p>

<p>
I hope I make any sense to you?
