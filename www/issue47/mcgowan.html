<P> Marcel Gagn&eacute;'s article (<I>Linux Journal</I> #65, September 1999) on
French cooking inspired me to share some recipes of my own.  The cooking
metaphor is not new to computing, as Donald Knuth, in his forward to
"Fundamental Algorithms" confesses he almost used "Recipes for the Computer" as
its title.  Without stirring the metaphor too vigorously, Gagn&eacute;'s
article gives me the opportunity to share two items of interest and give them
the needed cooking flavor.
<P>
For some time, I've been concerned about what I regard are overuse or
misuse of two programming constructs:
<ul>
<li>temporary variables and files, and
<li>nested logic and decisions.
</ul>
To continue the cooking analogy, these two may be thought of
respectively as inconsistent or lumpy sauce, and uneven temperature.
Realizing that we chefs like to work on one another's recipes, lets
see what happens when we apply them to Marcel Gagn&eacute;'s recipe, "Check
User Mail".
<P>
Before I'd read Marcel's article, my style of programming used the tool
metaphor.  While not much of a chef, I now prefer the cooking
metaphor, as it connotes more of a learning, and sharing model, which
is what we do in programming.
<P>
Marcel's recipe is an excellent starting point for my school of
cooking, as his recipe is complete, all by itself, and offers the
opportunity to visit each of the points once.  First, here is a copy
of his recipe, without the comment header.
<pre>
for user_name in 'cat /usr/local/etc/mail_notify'
do
	no_messages='frm $user_name |
		grep -v "Mail System Internal Data" |
		wc -l'
	if [ "$no_messages" -gt "0" ]
	then
		echo "You have $no_messages e-mail message(s) waiting." > /tmp/$user_name.msg
		echo " " >> /tmp/$user_name.msg
		echo "Please start your e-mail client to collect mail." >> /tmp/$user_name.msg
		/usr/bin/smbclient -M $user_name < /tmp/$user_name.msg
	fi
done
</pre>
This script isn't hard to maintain or understand, but I think the
chefs in the audience will profit from the seasonings I offer here.
<P>
A by-product of my cooking school is lots of short functions.  There
are those who are skeptical about adopting this approach.  Let's
suspend belief for just a moment as we go through the method.  I'll
introduce my seasonings one at a time, and then put Marcel Gagn&eacute;'s
recipe back together at the end.  Then you may judge the sauce.
<P>
One of the languages in my schooling was Pascal, which if you recall
puts the main procedure last.  So, I've learned to read scripts backwards,
as that's usually where the action is anyway.  In Marcel Gagn&eacute;'s script,
we come to the point in the last line, where he sends the message
to each client.  (I don't know Samba, but I assume this will make
a suitable function):
<PRE> 
	function to_samba { /usr/bin/smbclient -M $1; }
</PRE> 
This presumes samba reads from its standard input without another flag
or argument.  It's used:   "to_samba {user_name}", reading the standard
input, writing to the samba client.
<P>
And, what are we going to send the user, but a message indicating they
have new mail.  That function looks like this:
<PRE> 
	function you_have_mail {
		echo "You have $1 e-mail message(s) waiting."
		echo " " 
		echo "Please start your e-mail client to collect mail."
	}
</PRE> 
and it is used:   you_have_mail {num_messages}.  writing the 
message on the standard output.
<P>
At this point, you've noticed a couple of things.  The file names and
the redirection of output and input are missing.  We'll use them if we
need them.  But let me give you a little hint: we won't.  Unix(Linux)
was designed with the principle that recipes are best made from simple
ingredients.  Temporary files are OK, but Linux has other means to
reduce your reliance on them. Introducing temporary files does a few
things:
<ul>
<li>leaves you with extra cleaning to do after the meal is served,
<li>forces you to make sure someone else isn't using the bowl when
		you need it for your recipe.
</ul>
Therefore, we seek to save ourselves these tasks.  We'll see how this
happens in a bit.
<P>
A key piece of the recipe is deciding whether or not our user needs to
be alerted to incoming mail.   Let's take care of that now:
<PRE> 
	function num_msg { frm $1 | but_not "Mail System Internal Data" | linecount; }
</PRE> 
This is almost identical with Marcel's code fragment.  We'll deal with
the differences later.  The curious among you have already guessed.
This function is used: num_msg {user_name}, returning a count of the
number of lines.
<P>
What does the final recipe look like.  All of Marcel Gagn&eacute;'s recipe is
wrapped up in this one line of shell program:
<PRE> 
	foreach user_notify  'cat /usr/etc/local/mail_notify'
</PRE> 
And that's exactly how it's used.  This single line is the entire
program, supported of course, by the functions, or recipe fragments we
have been building.  We peeked ahead, breaking with Pascal tradition,
because, after looking at some low-level ingredients, I thought it
important to see where we are going at this point.  You can see the
value of a single-line program.  It now can be moved around in your
operations plan at will.  You may serve your users with the frequency
and taste they demand.  Note, at this point, you won't have much code
to change if you wanted to serve your A-M diners at 10 minute
intervals beginning at 5 after the hour and your N-Z diners on the
10-minute marks.
<P>
So what does "user_notify" look like?   I toiled with this one.  Let me
share the trials.  First I did this:
<PRE> 
	function user_notify { do_notify $(num_msg $1) $1; }
</PRE> 
thinking that if I first calculated the number of messages for the
user, and supplied that number and the user name to the function, then
that function (do_notify) could perform the decision and send the
message.  Before going further, we have to digress.  In the Korn
shell, which I use exclusively, the result of the operation in the
expression: $( ... ) is returned to the command line.  So, in our
case, the result of "num_mag {user_name}" is a number 0 through some
positive number, indicating the number of mail messages the user has
waiting.
<P>
This version of user_notify would expect a "do_notify" to look like
this:
<PRE> 
	function do_notify { if [ "$1" -gt "0" ]; then notify_user $2 $1; fi; }
</PRE> 
This is OK, but it means yet another "notify" function, and even for
this one-line fanatic, that's a bit much.  So, what to do?  Observe,
the only useful piece of information in this function is another
function name "notify_user".  This is where culinary art, inspiration,
and experience come in.  Let's try a function which looks like this:
<PRE> 
	function foo { { if [ "$X" -gt "0" ]; then eval $*; fi }
</PRE> 
This is different than the "do_notify" we currently have.  First of
all, $X, is not an actual shell variable, but here the X stands for
"lets see what is the best argument number to use for the numeric
test".  And the "eval $*" performs an evaluation of all its
arguments.  And here's the spice that gives this whole recipe it's
flavor!  The first argument may be another command or function name!
A remarkable, and little used property of the shell is to pass command
names as arguments.
<P>
So, let's give "foo" a name.  What does it do?  If one of its
arguments is non-zero, then it performs a function (it's first
argument) on all the other arguments.  Let's solve for X.  It could be
any of the positional parameters, but to be completely general, it
probably should be the next one, as it's the only other one this
function ever has to know about.  So, let's call this thing:
<PRE> 
	if_non_zero {function} {number} ....
</PRE> 
Using another convenient shorthand, it all becomes:
<PRE> 
	function if_non_zero { [ $2 -gt 0 ] && eval $*; }
</PRE> 
and we'll see how it's used later.  With this function, user_notify now
looks like:
<PRE> 
	function user_notify { if_non_zero do_notify $(num_msg $1) $1; }
</PRE> 
and is used: user_notify {user_name}.  Note the dual use of the first
argument, which is the user's name.  In one case, it is a further
argument to the num_msg function which return the number for that
user, in the other case, it merely stands for itself, but now as the
2nd argument to "do_notify".  So, what does "do_notify" look like.
We've already written the sub pieces, so, it's simply:
<PRE> 
	function do_notify { you_have_mail $1 | to_samba $2; }
</PRE> 
At this point, we have (almost) all the recipe ingredients. The
careful reader has noted the omission of "but_not", "linecount", and
"foreach".  Permit me another gastronomic aside.  Ruth Reichel,
recently food editor of the New York Times, is now the editor for
Gourmet magazine.  One of the things she promises to do is correct the
complicated recipes so frequently seen in their pages.  For example,
"use 1/4 cup lemon juice" will replace the paragraph of instructions
on how to extract that juice from a lemon.
<P>
In that spirit, I'll let you readers write your own "but_not" and
"linecount".  Let me show you the "foreach" you can use:
<PRE> 
      function foreach { cmd=$1; shift; for arg in $*; do eval $cmd $arg; done; }
</PRE> 
A slightly more elegant version avoids the temporary file name:
<PRE> 
      function foreach { for a $(shifted $*); do eval $1 $a; done; }
</PRE> 
which requires "shifted":
<PRE> 
      function shifted { shift; echo $*; }
</PRE> 
The former "foreach", to be completely secure, needs a "typeset"
qualifier in front of the "cmd" variable.  It's another reason to
avoid the use of variable names.  This comes under the general rule
that not every programming feature needs to be used.
<P>
We need one final "Chapters of the Cookbook" instruction before
putting this recipe back together.  Let's imagine by now, that we are
practicing student chefs and we have a little repertoire of our own.
So what's an easy way to re-use those cooking tricks of the past.  In
the programming sense, we put them in a function library and invoke
the library in our scripts.  In this case, let's assume we have
"foreach", "but_not", and "linecount" in the cookbook.  Put that file
"cookbook" either in the current directory, but more usefully,
somewhere along your PATH variable.  Using Marcel Gagn&eacute;'s example, we
might expect to put it in, say, /usr/local/recipe/cookbook, so you
might do this in your environment:
<PRE> 
   PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/recipe
</PRE> 
and then, in your shell files, or recipes, you would have a line like this:
<PRE> 
    . cookbook		#  "dot - cookbook"
</PRE> 
where the "dot" reads, or "sources" the contents of the cookbook file into
the current shell.   So, let's put it together:
 <PRE> 
# -- Mail Notification, Marty McGowan, mcfly@workmail.com, 9/9/99
#
  . cookbook
# -------------------------------------------- General Purpose --
function if_non_zero	{ [ $2 -gt 0 ] && eval $*; }
function to_samba	{ /usr/bin/smbclient -M $1; }
# --------------------------------------- Application Specific --
function num_msg	{ frm $1 | but_not "Mail System Internal Data" | linecount; }
function you_have_mail	{
	echo "You have $1 e-mail message(s) waiting."
	echo " " 
	echo "Please start your e-mail client to collect mail."
}
function do_notify	{ you_have_mail $1 | to_samba $2; }
function user_notify	{ if_non_zero do_notify $(num_msg $1) $1; }
#
# ------------------------------------------ Mail Notification --
#
  foreach user_notify  'cat /usr/etc/local/mail_notify'
</PRE> 
On closing, there are a few things that suggest themselves here.
"if_non_zero" probably belongs in the cookbook.  It may already be in
mine.  And also "to_samba".  Where does that go?  I keep one master
cookbook, for little recipes that may be used in any type of cooking.
Also, I keep specialty cookbooks for each style that needs its own
repertoire.  So, I may have a Samba cookbook as well.  After I've done
some cooking, and in a new recipe, I might find the need for some
fragment I've used before.  Hopefully, it's in the cookbook.  If it's
not there, I ask myself, "is this little bit ready for wider use?".
If so, I put it in the cookbook, or, after a while other little
fragments might find their way into the specialty books.  So, in the
not too distant future, I might have a file, called "samba_recipe",
which starts out like:
<PRE> 
# --------------- Samba Recipes, uses the Cookbook, Adds SAMBA --
. cookbook
# -------------------------------------------- General Purpose --
function to_samba	{ /usr/bin/smbclient -M $1; }
</PRE> 
This leads to a recipe with three fewer lines and the cookbook
has been replace with 'samba_recipes" at the start.  
<P>
Let me say just two things about style: my functions either fit
on one line or not.  If they do, each phrase needs to be separated
by a semi-colon (;), if not, a newline is sufficient.  My multi-line
function closes with a curly brace on it's own line.  Also, my 
comments are "right-justified", with two trailing dashes.  Find your
style, and stick to it.
<P>
In conclusion, note how we've eliminated temporary files and variables.
Nor are there nested decisions or program flow.  How was this
achieved?  Each of these are now "atomic" actions.  The one decision
in this recipe, "does Marcel have any mail now?" has been encapsulated
in the "if_non_zero" function, which is supplied the result of the
"num_msg" query.  Also, the looping construct has been folded into the
"foreach" function.  This one function has simplified my recipes
greatly.  (I've also found it necessary to write a "foreach" function
which passes a single argument to each function executed.)
<P>
The temporary files disappeared into the pipe, which was Unix's (Linux's)
single greatest invention.  The idea that one program might read its
input from the output from another was not widely understood when Unix
was invented.  And the temporary names disappeared into the shell
variable arguments.  The shell function, which is very well defined in
the Korn shell, adds greatly to this simplification.
<P>
To debug in this style, I've found it practical to add two things
to a function to tell me what's going on in the oven.  For example:
<PRE> 
   function do_notify	{ comment do_notify $*
	    you_have_mail $1 | tee do_notify.$$ |  to_samba $2
	    }
</PRE> 
where "comment" looks like:
<PRE> 
      function comment { echo $* 1>&2; } 
</PRE> 
Hopefully, the chefs in the audience will find use for these
approaches to their recipes. I'll admit this style is not the easiest
to adapt, but soon it will yield recipes of more even consistency,
both in taste and temperature.  And a programming style that will expand
each chef's culinary art.
