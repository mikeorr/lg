<center><h2><font color="blue">This installs X Windows twm for your Nana</font></h2></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you got a Nana?  Is she old and suffering from cataracts and glaucoma so that she has blurred vision?  My old mom is a Nana for her little grandkids, and she has the blurred vision plus a touch of forgetfulness (halfzeimer's).  Can you see exploded frozen Pepsi cans in the freezer; left there to cool down quick? Yes, I know, flowing cold water is faster, but the old girl thinks "freezer for cold", and her synapse pathways are ancient and nigh unbreakable.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the problem with her and a linux box is the small print on those X applications; not to mention detailed pixel-by-pixel rodent twitching.  Nana is not a mouser. Window after window opens up in a tiny font that is frustrating for her and she wanders off in disgust. She especially wanders off when the internet is loading up one of those "dynamic" (ha!) web pages that take up tons of RAM and take five minutes to conclude their "exciting" scripts.  All we want is big text and we want it right now; so we use lynx around here.    The "dynamic" scripts can not execute on the little lynx browser, and like the Answer Guy says, it acts as a twit filter. The Netscape browser goes into service when Nana wants to see a site that she saw on television.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a linux distribution available to you, then you can easily install X Windows in a big enough format so that she can finally see her desktop.  Even old neglected machines can install linux X Windows, all you <a href="#xme"> need</a> is 110 megabytes (other than swap) on a hard disk to hold it all.  Want to bug some NT or W2K users? The T-1 connection for file downloads for www.chguy.net has Apache web server, ftp, and X inside and it uses a total of 110 megabytes for the system. Total cost, less big disk drive, under 100.00 Canadian (like 20 bucks US:).<br>
<h2><font color="blue">Debian can do this thing</font></h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just about all linux distributions can do this little twm setup.  There is a very disturbing trend away from small installations of linux. Even though you can get a super linux-powered, tiny, complete file-server-on-a-flash-ROM-disk-drive like kyzo's <a href="http://www.kyzo.com/">pizza </a> box, most distributions will overload your hard disk on an automatic installation.  The main one to overload is RedHat and the other <a href="#bloat"> rpm-based</a> distributions. When a minimum Custom install takes 125 megabytes, you automatically exclude a lot of devices, not just old machines.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You need a thin client/thin server (a small installation) for the new wave of networking gadgets that were under your festive dead tree (or simulated dead tree). Yes, <a href="http://www.chguy.net/news/dec99/WAPenwireless.html">WAP-enabled</a> devices and destinations (voice powered interfaces to Wireless Markup Language enabled cell phones) are text based internet browsers that are just begging for a few linux-powered buttons. Your Palm PDA and your other handheld PCs are using 8 megabytes of memory in total. If you go with the new <a href="http://www.chguy.net/news/dec99/bluetooth.html">Bluetooth </a> network devices, you can jam a 340 megabyte tiny Microdrive disk drive onto your device. 
<h2><font color="blue">Flight of Fancy:</font></h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now you can have a voice-activated, hands-free linux box by using <a href="http://www.chguy.net/news/dec99/techweekaccess.html">Emacspeak </a>and <a href="http://www-4.ibm.com/software/speech/dev/">ViaVoice</a>. Your desktop is already in the future thanks to T.V. Raman. Now we are faced with all of these tiny internet devices. The challenge for linux developers will be to figure out a way to get some linux box power out of these miniature marvels. Then you will truly need to play with a small installation of X in order to keep yourself from WinCEing. I imagine that a flat screen cell phone flipped up like Captain Kirk's communicator will soon appear; complete with internet buttons to push and a tiny rodent-mover thumbswitch.  Linux-powered with X, of course. Please visit those wacky kyzo hackers to see what you can get done in a small space.
<h2><font color="blue">Small X with Big Fonts</font></h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who can read can install X Windows and get it configured for large print on a small 14" screen. The plus side is that you do not need a huge graphical user interface. Simple twm which comes with X Windows can be easily configured. Good old Debian has the small purposeful ".deb" packages that you can put in one at a time to make a very small yet powerful linux box.  This article fires up Debian and installs a big format for twm so that you can simply point your Nana at the machine and click, uh, let her go linuxing.
<h2><font color="blue">A lot of targets</font></h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The target system is any thing you want; Mac(m68k), Amiga(m68k), Atari(m68k), Alpha, ARM, Sparc, UltraSparc(sparc64), Hurd(hurd-i386), PowerMac(powerpc), i386 PC; with 16 MB RAM, a 1.44 MB floppy and at least a tiny hard disk, 110 megabytes small. Some of you will scoff, but there are a lot of small hard disks attached to a lot of old garage/attic computers. Thank goodness we can put the <a href="http://www.unix-vs-nt.org">NT-killer</a> linux on them; it enables the average Joe to run a home or business network of seven machines for the same price as a single pentium-CPU-melter.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We begin at the source for our distribution, good old '/debian'; at the top of the distribution tree. The <a href="#CHGUY">Official</a> CDROM or the internet machine will hold all the X files you need.  If you have not yet installed X, I congratulate you on having more balls than the general cyber population. Or it could be that I sympathize with you on being told that you did not have enough space for an X installation.  Fie on those festering file-bloat-fostering folk.
<h2><font color="blue">Apt-get, dftp, dpkg or dselect</font></h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that you just need the name of the package, not the full version number. Note that the list of packages is in /var/lib/dpkg/available and you can read it with less; less is more.
<pre>
  
No rodent clicking here; watch your fingers and press once per key:

less /var/lib/dpkg/available
</pre>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To search in less, type / then the word you seek.  Type n to go to the next instance of your search word.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do not have X Windows (XFree86) then we need to login as root and grab these <a href="#totalx">files</a>:
<ul><li>xserver-vga16
<li>xserver-common
<li>xf86setup (XF86Setup to configure your xserver)
<li>a groovy accelerated xserver which you have guessed from the available packages file
<li>xfree86-common
<li>xfonts-base
<li>xfonts-75dpi (and any others you wish, but you need at least this)
<li>xfonts-scalable (just because they are flexible)
<li>xbase-clients
<li>xlib6g (and xlib6 to use WordPerfect8)
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have apt, (you do on Debian 2.1 and up) you can log onto your network and then use apt-get to download them and install them and then clean up its own mess.  The usual term is "apt rocks!".
<pre>
  
For example:

apt-get install xbase-clients xfree86-common 
  
</pre>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may wish to use dpkg as well, since some of us like to grab the client by the collar and shake hard.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we will install them with dpkg -i filename.
<pre>
   
For example:

cd /debian/dists/slink/main/binary-i386/x11
dpkg -i xserver-vga16
  
</pre>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good old way is to use dselect, but since it requires patience to learn how to use it, many 'frantic clickers' do not bother. Too bad for them. The dselect utility requires that you know where your '/debian' tree begins; either on the internet machine or somewhere else.  This is the first hump. The dftp package will let you install direct from the internet machine (for example, ftp.ca.debian.org -- only in Canada, eh). Hump two is that you need to know the names of your packages. That one is easy, just fire up a second vt with a LeftAlt-F2 and then type dselect. You already have less pointed at /var/lib/dpkg/available on vt #1.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you can bounce between the two vt's and find a filename easily.  To search in dselect, type / and then the filename, just like in less. Put a plus in the highlighted line for your package and press Enter. Bingo! All of the other files you need will be suggested to you. Take them and press Enter again. Job done.
<h2><font color="blue">Configure X</font></h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type XF86Setup and follow the directions.
<h2><font color="blue">Start X</font></h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funny how a few simple changes can stop you in mid-stream. Now that you have X inside, how do you start it?  The usual old way is startx, which will fire up xinit and read the '.xinitrc' file in your home directory. The Debian standard now gets it to read '.xsession' in your home directory.  Tastes great and it is less filling.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The graphical login screen is very popular and you get that from gdm, kdm and their grandfather, xdm. Stick with Gramps.  The xdm is started with "xdm" (surprise) and it then reads a load of files to get you to the pretty picture login.
<h2><font color="blue">Here are the X files</font></h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Login as root to muck about with these:
<ul>
<li><a href="#xdmboot">/etc/init.d/xdm</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This one boots you into a graphical login.
<li><a href="#xdmreso">/etc/X11/xdm/Xresources_0</a>
<li><a href="#xdmserver">/etc/X11/xdm/Xservers</a>
<li><a href="#xdmopts">/etc/X11/xdm/xdm.options</a>
<li><a href="#xwmgr">/etc/X11/window-managers</a>
<li><a href="#xf86">/etc/X11/XF86Config</a>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy these to your home directory (~/):
<ul>
<li><a href="#homeresources">/etc/X11/Xresources/xterm</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as ~/.Xresources
<li><a href="#homexcess">/usr/doc/xfree86-common/examples/xsession</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as ~/.xsession
<li><a href="#hometwm">/etc/X11/twm/system.twmrc</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as ~/.twmrc
<li><a href="#homemap">/etc/X11/Xmodmap</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as ~/.Xmodmap
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edit these in your home directory (~/):
<ul>
<li><a href="#homebash">~/.bashrc</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the normal login at this machine.
<li><a href="#loginbash">~/.bash_profile</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case you login from elsewhere. Anywhere.
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whooee. And they say linux is tough to configure. This is full access and control, baby. Nobody else dares to let you in on it. Only open source software can be this much fun; similar to building your own car, but not so greasy. If you want greasy, go sit in on a sales presentation for something proprietary or monopolized.
<br>
<h2><font color="blue">Scripting is the mojo for linux</font></h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world of GNU/Linux Open Source there is a fine art to this configuration fiddling. Unfortunately you need to know what is going on inside the code before you can really get a handle on custom configuration files.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we will rely on the manual pages and the info pages and the README files and the very special comments inside the configuration files themselves.  All you are doing is scripting your little machine's movements. All you are doing is taking absolute control of your machine. You got the mojo workin'.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire up mcedit (it comes with Midnight Commander. You do have it, yes?). Go to the file you will edit and block out the script with the F3 toggle and then F9 copy it to the ~/.cedit/cooledit.clip file. Exit with F10.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then type mcedit your-new-file-name. It will give you a nice blue page to F9 insert the ~/.cedit/cooledit.clip file.  Edit it in your personal way and F2 save it, or F9 save it as your-new-script-name.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huh? What does a configuration file do? It provides all of the setup instructions for your program to read into the setup. You are the director and the program awaits your instructions. It gets them from the configuration files.
<h3><font color="blue"><a name="xdmboot">/etc/init.d/xdm</a></font></h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way to avoid a graphical login is to remove this file from /etc/init.d. Copy it to somewhere first, no 'frantic deletions', please. CAUTION.
<pre>
  
To get a boot to the console, move this file to somewhere else.

mv /etc/init.d/xdm /root/bucketofiles/xdm

<h2><font color="blue">Finding a font</font></h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going on a font-finding mission is easy enough.  You can install the xcontrib package and use xfontsel to see and select your fonts.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The xfstt is your TrueType font server, very nice. Works best for applications needing scalable fonts. You can use the exact same fonts that you have now on your monopoly machine. Just copy them over.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without xfontsel, you can still get your list of fonts with this:
<pre>

xlsfonts | less

</pre>
<h2><font color="blue">We are going live to chguy.net</font></h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On your screen is a little window called "Debian/GNU Linux". It only shows up when you are at a working xdm login.  It is also so darn big that you can read it from across the room. That is the real reason for making a big font setup for your screen.  If you have to strain to see the tiny print on your 1024x768 screen, then you can choose the groovy format of your present setup on a bigger screen or you can make an easier-to-read screen.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making your present window manager into an accessible X Window machine for the vision impaired is very rewarding.  I got fresh and delicious cake for my efforts.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest problem we face with these newfangled desktops like GNOME or KDE is their complexity. Window after window of tiny buttons and fancy formatting looks very nice on a seventeen inch screen.  We only have fourteen inch screens here, and a lot of folks are in the same squinting, headaching, eyestrain boat.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the fourteen inch screen we needed easy installation, well commented configuration files, good README files and a distribution that could fit onto a small disk drive.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is /debian. Always is.

<h3><a name="CHGUY"><font color="blue">linux on CD</font></a></h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your CHGUY Debian 2.1 CD set is labeled B1, B2, S1 and S2. The B1 CD (#1 of 4) is the installer for a regular desktop machine. The B2 CD (#2 of 4) is slightly tweaked for installing Debian 2.1 on your laptop machine. For installing via dselect, either one can go in the CDROM drive. Those wacky hackers are ready for anything.
<h3><a name="xme"><font color="blue">X Windows is compact</font></h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you install the Standard Server package it only fills up 50 megabytes on your hard disk. Add in 32 megabytes for a swap partition and you have only used 80 megabytes from a small, old hard disk. That will leave you enough room for the xbase ".debs" plus your video-card-specific xserver and the rest of the XFree86 window system.
<h3><a name="bloat"><font color="blue">RPM based bloat</font></a></h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can squeeze a small rpm installation into 125 megabytes from the Custom install option on the rpm based RedHat-style distributions. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a RedHat Custom install does not include X unless you leave it checked on the menu.  Leave about 340 megabytes for X and you will also get KDE or GNOME setup as well.
<pre>
       
Installation Type | size in megabytes |   partition size
----------------------------------------------------------
GNOME Workstation   561 Megabytes     | uses 650 M partition
KDE Workstation     573  "     "      |  "   650 M "    "
Server system       324  "     "      |  "   400 M "    "
Custom system       125  "     "      |  "   140 M "    "        
</pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Automatic Desktop installation of RedHat will suck up 700 megabytes in a flash. Mandrake will grab about 500 megabytes, with the other rpm-style installers doing a similar big desktop; either GNOME or KDE.  Accessibility for those two desktops is simply a matter of choosing a big font, but that is too big a system for a non-mouser like a Nana. Too many buttons, too much clicking, too much RAM needed. So we keep it simple with twm or ctwm with this article.
<h3><a name="totalx"><font color="blue">The total X</font></h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Branden Robinson hands out the straight goods yet again, and here is the total list of files that make up the Debian packages for installing X. You need "rstart, rstartd, twm, xbase-clients, xdm, xfree86-common, xfs, xmh, xproxy, xserver-common, xsm, and xterm.  Some files from the old xbase package were also placed in xlib6g (XKB and locale data) and xlib6g-dev (development tools)." Please see /usr/doc/xfree86-common/README.Debian.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking good is one thing, looking smart is another. If you get eyestrain from your tiny fonts and busy screen, remember that you can save your eyes by setting up BIG and getting an infra-red mouse and sit across the room from your linux box.  Happy holidays and Happy linuxing!
