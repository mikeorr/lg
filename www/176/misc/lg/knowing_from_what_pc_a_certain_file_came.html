Hello TAG
</p>

<p>
I have an ubuntu linux machine here thats got a samba shared folder,
writable by anyone.
</p>

<p>
Is there any way i can know from what IP a certain file came?
</p>

<p>
Cause one of the windoze machines on my network is spreading some
virus, and I cant figure out what machine is that. It creates an
autorun.inf and a .exe on my ubuntu shared folder, thats the reason I
wanted to try to figure out where it came from.
</p>

<p>
Thanks
Deividson

I do not know of any way except turning up the log/debug level. You
might get a lot of noise though.

<p>
In this case you can combine Samba with an anti-virus filter and check
every file as soon as it.

I'm not all that familiar with Samba, but here are a couple of
possibilities:
</p>

<p>
1) Is there any kind of a logging feature that you can enable in Samba?
2) If not, tcpdump/etherape might be of use.
3) Does this thing write those files fairly often (=$INTERVAL) <em>and</em> can
you enable/disable the sharing for selected Winboxen? If so, then use
the "divide-and-conquer" method to find the offending machine:
</p>

<p>
  a) Split the number of boxen in half and disable one of the two sections.
  b) Wait $INTERVAL. If the files appear, the problem is in the enabled
     section; otherwise, it's in the disabled one.
  c) Move the split point half-way into the problematic section.
  d) Repeat a - c until you've located the infected machine.
</p>

<p>
This might take some time depending on the number of machines you're
working with, but not as much as you might think: divide-and-conquer
uses powers of two, so a field of $N boxen would take log2($N) intervals
to test (e.g., 6 tests for 64, 10 for 1024, 20 for 1048576, and so on.)
</p>

<p>
This general technique allows you to troubleshoot any sequential system,
and is well worth knowing. Amazingly, I find that most people are not
familiar with it: I often end up explaining it to my students. And, no,
it's not a question of not knowing the name of the technique; people are
actually and literally unfamiliar with the method.  That still shocks
me.

<p>
Yes; you can set per-machine logging in samba by using '%m' in the logfile name:
log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m
</p>

<p>
(You can use '%U' for user-level logging, or combine them, etc.)
</p>

<p>
The 'log level' feature can be set to log a number of different
things, and there's an overview of levels here:
<a href='http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-HOWTO-Collection/VFS.html#xtdaudit'>http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-HOWTO-Collection/VFS.html#xtdaudit</a>
- it doesn't specifically mention file creation, so '2' (log
opens/closes) is probably a safe one to go with, temporarily.
