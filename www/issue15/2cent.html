<p>At first glance the humble GNU utility <em>date</em> seems to be a very
minor program, perhaps useful in shell-scripts but hardly something to get
excited about.  Type "date" at the prompt, press <em>enter</em>, and
"Tue Feb 11 09:25:50 CST 1997" (or something similar) is displayed on your
screen.  As with so many unix-ish utilities, the bare command is really
just a template, waiting to be laden with switches.

<p>I keep a journal, and I've been using a header line for each entry with
this format:<br><pre>

Tue 11 Feb 1997       *** Journal Entry #44 ***       9:30 PM

</pre>

<p>Weary of typing the header each day, some time ago I began attempts to
automate it.  Creating an abbreviation or macro for the center field is not
hard with most editors, but I wanted the date and time as well.  Reading the
man page for <em>date</em> I discovered that it has numerous formatting
switches. You can make the command print out the date and/or the time in
just about any fashion you can think of.  The first field of the above
header can be created with these switches:<br>

<p><code>date '+%a %-d %b %Y'</code>

<p>while the time-of-day field uses these:<br>

<br> <code>date '+%-I:%M %p'</code>

<p>The single quotes are essential when combining several of the switches.
I tried for some time to get the command to do what I wanted without
success; while rereading the man- page I eventually noticed the quotes.  Of
course no-one is going to memorize <b>date</b>'s numerous switches, which is
probably one reason the shell script was invented.  I wrote two short
scripts; the first, called <b>mydate</b>, is just:<br><pre><code>
#!/bin/bash
date '+%a %-d %b %Y'
</code></pre>

<p>The second, called <b>mytime</b> is the similar but with the above time
switches for <b>date</b>.

<p>Typing the daily header in Emacs was now somewhat easier: first the command
<kbd>Control-u Esc-!</kbd>; when prompted in the mini-buffer I'd type
<b>mydate</b> and the formatted date would begin the line.  Next a keyboard
macro for the center "Journal Entry" field, then a command like the first to
have the time inserted at the end of the line.

<p>After performing this little keyboard ritual for a few days, it occurred to
me that perhaps an Emacs macro could have a shell command embedded within it.
Reading a few <b>Info</b> files confirmed this supposition and suggested yet
another refinement.  I learned that it's possible to cause a macro to pause
for input and then resume!  This would be just ideal for the journal entry
number.

<p>The sequence which I came up with was: <kbd>Control-(</kbd> to start
recording the macro, then <kbd>Control-u Esc-!</kbd> followed (when
prompted) by <b>mydate</b>.  At this point I typed in some spaces, then
<kbd>*** Journal Entry #</kbd>, followed by <kbd>Control-u Control-x q</kbd>
to start a recursive edit; this pauses the macro and allows the entry number
to be entered.  Next is <kbd>Esc Control-c</kbd> which exits the recursive
edit and lets the macro proceed.  The macro is completed with some more
spaces, then <kbd>control-u Esc-!</kbd>, the <b>mytime</b> shell-script
command, and ends with two <kbd>Enter</kbd> keystrokes and two spaces, to
indent the first sentence. <kbd>Control-)</kbd> stops the macro-recording.
Whew! That's a lot harder to describe than to type.

<p>This routine would be ridiculously esoteric if you had to remember
it. Luckily in Emacs you only have to do it one time.  Once you've constructed
such a macro and tried it out to see if it does what you want, two more
steps will record it in your <kbd>~/.emacs</kbd> file so that it can be
executed with a simple keystroke.

<p>The first step is to give the macro a name, which can be
anything. <kbd>Esc-x name-last-kbd-macro</kbd>, followed by
<kbd>Return</kbd>, then the name and another <kbd>Return</kbd>, sets the
name.  At this point load your <kbd>~/.emacs</kbd> file, move the cursor to
where you want the macro definition, then type <kbd>Esc-x
insert-kbd-macro</kbd>, followed by <kbd>Return</kbd>.  There you go!  As
long as you keep your <kbd>~/.emacs</kbd> file you'll have the macro
available.  Now you can type <kbd>Esc-x [macroname]</kbd> and it'll
execute.  If you've put a recursive edit in it, just remember to type
<kbd>Esc Control-c</kbd> after you've inserted the text you need and the macro
will conclude.  

<p>This may seem like a convoluted procedure, and it is, the first time you do
it: haltingly typing in a macro, starting over from scratch after one
mis-typed character, all the while frequently referring to the docs.  Then
repeating the process when it doesn't do what you wanted!

<p>The second time you will probably remember about half of the commands,
enough that it's no longer a tortuous task.  Creating and saving macros
using these techniques isn't an everyday task; I've found that I have to
refresh my memory on at least part of the procedure every time I do it, but
for repetitive editing tasks the time spent is amply repaid.

<p>If you make very many of these you risk bloating your <i>~/.emacs</i>
file, causing the editor to load even more slowly and wasting memory.
Typically these macros have a specific use, so it makes sense to keep
them in categorised LISP files, one for each type of file you edit.  Put
each file in the directory where it will be used, and load them on demand
with the command <kbd>Esc-x load-file [filename]</kbd>.

<p>So there is a reason the Emacs partisans like to call it an "extensible"
editor.  These macros are just the tip of the iceberg; over the years many
LISP extensions to Emacs have been contributed to the free software
community by programmers world-wide.  Luckily some of the best of them tend
to be incorporated into successive releases of Emacs and XEmacs; many others
are available from the
<a href="ftp://archive.cs.ohio-state.edu/pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive">
Emacs-Lisp Archive</a>.
Another good source for Emacs information is the
