<p>
I was searching for an Assembler to COBOL converter and found &amp; enjoyed
your article at <a href="../../../126/TWDT.html">http://linuxgazette.net/126/TWDT.html</a>
</p>


<p>
Could you tell me the conversion tool used to convert assembler to COBOL ?
</p>


<p>
Do you also know of a PL/1 to COBOL converter ?
</p>


<p>
I, Owen Townsend, owen@uvsoftware.ca, website www.uvsoftware.ca
have tools to convert mainframe JCL to Korn shell scripts
</p>

<p>
&amp; mainframe COBOL to Micro Focus COBOL
</p>

<p>
&amp; EBCDIC DATA to ASCII preserving any packed/binary data.
</p>


<p>
I have had questions from prospects asking about assembler &amp; PL/1 conversion
so would be interested in finding tools for these conversions.
</p>


<p>
Please look at my web site. You might be interested in downloading
my free 'uvhd' utility from www.uvsoftware.ca/libuvhd.htm
</p>

<p>
- file investigation utility
</p>

<p>
- displays data in vertical hexadecimal
</p>

<p>
- great for files with packed/binary data
</p>

<p>
- browse, search, select, update
</p>

<p>
I am listing it in the GNU FSF directory.
</p>

<p>
Thanks, Owen
</p>

I just hope that you realise that the FSF, if they choose to list it
at all, will more than likely preface it with a warning against the
use of your other software, as it is proprietary.

&gt; Jimmy:
&gt;
&gt; Yes, I would expect that. I hope you will try out uvhd &amp; let me know
&gt; if it could be useful to you ?
&gt; It has proven useful to most of my customers converting mainframes
&gt; to Linux &amp; working with mainframe type files with packed/binary fields.
&gt; I think it should be useful to Linux users at large since there are
&gt; lots of linux files with binary contents not easily viewed with vi, etc.
</pre>

<p>
Sounds interesting. I've had some experience with AS/400s in college,
and remember having quite a lot of trouble getting data out of them.
But that's firmly in the past. I will bear it in mind, though, the
next time I feel the urge to tinker with some binary file.
