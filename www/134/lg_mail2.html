<h1>Mailbag, Part II</h1>

<p class="editorial">
Rick Moen has been forwarding messages from various other Linux
venues ([ILUG], the [conspire] list, the comp.os.linux.setup newsgroup,
etc.) for quite some time. These discussions have been sitting patiently
waiting for me; the end of the year roundup seemed like the right time
to dust them off with care and send them out to the world. Enjoy! - Kat

This is not flame bait.  Just an observation.  As many of you know, I am a
regular here.  I try to help as many posters as I can.  Though I am not a
guru, I do have some knowledge and often get a "Thanks very much" from OPs. 
I've been using Linux since 1999 for 99.5% of my computer needs, and
have finally made the transition to 100% after I got my scanner working. 
Though it did work for a while, the change to the 2.6.x kernel broke
something needed for my scanner to work.  So I kept a copy of W2K around
just for the occasional image scan.
</p>

<p>
One of the programs I found while still a Windows user was a virus scanner
from Trend Micro called PCcillin.  Probably the best virus scanner for
Windows users available.  I say that because I had tried a few others and
then, when I tried PCcillin it found several viruses the others had missed. 
Take it from someone who had actually had a hacker break into my box and
physically fry my hard drive...this was a lesson well learned.  Since the
time I switched to Linux, I still have friends who use Windows.  And I
always recommend that if they are going to continue using Windows that they
should buy PCcillin...  I don't recommend using Windows, but if they must,
at least they should get the best protection possible.  I've convinced
several people of the wisdom of using this anti-virus software and all have
thanked me several times over.  All have been saved by this program...
</p>

<p>
So, going back to my original question in the title of this article, how do
we know when we're there?  I have several anti-virus and anti-spam
applications that are all free as in cost and free as in freedom installed. 
Also, a couple of rootkit detectors as well as port scan detectors, etc...
So I think I'm pretty safe.  Never have had any problems since I switched OS. 
But I'm sure the day will come when some clever hacker will (finally)
produce a Linux virus... Mark my word, the day will come!  But, as I said,
I'm ready, as I'm sure most Linux users are.  I just wanted to point out
the fact that my favorite Windows anti-virus company has realized that the
Linux users are a substantial market force.  And, after all the wait, there
free as in cost, online virus detection service is available for Linux!
It's called 'House Call' and it works.... Free... Just like in Windows... 
You'll need to use Firefox or, well I forget the other Linux browser that
works, but it does work.
</p>

<p>
I'm NOT saying anyone should spend there money on this product.. Just
pointing out that there is one more commercial company to recognize the
Linux community and offer their services/products.  In the meantime, I'll
just keep using the other free products available to Linux users.  F-Prot
is free for personal use.  Of course ClamAV (with KlamAV front end) is a
must.  Spam Assasin, Bogofilter, etc... are all great programs that I
highly recommend.

&gt; The gist of the article is providing the source can be a hassle.
</pre>

<p>
But it really isn't.  E.g., you can cut source CDs for the few people
who receive copies of your GPLed binaries and request source within
three years, charging them in advance for the cost of producing and
mailing them.  If that's a "hassle", outsource it to one of the cut-rate
CD-burning houses such as Cheapbytes; I'm sure they'd appreciate the
business, and you'd bear neither expense nor hassle yourself.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; We got into this with Cygwin. We install Cygwin on some customer sites
&gt; solely for some of the popular Unix CLI utilities our support people
&gt; prefer. Other than that, we do not modify, compile with, or otherwise
&gt; touch a thing.  Referencing the current Cygwin source is not
&gt; sufficient; the reasoning is the source may change and no longer match
&gt; the packages we distributed. 
</pre>

<p>
Cygwin is a mixture of GNU GPL and MIT X11 licensing.  For the GPLed
packages, if your distribution of it was non-commercial, you can meet
your source-access obligation by referring people to where <em>you</em> got the
software from.  Otherwise, you have the above-referenced three-year
obligation, for which you may pass along all costs to those requesting
source.
</p>

<p>
Going by experience, the number of people actually willing to order a
source CD once you've clarifed that it's not on <em>your</em> dime is almost nil.
(I used to take care of this issue at a large Linux hardware firm that 
maintained and distributed its own full version of Red Hat Linux.  Care
to guess how many people requested source CD sets?  One, over three
years.  We sent them free, with our compliments.)
</p>

<p>
The <em>eWeek</em> article?  Oh, right.  It's mostly notorious whiner Warren
Woodford of MEPIS Linux complaining because he didn't bother to read the
GNU GPL, massively violated the copyrights of programmers whose terms he
failed to obey, and got his hand slapped.
</p>

<p>
Reporter Steven Vaughan-Nichols, who's usually really good, said:
</p>

<p>
   Woodford recently ran afoul of the GNU GPL (General Public License)
   requirement that downstream distributors of GPL code are obligated to
   provide source code to users in an easily accessible format.

Subject: [ILUG] Porting drivers from Windows (rant)
</pre>

<p>
Hi all,
    I'm currently writing Linux support for a piece of custom hardware -
I have Windows source code for hardware drivers and data conversion
algorithms, and I'm porting/re-writing that to Linux and I am beyond
unhappy at some of the intrinsically stupid things I am seeing.
</p>

<p>
Today's little bundle of joy regards writing to device registers.  It's
not actually so complicated - the I/O regions are set up automagically
during boot, your driver basically just has to tell the kernel (a) that
it now owns the appropriate region, and (b) how it wants the region to
be made visible to it.  Then you go and poke the registers that live
there, and the hardware goes and does what you said to.  Drive carefully.
</p>

<p>
Now, in the Windows driver, there is a little snippet of code like the
following.  It's part of the wake-up sequence for the hardware:
<pre>
    #define CTR_REG 0x4000
    ...
    WRITE_REGISTER_ULONG(CTR_REG,0);
</pre>
How obvious - it writes the value 0 to a 32-bit register located at
0x4000.  This is kindergarten stuff.  If you don't believe me, read
this page:
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/Kernel_r/hh/Kernel_r/k103_af58a3ec-4102-4a89-9c58-e56f99d793d0.xml.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/Kernel_r/hh/Kernel_r/k103_af58a3ec-4102-4a89-9c58-e56f99d793d0.xml.asp</a>
</p>

<p>
which says (the very first line):
    The WRITE_REGISTER_ULONG macro writes a ULONG value to the specified
address.
</p>

<p>
So, yea, we nod wisely, and write the equivalent under Linux, which
happens to be
<pre>
    iowrite32(0,CTR_REG);
</pre>
And yea, we would make many attempts to get a response.  We would poke
and prod.  We would reboot into Windows and check that the hardware
still worked.  Was the hardware sulking because we missed some
vanishingly obscure initialisation step?  We would examine our
documentation again and again - was it possible?  We would try and trick
the damn thing.  We would sacrifice goats.  Nada.  Not a whisper of
response.
</p>

<p>
Because, of course, the register isn't at 0x4000 at all.
</p>

<p>
It is (where else?) at 0x10000 (i.e. 0x4000 * 4).
</p>

<p>
Think about it...... and let the nausea sink in.
</p>

<p>
For those it hasn't hit yet, some <strong>genius</strong> in Redmond decided that, when
talking about 32-bit quantities, they were going to count 32-bits at a
time, like C array notation.  ("Hey Bill! I know this really cool way
of implementing WRITE_REGISTER_ULONG!").  Of course, they're still
going to call them "addresses".

Subject: [conspire] Compromise of a Debian Project host
</pre>
Early in the morning (European time) of last Wednesday, July 12, the
Debian Project figured out that one of its shared Internet hosts,
"gluck.debian.org", had been security compromised, and immediately took
it down to be studied, rebuilt from trusted program files, and back
within a day.  It look like, as with last time this sort of thing
happened, they detected the compromise pretty much immediately --
probably courtesy of monitoring from the intrusion detetion software
"AIDE".  As before, the package archives weren't penetrated.  ("gluck"
currently fills these roles via DNS aliases:  "cvs", "ddtp", "lintian",
"people", "popcon", "planet", "ports", and "release".  The machines
where packages are created and cryptographically signed are much more
heavily restricted.)
</p>

<p>
Their quick detection and correction are worth noting.  So is the avenue
of compromise (detailed below).  
</p>

<p>
Also worth noting is that, if you use your security token on a
compromised machine <em>anywhere</em>, it's equally prone to be stolen
regardless of whether it's a strong or weak password, or a public SSH
keypair, etc.  
</p>

<p>
Debian believes in transparency on security matters, which is why the
earlier (2003) compromise of "klecker", "gluck", "master", and "murphy"
was immediately and extensively analysed in public, on a set of pages
maintained by Wichert Akkerman:  <a href="http://www.wiggy.net/debian/explanation/">http://www.wiggy.net/debian/explanation/</a>
</p>

<p>
...which I then wrote about, here:  <a href="../issue98/moen.html">http://linuxgazette.net/issue98/moen.html</a>
I'm looking forward to a similar disclosure about the 2006 compromise.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, there's this Debian News article: <a href="http://www.debian.org/News/2006/20060713">http://www.debian.org/News/2006/20060713</a>
</p>

<p>
   At least one developer account has been compromised a while ago and
   has been used by an attacker to gain access to the Debian server. A
   recently discovered local root vulnerability in the Linux kernel has
   then been used to gain root access to the machine.
</p>

<p>
   At 02:43 UTC on July 12th suspicious mails were received and alarmed
   the Debian admins. The following investigation turned out that a
   developer account was compromised and that a local kernel
   vulnerability has been exploited to gain root access.

</p>

<p>
Ben recently called my attention to incoming mail being rejected at my
SMTP server because the system SPF daemon could not be reached.  More
recently, about an hour ago, a flurry of spam snuck through the system
because the SpamAssassin daemon had died.  And Exim4 (the SMTP daemon)
has occasionally entered a fault mode where a queued-up message is
processed repeatedly.
</p>

<p>
All of these epiphenomena turn out to have the same underlying cause:  
Baby needs new shoes.
</p>

<p>
Just as a frog put in a pot of cold water and brought slowly to a boil
will not jump out and save himself, mail servers reach the brink of
failure by... um... degrees.  In this case, what's been happening is
that my server's meagre 256MB of RAM is being badly overstressed.
</p>

<p>
The repeat-sending syndrome was an early clue:  The queue-handling Exim4
instance would send the queued mail out, and then call a different
routine to process final steps including deletion that just happened to 
require more RAM, which was not available so the Exim4 instance died
before cleanup could occur.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, I've sung the praises of GNU screen so effectively
that several other shell users (Hi, Karsten!  Hi, Ben!  Hi, Thomas![1])
have joined me in leaving it running 24x7 running (sometimes) large jobs
-- more RAM gone.  And last, the volume of incoming spam continues to
increase and find new tricks, while my primary SMTP-layer defence of
Exim4 rulesets isn't being updated because the host is a lame-duck
installation intended to be retired.
</p>

<p>
Right behind the primary defence, intended to backstop spam that gets
past Exim4's rules, is -- guess what?  SpamAssassin, a rather large,
slow, and RAM-grabbing Perl script, running in daemon mode and spawning
more instances as needed.  The busier and slower it gets, the more
RAM-grabbing instances.
</p>

<p>
So, we've been getting weird MTA repeated-mailing behaviour, and
mysteriously dying processes:  The kernel OOM-killer gets set loose,
and starts shooting large and/or busy processes in the head.  If I'm 
lucky, it's one of my mutt instances running under screen and reading
one of my carelessly overlarge mbox files.  Or screen itself.  If I'm
unlucky, it's spfd.  Or SpamAssassin.  Or Exim4.  Or Apache httpd.  Or
BIND9.  All of those have happened.
</p>

<p>
The pattern was obvious, but I've been reluctant to see it, in part
because it's a pain to deal with.
</p>

<p>
The only fix is to debug my problems with the intended replacement box
(needs a kernel with ability to load the root FS from software RAID1), 
configure its daemons for the needed services, sync up all data files,
and do a flag day.  The new box is better in every way, including 
its 1.5 GB of system RAM.
</p>

<p>
I need to do that.  You guys really can't.  I just need to find the
time.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, I'm using screen <em>less</em>.  (Karsten, if you can help in
that area, too, that would be appreciated.)
</p>

<p>
[1] Latter two names being a guess -- and it's not like there's anything
wrong with using screen.  It's great stuff.

I used to wonder what "unroutable address" meant in SMTP Delivery Status 
Notification messages, as it has always seemed more than a bit vague.
It turns out, it <em>is</em> vague.  ;-&gt;  It's the default Exim return value if
a message gets evaluated against all the Exim "router" handling routines to 
see if it meets any of their criteria for acceptance.  If not, it falls
through and generates return value text "unrouteable address" by default
(<a href="http://www.exim.org/exim-html-4.40/doc/html/spec_3.html#SECT3.10">http://www.exim.org/exim-html-4.40/doc/html/spec_3.html#SECT3.10</a>).  The
question then becomes <em>why</em>, in each case.  For TAG subscriber Barry
O'Donovan &lt;gazette at barryodonovan.com), only a little checking was
required to find out:
<pre>
  $ dig -t mx barryodonovan.com +short
  ;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached
  $ dig -t a barryodonovan.com +short
  ;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached
  $ whois barrydonovan.com | more

  Domain names in the .com and .net domains can now be registered
  with many different competing registrars. Go to <a href="http://www.internic.net">http://www.internic.net</a>

Because Barry's domain no longer exists, I've been getting one of the
below-cited nastygrams every time anyone posts to TAG.  So, I'm setting
his subscription to "nomail" in case he fixes his domain.  ('Course, he
might never figure out why he's ceased to receive TAG mail, but that's
the breaks.)

   [announcement] ntfs-3g: open source read-write driver  
   2006-07-14 10:39
</p>

<p>
   As part of the Linux-NTFS project, I'm happy to announce my
   contribution to ntfsmount and libntfs which resulted ntfs-3g, a
   read-write ntfs driver, capable for unlimited file creation and
   deletion.
 
   The driver was successfully tested very exhaustively for a longer
   period of time by many ways and methods, creating and destroying
   millions of files and directories on newly created images, and on
   over 40 real, very diverse NTFS images collected over the last four
   years.
 
   The README file is copied below which includes more general,
   performance and quality information with answers and future plans.
 
   Please make a backup of your NTFS volume by ntfsclone and try to
   reproducible break ntfs-3g, if you can. If you are able to do so
   then please let us know, preferable providing your NTFS metadata
   image, if it couln't be reproduced by other ways.
 
   The driver can be downloaded from
 	
   <a href="http://mlf.linux.rulez.org/mlf/ezaz/ntfs-3g-20070714-BETA.tgz">http://mlf.linux.rulez.org/mlf/ezaz/ntfs-3g-20070714-BETA.tgz</a>
 
   Please note that I'm leaving for an over 5,000 km long Far North and
   Arctic Ocean advanture on Sunday morning (European time) and won't be
   able to read and answer emails for almost a month (no, I'm not
   escaping, I plan to come back alive ;). Originally I planned to fix
   all the minor issues listed below but no more time left for me and I
   think it's better to release now, in case I would get lost somewhere
   on the road ;) Well, actually I hope that most issues will be
   resolved when I'm back!
 
   Happy testing, problem reporting and coding,
 
        -- Szaka

I expect I'll be needing to Google-search this post quite a lot, in the
future, to refute the inevitable claims to the contrary.

Subject: Re: [vox-tech] Purpose of "nobody" user?
</pre>
Yesterday, I was helping Melissa add a user account to her laptop.
I decided to just point her at KDE's "Kuser" (K-&gt;System-&gt;"User Manager")
GUI tool, mostly because I wanted to see it. ;)  ("adduser" is not hard to
use, but I figured most non-Unix-types would go hunting a GUI tool,
so wanted to familiarize myself with it.)
</p>

<p>
One thing she noticed was the user "nobody", which sounded supsicious.
And it had quite an insane UID (65534), compared to other user accounts.
Her first thought was to Google for 'nobody 65534', and found many, many
posts where people had obviously dumped their /etc/passwd to a mailing list
for help with this-or-that.  Based on this, she seemed happy enough to
know it's just some "thing" that Linux does/has.
</p>

<p>
For the life of me, I couldn't really explain <em>what</em> "nobody" is used for.
I'm familiar with it in terms of NCSA httpd and Apache, but beyond that...
A little help, here?  :^D
</p>

<p>
Thx!
</p>

<p>
-bill!
(PS - Google for '"nobody user" OR "user nobody" purpose linux' wasn't as
helpful as I had hoped. :^/  I also tried throwing 'FAQ' in there ;^) )

I'll take a stab at this.
</p>

<p>
The way I would explain it is that a *nix system has a variety of users
that are non-human.
</p>

<p>
They are users in the sense that they run processes that do not require
privileges to other parts of the system, and they maintain resources
(e.g. files and directories) to which other parts of the system do not
need access.  Therefore it is convenient and sensible to isolate them
from human users and from each other in the same way that human users
are isolated from each other.
</p>

<p>
The general idea is that your system is more secure if access is not
granted where it is not needed.  A non-human user may be a security
risk if, for example, it runs a program containing a flaw that lets
someone break in and run tasks with the privileges of that user.
</p>

<p>
I suppose someone chose the name "nobody" for one of these users
simply to emphasize that it's not human.  But there are many other
examples of such users, like apache, bind, daemon, mail, mysql and
news.
</p>

<p>
I hope this is not too condescending... I wrote it this way so that
newbies may also find it useful.

Quoting Daniel Pittman (daniel at rimspace.net):
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I wish you wouldn't.  SPF is great, in theory, but not really so hot in
&gt; practice.  Using it will only encourage others to adopt it.
</pre>

<p>
There's a lot of confusion about this.  Let's dissect it into parts:
<pre>
o  SPF reference records within a domain's DNS:  These allow the domain
   administrator to specify which IPs are those of the domain's 
   (and optionally, various subdomains') sole intended MX hosts -- 
   along with suggestions as to the degree of confidence that the 
   admin feels receiving SMTP hosts should grant to that data.
 
o  SPF-checking routines executed by a receiving SMTP host's MTA 
   during the incoming SMTP session, prior to saying yes or no to
   the delivery attempt.  (It's also possible to check SPF RRs at later
   points, such as during MDA execution, but less useful.)
</pre>
Speaking from a domain administrator's perspective, one has _no downside_
from publishing SPF RRs for one's domain.  It's good and useful data,
providing the public with a definitive means of detecting and rejecting
mail forged to dishonestly claim your domain as its origin, even mail
competently forging the 'envelope From' and Return-Path headers (Joe Jobs).  
It's categorically useful even to domain admins who favour alternate
approaches.  I.e., is you think Hadmut Danisch's Reverse-MX (RMX)
proposal was better designed, or Yahoo's DomainKeys, or SPF plus
Meng/Microsoft's Purported Responsible Address (PRA) header, or S/MIME, 
or Email Postmarks, or a full gpg web-of-trust architecture, or BATV, 
or Jim Fenton's Identified Internet Mail -- then nothing stops you from
participating in <em>all</em> of them, if you wish.
</p>

<p>
It would be a Good Thing even if nothing like SRS (Sender Rewriting
Scheme) had even been attempted, and every forwarding mechanism on the
globe other than mailing lists (which have rewritten 'envelope From' and
Return-Path all along) were to instantly and permanently break.  
</p>

<p>
Why?  _Because I own domains._  I'm therefore tired of spammers and
malware authors being able to Joe Job them believably.  Why would I
<em>not</em> spend five minutes writing a TXT RR that makes crystal clear that
mx4.pinkmeatproducts.com isn't a legitimate source for my domains' mail?
</p>

<p>
'No so hot', you say?  OK, compared to what?  The relevant comparison
for a domain owner is:  extant SPF record versus none.  Do you honestly 
assert that my domains would be better off without them?  If so, please
do explain.

Subject: Debian installer does not recognise ataraid array
Date: 18 Jul 2006 03:14:30 -0700
</pre>
I have two SATA HDs on a Silicon Simage 3112 RAID controller. This is
known as "fakeraid" or "ataraid" because it's not a proper hardware
RAID controller, it just buggers about with on-the-fly address
translations in the controller's BIOS. So it's a bit like software RAID
- and indeed inferior to Linux software RAID - but this is a dual-boot
box, which is why I'm using it. (Honestly, it makes Windows a <strong>lot</strong>
faster, like 50%+.)
</p>

<p>
So, I want to install Debian on it. I managed it under 2.4 by manually
coaxing the medley.o module into place, to recognise the array and let
me install on it. On the way I found and reported several bugs: a
conflict between siimage.o and via82cxxx.o (which is still unsolved in
kernel-source-2.4.27), the fact that ataraid modules were not loaded by
the installer, and the fact that medley.o was missing from the mkinitrd
script, which meant that I couldn't boot after the install!
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure if that second one is solved yet, but it doesn't matter
because this time I'm trying to install 2.6 (I am reinstalling rather
than upgrading because I made a ton of changes to the partition
structure). I know that 2.6 doesn't use the medley module, and that all
the fakeraid stuff is dealt with by something called the device mapper,
and a user-space tool called dmraid.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately I don't know any more than that, like how they work. When
I use the latest Debian installer CD, it boots 2.6 and finds all my
hardware and offers me sda and sdb as my HDs - it completely fails to
notice the fakeraid array.
</p>

<p>
Yes I have brought this to Debian's attention, but I'm asking here
because I really need to just know a few more basics about ataraid
handling in 2.6.x and the device mapper - can anyone point me towards a
HOWTO or idiot's guide for that?
</p>

<p>
Grateful also for any other advice on how to diagnose this problem. I
presume that the low-level hardware driver (sata_sil.o in this case) is
still needed - this is what's finding sda and sdb. But I don't know
what to do once that's loaded to find the ataraid array, and therefore
I don't know how to find out where the Debian installer is going
astray.
