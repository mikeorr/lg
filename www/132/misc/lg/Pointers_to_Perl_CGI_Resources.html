Hi Gang,
</p>

<p>
I could have Googl-ed to find plentiful of answers but decided
otherwise to seek wisdom here.
</p>

<p>
My plans are to develop simple web-based application using Perl
scripts and MySQL as back-end for data storage. Am planning to host
the application using Apache http server. Am aware that Perl modules
(DBI) are needed to interact with database. I have little knowledge of
db design.
</p>

<p>
My question :
</p>

<p>
Am lost here, how to start this whole activity ? Reason is, am not
comfortable in embedding the Perl scripts with HTML tags and regular
functions for data management needs.
</p>

<p>
Intention is to keep the, scripts providing the front-end and back-end
processing, separate and not mix all in the same script(s).
</p>

<p>
Looking forward to your suggestions.
</p>

<p>
/Ram
</p>

Getting this part correct is <em>paramount</em>.  I have no idea what the
scale of your project is, but even a little knowledge of normalisation
would go a long way into helping you.  This is the main area your time
should be focused on, since if you can't define your database schema
with any reliability the whole thing will fall apart at the seams.

That's not how it works.  Ideally your CGI pages should just be perl
scripts which run via mod_perl.  There's always things like the CGI
module and CARP to help you.
</p>

<p>
I realise this is a non-useful reply, but if you can be more specific
about your requirements, then maybe we can tailor our answers to you.

Thanks for your suggestions. This should probably help me to address
this topic with much care while designing the db; of course, the
project is aimed at a group of ~40 developers but if the tool turns
out be valuable (in terms of increasing productivity), then may be
others ask for it.
</p>

<p>
Do you think, mysql documentation would be a good place to start ?

<p>
Am not at my workplace now to provide sample of code which takes care
of the initial screen but I think this would not be starting point for
me.
</p>

<p>
Yes, am planning to use CGI module.
</p>

<p>
Incidentally, I stumbled upon this mod_perl thing but unable to
understand the adv of mod_perl over CGI.
</p>

<p>
Second, am still in a dilemma which OS env to use ? Linux or Win.
</p>

<p>
I prefer Linux as, almost all these are already available in my home
system running Fedora core 5.

You seem to be skirting around a more fundamental problem:  not knowing
where to start.  If this is the case, it makes me wonder just how
efficient the thing is that you're trying to do.  Do the people this
project is aimed at (and you've said there's fourty of them) have <em>any</em>
idea about Perl/MySQL integration?  If not, you're screwed.

Umm, because generally CGIs suck?  What happens is that the interpreter
(for whatever language the CGI is written in; in this case Perl) is
spawned for every instance the page is viewed.  Hence you can quickly
see how slow and cumbersome it would get for a multi-user environment.
Not to mention that persistent states would be compromised.  At least if
it is via mod_perl, it's Apache which spawns the process.  This means
that only one instance need be created for all instances it is viewed at
if it is concurrent.

I'd go with RISCOS; the name seems more apt in this instance.

Then there you go.  ;)  Again, until you provide more details, I can't
help you.  Note that my day job is perl programming with CGIs, so make
use of this resource.  :P

<p>
Couple of years back, I have been introduced and worked on mysql but
for very limited time (~ 6 months with no formal training) as part of
requirement to develop web based application / tools. Though, I
remember (very vaguely) some of the concepts but need to refresh the
basics and those parts that will be needed for the current assignment.

That sounds like, mod_perl is the way to go.

</p>

<p>
I have written / come up with basic script (very very primitive to say
the least) which I would like to share with you.
</p>

<p>
It was heartening to note that you are willing to extend your guidance
in this regd. Thanks very much.
</p>

<p>
Hence, am considering to take your help / mentoring in this project
(personally, I would like to make this happen, even if I do not have
the chance to setup this project at my workplace, it will give me
needed exp with web-based appln development), if you are willing.

Certainly, it's not that kind; but it is something, I tell / impose to
myself to improve skills and keep alive my interests in technical things
(and not just spend the rest of my preofessional career in only management).
Of course, there is a day job which keeps me busy for the most part <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">

Sure, that's not fair on my part to ask others to do my work; i do not stand
to gain anything in that way.
