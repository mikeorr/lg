I have a similar Zaurus 3100. I checked out both Openzaurus' OPIE &amp; GPE. They 
were nice, but felt too similar to a palm pilot or a "plain" old PDA.
</p>

<p>
If you really want your Zaurus to be just like a "regular" PC running a full 
blown OS, OpenBSD on the Zaurus is great. It's the full OS installation with 
gcc, X windows, etc. Basically, if it compiles on OpenBSD it'll work on the 
Zaurus. Completely self-hosted development--no need for cross compilers on 
other boxes. Combined with a lightweight desktop such as blackbox it's amazing. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<strong>Nice</strong> tip, Jeff. I've spent time playing around with a PDA (iPaq) in the
past, but had regretfully concluded that it's still a bit too early in
the game to really rely on one for mobile computing (Opie and GPE went a
long way toward convincing me otherwise, but weren't quite good enough.)
</p>

<p>
The features that Edgar described, plus your follow-up here, have
definitely got me thinking about a PDA again - although the price of the
3100 seems a little too steep for me at the moment. I'll give it a few
months... I'm sure there will be something New And Hot and Amazing by
that time (Moore's law says so, anyway), the 3100 will cost about the
same as a cup of coffee and a good Danish, and all will be well in my
world. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Oh, heck no. Senator McCarthy would have called Linux and OpenBSD
"fellow travelers" [1] - all Open Source discussion is welcome here.
Although most of our content is focused on Linux, for the times when a
Linux solution is not yet available, it's <em>very</em> nice to hear that
another Free Unixy OS is.

&gt; I did try to find a similar "full install" with the linux kernel, but there 
&gt; really wasn't anything. Someone had started and abandoned putting debian on 
&gt; there, which would have been cool. I poked at pdaXrom(?) or similar, but it 
&gt; was just different but not that much better--still too much of a PDA than a 
&gt; computer for me. I also set up all the cross compilers and all that jazz 
&gt; for openzaurus, but man, that's quite a bit of work just to get started...
&gt; 
&gt; The ability to just `tar zxf foo.tar.gz &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install` right in 
&gt; your pocket is just too good. At one point I was running openbsd-current so 
&gt; the entire install was compiled on the device itself! <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Yeah, that carries an extremely high coolness factor. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> It must have
taken a while, though!

&gt; 
&gt; I got one from <a href="http://pricejapan.com/">http://pricejapan.com/</a> and another from some company I 
&gt; forget which was real slow and sucked. The German company that Edgar 
&gt; mentions is very nice because they make it easy to get backup ROMs, provide 
&gt; good docs online, etc. They are probably a good company to support. I'm not 
&gt; sure the prices will fall to fast or speeds go up /too/ quickly on these 
&gt; things as they are quite niche. There are hacks online on how to add 8 gig 
&gt; drives and stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; Did I mention even things like enlightenment work? Abiword? etc. Granted 
&gt; some are quite slow, but they make it. I did a gimp setup which basically 
&gt; removes all the extra plugins, brushes, etc. so it's more workable--xpaint 
&gt; is more lightweight though... OpenGL games work fine. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

&gt; The GUI web browsers are konq-e (an old version of konqueror embedded 
&gt; someone did a couple years back), minimo (embedded mozilla--a bit old as 
&gt; well). They don't handle funky websites very well. Things like lynx, 
&gt; links+, elinks, etc work fine and links+ even in graphical mode (though its 
&gt; a console browser). w3m I can't get to compile due to something weird in 
&gt; boehm-gc... So browsing is decent, but not perfect. To make it perfect, I 
&gt; just run `firefox` on a remote box and export the display. It's X remember! 
&gt; Then you save RAM, get javascript, etc...
&gt;
&gt; Sorry, am I gushing?
</pre>
</p>

<p>
With full justification, if so. Given the above, I would be too.
</p>

<p>
Despite my joking about the price, this <strong>is</strong> the direction in which
computing is moving. If not within the next year, then certainly within
the next five years this kind of machines - and much more powerful ones,
as well - will be commodity items, with prices to match. I'm really
looking forward to that.

<pre>
&gt; There are some drawbacks to openbsd:
&gt; 
&gt; * The openbsd install is a small trick--but if you still have the original 
&gt; japanese (or english translated) ROM, its straightforward (such as supplied 
&gt; by the german vendor). It even detects my wifi card and installs across the 
&gt; 'net. If you have openzaurus on there already you have to revert to the 
&gt;  old ROMs before installing which can be /quite/ a hassle. I know of no 
&gt; other way to do it.
&gt; 
&gt; * Screen rotation doesn't work on the fly because I don't think it's 
&gt; supported in X.
&gt; 
&gt; * The Secure Digital card reader doesn't have a driver (i think openzaurus 
&gt; gets around this by `insmod -f`ing the binary driver from Sharp, but I 
&gt; don't know for sure).
&gt; 
&gt; * Sometimes it freaks coming out of sleep mode. This probably happens in 
&gt; linux too. It seems to be happening less (I have 3.9 on here now).
&gt; 
&gt; * The install is a bit more difficult than a typical i386 openbsd install 
&gt; and an openbsd install is quite a bit more difficult than a "standard" 
&gt; linux install. Partitioning is probably the most confusing for gnulinux 
&gt; folks.
</pre>

<p>
Thanks, Jeff; this will make a good "from the front lines" report for
any of our readers who want to install a free Unix-flavor OS on a PDA.
Much appreciated!

<p>
I'm thinking in terms of the economies of scale when the "small"
revolution finally takes off (alas, the timing of this is the rock on
which many ventures have foundered so far...) The two things that
everyone appears to be waiting for is a) a reasonable input method for
PDAs (carrying a fold-up keyboard is somewhere between an oddity and a
non-starter), and b) a display that can be read by the over-40 set
without squinting. There's a lot of new stuff in the latter category,
and a few tentative advances in the former; the important thing is that
there's now a "big money" sign attached to progress in either one, and
that tends to focus people's energies quite well. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
I wouldn't mind carrying a roll-up keyboard and a top-quality PDA
instead of a laptop if I could do everything I need. Add some sort of a
good-quality collapsible display on top of that, and you'd own 3/4 of
the laptop market within the year, and the rest within five years. I
don't know when it's going to happen, but it's not a matter of "if"
anymore.

&gt; What we all want is a battery revolution... (and an FPU...)
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Have you <strong>seen</strong> the latest generation of batteries in the power tool
market? If you haven't, stop by your local hardware store. 1/3rd the
weight of the old NiCds, and about twice as much output torque as the
average <strong>corded</strong> tools (!) I'm going to be buying one of these tool kits
in the near future:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.homedepot.com/prel80/HDUS/EN_US/jsearch/product.jsp?pn=100490041">http://www.homedepot.com/prel80/HDUS/EN_US/jsearch/product.jsp?pn=100490041</a>
</p>

<p>
It's not just hype, either; I've spent an hour or two at the store
talking to grimy contractors who've been buying these things by the
truckload, and they're all just raving about the ability to bust
concrete and drill holes all day long without stopping or changing
batteries.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Also, look up "betavoltaics", "nanobattery", "zinc matrix", and
"nanotube capacitors" (the last is <strong>very</strong> exciting - essentially instant
charge, "battery life" thousands of times longer than a standard
battery, etc.) There's a lot of good stuff on the way, and we're
definitely headed in the right direction.
