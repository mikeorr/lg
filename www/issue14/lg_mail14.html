Subject: <B> Linux on Compaq </B> <BR> 
From: afarnsworth@S1.DRC.COM
<P> 
Hi,<BR> 
  I just received a brand spanking new Compaq Deskpro 6000 with Adaptec 
2940U SCSI card and Compaq Netflex III ethernet card.  I think I have the 
SCSI card problem whipped, but how do I find drivers for the Netflex III 
card?  I have check the usual places, does it even exist?
<P> 
  The Compaq Deskpro 6000 is a fairly new 
system out, though Compaq has been building Deskpro's for many years.  The 
only problem I have had with them is their proprietary hardware.  This is 
usually either their Network cards or their Hard drive controllers 
(usually RAID controllers).  Other than that, it's pretty standard.
<P> 
Please reply to my email address : afarnsworth@s1.drc.com for I don't have 
the ability to check the gazette often.  Thanks.

Subject: Office-tools
From: J.Hernetkoski, jjjj@zenith.yok.utu.fi
<P> 
Hi!
Could you write an article about these two office-package for Linux:
<ul>
<li>Applixware 
<li>StarOffice
</ul>
Thanks <BR> 
Jukka Hernetkoski
<blockquote> <I> 
(An article about StarOffice by Dwight Johnson appeared in issue 9 of 
Linux Gazette. An article about Applixware will be in the April issue
of Linux Journal. I can probably get permission to run it in LG also, but
not until that issue of LJ is on the stands. Which means it would also be
the April issue of LG. Anyone want to do one sooner?--Editor)

Subject: <B> Linux samba win95 </B> <BR> 
From: nravin@cs.fit.edu
<P> 
-I am a system administrator....manages 20 PC's....all running windows95
<P> 
-We were running Windows NT server(4.0) in the lab for some time
Then we realised we had only 10 client access licenses and so were
forced tp SWITCH to Linux.
<P> 
-Linux emulates NT, as you may know
<P> 
-I had the CONFIG.POL working perfectly with the NT network.
-But when I switched to Linux I lost that control.  No longer are the
clients able to access the CONFIG.POL file even though I have kept it in
the NETLOGON share.
<P> 
-Now whosoever uses the PC's(most are novices) play around with  the
settings( of client) and is giving me nightmares, since I cannot lock
them out.
<P> 
-Is there a way out?  How can I make the clients read the system
policies from the CONFIG.POL using Linux server?
<P> 
Please help.
<P> 
Thanks <BR>

Subject: <B> dbms connectivity </B> <BR> 
From: Mike Lewis, mlewis@burly.com
<P> 
Hi.  I love linux but most of the projects I work on preclude it because
of a lack of dbms connectivity.  None of the major dbms players (Oracle,
Sybase, Informix, etc.) or 3rd party developers (Intersolv, Visigenic,
etc.) offer access from a linux client.  I've tried a middleware
solution from Openlink and I guess you could run SCO drivers with
emulation, assuming you can get your hands on the low-level libraries.  
<P> 
This seems to be the only thing standing in the way of Linux getting
business worthy respect.  Could you put together a piece on this issue
and explore the future availability of dbms connectivity from linux?
<P> 
Thanks. <BR> 
Mike

Hi there! I just got Linux from RedHat and I have been wondering how to do
Animations in XWindows. I would like a little picture box on the lower
right hand corner of the screen on startup to start an animation. Is this
possible? If it is, please email me back with instructions!!! Thanks for
the help.

Subject: <B> C++ Programming w/ Linux </B> <BR> 
From: James Cannon, cannonj@jads.kirtland.af.mil
<P> 
Hi,<BR> 
	About a month ago I asked about help with C++ programming on Linux. I
am currently using the Walnut Creek Slackware, kernel 1.3.20. I had a
hard time getting a simple &quot;Hello World&quot; program to compile. &quot;cc&quot;
couldn't find the &quot;.h&quot; files like &quot;stdio.h&quot;, which are normally in
/usr/include. I had to create a &quot;$INCLUDE&quot; variable in my &quot;.profile&quot;.
So, when compiling, I used &quot;g++ -I $INCLUDE -o hello hello.c&quot; to
compile. 
<P> 
Well, I received help via e-mail pointing me to this page:<BR>

(RE: Color depths in X)
<P> 
Well, I know this isn't really a fix, and it's not that great, but I
have 2 scripts.  startx which starts me in 16 bit color and start8,
which starts in 8 bit.  As I said, not a solution, but a pretty painless
alternative...

Subject: <B>Further note about the spiral notebook page design.</B><BR>
From: Ben Boule, bouleb@rpi.edu
<P> 
Someone else noted that his web browser didn't correctly show the spiral 
notebook background.  I use Netscape, so that isn't a problem for me, but 
I do have another problem with the background.  It's very hard to look at 
on an interlaced display.  I can always switch to a non-interlaced mode 
in XFree86, but I'd bet some people can't.  I know that the interlaced 
mode that I use looks fine on 99.99% of web pages, so it usually isn't a 
problem for me.
<P> 
Thanks,<BR>

To: Stephen, Tauche%fbm%mfh@mfhdvzis.mfh-iserlohn.de <BR> 
<P> 
Unfortunately, Banyan is a pretty tight (read: won't work with much) OS,
so you are pretty limited.  There is a way for Linux to sign onto
Banyan, but you have to use DOSEMU.60.1.  The later versions will not 
work.  (Disclaimer:  I have not used the patch for dosemu.60.4).  If you
have not used DOSEMU, the setup is fairly straightforward.
<P> 
As for using Linux as a resource, you will have to use IP stuff (ftp,
telnet, etc) to do so.  There are no ports for Linux<->Banyan stuff.
<P> 
BTW, Jon is still doing Linux and Banyan.  His site
(http://www.netmind.com) is running Linux!  Check it out!

Subject: <B> Vines IP and TCP/IP </B> <BR> 
From: Denis Dimick, ddimick@irvine.ddddf.com
<P> 
Back on Dec 5, 1996 Stefan wrote wanting help with Vines. <BR> 
**************************************************************
<P> 
Stefan the problem you're having sounds like the Vines Servers are not passing 
TCP/IP.. By default Banyan Vines doesn't pass route TCP/IP thru the servers. 
You have to have the TCP/IP option installed on all the servers your going 
to route thru. This option cost $$$ about $1200.00 US if I remember 
correctly. So there's p[robally a good chance your school didn't buy this 
option...
<P> 
Vines doesn't have anything that will cause IP to tunnel via Vines IP.. So 
your only chance might be to get access to the same segment that the 
internet is running off of... But it sounds like your sysadmin is using the 
Banyan Server as the gateway to the internet, if this is the case your out 
of luck...
<P> 
Since I've worked with Banyan Vines for the last 7 years, I'm sorry to say 
you might not be able to set up the Linux Box on the internet routing thru 
your Banyan Servers...

Subject: <B> isssue 8 & ftp server </B><BR> 
From: Rick Lim, rick_lim@bc.sympatico.ca <BR> 
<P> 
Hi there, <BR> 
thanks for hosting the gazette.
Is there a way of just downloading the
text of each issue?
I have downloaded  LinuxGazette_jan97.tar.gz
and it seems that issue8.txt is missing.
also I have tried to ftp  LinuxGazette_dec96.tar.gz
but after 1770k of 2751k the server seemingly
goes into ignore mode, this has happened about
5 times.
<P> 
Thanks again <BR> 
rick
<blockquote> <I>
(Don't know why you are having trouble ftp'ing LinuxGazette_dec96.tar.gz,
but can tell you that you have LinuxGazette_jan97.tar.gz you have
everything that is in dec96. We took over LG for issue 9, so there is no
file issue8.txt or 1 to 7 either. We use Lynx to save the HTML as text.
Perhaps we'll do it for 1-8 one day when we have time. --Editor)
