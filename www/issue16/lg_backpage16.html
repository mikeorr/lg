giving us their tips and tricks and making suggestions. Thanks also to our
new mirror sites.

2 Cent Tips and The Answer Guy. I'm going to be giving her more and
more each month.

I've had a lot of fun going to see the "Star Wars" movies again. Space movies
are so much more fun at a theater. I was amazed to discover that I
can remember the first time I had seen each of them (theatre, company,
etc.). I was pleased to see so many kids there enjoying the epic for the first
time on a big screen.
Riley and I had a lot of fun competing to see who recognized new scenes
first (nudge, nudge).
I thought they did a pretty smooth job of inserting
the scenes without being annoyingly noticeable. I still have to wonder
how the people of Tatooie kept the streets clean with dinosaurs as
pack animals? 
<P>
Have fun!
