I run Samba 2.2.3a on RH Linux 7.3 as the Domain Controller.  I have all
my Windows clients connecting fine to it but have trouble with Mac
clients, no idea how to log them on.  I also attempted to have the Mac
client connect to the Linux POP3 and SMTP server (Sendmail) to no avail
probably because the Mac is not welcome on the network. I am connecting
the Mac using wired ethernet to a Network switch.

You need to ensure that you're using the 'appletalk' protocol. This has to
be enabled in the kernel. There are also userspace programs that are
needed for this.

You don't use AppleTalk to connect to a POP or SMTP server. That's pure
TCP/IP.

If we're talking about a Mac OS X client, that comes with Windows
filesharing built in. Classic Mac OS is of course a different problem.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Actually, MacOS X knows how to speak Samba/mswin sharing now too; their
client side tool is called DAVE, and it used to be third party software
for MacOS 9.  If you want to install Mac style sharing on your Linux
box, the app you're looking for is called netatalk.  I used it years ago
and it was a breeze to setup - had 'em working faster than their mswin
cousins in the same office.

If you're using OS X you can call up a connect dialog with Cmd-K and
enter the address smb://&lt;ip_of_server&gt;. You'll need an IP address, of course
-- check your network preferences pane to make sure.

<BR>Question by Joseph Lalingo (ah300 from torfree.net)

<P>
Hi,
</P>
<P>
I installed RedHat Linux 9 via the cd-rw, successfully, but the cdrom
was not seen. I know the cdrom is still connected internally as I
haven't interfered with the system's insides (which came with a a cdrom
and cd-rw) internally. The cd-rw is understood to be the cdrom and there
is now NO <TT>/mnt/cdrom1</TT> but there IS a <TT>/mnt/cdrom.</TT>
</P>
<P>
The cdrom door does not open, yet the light of the cdrom is on.
</P>
<P>
Joe
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Thomas] 
"The lights are on but there's no one home". <TT>/mnt/cdrom</TT> is the mount-point
location of your cdrom drive. It is arbitrary and you can use anything you
like. These are defined (or should be) in <TT>/etc/fstab.</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you look in that file, you should have a line similar to:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>/dev/cdrom      /cdrom          iso9660 ro,user,noauto          0       0
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Here, <TT>/dev/cdrom</TT> is in turn a symlink that points to my main cdrom device:
<TT>/dev/hdd.</TT> This then gets mounted to <TT>/cdrom</TT>, when I issue the command:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>mount /cdrom
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I suspect your troubles come from you missing an entry in <TT>/etc/fstab.</TT> If
you wanted to mount the second drive as <TT>/mnt/cdrom1</TT>, then look at the
existing line in the <TT>/etc/fstab</TT> file, and modify it to reflect the new
drive.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The device name (<TT>/dev/xxx</TT>) can be got from viewing:

<P>
Possibly there's not a sysadmin around who hasn't needed to do a host
lookup now and then, to make sure they know what addresses are really
being found when a DNS lookup is made.
</P>
<P>
nslookup is deprecated, host can be confusing, dig is the nice tool for
the job - regardless of attempts to claim it is old too, it will be
around a long time.  But who really wants to get a long listing full of
semicolon comments and things?

Hi,
</P>
<P>
I had an annoying little problem: My home network has grown to 3 PC's --
one directly on the phone line, the others connected via WLAN. Usually I
would pick one dial-up provider and stick with that. Unfortunately the
German ISP's are a big mess of call-by call providers with constantly
changing tarifs.
</P>
<P>
The directly connected box is only the dial-in and firewall/NAT Router,
the other two are my Laptop and desktop.
</P>
<P>
The annoying problem: Everytime I change the provider I had to change
the resolv.conf on all systems according to the new nameservers as
transmitted via [i]ppp protocol.
</P>
<P><DL><DT>
My solution: dproxy
<DD><A HREF="http://dproxy.sourceforge.net"
	>http://dproxy.sourceforge.net</A>
</DL></P>
<P>
It serves as a proxy/cache for DNS lookups. It uses regular sys-calls
for namelookups and reacts instantly (no kill -HUP or similar) to new
entries in <TT>/etc/resolv.conf.</TT> This is on the router of course and
everytime pppd changes the resolv.conf for the new provider it simply
uses the new values.
</P>
<P>
The other two machines have the router as the nameserver and always get
the correct information (even offline, so a connection is of course not
possible). No manual changing anymore.
</P>
<P>
K.-H.

<P>
Sometimes, despite our best eforts with "unzip -L", we end up with a
bunch of files the names of which are ALL IN CAPS. The easy way to deal
with these is with a simple utility that I call "lc". (Also, should you
ever need such a thing, creating a complementary "uc" would be an
obvious modification.)
</P>

<blockquote><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl -w
# Created by Ben Okopnik on Fri Jul 25 09:13:22 EDT 2003

die "Usage: ", $0 =~ /([^\/]+)$/, " &lt;FILE[S]_TO_LOWERCASE&gt;\n" unless @ARGV;

rename $_, lc for @ARGV
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
Note that you can specify multiple files or even shell wildcards at the
command line; it's perfectly happy to chew on whatever you supply.

<P>
Hi,
</P>
<P>
I've found a useful side effect of running smartd on my drives at home
which I've used for a while now
to monitor the temperature in my apartment.  A lot of newer IDE drives,
especially IBM/Hitachi's and SCSI
hard disks monitor the drive temperature.  I've found this to be a
useful way to figure out how hot it is
in my computer room at home :D
</P>
<P>
Assuming you've already installed smartmontools, this was tested with
version 5.26:
</P>

<blockquote><pre># smartctl -a /dev/hda | grep 194
194 Temperature_Celsius     0x0002   161   161   000    Old_age
Always       -       34 (Lifetime Min/Max 20/37)
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
As you can see the drive is a toasty 34 degrees celsius.  Of about 5-7
degrees above ambient, it's about 27-29C
or 80-85F in that room right now.  Not great for the equipment but
survivable.  Anyway, not terribly useful,
but interesting nonetheless :D
</P>

Yan

<P>
There are times when the mail just won't go through, for any of a host
of reasons. Your ISP's server may be down, your own mail programs don't
work, whatever - and of course, this happens at the most critical times,
"when it absolutely, positively has to be there." Well, assuming that
your recipient's mail server is working, you can bypass most of the
chain - at least your end of it. This can also be a good testing tool.
It lacks a few refinements (e.g., there's no subject and the address you
supply is actually used as the normally hidden "From" header rather than
the friendlier and visible "From:"), but it will at least get the
content across.
</P>

<blockquote><pre>ben@Fenrir:~/Docs$ telnet badabing.com 25

Hi, Joe - it's me!

</pre></blockquote>
<P>
To recap - I connected to port 25 (SMTP) at badabing.com, identified my
server via HELO ("hello"), to which the server responded with its own
name. I then told it who the MAIL was FROM: and who the recipient (RCPT)
is supposed to be, and asked it to stand by for the actual DATA, which
it told me to end with a return, a period, and a return. When I was
done, I typed "QUIT" to exit.
</P>
<P>
This is not for everyday use, but can be a very handy tool for those
times when you've just got to get your mail across despite problems.

<P>
In my consulting I find myself running into an awful lot of systems
booting off of 'vmlinuz' in the root directory.  What kernel is that?
How the heck would I know?
</P>
<P>
I'll tell you how I ask it :D
</P>

<blockquote><pre>[root@somebox] /# strings vmlinuz | grep 200
2.6.0-test7-1-386 (herbert@gondolin) #1 Sun Oct 12 10:29:56 EST 2003
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
Why does this work?  Because now that we're a few years into the
century, nearly all the kernels contain something with a year 2000 or
later, and we'll have 200n year numbers for a while yet.  On an older
system, try 199 - Linux isn't old enough to have kernels from 1980
unless someone is playing serious games with their clock.  You could
probably look for the @ sign, but chances are too good of finding one
alone somewhere in the binary portion of the code.
