<h1>Transporting Files between Linux and Windows</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/raby.html">Dale Raby</A></b></p>

<p>

<p> A long time ago in a galaxy far... no
that isn't quite right. Well, it was a while ago, 1999 or so, as I
recall. In any case, it was at that particular Barbourian Now when I
finally decided to jump into "modern" times and abandon my old
Tandy 600 laptop for something that could actually "surf the web",
as it was known back in those innocent times. So I went out and
bought a used machine running Windows 95.
</p>

<p> Having been rather flush with cash at
the time, I also bought a Hewlett-Packard printer and an IBM parallel
port scanner. Shortly after this, I discovered what a really rotten
OS Windows of that era was. I think it was after the third or fourth
time I had to take the machine in for yet another fifty dollar repair
that I began to search for alternatives and discovered Linux. It was
a boxed copy of Mandrake 6.5... which was even packaged with a
ready-made boot disc.
</p>

<p> Unfortunately, Linux did not support my
scanner... and it still doesn't. I did without it for a time, but
eventually I got another Windows machine up and limping just so I
could have scanner capability. Transferring image files to the Linux
machine was a laborious process involving copying to an Iomega Zip
disk and then re-copying them to the Linux machine's hard drive, or
emailing them to myself from the Windows machine and receiving them
on the Linux machine. This was also a laborious task... especially
with the 28.8 modems I was using at the time.
</p>

<p> Eventually, I set up a LAN... which was
a terrifying prospect at first that I put off for several years until
I finally broke down. I had since acquired a Sony Mavica camera,
which was also not supported under Linux, though I had a workaround
in the floppy discs the Mavica could use. It was much easier and
faster to transfer the images from the Sony Memory Stick to the
Windows machine, however. 
</p>

<p> The LAN made it possible to transfer
files, from one computer to the other, though it was by no means
easy. I don't care what anyone says; SAMBA IS NOT simple to set up!
By this time, I had pretty much abandoned Windows for all uses except
supporting my legacy scanner and camera, and was getting to be fairly
comfortable with command lines in a Bash shell and the use of common
Linux applications like the GIMP.
</p>

</p>

<p> I still had no easy way to get the files to my Linux machine,
even though there was no theoretical hardware limitation. I am many
things, but I am not by any stretch an IT professional. I was
however, blessed with a web-buddy of genius level IQ; one Mae Ling
Mak, formerly of the late Maximum Linux magazine. She dropped a few
terms I had never heard before; 'scp' and 'Cygwin'. Now, it being too
embarrassing for a studly alpha male type such as myself to actually
admit to an attractive young woman that I didn't know what those
terms meant, I went Googling. I find that I often do quite a bit of
Googling whenever I receive an email from Mae Ling Mak. 
</p>

<p> OK - Cygwin is, for all practical
purposes, a Windows application that gives you a Bash shell. Within
this shell, one can run many common Linux/Unix applications on top of
the Windows OS. When it is installed, one makes the choices of which
applications one needs. If you want Mutt and GnuPG, for example, you
simply check those boxes during the setup process, and they are
installed for you. 
</p>

<p> 'scp' is the "secure copy protocol".
It allows one to transfer files from one location to another
within the LAN or even to a server on the Internet. Using the '-r'
option, one can transfer entire directories intact with all their
embedded children. One of the nice things about 'scp' is that anything
sent this way is automatically encrypted so that nobody can read what
is sent. Read between the lines here.
</p>

<p>
<img src="misc/raby/cyg1.jpg" name="graphics1" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10">
</p>

<p> Now, using 'scp' from a Cygwin Bash shell will allow one to
transfer files from the Windows machine with obsolete non-Linux
supported hardware to the Linux machine using a command line. 
</p>

<p> Two problems then manifested
themselves; I was not familiar enough with the 'scp' command to
remember the procedure from one week to the next, and the Windows
directory hierarchy is complex and confusing to anyone used to
Unix/Linux. Also, as noted in the illustration, one cannot navigate
double-named directories with Bash, so my default Windows ME
directories My Pictures, My Documents, and Program Files, are still
unreachable with Cygwin. 
</p>

<p class="editorial">[ In fact, they are indeed reachable - but, just like
filenames that contain whitespace in *nix, they require a bit of twiddling.
Namely, surrounding the file or directory name with quotes - i.e.  <span
style="color: black">cd "My Pictures"</span>, etc. Conversely, you could
use wildcards: <span style="color: black">ls *Pictures</span> or even <span
style="color: black">ls My*Pictures</span> should work fine. -- Ben ]</p>

<p> By doing a little Googling, I got the
proper command sequence ironed out. Then Mae Ling jumped into my head
from a few years back when she wrote an article about scripts. After
a little consideration, I created a text file containing the command
sequence to transfer my files to the host computer called "beam".
</p>

<p> The simplest way to do this is to
invoke 'vi', as "vi beam", and paste the text below into it, suitably
modified to suit your own system. You will need to substitute your
own username on the Linux system, and you may be able to use the
domain name of the host computer, rather than the IP address I used,
depending on how you have your LAN set up. The '-r' option recursively
copies the entire specified directory and its contents - in this case,
that's "/home/dale/transporter" - to the host computer. The comments
are, of course, optional.
</p>

<pre> 
# this is an scp command file. To use it, transfer files to the
# &quot;transporter&quot; directory and then invoke the command line
# below or simply type &quot;./beam&quot; in a Cygwin bash shell.

scp -r transporter dale@192.168.1.12:/home/dale
</pre>

<p> Next, I created a new directory, thusly: "<code>mkdir
transporter</code>". Now I had a command file to "remember" the command
sequence for me, as well as a place to store documents I wished transported
to the host computer (the "transporter" directory). This directory can be
accessed using the Windows GUI, which sidesteps the double name problem.
</p>

<p> By simply typing in "<code>./beam</code>", one can initiate transport.
When you do this, you will be prompted for the password you set up on the
Linux machine and after entering it, the directory "transporter" magically
appears in your home directory on the host machine. Upon browsing it, you
will find all your files intact. 
</p>

<p> No fuss, no
muss. Now you can open all those .bmp images with the GIMP and alter
them to your heart's content.
</p>

<p> For proper
housekeeping, one must clear the transporter platform after every
use... on both ends! If you do not do this, you may have to dig
through a pile of tribbles to find what you just transported. Note
also, that any file of the same name will be overwritten by the
subsequent version of it. I usually access the files as transported
and after modifying them, use the "save as" option from the file
menu of most Linux applications to put them in different directories.
</p>

<p class="editorial">[ This kind of problem in *nix is traditionally
handled by creating a new, time-stamped directory at the "receiver" end
during each upload. This avoids conflict with existing files, but requires
occasional cleanup to conserve disk space. -- Ben ]</p>

<p> Then I do a "./jayne":</p>

<pre> 
#this script sends Jayne and Vera to &quot;clear&quot; the transporter platform.
rm -rf transporter
</pre>

<p>
<img src="misc/raby/jayne.jpg" name="graphics3" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10">
</p>

<p> You can use the 'jayne' command file only with caution, like
Adam Baldwin's character. 'jayne' is dangerous and will not care if
you forgot to move the files off the transporter platform... he will
simply kill them all and give them to the Reavers. You will not be
able to recover them. If you want to watch Jayne and Vera do their
evil work, you can use the '-v' option, and then you will see a listing
as Jayne makes each kill. 
</p>

<p> The 'jayne' command should not be used on the Cygwin end of things, as
it deletes the "transporter" directory. If you want to run a 'jayne'
command on both ends, you have to remember to "mkdir transporter" before
you can use the transporter again.
</p>

<p> If you want
to, I suppose you could make another command file and call it either
"scotty", or "kaylee", depending upon whether you are a
member of Star Fleet or the Browncoats. Scripts do indeed invoke a
certain amount of Serenity.

<p>
Dale A. Raby is an ornery old man who started out on the original IBM PC back
in the day of running MS-DOS programs while convalescing in Ireland Army
Community Hospital and working for Captain James. Upon release from that
particular episode of his military service, he bought a Tandy 600 laptop
which still works after a fashion.
</p>

<p>
He picked up a more "modern" computer in 1998 and began publishing a general
interest webzine, The Green Bay Web. Quickly discovering that Wind0ws 95 was
about as reliable as a drunken driver with sleep deprivation, he made the
conversion to Linux over the protestations of every member of his household. He
now uses Fedora Core and since discovering Yum, has managed to keep his systems
relatively up to date.
</p>

<p>
Dale is a graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay with a background
in photography and print journalism. He is also a shade tree blacksmith who can
often be seen beating red-hot iron into shape in his driveway. He has been
known to use hammers and other Big Tools to "repair" uncooperative computers.
He is a conservative WASP, abhors political correctness, and... not to be too
clich&eacute;... enjoys hunting and shooting. Yes, that is a shotgun.  No,
it is not a rifle.  Yes, there is a difference.
