<p>Here in north-east Missouri we are currently afflicted with a
heavy, wet snowfall, so the time is ripe to write a page updating
some of my past Gazette articles, along with some e-mail which
has come my way.

<center><h3>More Text-Processing</h3></center>

<p>I've received quite a few messages concerning my article in LG
#22, <strong>Word-Processing vs. Text-Processing</strong>.  Eric
Marsden sent this message concerning the <b>Lout</b>
text-formatting system:<br>

<blockquote>
<p>From: Marsden Eric &lt;emarsden@mail.dotcom.fr&gt;<br>
To: layers@marktwain.net<br>
Subject: [LG] Lout-mode for Emacs<br>

<p>Hello Mr Ayers,<br>

<p>In the October Linux Gazette you wrote an article comparing
different document formatters, and mentioned Lout in passing. I
noticed that you regretted the lack of an Emacs mode for Lout
code.

<p>I agreed with you, and set out to write one. Indeed, there are
now <i>two</i> Emacs modes, since another Lout user had also set about
writing one, independently of my effort. Both are available on my
<a href="http://www.chez.com/emarsden/lout/">site</a>, where you'll also find 
the Lout FAQ/HOWTO.

<p>You were right to mention that "The Lout system is still
maintained and developed"; Jeff Kingston is quite receptive to
suggestions and requests for new features in the formatter, which
is far from being the case for TeX (now frozen) and LaTeX (whose
development group seems very closed).

<p>I agree that Lout is very much less widely used than LaTeX, which
is a definite disadvantage. I believe that things will change
over time, in particular given Lout's very strong capabilities
for mixing graphics and text. I might even write an article for
the Linux Gazette myself to spread the word.

<p>I tried out the XEMacs mode found at the above link, and
though it's still under development, it works well here and is
well worth investigating.

<p>Here's another interesting message:<br>

<p>I noticed in your defense of mark-up systems, you didn't touch on
issues regarding quality of output.  If you write on this in the
future, you might find <b>What has WYSIWYG done to us?</b> by
typographer Conrad Taylor quite interesting.  I think he makes
quite a case that the word processors aren't suitable if the user
cares about the quality of the typesetting.  I think there is a
lot of good thinking there for folk involved with document
production at any level.

<p>Another message concerning Emacs and LaTeX:<br>

<blockquote><p>To: layers@marktwain.net<br>
Subject: Word Processing and Text Processing<br>
From: Peter S Galbraith &lt;galbraith@mixing.qc.dfo.ca&gt;<br>

<p>Nice summary!<br>

&gt; Emacs provides excellent syntax highlighting for LaTeX files,<br>
&gt; which greatly improves their readability.<br>

<p>I also wrote a better syntax highlighting Emacs package for LaTeX
files, called font-latex.el.  I think I should make it part of
Emacs.  I doubt you knew about it even though it's distributed as
a contributed package with AUC-TeX.<br>

&gt; Xtem has one feature which is useful for LaTeX beginners:<br>
&gt; on-line syntax help-files for the various LaTeX commands.<br>

<p>There are a few add-on packages to AUC-TeX that do this by
interfacing with latex info files:<br>
<ul>

  <li>ftp://ftp.phys.ocean.dal.ca/users/rhogee/elisp/func-doc.el
</ul>

<p>I confess I'd seen Mr. Galbraith's <b>font-latex.el</b> in the 
AucTeX distribution files, but didn't realize that it is an
extra package which must be explicitly loaded.  The version
included with AucTeX is an older one; I recommend downloading the 
latest revision from this FTP
<a href="ftp://ftp.phys.ocean.dal.ca/users/rhogee/elisp/">site</a>. 
Along with <b>font-latex.el</b>, a file called
<b>font-latex.tex</b> is available at the site.  This file is a
sort of demo for <b>font-latex.el</b>, illustrating its
capabilities. Some people won't like the very colorful approach
to highlighting this LISP file provides, but with judicious
selection of colors (now so much easier using the Customize
facility!) the readability of <b>TeX</b> files is much enhanced.

<p>I recently happened across a message posted to the
<em>comp.editors</em> newsgroup which eloquently expresses a plea
which I'm sure will resonate with many Linux users:<br>

<blockquote>

<p>(discussion of editor internals snipped)

<p>Given that the Unix world has already more editors than could possibly
be required, and a dearth of even modest word-processing type apps, I
would urge you at least to consider allowing multiple fonts in one
document.  You don't have to rewrite Word; we don't even have a
competitor for Notepad (simple wysiwyg-ish thing with RTF output).
And no, XEmacs does <em>not</em> count.

<p>(more discussion snipped)

<p>&lt;rant&gt;<br> But I really, really think that this
particular wheel has been reinvented often enough.  What
<em>I</em> want is a toy word processor/editor, like wordpad on
steroids, say, which could be used for writing simple letters to
Auntie (for the Windoze crowd), and to make programming more
pleasant (different faces for different bits of syntax), and a
nice HTML mode.  XML (a sort of SGML-lite) is coming, and its
facilities for structured documents could make it a snap to
develop literate programming envronments, without locking you in
to one set of tools, or using (eek!) embedded TeX.  You could
have DTD's for almost every application, and finally supercede
the (admittedly powerful) Unix "everything is a stream of bytes"
philosophy with a universally understood set of conventions for
<em>structured</em> documents.  Word processors could use XML for
storage!  You could share files across platforms!  You could even
still use Emacs or vi or joe, if you wanted to!

<p>I know XEmacs can (probably) do all this, but I want a small,
fast, cute version, that doesn't eat all my RAM.  I want to use
proportional fonts to edit text (which Sam and Wily allow)
without changing my entire world-view (which they tend to insist
on), and I don't care if it won't run on a vt100.  It's
<em>1997</em> for heaven's sake!  I have a windowing system!
(Admittedly, it's only X, but it's still a window system!)  At
the moment, my desktop has a bunch of terminal emulators, and a
couple of GNU emacs frames open.  These are powerful tools, but
they hardly constitute a rich GUI environment that would make me
the envy of all my friends (they lust after the stability of my
system, but they run away screaming when confronted with the
tools.  And they are neither stupid nor technophobic).

<p>I don't want a ultra-heavy power tool, and I don't care about
slow serial lines: I already have tools for those jobs. I just
want a sprinkling of nice fonts, and an interface which doesn't
scare off Windows or Mac users.  Context sensitive pop-up menus
might be nice, and a reasonable (in terms of looks and
functionality) menu bar, too.  Real-time spell-checking along the
lines of Word is quite a nice idea, too -- spellchecking email
and Usenet posts is overkill if it takes any effort at all. (Even
M-x ispell-buffer is effort: I have to remember to bother.)
Notepad on steroids, is all I want, really.  And it has to be
free (as in freedom-not-price, that is).

<p>Does anyone have one, or do I really have to roll my own?  And
does anyone have any info on (or pointers to) suitable data
structures for such a thing?

<p>Standard Unix tools are very powerful, and for some things I
find them indispensible.  But, for me at least, vt100
compatibility is a legacy issue.  Sometimes I use remote systems,
and then I telnet in and use vi, and I'm happy to do so.  But
most of the time I'm on my own Linux box, with 16Mb and clock
cycles to burn.  I can afford some luxuries, but I don't want a
whole XEmacs.  Is this really so weird, this late in computing
history?  Or did I swear a vow of allegience to xterms and
non-proportional fonts when I signed on as a Unix user?  Am I the
only person who finds the current situation imperfect?  Do I have
to wait for GnuStep to combine the robustness and programmability
of Unix (which I love) with a halfway-sane GUI-fied environment
for those "I want to use a tool but I haven't got a month spare
to master the interface" moments?<br> &lt;/rant&gt;

<p>Sorry to rant on like that, but I feel strongly that the many things
Unix does well should not (and in the eyes of the Heathen do not)
excuse its barely-half-hearted embracing of the possibilities of the
new-fangled (ahem...) bit-mapped screen.

</blockquote>

<p>After reading the above posting, I began to think about
editors which <em>can</em> display proportional fonts.  Off-hand
I can think of three which offer this option: XEmacs, the
semi-commercial Edith editor, and NEdit.  All three display
Postscript fonts well <em>only</em> if bitmapped versions are
available, which limits you to the fonts (such as Times Roman and
New Century Schoolbook) supplied with X.  XEmacs will attempt to
scale other Type 1 fonts but they are unaliased and unsightly.
Edith and NEdit don't even try to scale the fonts, and only the
12 point size is offered in the font dialogs.  This isn't the
fault of the editors I've mentioned; they just do what X will
allow them to do. There are several Type 1 font rasterizers under
development for Linux, and perhaps this deficiency in the X
environment will eventually be addressed.  This could be helpful
in attracting Windows users to Linux, as Win95 and NT, for all
their faults and annoyances, <em>do</em> display scalable fonts
well.

<p>If anyone knows of a technique for generating bitmapped fonts
in various sizes from standard type-1 Postscript fonts, I'd love
to hear about it!

<p>Both the Gimp and SDCorp's WordPerfect 7 port will scale
Postscript fonts flawlessly; I assume they have their own
internal font-display engines.  I imagine that StarOffice and
Applix can do the same.
<hr>

<p>A floridly-worded letter from Harry Baecker was printed in
issue 23 of LG, to which I felt compelled to respond: he seems
to think my opinions on text-processing are "a ritual obeisance
to received wisdom" and a "requisite Unixworld denigration of
word-processors and their users".  On the contrary, I have little
interaction with Unix users and my expressed opinions are a
direct result of my experiences using both word-processors and
text-formatting systems.  So there!

<p>The folks at SDCorp in Utah have made a welcome change to the
licensing scheme used in their Linux port of WordPerfect 7.  When 
the port was first released a licensing daemon had to be running
in order to run the word-processor, which would only work on the
original machine on which WP was installed.  Now the daemon isn't 
necessary, and the application isn't limited to one machine.
Rumor has it that WordPerfect 8 will be ported to Linux sometime
next year if sufficient interest is shown in the Linux community.

<center><h3>New Editor Versions</h3></center>

<p>There have been new releases of several editors lately.  Those
of you who are of the VI persuasion will be glad to hear of new
versions of all three of the actively-maintained VI-clones.

<p>Vim is probably the most featureful of the VI-style editors.
Judging by newsgroup postings, it may be the most popular as
well.  With the release of vim-5.0s, vim 5 has finally reached a
beta rather than alpha state.  This revision has a really
well-implemented syntax-highlighting system for many programming
and shell-script languages, and it's not too difficult to adapt
to new file-types and languages.  The down-side is that vim is
growing larger, and is beginning to lose the quickness and low
memory-usage that has been a hallmark of VI-style editors.  Of
course, memory is cheap and machines are more powerful these
days, so this isn't as much of a factor as it used to be.

<p>I tend to use XEmacs as my primary editor, due to its
excellent programming modes, with vile/xvile as an adjunct for
quick editing tasks, such as config files and e-mail messages.
Vile 7.3 was released recently, and it is in my opinion the ideal
vi-style editor for an Emacs user.  It incorporates several of
the most common Emacs keystrokes, such as control-x-1 and
control-x-0, which softens the transition between the two.

<p>Recently Paul Fox, who several years ago modified the
Microemacs code until it became the first version of the vile
vi-like editor (sounds improbable, but it's true!), posted an
interesting response in the <i>comp.editors</i> newsgroup.  He
was responding to a query concerning the differences between vile 
and vim:<br>

<p>and VMS and Win95.  i'm not sure which i've used less.  :-)

<p>as the original vile author, i'll chime in here, but a) i'm
biased :-), and b) i've never used vim much, except when looking
at a specific feature implementation.

<p>vile's design goal has always been a little different than that
of the other clones (and i mean elvis, vim, and nvi here -- i
don't know enough about any of the others).  vile has never
really attempted to be a "clone" at all, though most people find
it close enough.  i started it because in 1990 i wanted to to be
able to edit multiple files in multiple windows, i had been using
vi for 10 years already, and the sources to Micro-EMACS came
floating past my newsreader at a job where i had too much time on
my hands.

<p>i started by changing the uemacs keymaps in the obvious way, and
ran full-tilt into the "hey!  where's 'insert' mode gonna come
from?!" problem.  so i hacked a little more, and hacked a little
more, and eventually released in '91 or '92.  (starting soon
thereafter, major version numbers tracked the year of release:
7.3 was the third release in '97.  i don't know what tom is going
to do about the Y2K problem.  ;-)

<p>but my goal has always been to preserve finger-feel, as opposed
to display visuals , and, selfishly, to preserve finger-feel most
for the commands i use.  :-) i've never used ex mode much, so
vile doesn't have much of an ex mode.  actually, it has quite an
amazing ex mode, that works very well -- it just <em>looks</em>
really odd, and a couple of commands ("t", and "m", which are
beyond the scope of the current parser) are missing.  for the
same reasons, it also won't fully parse existing .exrc files,
since i don't really think that's very important -- it does
simple ones, but more sophisticated one's need some tweaking.
when you toss vile's built-in command/macro language, you quickly
forget you ever cared about .exrc.

<p>just for bragging rights, i think vile had X11 support earlier
than the others, thanks to work by Dave Lemke from NCD, and
Keving Buettner who made it <em>really</em> functional.  i take
no credit -- i never use xvile.  on the other hand, vile wasn't
real useful under DOS, since it doesn't use a swap file, and the
memory limits got in the way pretty quickly.  (of course, this
isn't a practical problem under real OSes.)

<p>unfortunately, since none of the "vi rewrite" authors were
collaborating much in the early years (if we knew about one
another at all :-), i think we all made different choices for the
extension commands.  vile tends to follow an emacs-like model,
and uses ^X and ^A as built-in (but rebindable, of course)
command prefixes, and indeed uses emacs bindings directly for
some commands: like ^X-2 to split a window in half.

<p>another typical difference: i insist that ":q" should quit the
editor, and not just close the current window.  both nvi and vim
got this wrong, imho.

<p>another one: vile does infinite undo the way nvi does, and not
the way vim does.  small differences, but ones that can make a
user prefer one over another.

<p>as someone else said in this thread -- if you're choosing a new
version of vi, you owe it to yourself to try them all, for half
an hour of real work with each, and make your choice based on
that.  vim has lots and lots of support, and having this nice
"comp.editors.vim" newsgroup helps :-), but the others have
things to offer too, and you might like one of the others better.
i do.  ;-)

<p>btw, i'm only peripherally involved in vile maintenance anymore
-- Tom Dickey does most of it (thanks tom) these days -- i just
run the mailing lists.

<p>Steve Kirkendall's Elvis editor has also been updated
recently.  The X version, like vim's, has good syntax-highlighting
support, and also like vim, the windows (95/nt) version is
well-supported, for those users who need to work in that
environment.  I confess I haven't spent as much time with elvis
as I have with vile and vim; perhaps another user might care to
contribute? 

<p>XEmacs development continues apace.  Versions 19.16 and 20.3
are available (from <a href="ftp://ftp.xemacs.org">the home
site</a> and its mirrors) but one of the most interesting
developments is taking place in the 20.5 series of betas.

<p>A common complaint about XEmacs is its bulk and lengthy
loading time.  A full distribution is huge, with many bundled
packages for which most users have little use.  Trying out a new
version was not to be undertaken lightly, as the download time
was long and a large block of disk space needed to be available
for compilation.  The XEmacs team is in the process of unbundling
packages, which are now available individually.  The base source
archive is now around eight megabytes, while the compiled LISP
(*.elc) archive is only one and one-third megabytes.  The
packages are independent, and when this beta of XEmacs is
compiled it finds whichever packages you have installed and loads
their documentation, menu-items, and keybindings.  The package
subdirectory is independent of the version-specific binary and
LISP directories, so unchanged package files need not be
downloaded when upgrading to a new XEmacs version. The easiest
way to try this out is to compile the base source archive without
any packages installed and see what doesn't work.  Then packages
can be incrementally installed until the desired functions are
once again available.  After a new package has been unpacked, the
/lib-src/DOC file should be deleted.  Run <b>make</b> again and
the new package should be found and incorporated into the editor.
In other words, it's a good idea to keep the built source-tree on
your disk until you've generated an XEmacs which meets your
particular needs.  Of the subset of the available packages which
I installed, only the Ediff package initially failed to work, but 
after some experimentation I found that the line <br>
<kbd>(require 'ediff-hook)</kbd><br>
in the XEmacs init file caused it to be loaded.

<p>The release version of 20.5 should be available in the late
spring of 1998.

<p>A new version of NEdit has been released recently.  NEdit has
become popular with programmers and general users due to its
nicely-designed interface, equally-useful mouse and keyboard
control, and relatively small size.  Version 5.0 adds very
configurable (via dialog-boxes) syntax-highlighting and a new
macro language.  It's one of the easiest editors to learn, and
it's nearly as powerful as Emacs without being as large and
memory-hungry.  If you like mouse-based editing, the ability to
highlight a selection and drag it to another location in the file
will be appealing.  This function isn't found, as far as I know,
in any other editor available for Linux. 

<p>NEdit is strictly X-based; if you like to edit in a console
session (admittedly a minority view these days) this editor may
not be to your taste.

<p>There are now two versions available: the main
version is maintained by Mark Edel at Fermi National
Laboratories, and both source and binaries are available from
<a href="ftp://ftp.fnal.gov/KITS/pub/nedit/v5_0">ftp.fnal.gov</a>,
the home site.  Max Vohlken has made a number of patches to NEdit
5 which for various reasons haven't been accepted into the main
distribution.  He has been packaging his patched version into an
alternate release, and it can be also obtained from the above
site, in the <b>/KITS/pub/nedit/v5_0/contrib/max/5.0</b>
directory.  Both versions have adherents, it seems. 
<hr>

<center><h3>File-Managers</h3></center>

<p>Christian Bolik recently released the first new version of the
desktop- and file-manager TkDesk in nearly a year.  Version 1.0b5
has some nice new features (check out the Be-style icon-bar!),
and is well worth looking into.  This beta is supposed to be the
last; as soon as [incr tcl] (an object-oriented extension of Tcl) is
updated to work with Tcl8.0, TkDesk will also be able to make use
of the latest Tcl/Tk releases.  The TkDesk web-page has recently
become inaccessible, but the new version is still in Sunsite's
/pub/Linux/Incoming directory.

<p>Henrik Harmsen's FileRunner is now (with version 2.4.1) a GNU
General Public License application, which means that it will be
more easily included in distributions such as RedHat and Debian.
FileRunner is small, quick, and efficient, and if you have
installed Tcl/Tk 8.0 you should give it a try.  It can be
obtained from
<a href="http://www.cd.chalmers.se/~hch/filerunner.html">this site.</a>

<p>The Midnight Commander, the versatile text-mode
file-and-archive-manager, is still under continual development.
Beta 4.1.19 is the latest beta, and although none of the
X-windows versions are yet ready for prime-time, these recent
betas are well worth installing, as useful new features are
continually added.  Source (which generally will compile without
a hitch) is available from
<a href="ftp://ftp.nuclecu.unam.mx/pub/Midnight/devel">this site.</a>

<p>I must confess that the numerous icon-based file-managers,
many of which have been released or updated lately, don't really
suit my needs.  Several are based on the venerable xfm manager,
or its (apparently abandoned) successor moxfm.  Surely one of you 
readers out there prefers this type of file-manager?  Why not
write an article or review for the Gazette?  There's room here
for all sorts of views, after all!   

<center><h3>Xlock and XScreensaver</h3></center>

<p>Jamie Zawinski is a programmer and hacker currently working

programs, including xkeycaps and several of the screensaver modes
included with both Xlockmore and XScreensaver.  He also was
involved in the early development of Lucid Emacs (an ancestor of
XEmacs), and has contributed to the development of many Emacs
packages including the Fontlock highlighting mode.  I recently
received this message from him:<br>

Subject: xlockmore and xscreensaver<br>

<p>Dear Linux Gazette folks,

<p>I saw the article on Xlockmore by Larry Ayers in issue 18 of
the Linux Gazette, and I was surprised that it didn't mention,
even in passing, my XScreenSaver program!

<p>Allow me to engage in a bit of advocacy.

<p>Back in 1991, before Xlockmore existed, there was only Xlock.
Xlock was not a screensaver: it was only a locker.  There was no
way to make it activate itself automatically when the console
became idle, nor was there any way to avoid having it lock the
screen: that is, there was no way to have it turn off when the
mouse moved.

<p>So, I wrote XScreenSaver.

<p>XScreenSaver is superior to Xlockmore in a number of ways.
The most important way, of course, is that it is actually a
*screen saver*.  Although Xlockmore can be configured to not
require a password, it still doesn't have the ability to turn on
when the machine is idle; for that you have to use an external
program that launches and kills it.

<p>The second way in which XScreenSaver is better is that it
takes a server/client approach: the "xscreensaver" program itself
knows how to detect idleness, and to lock the screen.  The
graphics hacks are not built in: the beauty of XScreenSaver is
that any program which can draw on the root window can be
launched by XScreenSaver for use as a graphics hack!  This has
several benefits:

<ul>
  <li>You don't have to recompile and reinstall xscreensaver to
      install a new graphics hack: all you have to do is change your
      X resources, and issue one command.

  <li>Since programs don't have to be written *specifically* to run
      inside the xscreensaver framework, there are many more potential
      graphics hacks available.  They don't even need to be written in
      the same language: they just have to draw on the root.  Thus,
      it's easier to write programs to work with XScreenSaver than with
      Xlock or Xlockmore, because they don't have to follow a complex
      set of idiosynchratic rules on how to structure the code: the
      only rule is, "draw on the root."

  <li>By separating the task out into two processes, the whole
      system becomes more robust: the memory protection provided
      by the OS serves us well, in that, if one particular
      graphics hack has a bug (leaks memory, corrupts memory, gets
      a floating-point exception, etc) the integrity of the screen
      saver itself is not compromised.  The offending hack may
      exit, but the screen saver itself is still running, and the
      screen is still blackened (or locked.)  Also, since a screen
      saver is, by its nature, a very- long-running background
      task, even a small leak would build up over time.  By
      arranging for the graphics hacks themselves to be relatively
      short-running tasks, this problem goes away.

  <li>On some systems, only programs which are running as root can
      check passwords.  Therefore, on such systems, a screen
      locker would need to be a setuid-root program.  Obviously
      one needs to be very careful about what programs one allows
      out of the security sandbox; a conscientious sysadmin would
      want to examine such a program very carefully before
      installing it.  The XScreenSaver model allows this, by
      having the priveleged part of the program (the saver itself)
      be small, while letting the larger part (the graphics hacks)
      remain unpriveleged.
</ul>

<p>XScreenSaver also includes a nice Demo Mode that lets the user
interactively experiment with the currently-configured graphics
hacks.  (Until recently, most Linux users wouldn't have been able
to take advantage of this, since the code had required Motif; but
that is now configurable, and demo mode works with Athena widgets
too -- since release 1.27 back in January 1997.)

<p>If you have a system with more than one monitor, XScreenSaver
can save them both at once: a different graphics hack will run on
each, and if the two monitors have different depths (for example,
if one is monochrome and the other color) they can be configured
to choose their screenhacks from different lists, so that each
monitor is running the hacks that look best on it.

<p>Most of the xlockmore hacks (the ones that I liked, anyway,
including the GL modes) are included with the XScreenSaver
distribution; the only change made being to extract the various
display modes from the monolithic XLock executable, and turn them
into standalone root-window-oriented programs.

<p>However, it's possible to have XScreenSaver run xlock itself, as just
another one of its many modes -- the best of both worlds!

<p>Do check it out: the canonical web page is
&lt;http://people.netscape.com/jwz/xscreensaver/&gt;, which
includes screen shots and descriptions of most of the included
graphics hacks.

<p>The latest version, as of this writing, is 2.12.  At last
count, it came with 64 different graphics hacks.  Roughly a third
of these were written by me; the others were graciously
contributed by others.

<p>And, of course, it's all free, under the usual
X-Consortium-style copyright.

of screensavers, at

<center><h3>The Gimp</h3></center>

<p>Since I last wrote about the <b>G</b>nu <b>I</b>mage
<b>M</b>anipulation <b>P</b>rogram (in LG #18) both the GTK
toolkit (the underlying programming framework of the Gimp) and
the Gimp itself have undergone several revisions.  The
long-awaited version 1.0 still hasn't been released, but may have
been by the time you read this.  There has been talk of a release
by Christmas.

<p>There's really no reason to wait for a non-beta release,
though, as the version available as of mid-December is very
useful and impressive.  Some incredible new plug-ins are bundled
with version 19.16, and general stability has been much
improved.  A useful feature for new users has been added: at
start-up a small window appears which contains a different usage
tip at each invocation.  This can be disabled at any time.  One
caveat: be sure to obtain the corresponding version of GTK (in
this case gtk+-0.99.0), as unlike some earlier versions it is no
longer bundled with the Gimp.

<p>Here are brief descriptions of some of the new plug-ins:<br>

<center><h4>Iwarp</h4></center>

Some plug-ins are very useful, but tend to be taken for granted,
such as the various blurring or image-format modules.  Then there
are plug-ins which, though not immediately useful, are
fascinating due to the unexpected and interesting changes they
can wreak upon an unsuspecting image. The Iwarp plug-in,
as an example.

<p>I admit I've never used Adobe's Photoshop and the many commercial
plug-ins available for it.  Therefore my initial reaction
(composed of equal parts of awe and wonder) to this plug-in may
seem a bit naive, as there are several commercial extenders for
Photoshop with similar capabilities.  Be that as it may, clicking
the mouse pointer on an image thumbnail and actually stirring and
shifting pixels interactively is quite amazing.

<p>A screenshot will give you an idea of the nature of the
interface and the options available:<br>

<p>
<center><img alt="the Iwarp plug-in" src="./gx/ayers/iwarp.gif"></center>

<p>The plug-in offers a choice of six different methods of
changing an area of pixels in an image: clock-wise rotation,
counter-clockwise rotation, growing, moving, shrinking, or
removing.  Playing around with this plug-in will give you a good
idea of its capabilities.  Try setting it to one of the rotation
options, then hold the first mouse button down as you slowly move
it across an image.  It's as if a miniature hurricane is
travelling across the image, leaving spirals of distortion in its
wake.  I imagine that a drawing tablet would be handy to
use with this plug-in, allowing more precise control than that
provided by a mouse.

<p>Like icing on a cake, Iwarp has animation capabilities
built-in.  Once you have warped an image to your satisfaction,
select the animation tab in the plug-in's window; this lets you
choose how many frames to create, and whether to make them cycle
repeatedly (the ping-pong effect) or just play from start to
finish.  Each frame is saved in a separate layer, and there is a
convenient plug-in called Animation Playback which will let you
view it.

<p>So what's the use of this?  You can use it to create animated
GIF files for web-pages, or perhaps tweak a small area of an
image, but mostly it is just a lot of fun!

<center><h4>Flame and Fuse</h4></center>

<p>Gimp 0.99.16 must be something of a milestone for Scott
Draves, creator of the Flame and Fuse plug-ins (as well as the
Bomb interactive screen hack). Though successive versions of the
Flame plug-in have been available for some months now, the
maintainers of the Gimp have been reluctant to include it in the
Gimp distribution due to certain licensing restrictions which
Scott had placed on the program and its output.  Recently Scott
relaxed those restrictions and Flame is now a part of the Gimp.

<p>Flame is similar in some ways to the IFS-Explorer plug-in, in
that is based on Iterated Function Systems fractal algorithms,
but the approach and interface are different.  Rather than
manipulating three triangles, which is the traditional IFS
interface used by IFS Explorer, Flame does much of its work
"behind the scenes", though there are still several options
available to the user.  One nice feature is the built-in support
for the Gimp's color gradients.  Several of Scott Draves' own
gradients are included in the plug-in, but any others can be
entered into an entry-field in the plug-in window.  Here's a
screenshot of a typical window:<br>

<p><img alt="Flame Window" src="./gx/ayers/flame.gif">

<p>Flame can generate some really intriguing images; some of
Scott Draves' examples can be seen on
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~spot/flame.html">this web
page</a>.  If you are using an earlier Gimp version, a binary of
the plug-in has been thoughtfully included in the Flame archive
file available from the page.  Just drop the binary into your
Gimp plug-in directory; the next time you start the Gimp Flame 
should be accessible from the "Render" sub-menu.

<p>It's interesting to compare the results obtainable from Flame
and the IFS-Explorer plug-ins, as they both are based on the same
mathematical principles but have such different methods of
implementing them.

<p>Another plug-in from Scott Draves is called Fuse.  This one is
used to disassemble a pair of images and merge them into one,
using what seems to be some sort of AI trial-and-error process.
A preview window shows the various attempts in real-time, which
can be interesting to watch.  The process is time-consuming, as
the plug-in seems to be repeatedly dissatisfied with its results,
and will back up to a previous branch in the process and start
anew.  Scott Draves has achieved some interesting results with
Fuse, which can be viewed on this 
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~spot/fuse/index.html">web-page</a>.
It would take some practice to gain proficiency with this plug-in;
this is one of those applications which may require reading the
source code to get a feel for just what is going on behind the
scenes.  In other words, no on-line help!

<center><h3>Illusion</h3></center>

<p>The Illusion plug-in is another interesting one to experiment
with.  It was written by Hirotsuna Mizuno, a Japanese
programmer.  What this one does is difficult to describe; it
seems to duplicate an image and tile a new one with "faded-out"
copies of the original.  This results in a surrealistic sort of
pattern, and could be useful in creating watermark-like
backgrounds.  A before-and-after pair of screenshots should
convey an idea of its capabilities:<br>

<p><center><img alt="Illusion #1"
src="./gx/ayers/illusion.gif"></center>

<p><center><img alt="Illusion #2"
src="./gx/ayers/illusion2.gif">
</center>
<hr>

<center><h3>Map-Object</h3></center>

<p>The Map-Object plug-in, though included with 19.15,
unfortunately wasn't supplied with the 0.99.16 release.  It is
being developed by Tom Bech, of the University of Bergen in
Norway.  This plug-in will map or project an image onto the
surface of either a sphere or a skewed plane, with full control
of many parameters such as the light source's orientation and
color.  The background can easily be set to be transparent, which
makes the output useful in HTML files.  If you are still using
version 19.15 of the Gimp the current version is functional.
Perhaps by the time Gimp 1.0 is released Mr. Bech will find time
to adapt this ingenious plug-in to the rapidly-changing Gimp/GTK
environment.

<p>Just as I was finishing this article Gimp 0.99.17 was
released, and Map-Object has been reinstated into the
distribution.  A new version of GTK was released concurrently;
visit <b>ftp.gimp.org</b> if you'd like to obtain the
source. Debian and Redhat packages of these releases are also
available there.

<p>This is just a sampling of the more than sixty plug-ins
bundled with the 19.16 release; more are appearing regularly, and
when the 1.0 release is completed (and development of the Gimp
moves on to a new beta version) the resulting "fixed target"
should make developing new plug-ins easier for programmers.
