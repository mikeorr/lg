Crashed Computer Traps Thai Politician
Updated 14 May 2003
<A HREF="http://aardvark.co.nz/daily/2003/n051301.shtml"
	>http://aardvark.co.nz/daily/2003/n051301.shtml</A>
</p>
<p>
Thailand's Finance Minister Suchart Jaovisidha had to be rescued today
from inside his expensive BMW limousine after the onboard computer
crashed, leaving the vehicle immobilized.
</p>
<p>
Once the computer failed, neither the door locks, power windows nor
air conditioning systems would function, leaving the Minister and his
driver trapped inside the rapidly heating vehicle.
</p>
<p>
Despite the pair's best efforts, it took a full ten minutes before
they were able to summon the attention of a nearby guard who freed the
two men by smashing one of the vehicle's windows with a sledgehammer.
</p>
<p>
A report (<A HREF="http://www.bangkokpost.com/Business/13May2003_biz12.html"
	>http://www.bangkokpost.com/Business/13May2003_biz12.html</A>)
published in the Bangkok Post indicates that the vehicle was Mr
Jaovisidha's own BMW 520 which was being used while his state-supplied
Mercedes was being repaired.
</p>
<p>
BMW's more up-market 7-series range uses a computer system called
i-drive which has Microsoft's WindowsCE at its core
(<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2002/Mar02/03-04BMWpr.asp"
	>http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2002/Mar02/03-04BMWpr.asp</A>).
</p>
<p>
Did Mr Jaovisidha narrowly miss being killed by the blue windscreen of
death?

I am reliably informed a Scotsman by the name of Cuthbertson invented
the cardboard box and took the invention to the USA and made a fortune.
I don't know how long ago, but it was a long time ago. Cuthbertson was
an eccentric and his dying wish was to be stuffed and sat on a chair in
his house, which was granted. When the law eventually changed he was
buried. This story comes from a distant relative of Cuthbertson, who
lives here in Scotland.

A google search says the cardboard box was invented in Britain in 1817,
but has no mention of a name; the corrugated cardboard box seems to have
been invented later by Robert Gair.

There's a lot of spilled virtual ink over Internet "standards".
Depending on who's talking, it encompasses only adopted RFCs, or
includes drafts and standards-track (proposed) RFCs such as Son of RFC
1036 (to which you refer).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Several key DNS protocols are of that sort:  The IETF NOTIFY and IXFR
protocols, outgoing AXFR, DNSSEC, TSIG, A6, DNAME, bitstring labels,
Dynamic DNS, and IXFR are <b>not</b> yet enshrined in any adopted RFC.
However, in DNS as elsewhere in the real world, standards documents most
often get <b>abstracted</b> from in-use software; the RFCs merely codify (and
thus lag) the implementations that gave rise to them.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Son of RFC 1036 <b>is</b> just such a standard, in that it's widely
implemented and relied upon.  Not implementing its .signature spec is
legitimately considered a bad thing.  (Fortunately, consequences are
minimal:  Recipients whose MUAs auto-snip .signatures may flame you for
sabotaging their filters.  Otherwise, no big deal.)

Hemingway of the "Great Gatsby" and "For Whom The Bell Tolls", rather
than "The Old Man and The Sea" or "Farewell to Arms". I don't know that
I could ever accuse him of "run-on" sentences, although he certainly
broke out of the short'n'choppy mold a number of times.  I understand
about "geniuses break rules by redefining them", but some people push
the borders a little too much.  As to the comma allergy... blechh.
That's one of the things that bugs me when I see it in writing.  I've
always found Hemingway annoying but good enough that I can usually get
past the annoyance.

I'm here at the scene of the alleged riot. Appearently, a member of the Grammar
Police, one Mr. Benjamin Okopnik, opened fire on the crowd with his grammer gun.
To his credit, eye wittnesses report he attach a "smiley-face", but, as he
allegedly said, "Some people can't take a joke". Many bystanders sided with Mr.
Okopnik. One said, "Ending sentences in a prepistion is something up with which
I will not put! Mr.Okopnik was doing his duty".

Wether Mr. Okopnik was merely "doing his duty" is up the investigation, which is

<blockquote><pre>&gt; I'm here at the scene of the alleged riot. Appearently, a member of the Grammar
&gt; Police, one Mr. Benjamin Okopnik, opened fire on the crowd with his grammer gun.

-&gt; post re grammar joke
You post a humorous description of a joke made by another TAG member.
However, due to the incorrect description of the situation (it was
actually a remark about gratuitous usage of slang rather than grammar),
the weapon allegedly used in the attack slowly turns in your direction.

&gt; To his credit, eye wittnesses report he attach a "smiley-face", but, as he
                    ^  ^                        ^
                    |  |                        |
-&gt;run away
As you attempt to leave the scene, you accidentally drop several
grammatical errors in your haste. You hear the sound of a bolt being
raked back, then locking into battery...

&gt; allegedly said, "Some people can't take a joke". Many bystanders sided with Mr.
&gt; Okopnik. One said, "Ending sentences in a prepistion is something up with which
                                                ^ ^
                                                | |

-&gt;duck, dodge, avoid bullets
You attempt to hide from just retribution, but all is in vain. To your
horror, you realize that the brick wall you've ducked behind is nothing
more than a carboard movie prop, and that there's no effective cover
within hundreds of yards.

&gt; I will not put! Mr.Okopnik was doing his duty".
&gt;
&gt; Wether Mr. Okopnik was merely "doing his duty" is up the investigation, which is
   ^
   |

&gt; allegedly going to start later this week. For LUNX, this is Jason Creightion.
                                                                           ^
									   |
-&gt;Uh...
&lt;RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!!!!!&gt;

As you lie there twitching in your final agony, you hear the slow pace
of the man you've unjustly accused approaching you - a man who would
never (never!) hurt a fly - to administer the /coup de grace/.

&lt;POW!&gt;

&gt; Back to the studio, for your weather report.

Your score is   3  out of a possible 100000000000000000000000000000.
Would you like to play again? &lt;Y/n&gt;

Any 4runner of the latest version of the kernel should be upgraded -
particularly if it goes as far back as 1996, even if the motor, I mean
kernel is "excellent clean" (e.g., "make clean" was run before
compilation.) The hot oil smell is the poor machine trying to get some
work done and bogging down in warmfuzzy "Wind*ws Will Not Harm You,
Little Human!" themes, automatic MSN installations, and "Wind*ws has
detected that your wire-haired terrier has peed in the corner. Please
wait while we download the appropriate 147.3Gb driver" messages.

Subject: Microsoft toilet project wasn't hoax

Microsoft and its public relations firm are now saying that what they
themselves thought was a hoax (the development of the iLoo, a portable
toilet complete with wireless keyboard and Internet access) actually was a
real project of the company's MSN group in the UK. The original press
release indicated that the iLoo would offer its users "a unique experience."
An MSN product manager now says: " "We jumped the gun basically yesterday in
confirming that it was a hoax and in fact it was not," said Lisa Gurry, MSN
group product manager. "Definitely we're going to be taking a good look at
our communication processes internally. It's definitely not how we like to
do PR at Microsoft." In any event, whether really a hoax or really real, the
project is now dead -- flushed, as it were.  [AP/*USA Today*, 14 May 2003;

i understand how remote computers can attempt to access my computer through
telnet, ssh, etc. say, for instance, i have telnet running on port 70.
so if a person "telnet myserver 70" can log into my computer. say i get a
request like "telnet myserver 78". how could i set up in linux so that my
computer would echo with a message like "you cannot access this port
fool!".
would i have to create a program and then bind it to a port or something?
not sure how this would work.  i know how there are reserved ports set and
stuff, just would like to fool around with these things.

Then my old 386 was almost a minicomputer, but I've downgraded it by
moving it into a newer case whose power supply is kinda okay, instead
of the old monster case that weighs a lot more.

Neil, it belongs to you as much as it does to every human being on this
planet. These courageous people have made it possible for all of us to
say "WE made it out - again!" Their achievement touches all of us, every
one. The space program is not there for the benefit of any one person or
any one country - the survival of the human race hinges on it.

<blockQuote>
If - <EM>WHEN</EM> - we get out there, establish a self-supporting foothold on
another planet... no nuclear bombs, no dinosaur-killer meteor will ever
destroy us all. Our sons and daughters will expand into the universe,
will grow to face much bigger challenges, ask greater questions, reach
unimaginably greater heights.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
We pay the cost of pioneering with heart-breaking effort, with the best
of everything at our disposal... with our very blood and bones. This is
the cost of facing the unknown - and we pay it, and keep on paying it,
because we <EM>must</EM> grow or perish. We will mourn these seven brave people
- but we will go on. Their deaths are a tragedy - but to even think of
stopping, of abandoning the effort in which they died would be a greater
tragedy.

Oh, I have slipped the surly bonds of earth
And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;
Sunward I've climbed and joined the tumbling mirth
Of sun-split clouds -- and done a hundred things
You have not dreamed of -- wheeled and soared and swung
High in the sunlit silence. Hov'ring there,
I've chased the shouting wind along and flung
My eager craft through footless halls of air
Up, up the long, delirious, burning blue
I've topped the windswept heights with easy grace
Where never lark or even eagle flew.
And, while with silent, lifting mind I've trod
The high untrespassed sanctity of space,
Put out my hand and touched the face of God.

The one I've been flying out of, SGJ (Saint Augustine). Let me know, and
I'll buy you guys lunch at the Fly-By Cafe; if you do it sometime soon,
we can watch the F-86 Sabre doing his rolls and loops, and maybe a Pitts
and an Extra 300, too. If my buddy Jack is about, you might get to see
me pull a few Gs in his Harmon Rocket.

It was probably mostly a matter of processor latency.  Specifically I

Yep; that's a good description of ginger beer.  Stewart's is only
middlin' as far as their ginger beer goes (I like their cream soda,
though); there are much better ones out there, although I can't remember
a specific brand, but be aware that most of them are just as strong or
even stronger.

Back in 1971, Dan "DB" Cooper hijacked a plane, got a $200,000 ransom,
parachuted out on the return flight, and disappeared. He became a
legend. (Obviously, this was long before the current crop of terrorism
when skyjacking was seen as a romantic daredevil stunt by a successful
desperado... believe it or not. Times have changed that much.)

Oh, it was a problem then, too. IIRC, he picked the plane that he was on
(727, I think?) because it had a tail gate exit. He also made the pilot
set the flaps to full and lower the landing gear (makes the plane about
as aerodynamic as a garbage truck - and the speed goes <b>way</b> down.)

Images? How's that gonna work? Filenames, and maybe some metadata
attached to the image it's the only thing I can think of that is easily
searchable.

Package: imgseek
Description: Image viewer and manager with content based query
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
ImgSeek is a photo collection manager and viewer with content based search
and many other features.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The search query for an image is expressed either as a rough sketch
or as another image you supply. The searching algorithm makes use of
multiresolution wavelet decomposition of the query and database images.

Cool. I thought something like this must exist, given that there are
things like songprint, but never heard of any actual software that did
it. I'll stick with metadata though, because I can't draw.

Oh, sorry, I didn't make myself clear. I didn't doubt Microsoft's
ability to rip features off. What I meant was that they usually think
bigger. They don't like simple things. They like System Restore.

Actually, when it comes to their OS, so do I. The correct fix for about
3/4 of all Wind0ws problems - the one that takes the least time, effort,
and frustration - is to back up the data and reinstall from scratch.
I've got most of my commercial clients trained in the basics: keep the
data on a separate partition, back up often, keep all the install
CDs/installation software close at hand.

Buying a new car instead of continuously fixing the old junker (in which
each problem triggers several others, and fixing one thing breaks three)
can be a very sound policy. Unfortunately, many people continue to buy
the same model that produced that junker in the first place...

So I'm thinking it's not just a simple grep. They'll have hacks
into Outlook's file format in order to look at emails. Hacks for all of
Microsoft's special formats. Maybe even a kludge of a plugin system that
allows Windows to search third-party formats. Something like that is
what I expect from Microsoft.

I agree. It's also likely to have a dancing paperclip, a Micr0s0ft Bob,
or some new version of a combination of the two, subtly unsettling and
vaguely smelling of brimstone.

Of course, it's hard to tell what software actually <EM>does</EM> from a press
release. So we really don't know if it's something big that might
actually do something useful[1]  or if it's just something like
what you can do with find and grep.

Speaking of security holes, has anyone looked at Metasploit?
(<A HREF="http://www.metasploit.com/projects/Framework"
	>http://www.metasploit.com/projects/Framework</A>) I couldn't get the few
Linux exploits going (damned security updates!), but typing four or five
lines got me a windows command shell and a running VNC server. Scary
stuff. I might be able to scribble something about it in time for 106,
if I can find a CD with an old distro with a hole or two.

Micr0s0ft is patenting everything WRT software nowadays; it doesn't mean
a whole lot in this case, but could in a number of other situations. I
understand that the next version of the MSWord doc format is supposed to
be <EM>so</EM> tightly "protected" by these legal shenanigans that you won't be
able to write a reader or a converter for it without MS's permission.
[shrug] I guess they haven't lost enough business yet to this kind of
tactics to learn better. <TT>Sui sponte</TT>, as the US Army Rangers say.
