<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>This month marks the second
anniversary for the Graphics Muse column.&nbsp; Its hard for me to believe
I've been doing this for that long.&nbsp; My general span of attention
is about a year, but I've managed to not only hold onto an interest in
this column, I've managed to grow it into several articles and covers for
the Linux Journal, a book, and a web site devoted to computer graphics
and based on this column.&nbsp; I guess when you get on a roll, stick with
it.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The more observant readers
will also notice a little change in format for this column.&nbsp; I finally
did a little color matching for the various images I use and, at the bequest
of more than just a few readers, got rid of the multicolumn articles.&nbsp;
Most of the announcements are on a page of their own now, although I will
be keeping a few on the first page.&nbsp; Overall, I much prefer this new
format.&nbsp; It just looks cleaner.&nbsp; I hope you like the changes.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>In this months column I've
taken a chance and offered a little editorial on the way things are as
I see them.&nbsp; Much of what I've seen in the past few months revolving
around Linux has been positive news - announced support from all 5 major
database vendors (Oracle, IBM, CA, Sybase, and Informix), Intel and Netscape
announcing investment in Red Hat, and lots of generally good press.&nbsp;
But along with this I've seen a fair amount of disunity among the community.&nbsp;
There are camps forming between followers of various leaders.&nbsp; I find
this sad.&nbsp; Hardlines drawn by groups with disparate interests and
ideas tends to drain the energies of both sides of the argument and I'd
really hate to see that happen with Linux.&nbsp; The worst aspect of these
arguments is the distraction thats created from the real focus - proving
how Open Source/free software can really be viable solutions to end users,
not just developers.&nbsp; Thats key to making Linux a world player in
corporations, education, government and on the desktop.</FONT></FONT>

Sutton</A> is pleased to announce the release of "meteor-1.5.2", a driver
and collection of applications for the Matrox Meteor frame grabber.&nbsp;
This driver runs on the Linux 2.0.xx series of kernels. Its earlier counterpart,
version 1.5.1, has been reported to work on many 2.1.xx releases and later
1.3.xx kernels.&nbsp; This version should work on those kernels also.</FONT></FONT>

and clarity of it's captures are generally notably superior to the garden
variety consumer grade image capture devices, and it's price reflects this.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>This driver is bundled with
single frame capture software, software for displaying real time video

this package is found at <A HREF="http://www.rwii.com/linux/">http://www.rwii.com/linux/</A>.&nbsp;

contains numerous enhancements over the last "stable" release, not the
least of which are the ability to compile without hacking on the latest
development and stable linux kernel versions, as well as the ability to
compile and run properly on libc6 based distributions.&nbsp; In actuality,
this "development" version should prove to be pretty much as stable as

<I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Q:&nbsp; Ok now I'm new to
linux and gimp - my friends got me into linux in the last couple months.&nbsp;
How can I, in Gimp save a file without having to merge the layers and still
have the graphic look the way its supposed to?&nbsp; Am I just really missing
something here?</FONT></FONT></I>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>A:&nbsp; If you just want
to save an "in-progress" verison of your image that preserves layers, guides,
channels, selections,etc then you should be saving as <B>.xcf</B>. That's
gimps native format.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>If you want to "export" an
image to a single layer format but not have to merge the layers, you should
have a look at Simon Budig's export scripts that automate this task. These
scripts can be found at:</FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1><B><I><FONT COLOR="#993300">'Muse</FONT></I></B>:&nbsp;
Unfortunately this area of graphics tools on Linux is pretty sparse.&nbsp;
Like you said, there are a number of command line tools for doing very
specific tasks (like frame grabbers or creating MPEG video animations)
but there aren't&nbsp; any user-friendly, GUI based tools like, for example,
Adobe Premier.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>That said, there is one project
you might want to look into.&nbsp; The project is called Moxy (http://millennium.diads.com/moxy/).&nbsp;&nbsp;
Not much information there yet, but its aim is to be a Premier-style application.&nbsp;
Its in *very* early development.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>You might also drop a line
to the Gimp-Developer mailing list.&nbsp; A number of people had been discussing
creating an application like this on that mailing list.&nbsp; I haven't
heard whats become of this, however.&nbsp; Adding a plug-in to the Gimp
wouldn't be the best way to handle video editing - the Gimp isn't designed
for that type of work.&nbsp; But eventually interfaces should be (re: ought
to be) developed that allow easy transfer between the Gimp and video editing
tools.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>No commercial packages that
I know of are being ported yet.&nbsp; Desktop publishing on Linux is still
somewhat limited to word processors and the Gimp, which lacks color management
facilities that are quite important to most desktop publishing and video
editing environments.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I'll post your message (actually
this reply) to the next Graphics Muse column and perhaps someone with more

No such beast is yet available.&nbsp; Its just not in high demand so you
probably won't see it from the commercial vendors unless a paying business
customer requests it (with some serious dollars behind the request).&nbsp;
XFree86 will support it as soon as someone decides they want/need it and
have the time/expertise to write the code for it.&nbsp; If the video cards
handle it already then its just a matter of adding that support to an existing
video card driver (assuming a standard, well known video chipset on the
card).&nbsp; The problem is usually finding someone who knows how to do
that.&nbsp; A post to <A HREF="news:comp.os.linux.x">comp.os.linux.x</A>
or maybe a letter to the Linux Gazette editor (<A HREF="mailto:gazette@linuxgazette.net">gazette@linuxgazette.net</A>)
will put you in contact with someone.&nbsp; The LG editor will simply post
your request in the next issue of the Gazette and, with luck, someone will
contact you about their current work in this area.&nbsp; You might also
try sending a letter to the XFree86 support address (its listed on their
web site <A HREF="http://www.xfree86.org">www.xfree86.org</A>).</FONT></FONT>

PEX is the PHIGS Extension, a formal X Extension that supports PHIGS, which

still in use today in a few places.</FONT></FONT>

Review:&nbsp; Corel Super 10 Packs CD collections</H2>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I haven't been doing much with
my Web site this past month.&nbsp; Once I got the new format running I
didn't have much need to mess with it, although I do have to remove the
Apache logs fairly often (12Mb of logs in less than 5 days causes me to
keep running over my disk quota).&nbsp; So I was a little unsure of what
to write about for this months Web Wonderings.&nbsp; That is until I wondered
through a local computer retail outlet.&nbsp; There on the shelves I found
a number of Corel's Super Ten Pack CD image collections.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Normally I wouldn't consider
using stock photos from Web-style CD collections because the quality of
the photos generally isn't much better than what I can take myself.&nbsp;
Additionally, most of those "25,000 (or more) Image" collections you find
on the shelves come with images suitable only for the Web - generally no
more than about 1024x768 resolution.&nbsp; These usually are far too small
for any other media.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>But an article in the September
1998 issue of Digital Video magazine covering stock image collections mentioned
the Corel image collections, including their Super Ten Packs, as a source
of quality stock images.&nbsp; Since I trust this magazine more than my
own common sense (which is still rather new to the graphic arts world)
and due to Corel's fairly full-blown support for Linux, I decided to check
out one or two of these collections.</FONT></FONT>
<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>What is a Corel Super
Ten Pack?</FONT></FONT></B>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Super Ten Packs are collections
of 10 CD's, each with 100 PhotoCD images on them.&nbsp; The current collections
are classified into a number of different categories:</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>There is also a Sampler Ten
pack.&nbsp; The sampler set has CD's titled, among others, "War", "Alien
Landscapes" and "Success".&nbsp; Unfortunately the limited documentation
doesn't say from which other Ten Pack's these samples are taken.&nbsp;
I expect that Corel will expand this list further as well, since they tend
to produce a large number of stock photography CDs in general.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The images are royalty free
but there are some restrictions to their use.&nbsp; First, you must display
the following text somewhere in your publication:</FONT></FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>This product/publication
includes images from [insert full name of Corel product] which are protected
by the copyright laws of the U.S., Canada and elsewhere. Used under license.</FONT></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Since I'm reviewing the CDs
in general I hope the above counts towards my meeting this requirement.&nbsp;
They also limit online display of the images to 512 X 768, but that may
be only if you display the image unmodified.&nbsp; Its not clear about
if such restrictions exist for derivative works that use the images.</FONT></FONT>
<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>How do you get them?</FONT></FONT></B>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Super Ten Packs are available
at computer retail outlets or online.&nbsp; I purchased my two sets from
MicroCenter here in Dallas.&nbsp; Corel's online site contains thumbnails
of all the images from their huge collection of images so that you can
preview them before purchase.&nbsp; All of the online versions have watermarks
so don't get any ideas about trying to swipe them from their site (unless
you like watermarked images).</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Online ordering can be done
at <A HREF="http://www.corel.com/products/clipartandphotos/photos/superten.htm">http://www.corel.com/products/clipartandphotos/photos/superten.htm</A>.&nbsp;
You can also search for individual images and order those online at <A HREF="http://corel.digitalriver.com/">http://corel.digitalriver.com/</A>.&nbsp;
I didn't check to see if you could actually order the photos individually
or just in the sets that contain them but a reliable resource who has used
the service in the past suggested you could purchase them individually.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>When you go to http://corel.digitalriver.com/&nbsp;
just click on the Photo CD package image to get a list of titles.&nbsp;
From there you can click on the individual CDs to preview all of the images
on each CD.&nbsp; Each CD runs about $35-$45US.</FONT></FONT>
<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>What do you actually get?</FONT></FONT></B>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I purchased two different
sets, the Sampler Ten Pack and the Textures II Ten Pack.&nbsp; Both run
a little higher at the retail outlet, as expected, and came in boxed sets.&nbsp;
Inside the box I found the 10 CD's shrink wrapped along with a small pamphlet.&nbsp;
The pamphlet had the obligatory licensing information along with full color
thumnail images of all the images on each CD, one page per CD.&nbsp; This
is quite useful and something I hadn't quite expected for some reason.</FONT></FONT>
<P><IMG SRC="./gx/hammel/pcd-plug-in.jpg" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 HEIGHT=312 WIDTH=157 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The
images on the CD come in PhotoCD format.&nbsp; This format specifies 5
different image sizes:</FONT></FONT>

<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>2048x3072</FONT></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>To read this format you have
a couple of options.&nbsp; First, the <B><FONT COLOR="#CC6600">Gimp</FONT></B>
has a <B><FONT COLOR="#CC6600">PhotoCD file plug-in</FONT></B>.&nbsp; You
can tell if you have this plug-in installed if you try to open an existing
file and the <I>Open Options</I> menu includes an entry for <B>PCD</B>.&nbsp;
If you try to open a file from the CD by double clicking on the filename
in the Load Image dialog then the plug-in is started and you get the dialog
shown at left.&nbsp; You'll notice that this plug-in offers the additional
resolution of 4096x6144.&nbsp; I'm not certain if this is a valid PhotoCD
resolution or not, but it didn't seem to matter.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I
was unable to read any of the images from the CD in resolutions higher
than 512x768 using this plug-in.&nbsp; I had to switch to an alternative
option, the <B><FONT COLOR="#CC6600">hpcdtoppm</FONT></B> tool from <B><FONT COLOR="#CC6600">NetPBM</FONT></B>
package.&nbsp; With this program I could read the higher resolutions -
up to 2048x3072 - into a PPM formatted file which I could then load into
the Gimp.&nbsp; I didn't have time to determine if the problem was with
the Gimp plug-in or the CDs, but I suspect the plug-in is at fault since
I could read the higher resolutions with hpcdtoppm.&nbsp; Note that this
plug-in works fine for resolutions up to 512x768.</FONT></FONT>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Both RMS (Richard
M. Stallman) and Eric Raymond have done wonders for the community and both
should be applauded for their efforts and dedication.&nbsp; However their
spirited enthusiasm, in the manner and form which they display in public,
is not necessarily what we need now.&nbsp; Linux and free software/Open
Software is a community, one that has grown beyond its bare communal spirit
and now encompasses a metropolitan mix of individuals and groups.&nbsp;
And that mix includes a high number of end users - not developers, not
hackers - users.&nbsp; I wonder now if either RMS or Raymond is truly interested
in the end user or is their focus solely on the developers needs.&nbsp;
At this point, the community needs to focus on both.</FONT></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#660000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Commercial
vs. Free and World Domination</FONT></FONT></FONT></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Unlike many Linux
fans, I have no problem with commercial (re: proprietary) software.&nbsp;
There are people who both need and desire commercial software, regardless
of what developers might find as the higher moral ground.&nbsp; I personally
will use the tools which best suit my needs.&nbsp; I have always wanted
a Unix desktop, ever since my days working on the Dell Unix products in
the early 1990's and Linux is it for me.&nbsp; If commercial applications
begin to show up that work well for me, I will use them.&nbsp; I already
use Applixware and commercial versions of the sound drivers and X server.&nbsp;
You don't have to encourage commercial development, but you shouldn't attack
them either.&nbsp; Having a different point of view does not make someone
wrong or generally evil in all cases.&nbsp; If you provide alternatives
to commercial products you'll find many people who will both use and support
those alternatives.&nbsp; But to disuade others from using commercial products
without first providing the alternative is tantamount to using the same
tactics Microsoft uses with their vaporware announcements.&nbsp; Convince
by doing first.&nbsp; It makes the counter argument, the argument for commercial
or proprietary software, more difficult to sustain.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>On a related subject:&nbsp;
World Domination by Linux is not a goal I seek.&nbsp; The first reason
is obvious - if you displace Microsoft you lose the strongest focal point
that currently exists for the free software movement - the drive to displace
Microsoft.&nbsp; It is a bit of a catch-22 scenario, but I'd rather have
Microsoft stay strong to keep developers on edge in the Linux community.&nbsp;
They seem to thrive on that.&nbsp; Without real leadership in our community
(and I'm not convinced we have that one strong individual or group that
can claim that leadership role) it is imperitive that the strong focal
point be kept clear.&nbsp; Focus is key in any project, be it writing software
or climbing mountains or writing columns like this one.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The other reason I don't
want world domination is I really don't want to replace one egotistical
maniac with several thousand (or million).&nbsp; Great developers are egotistical
- its a form of self confidence not unlike that displayed by great artists.&nbsp;
But I wouldn't want either in charge of my personal computing world.&nbsp;
They see the world from their perspective and that perspective can be clouded
by their own intellect.&nbsp; It can be difficult to see the frustration
of others when their problems may seem trivial to you and easily solved.&nbsp;
Instead, I'd rather have the ability to control my own computing environment
by having the opportunity to choose between multiple solutions to similar
problems.&nbsp; I'd love to see the Mac and BeOS expand their market share
because, in the end, it only opens up my vistas of choice.&nbsp; And thats
what Linux is really about for end users.&nbsp; Freedom of choice.</FONT></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

Hat or Debian or S.u.S.E?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Depends on what
you want and where you live mostly.&nbsp; All three produce decent distributions.&nbsp;
I tend to think of Debian as aimed more towards the technical crowd while
the other two are more amenable to the average Joe.&nbsp; I use Red Hat
4.2.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because 2 years ago when I was ready to upgrade from
my Slackware distribution I went into SoftPro Books in Denver and found
Red Hat abundantly stocked.&nbsp; S.u.S.E wasn't there yet.&nbsp; Neither
was Debian.&nbsp; It was a simple choice back then, really.&nbsp; But like
Linux in general, the good news is that I have choices.&nbsp; Thats important.&nbsp;
I'll be upgrading again at the start of the year, probably in February.&nbsp;
By that time most of the kinks with dealing with libc/glibc should be worked
out from the installation point of view.&nbsp; I may go with Red Hat 5.2
if its out by then.&nbsp; But S.u.S.E sure has had a lot of good press
too.&nbsp; But it probably doesn't matter that much.&nbsp; I don't even
use RPM's on my machine except during an initial installation.&nbsp; After
that, I install free software from source and commercial packages from
CDs (in whatever form they come in).</FONT></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>See what I mean?&nbsp;
Choice.&nbsp; This sort of thing seldom crops up in the Microsoft world.&nbsp;
Which is best?&nbsp; I won't say.&nbsp; Of all the arguments that have
arisen repeatedly the past 2 years, this one is most certainly one of personal
choice.&nbsp; I will recommend, however, that if you consider releasing
software to the free/Open community that you read through each of these
and try to understand them before releasing and before creating your own
license.&nbsp; I did the latter.&nbsp; It was a bad choice.</FONT></FONT>

<A NAME="where-to-go"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#660000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Where
to go from here - Desktop Graphics</FONT></FONT></FONT></B>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Ok, I've blabbered on for
too long with my own opinions that really have nothing to do with graphics
on Linux.&nbsp; I need to focus.&nbsp; What do we have now and what do
we need?&nbsp; How do we get it?&nbsp; And who are "we"?'</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>We are the people who desire
the tools to do the graphics arts work from which we both find enjoyment
and make our livings.&nbsp; As of now, the tools for Linux are mostly geared
toward Web development, a medium born from the same family as the images
we create.&nbsp; Most of the tools are command line driven, with a few
GUI-based tools like the Gimp or perhaps ImageMagick.&nbsp; But we lack
certain features to go beyond Web images.&nbsp; We lack any real form of
color management in the Gimp needed for prepress operations.&nbsp; We have
3D modellers but are they sufficient for commercial animation work?&nbsp;
And what about video editing tools?&nbsp; Nothing exists at this point
beyond one project in a very early stage.&nbsp; We have some hardware acceleration
for 3D video chipsets but lack consistant support from vendors.&nbsp; Most
important, we need a desktop that makes porting of applications - or writing
new ones - inviting to those who need to interact with other tools.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>There are plenty of tools
available for commercial artists and effects houses that already exist
on other Unix platforms.&nbsp; What would it take to make those people
want to migrate to Linux?&nbsp; Vendors are fond of saying that end user
demand is what drives ports to new platforms.&nbsp; We need to know if
the demand exists and if not, then why not.&nbsp; I've spoken to two effects
houses in the past who use Linux in rendering farms (groups of Linux servers
number crunching 3D images with little to no user interaction).&nbsp; Linux
as a server once more.&nbsp; Is Linux not appropriate as the front end
of the special effects development process?&nbsp; What about for Desktop
Publishing?&nbsp; All you Quark and Adobe users - what do we need?&nbsp;
Would you use the ports if they were made available?</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I write this column out of
a desire to learn about computer graphics.&nbsp; The only graphics tools
I'd ever used before moving to Linux were MacDraw and MicroGrafix under
DOS many years ago.&nbsp; I'm not familiar with the Adobe series of graphics
programs, nor Quark Express, nor the SoftImage tools or other SGI-based
applications.&nbsp; I need feedback from users of these tools to know what
to pass on to the rest of my readership.&nbsp; There are likely to be a
few who would be willing to work on projects, if they new what needed to
be done.&nbsp; And grass roots efforts by end users to convince commercial
vendors that ports of existing applications to Linux would be worth their
effort are also needed.&nbsp; Corel appears to be porting all their applications
to Linux.&nbsp; I assume this means Corel Draw will be coming out sometime
in the next 6 months.&nbsp; At least then I can see what a commercial application
looks like.&nbsp; If I could only get my hands on Adobe Premier or Quark
Express for Linux.....</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Most important of all, I
need to know what the readers need - desktop tools for the small prepress
environment?&nbsp; Web tools?&nbsp; High end graphics tools for research
and the entertainment industries?&nbsp; Perhaps multimedia authoring tools?&nbsp;
Or just simple tools for doing common tasks at home, those that are readily
available for the Mac and MS platforms and cost a buck and a quarter at
the local computer retail outlet.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Graphics on Linux needs focus.&nbsp;
We have the kernel supporters and the desktop supporters who have driven
the server side of Linux to the point that the rest of the world is not
only aware of Linux but enthusiastic about joining the community.&nbsp;
Now we need the graphics folks to mobilize and show that we can go beyond
the realm of back room servers.</FONT></FONT>
