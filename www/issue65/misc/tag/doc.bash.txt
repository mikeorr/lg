Heather,
thank you for your complete and prompt reply.

I will provide here some answers from the queries that you had.
At this stage it seems that the problem is caused by one of our product,
that I have recently installed under Linux. After reporting the LI problem
to our support team, I received a reply where they state that this product
ast times seems to affect LILO, and to cause the problem that I have
described to you.

I am still awaiting from our support team, if they know how to fix the
problem of LILO.

And now to your questions:

> loader so the kernel can get going.  These could be disk-ish things like

> needed to reboot, etc

Yes, I have installed a new Micromuse Package under LINUX. After the
installation I rebooted few times without problem, but then one day, LI
started to happen.

No changes on disk size, or disk partitioning under Linux or under NT. I
never run /sbin/lilo before , so I cannot tell you if this was a problem.
But LILO always worked before.

I use Linux to run Micromuse products, and as I said, the problem started to
happen since I installed one of our package. Other people installed it on
their laptop, but they did not report the error. Support told me that at
times this product is know to cause some problem with LILO, but they are not
too sure.

You mean, remove linear or lba32 from lilo.conf and try to run lilo again ?
I will try this.

So I should just run :
1. lilo -u or lilo -U
2. Then how do I re-install LILO ? Just running /sbin/lilo or do I need to
download the LILO package from somewhere and the install it with   "rpm -Uhv
<nomefile>.rpm" or something similar ?





Thank you for your help once again, I will keep you posted !

ciao, alessio

Heather,

here is how I got this problem fixed with the help of the support personnel
in our company

Thank you once again for your support !!!



Support adviced me that the following recovery procedure for LILO problems
is to be used for Laptop that have dual boot partition, NT & Linux, when the
menu received at boot time shows OS LOADER, and then it presents 2 choice ,
Windows NT or Linux.

Steps taken:

0. Boot Linux from bootdisk
1. Run /sbin/lilo -v  (make sure no errors are displayed)
2. Insert a new diskette and mount it:
