I've recently gotten a digital camera (yes, I know I'm sort of late
coming into the digital revolution). This is a HP R607 and lets you add
audio tags to still images.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Lew] 
Kewl.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
I would have thought that the audio would be a wav or mp3 file with the
same name as the image, but life is never easy. I can only assume that
the audio is embbedded into the jpg. I've checked, and the only files on
the camera (other than some short XML files) are the jpgs.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Lew] 
Yah. The JFIF format (that's the file format that "JPEG" pictures are stored
in) supports a bunch of metadata. Many (I'm tempted to say most) cameras
store a 'thumbnail' photo in the jpg along with the full photo. They also
store camera information (make, model) and photo metadata (date/time of
photo, focal of lens, exposure time, photographers comments, picture
orientation, and a whole lot more). It wouldn't surprise me if the HP camera
also stored an audio clip as metadata in the picture jpg.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
When you say that you've checked, do you mean that you used something
like "camedia", or did you actually mount it as a storage device and
looked at the files on it? The former may only show the JPG files, while
the latter should show everything. My Olympus D-40, for example,
produces discrete files for audio, stills, and movies.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you're actually looking at the files on the device, then I'd have to
agree with the previous post - it's stored as EXIF data.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Yes. It is definitely stored as EXIF data. Ran a jpg file into emacs and
had a look. There's a nice RIFF/WAV header block right in the file. Of
course, the picture files without audio don't have the header.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
More reading leads me to think that some cameras use 2 files and others
embed the audio into the picture. Mine is that later 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
So, is there a way to play the audio in the pictures on Linux?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Lew] 
I'm not sure, but it's likely that the audio is stored in one of the EXIF
(JFIF metadata) tags. There are tools available that can extract EXIF tag
data, ranging from the digikam/gphoto2/libgphoto tools to standalone tools
like jhead. Perhaps one of these tools can extract out the audio, and you can
play it from there.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Yes, it helps. Problem is to find a tool to do the extraction. digikam,
etc (based on gphoto2) do NOT seem to support audio play/extraction.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
'gphoto2' supports a '--get-audio-data' option. There are probably a
number of other programs; googling for "exif audio extract linux" comes
up with 40,500 hits. 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
I think from reading and a bit of testing that --get-audio-data just
copies .wav files if they are on the camera. I could be wrong, but I
could not get this program to extract data.
</STRONG></P>

I did the google as well

EXIFutilsLinux2.6.2.tgz is another package which works. Installed and

features.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Amazing, the files I did extract sounded not bad at all.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I can't imagine that getting the audio out is much more than trivial. I
just don't have time right now, but I did compare the extracted file to
the data in the camera file and it is identical. Just a matter of
figuring an offset and the size.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Jimmy] 
I shouldn't imagine it's even that difficult: the audio is stored as
an EXIF tag, so you really just need to extract the contents of a
specific tag. (Hint: with Perl, Image::EXIF and Data::Dumper are your
friends).

<br>Answered By  Ben Okopnik

<P><STRONG>
I have a number of issues with tcsh (not my choice..) shell scripting
I need help with.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Basically I'm writing a shell script that automates a long setup
procedure. This top-level script is in bash, however the bulk of it is
comprised of commands that are fed to a program which is, in essence,
a tcsh shell. I've achieved this by using the &lt;&lt; redirector. I need
help on two points:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
1) Is there any way of suspending input redirection, taking input from
the keyboard, and then resuming input from the tcsh script?
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
There is, but it is Fraught With Large Problems. I'm not that familiar
with TCSH, but I've just had to do that in Perl - essentially, I was
writing a Perl version of 'more' and had to answer the question of 'how
do you take user input from STDIN when the stream being paged is STDIN?'
It requires duplicating the STDIN filehandle... but before you start
even trying to do it, let me point you to "CSH Programming Considered
Harmful" - Tom Christiansen's famous essay on Why You Shouldn't Do That.
If it's not your choice, then tell the people whose choice it is that
They Shouldn't Do That. The task is complex enough, and has enough
touchy problems of its own, that introducing CSH into the equation is
like the Roadrunner handing an anvil to the Coyote when he's already
standing on shaky ground over a cliff.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To give you <EM>some</EM> useful direction, however - the answer lies in using
'stty'.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
2) There comes a point towards the end of the script when two shell
scripts are run simultaneously. These shell scripts open up individual
xterm windows to run inside. I'm wondering, is there anyway of having
the tcsh script monitor stdout of one xterm, and upon the output of a
certain piece of text, echoing a command into the stdin of the other
xterm?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
Why not 'tee' the output of the script - one 'branch' into the xterm and
the other into a pipemill (or whatever you want to run 'grep' in)?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Any insight or knowledge on the matter would be very much appreciated.
I hope I have provided sufficient details.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
You have - from my perspective, anyway.

<P>
Actually, the spec requires a file-like object, so an emulation like
StringIO is allowed.  StringIO is pickleable:

'abc'
&gt;&gt;&gt; sio.read()
&quot;                   # End of file.
&gt;&gt;&gt; sio2 = pickle.loads(p)
&gt;&gt;&gt; sio2.read()
'abc'

cStringIO, however, is not pickleable.

<P><STRONG>
I assume that you are planning to use Debian's kernel-package
(make-kpkg) utility to build the kernel. This you can do without
worrying about anything. Just build a kernel without devfs and other
options as you want them.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The initrd that is installed along with the kernel is built
(providing you specified that you wanted it to be built) at the time
when you <EM>install</EM> the kernel-image-x.x.x-y package.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
This initrd is build by a set of tools called (what else)
initrd-tools; the principal among them being "mkinitrd". Now
"mkinitrd" takes a conf file <TT>/etc/mkinitrd/mkinitrd.conf</TT> so you can
make some changes there.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I haven't tried this but you would need to create a script in
<TT>/etc/mkinitrd/scripts</TT> that would setup the necessary device files in
the $INITRDDIR/dev.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
More importantly, the script <TT>/usr/share/initrd-tools/init</TT> is the "init"
that is put on the initrd image. You would need to replace this with
your own version as the default one makes use of devfs.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
If you are keen on sorting out all these issues you should probably
contact the maintainer of initrd-tools as Debian's initrd will have
to give up "devfs" at some stage since Linux 2.8 won't have "devfs".

Just a thought, but how about if he compiles a plain-jane Pentium I kernel?
It could be that the more recent kernels (and GCC?) might be putting in CPU
instructions that didn?t get called before, or they are called more often now
and are causing other errors.  My experience is if the system is locked <EM>hard</EM>
like he implies, then it's probably a hung CPU not answering interrupts (as he
alluded to).

modern than my parents.

But I'm well, and accounted for.

I just hope Neil is, although as
I know Neil is around the Pin-Green area (where my grandparents are), I
would surmise he too is just as well.

Yes indeed; he's emailed me (and as I recall, cc'd the Gang on it.) I
haven't heard back from Mike yet, though - it's a bit worrying. Since
you live in the same small island, could you perhaps walk over and knock
on his door?

Ben your concern is appreciated. I was working from home that day, fortunately
miles away from all the incidents. My wife was working in London as usual,
and  the first bomb was on her route in. Luckily she was already at work when
it went off. Although she had a very unpleasant journey home, we are lucky it
was no worse than an inconvenience for us. With 49 confirmed dead and more
than 25 missing, our thoughts are with their families.

Small?  Hehehe, Ben, sail your boat round these waters, I'll show you
around this place.
